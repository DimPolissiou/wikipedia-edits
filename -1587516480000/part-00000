{"title_page": "Causes of World War II", "text_new": "\n\n\nDeep anger arose in [[Weimar Germany]] that experienced strong currents of [[revanchism]] after the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that punished Germany for causing [[World War I]] in 1918. Complaints focused on the [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarization]] of Germany's [[Rhineland]], the prohibition of unification with Austria, and the loss of some German-speaking territories. The loss of overseas colonies was a less prominent issue. Germans said they had endorsed  Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] in good faith, but the points were ignored. Versailles imposed severe conditions to prevent Germany from ever becoming a military power again, as well as heavy financial [[World War I reparations|reparations]].  Resentment and hatred of other countries was intensified by the instability of the German political system, as many activists rejected the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic. The most extreme politician was  [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Adolf Hitler]] and his violent Nazi party. They [[Machtergreifung|took totalitarian power in Germany starting in 1933]] and demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions. The ambitious and aggressive foreign policy reflected Nazi ideology, such as: [[Anti-Semitism]], [[pan-germanism|unification of all Germans]], the acquisition of \"living space\" ([[Lebensraum]]) for agrarian settlers ([[Blut und Boden]]), creating a \"pull towards the East\" ([[Drang nach Osten]]) (that is, Poland and Russia), the elimination of [[Bolshevism]], and the hegemony of an \"[[Aryan race|Aryan]]\"/\"[[Nordic race|Nordic]]\" [[Master Race]] over the \"sub-humans\" ([[Untermensch]]en) of [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]].\n\nOther factors leading to the war included aggression by Italy against Ethiopia and Albania, the Japanese aggression and seizure of most of China and the Axis alliance formed by Germany, Japan and Italy. The 1930s were a decade in which democracy was in disrepute; countries across the world turned to authoritarian regimes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Dahl|title=Democracy and Its Critics|url=https://archive.org/details/democracyitscrit00dahl_0|url-access=registration|year=1989|publisher=Yale UP|pages=[https://archive.org/details/democracyitscrit00dahl_0/page/239 239]\u201340|isbn=0300153554}}</ref>\n\nThese aggressive moves met only feeble and ineffectual [[appeasement|policies of appeasement]] from Britain and France. The League of Nations proved helpless regarding China and Ethiopia.  A decisive event was the 1938 [[Munich Conference]] which formally approved Germany's annexation of the Sudeten region from Czechoslovakia.  Hitler promised it was his last claim, but in early 1939 he became even more aggressive, as the British and French finally realized that appeasement was not guaranteeing peace. Britain and France badly fumbled diplomatic efforts to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union. Instead Hitler offered Stalin a better deal in the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Expansionism==\n\n[[Expansionism]] is the doctrine of expanding the territorial base (or economic influence) of a country, usually by means of military aggression. In Europe, Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]] sought to create a [[New Roman Empire]] based around the Mediterranean. It invaded [[Albania]] in early 1938, at the start of the war, and later invaded [[Greece]]. Italy had also invaded [[Ethiopia]] as early as 1935. This provoked angry words and an oil embargo from the [[League of Nations]], which failed.\n\nUnder the Nazi regime, Germany began its own program of expansion, seeking to restore the \"rightful\" boundaries of historic Germany. As a prelude toward these goals the [[Rhineland]] was [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized in March 1936]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World War 2 Causes|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/causes_world_war_two.htm|publisher=History Learning Site|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlso of importance was the idea of a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]], supporters of which hoped to unite the [[German people]] under one nation state, which included all territories where Germans lived, regardless of whether they happened to be a minority in a particular territory. After the [[Treaty of Versailles]], a unification between Germany and a newly formed [[German-Austria]], a successor [[rump state]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], was prohibited by the Allies despite the majority of [[Austrians|Austrian Germans]] supporting such a union.\n\n[[File:First pictures of the Japanese occupation of Peiping in China.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese march into [[Zhengyangmen]] of [[Beijing]] after capturing the city in July 1937]]\nIn Asia, the [[Empire of Japan]] harbored expansionist desires towards [[Manchuria]] and the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].\n\n==Militarism==\n  \n{{Further|Militarism|Italian irredentism|Weimar Republic|Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Japanese militarism|}}\n[[Militarism]] is the principle or policy of maintaining a strong [[military]] capability to use aggressively to expand national interests and/or values, with the view that military efficiency is the supreme ideal of a state.<ref>{{Cite web|title = the definition of militarism|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/militarism|website = Dictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> A highly militaristic and aggressive national ideology prevailed in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Italy]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bruno Coppieters|author2=N.

The leaders of countries that have been militarized often feel a need to prove that their armies are important and formidable, and this was often a contributing factor in the start of conflicts in the [[interwar period]] such as the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2129.html|title=Japanese history: Militarism and World War II|website=www.japan-guide.com|accessdate=2015-05-30}}</ref>\n\nDuring the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u20131933), the [[Kapp Putsch]], an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the republican government, was launched by disaffected members of the armed forces. After this event, some of the more radical militarists and nationalists were submerged in grief and despair into the [[NSDAP]], while more moderate elements of militarism declined. The result was an influx of militarily-inclined men into the Nazi Party which, when combined with their racial theories, fueled [[Irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments and put Germany on a collision course for war with its immediate neighbors.\n\nTwo contemporaneous factors in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] contributed both to the growing power of its military and chaos within its ranks leading up to the Second World War. One was the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] Law, which required the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) to nominate cabinet members before changes could be formed. This essentially gave the military veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly parliamentary country. Another factor was ''[[gekokuj\u014d]]'', or institutionalized [[Insubordination|disobedience]] by junior officers. It was not uncommon for radical junior officers to press their goals, to the extent of assassinating their seniors. In 1936, this phenomenon resulted in the [[February 26 Incident]], in which junior officers attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and killed leading members of the Japanese government. In the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] wrecked Japan's economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to force the entire military into working towards the conquest of all of Asia. For example, in 1931 the [[Kwantung Army]] (a Japanese military force stationed in [[Manchuria]]) staged the [[Mukden Incident]], which sparked the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Invasion of Manchuria]] and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].\n\n==Germans vs Slavs==\n\n{{Further|Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Lebensraum|Drang nach Osten}}\nTwentieth-century events marked the culmination of a millennium-long process of intermingling between Germans and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. The rise of nationalism in the 19th century made race a centerpiece of political loyalty. The rise of the nation-state had given way to the politics of identity, including [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]]. Furthermore, [[Social Darwinism|Social-Darwinist]] theories framed the coexistence as a \"Teuton vs. Slav\" struggle for domination, land and limited resources.<ref>Andreas Wimmer, ''Waves of War: Nationalism, State Formation, and Ethnic Exclusion in the Modern World'' (2012)</ref> Integrating these ideas into their own world-view, the Nazis believed that the Germans, the \"[[Aryan race]]\", were the [[master race]] and that the Slavs were inferior.<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''The Third Reich: A New History'' (2001)</ref>\n\n==Interrelations and economics==\n\n===Problems with the Treaty of Versailles===\n{{Further|Treaty of Versailles}}\n[[File:German losses after WWI.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Germany after Versailles\n----\n{{legend|#ddefd0|Administered by the [[League of Nations]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffcf|Annexed or transferred to neighboring countries by the treaty, or later via plebiscite and League of Nation action}}\n{{legend|#f6d3a9|[[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]}}]]\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] was neither lenient enough to appease [[Germany]], nor harsh enough to prevent it from becoming the dominant continental power again.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The National Archives Learning Curve {{!}} The Great War {{!}} Making peace {{!}} Reaction to the Treaty of Versailles {{!}} Background|url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/greatwar/g5/cs2/background.htm|website = www.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> Germans largely saw the treaty place the blame, or \"[[War Guilt Clause|war guilt]]\", on Germany and Austria-Hungary and punish them for their \"responsibility\" rather than working out an agreement that would assure long-term peace. The treaty provided for harsh monetary [[World War I reparations|reparations]], separated millions of ethnic Germans into neighboring countries, [[Territorial changes of Germany|territorial dismemberment]], and caused mass ethnic resettlement. In an effort to pay war reparations to Britain and France, the [[Weimar Republic]] printed trillions of marks, causing extremely high [[inflation]] of the German currency (see [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]]).\n\nThe treaty created bitter resentment towards the victors of World War I, who had promised the people of Germany that U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Wilson's Fourteen Points|Fourteen Points]] would be a guideline for peace; however, the US played a minor role in World War I and Wilson could not convince the Allies to agree to adopt his Fourteen Points. Many Germans felt that the German government had agreed to an [[armistice]] based on this understanding, while others felt that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]] had been orchestrated by the \"November criminals\" who later assumed office in the new Weimar Republic.\n\nThe [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] were taken during the war, and Italy took the [[South Tyrol|southern half]] of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] after an armistice had been agreed upon. The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|war in the east]] ended with the defeat and collapse of the [[Russian Empire]], and German troops [[Ober Ost|occupied]] large parts of Eastern and Central Europe (with varying degree of control), establishing various client states such as a [[Kingdom of Poland (1916-1918)|kingdom of Poland]] and the [[United Baltic Duchy]]. After the destructive and indecisive [[battle of Jutland]] (1916) and the mutiny of its sailors in 1917, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] spent most of the war in port, only to be turned over to the allies and scuttled at surrender by its own officers. The lack of an obvious military defeat was one of the pillars that held together the ''[[Dolchstosslegende]]'' (\"Stab-in-the-back myth\") and gave the Nazis another propaganda tool at their disposal.\n\n===French security demands===\nFrench security demands, such as reparations, coal payments, and a demilitarized Rhineland, took precedence at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and shaped the Treaty of Versailles by severely punishing Germany; however, Austria found the treaty to be unjust which encouraged Hitler's popularity.  Ginsberg argues, \"France was greatly weakened and, in its weakness and fear of a resurgent Germany, sought to isolate and punish Germany....French revenge would come back to haunt France during the Nazi invasion and occupation twenty years later.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Roy H.

The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 was their chance to punish Germany for starting the war. The war \"must be someone's fault \u2013 and that's a very natural human reaction\" analyzed historian Margaret MacMillan.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winter|first=Jay|title=The Legacy of the Great War: Ninety Years On|year=2009|publisher=University of Missouri Press|page=126}}</ref> Germany was charged with the sole responsibility of starting World War I.

The French government printed excess currency, which created inflation, to compensate for the lack of funds in addition to borrowing money from the United States. Reparations from Germany were necessary to stabilize the French economy.<ref name=\"Paxton 2011 153\"/> France also demanded that Germany give France their coal supply from the Ruhr to compensate for the destruction of French coalmines during the war.

Lengthy talks were held between the U.S. and Japan. When Japan [[French Indochina in World War II|moved into the southern part]] of [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|French Indochina]], President Roosevelt chose to freeze all Japanese assets in the U.S. The intended consequence of this was the halt of oil shipments from the U.S. to Japan, which had supplied 80 percent of Japanese oil imports. The Netherlands and Britain followed suit. With oil reserves that would last only a year and a half during peacetime (much less during wartime), this [[ABCD line]] left Japan two choices: comply with the U.S.-led demand to pull out of China, or seize the oilfields in the [[Dutch East Indies#World War II and independence|East Indies from the Netherlands]].

The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding century. The old philosophy of \"concert of nations\", growing out of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), saw Europe as a shifting map of alliances among nation-states, creating a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] maintained by strong armies and secret agreements. Under the new philosophy, the League was a government of governments, with the role of settling disputes between individual nations in an open and legalist forum. The United States never joined, which lessened the power and credibility of the League\u2014the addition of a burgeoning industrial and military world power might have added more force behind the League's demands and requests.\n\n[[File:No-nb bldsa 5c006.jpg|thumb|Left|The official opening of the League of Nations, 15 November 1920]]\nThe League lacked an armed force of its own and so depended on the members to enforce its resolutions, uphold economic sanctions that the League ordered, or provide an army when needed for the League to use. However, they were often very reluctant to do so. After numerous notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the [[Axis powers]] in the 1930s. The reliance upon unanimous decisions, the lack of an armed force, and the continued self-interest of its leading members meant that this failure was arguably inevitable.<ref>{{cite book|author=David T.

Mason had contended that a \"flight into war\" had been imposed on [[Adolf Hitler]] by a structural economic crisis, which confronted Hitler with the choice of making difficult economic decisions or aggression. Overy argued against Mason's thesis, maintaining that though Germany was faced with economic problems in 1939, the extent of these problems cannot explain aggression against [[Poland]] and the reasons for the outbreak of war were due to the choices made by the Nazi leadership.\n\nMason had argued that the German working-class was always  to the Nazi dictatorship; that in the over-heated German economy of the late 1930s, German workers could force employers to grant higher wages by leaving for another firm that would grant the desired wage increases; that this was a form of political resistance and this resistance forced [[Adolf Hitler]] to go to war in 1939.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\">Perry, Matt \"Mason, Timothy\" pages&nbsp;780\u2013781 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1999 page 780</ref> Thus, the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] was caused by structural economic problems, a \"flight into war\" imposed by a domestic crisis.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> The key aspects of the crisis were according to Mason, a shaky economic recovery was threatened by a rearmament program that was overwhelming the economy and in which the Nazi regime's nationalist bluster limited its options.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> In this way, Mason articulated a ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' (\"primacy of domestic politics\")  view of World War II's origins through the concept of [[social imperialism]].<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages&nbsp;6\u20137</ref> Mason's ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' thesis was in marked contrast to the ''Primat der Au\u00dfenpolitik'' (\"primacy of foreign politics) usually used to explain World War II.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> In Mason's opinion, German foreign policy was driven by domestic political considerations, and the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a \"barbaric variant of social imperialism\".<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 7</ref>\n\nMason argued that \"Nazi Germany was always bent ''at some time'' upon a major war of expansion.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated165\">Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 165</ref> However, Mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy, and had nothing to do with what Hitler wanted.<ref name=\"autogenerated165\"/> In Mason's view in the period between 1936\u201341, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler's 'will' or 'intentions' that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy.<ref name=\"autogenerated88\">Kershaw, Ian'' The Nazi Dictatorship'' London : Arnold 2000 page 88.</ref> Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the November Revolution of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution.<ref name=\"autogenerated88\"/> According to Mason, by 1939, the \"overheating\" of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\">Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages&nbsp;165\u2013166</ref> Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless 'smash and grab' foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 166</ref> Mason described German foreign policy as driven by an opportunistic 'next victim' syndrome after the ''[[Anschluss]]'', in which the \"promiscuity of aggressive intentions\" was nurtured by every successful foreign policy move.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 151</ref> In Mason's opinion, the decision to sign the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact]] with the Soviet Union and to attack Poland and the running of the risk of a war with Britain and France were the abandonment by Hitler of his foreign policy program outlined in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' forced on him by his need to stop a collapsing German economy by seizing territory abroad to be plundered.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\nFor Overy, the problem with Mason's thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way not shown by records, information was passed on to Hitler about the ''Reich'''s economic problems.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J. \"Debate: Germany, 'domestic crisis' and the war in 1939\" from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Patrick Finney, (London: Edward Arnold, 1997) p 102</ref> Overy argued that there was a difference between economic pressures induced by the problems of the [[Four Year Plan]] and economic motives to seize raw materials, industry and foreign reserves of neighboring states as a way of accelerating the Four Year Plan.<ref>Overy, Richard \"Germany, 'Domestic Crisis' and War in 1939\" from ''The Third Reich'' edited by Christian Leitz (Oxford: Blackwell, 1999) p&nbsp;117\u2013118</ref> Overy asserted that Mason downplayed the repressive capacity of the German state as a way of dealing with domestic unhappiness.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/> Finally, Overy argued that there is considerable evidence that the German state felt they could master the economic problems of rearmament; as one civil servant put it in January 1940 \"we have already mastered so many difficulties in the past, that here too, if one or other raw material became extremely scarce, ways and means will always yet be found to get out of a fix\".<ref>Overy, Richard \"Germany, 'Domestic Crisis' and War in 1939\" from ''The Third Reich'' edited by Christian Leitz Blackwell: Oxford, 1999 page 108</ref>\n\n==Specific

However its defensive strategy against Germany was based on the mountains of the Sudetenland.\n\nHitler pressed for the Sudetenland's incorporation into the Reich, supporting German separatist groups within the Sudeten region. Alleged Czech brutality and persecution under Prague helped to stir up nationalist tendencies, as did the Nazi press. After the Anschluss, all German parties (except the German Social-Democratic party) merged with the [[Sudeten German Party]] (SdP). Paramilitary activity and extremist violence peaked during this period and the Czechoslovakian government declared martial law in parts of the Sudetenland to maintain order. This only complicated the situation, especially now that Slovakian nationalism was rising, out of suspicion towards Prague and Nazi encouragement. Citing the need to protect the Germans in Czechoslovakia, Germany requested the immediate annexation of the Sudetenland.\n\nIn the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 30, 1938, British, French and Italian prime ministers appeased Hitler by giving him what he wanted, hoping he would not want any more. The conferring powers allowed Germany to move troops into the region and incorporate it into the Reich \"for the sake of peace.\" In exchange for this, Hitler gave his word that Germany would make no further territorial claims in Europe.<ref>[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pv/munich/czdoc09.html Chamberlain's radio broadcast] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607043817/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pv/munich/czdoc09.html# |date=2007-06-07 }}, 27 September 1938</ref> Czechoslovakia was not allowed to participate in the conference.

In 1938, Poland participated in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia by annexing [[Zaolzie]].

Leading themes include the political takeover in 1933 of Germany by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], which ruthlessly promoted an aggressive foreign policy in violation of the Versailles Treaty of 1919, [[Japanese militarism]] against China, Italian aggression against Ethiopia, and the success of Germany in forming an agreement with the Soviet Union in August 1939 to divide up Eastern Europe. The immediate precipitating event was [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invading Poland]] on September 1, 1939, and Britain and France declaring war on Germany on September 3, 1939.\n\nDeep anger arose in [[Weimar Germany]] that experienced strong currents of [[revanchism]] after the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that punished Germany for causing [[World War I]] in 1918. Complaints focused on the [[Demilitarized zone|demilitarization]] of Germany's [[Rhineland]], the prohibition of unification with Austria, and the loss of some German-speaking territories. The loss of overseas colonies was a less prominent issue. Germans said they had endorsed  Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]] in good faith, but the points were ignored. Versailles imposed severe conditions to prevent Germany from ever becoming a military power again, as well as heavy financial [[World War I reparations|reparations]].  Resentment and hatred of other countries was intensified by the instability of the German political system, as many activists rejected the legitimacy of the Weimar Republic. The most extreme politician was  [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Adolf Hitler]] and his violent Nazi party. They [[Machtergreifung|took totalitarian power in Germany starting in 1933]] and demanded the undoing of the Versailles provisions. The ambitious and aggressive foreign policy reflected Nazi ideology, such as: [[Anti-Semitism]], [[pan-germanism|unification of all Germans]], the acquisition of \"living space\" ([[Lebensraum]]) for agrarian settlers ([[Blut und Boden]]), creating a \"pull towards the East\" ([[Drang nach Osten]]) (that is, Poland and Russia), the elimination of [[Bolshevism]], and the hegemony of an \"[[Aryan race|Aryan]]\"/\"[[Nordic race|Nordic]]\" [[Master Race]] over the \"sub-humans\" ([[Untermensch]]en) of [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]].\n\nOther factors leading to the war included aggression by Italy against Ethiopia and Albania, the Japanese aggression and seizure of most of China and the Axis alliance formed by Germany, Japan and Italy. The 1930s were a decade in which democracy was in disrepute; countries across the world turned to authoritarian regimes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Dahl|title=Democracy and Its Critics|url=https://archive.org/details/democracyitscrit00dahl_0|url-access=registration|year=1989|publisher=Yale UP|pages=[https://archive.org/details/democracyitscrit00dahl_0/page/239 239]\u201340|isbn=0300153554}}</ref>\n\nThese aggressive moves met only feeble and ineffectual [[appeasement|policies of appeasement]] from Britain and France. The League of Nations proved helpless regarding China and Ethiopia.  A decisive event was the 1938 [[Munich Conference]] which formally approved Germany's annexation of the Sudeten region from Czechoslovakia.  Hitler promised it was his last claim, but in early 1939 he became even more aggressive, as the British and French finally realized that appeasement was not guaranteeing peace. Britain and France badly fumbled diplomatic efforts to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union. Instead Hitler offered Stalin a better deal in the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Expansionism==\n\n[[Expansionism]] is the doctrine of expanding the territorial base (or economic influence) of a country, usually by means of military aggression. In Europe, Italy under [[Benito Mussolini]] sought to create a [[New Roman Empire]] based around the Mediterranean. It invaded [[Albania]] in early 1938, at the start of the war, and later invaded [[Greece]]. Italy had also invaded [[Ethiopia]] as early as 1935. This provoked angry words and an oil embargo from the [[League of Nations]], which failed.\n\nUnder the Nazi regime, Germany began its own program of expansion, seeking to restore the \"rightful\" boundaries of historic Germany. As a prelude toward these goals the [[Rhineland]] was [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarized in March 1936]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World War 2 Causes|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/causes_world_war_two.htm|publisher=History Learning Site|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlso of importance was the idea of a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]], supporters of which hoped to unite the [[German people]] under one nation state, which included all territories where Germans lived, regardless of whether they happened to be a minority in a particular territory. After the [[Treaty of Versailles]], a unification between Germany and a newly formed [[German-Austria]], a successor [[rump state]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], was prohibited by the Allies despite the majority of [[Austrians|Austrian Germans]] supporting such a union.\n\n[[File:First pictures of the Japanese occupation of Peiping in China.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese march into [[Zhengyangmen]] of [[Beijing]] after capturing the city in July 1937]]\nIn Asia, the [[Empire of Japan]] harbored expansionist desires towards [[Manchuria]] and the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].\n\n==Militarism==\n  \n{{Further|Militarism|Italian irredentism|Weimar Republic|Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|Japanese militarism|}}\n[[Militarism]] is the principle or policy of maintaining a strong [[military]] capability to use aggressively to expand national interests and/or values, with the view that military efficiency is the supreme ideal of a state.<ref>{{Cite web|title = the definition of militarism|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/militarism|website = Dictionary.com|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> A highly militaristic and aggressive national ideology prevailed in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Italy]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bruno Coppieters|author2=N.

The leaders of countries that have been militarized often feel a need to prove that their armies are important and formidable, and this was often a contributing factor in the start of conflicts in the [[interwar period]] such as the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2129.html|title=Japanese history: Militarism and World War II|website=www.japan-guide.com|accessdate=2015-05-30}}</ref>\n\nDuring the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u20131933), the [[Kapp Putsch]], an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the republican government, was launched by disaffected members of the armed forces. After this event, some of the more radical militarists and nationalists were submerged in grief and despair into the [[NSDAP]], while more moderate elements of militarism declined. The result was an influx of militarily-inclined men into the Nazi Party which, when combined with their racial theories, fueled [[Irredentism|irredentist]] sentiments and put Germany on a collision course for war with its immediate neighbors.\n\nTwo contemporaneous factors in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] contributed both to the growing power of its military and chaos within its ranks leading up to the Second World War. One was the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] Law, which required the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) to nominate cabinet members before changes could be formed. This essentially gave the military veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly parliamentary country. Another factor was ''[[gekokuj\u014d]]'', or institutionalized [[Insubordination|disobedience]] by junior officers. It was not uncommon for radical junior officers to press their goals, to the extent of assassinating their seniors. In 1936, this phenomenon resulted in the [[February 26 Incident]], in which junior officers attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and killed leading members of the Japanese government. In the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] wrecked Japan's economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to force the entire military into working towards the conquest of all of Asia. For example, in 1931 the [[Kwantung Army]] (a Japanese military force stationed in [[Manchuria]]) staged the [[Mukden Incident]], which sparked the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Invasion of Manchuria]] and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].\n\n==Germans vs Slavs==\n\n{{Further|Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Lebensraum|Drang nach Osten}}\nTwentieth-century events marked the culmination of a millennium-long process of intermingling between Germans and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. The rise of nationalism in the 19th century made race a centerpiece of political loyalty. The rise of the nation-state had given way to the politics of identity, including [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]]. Furthermore, [[Social Darwinism|Social-Darwinist]] theories framed the coexistence as a \"Teuton vs. Slav\" struggle for domination, land and limited resources.<ref>Andreas Wimmer, ''Waves of War: Nationalism, State Formation, and Ethnic Exclusion in the Modern World'' (2012)</ref> Integrating these ideas into their own world-view, the Nazis believed that the Germans, the \"[[Aryan race]]\", were the [[master race]] and that the Slavs were inferior.<ref>[[Michael Burleigh]], ''The Third Reich: A New History'' (2001)</ref>\n\n==Interrelations and economics==\n\n===Problems with the Treaty of Versailles===\n{{Further|Treaty of Versailles}}\n[[File:German losses after WWI.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Germany after Versailles\n----\n{{legend|#ddefd0|Administered by the [[League of Nations]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffcf|Annexed or transferred to neighboring countries by the treaty, or later via plebiscite and League of Nation action}}\n{{legend|#f6d3a9|[[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]}}]]\nThe [[Treaty of Versailles]] was neither lenient enough to appease [[Germany]], nor harsh enough to prevent it from becoming the dominant continental power again.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The National Archives Learning Curve {{!}} The Great War {{!}} Making peace {{!}} Reaction to the Treaty of Versailles {{!}} Background|url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/greatwar/g5/cs2/background.htm|website = www.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}</ref> Germans largely saw the treaty place the blame, or \"[[War Guilt Clause|war guilt]]\", on Germany and Austria-Hungary and punish them for their \"responsibility\" rather than working out an agreement that would assure long-term peace. The treaty provided for harsh monetary [[World War I reparations|reparations]], separated millions of ethnic Germans into neighboring countries, [[Territorial changes of Germany|territorial dismemberment]], and caused mass ethnic resettlement. In an effort to pay war reparations to Britain and France, the [[Weimar Republic]] printed trillions of marks, causing extremely high [[inflation]] of the German currency (see [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic]]).\n\nThe treaty created bitter resentment towards the victors of World War I, who had promised the people of Germany that U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Wilson's Fourteen Points|Fourteen Points]] would be a guideline for peace; however, the US played a minor role in World War I and Wilson could not convince the Allies to agree to adopt his Fourteen Points. Many Germans felt that the German government had agreed to an [[armistice]] based on this understanding, while others felt that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]] had been orchestrated by the \"November criminals\" who later assumed office in the new Weimar Republic.\n\nThe [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] were taken during the war, and Italy took the [[South Tyrol|southern half]] of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] after an armistice had been agreed upon. The [[Eastern Front (World War I)|war in the east]] ended with the defeat and collapse of the [[Russian Empire]], and German troops [[Ober Ost|occupied]] large parts of Eastern and Central Europe (with varying degree of control), establishing various client states such as a [[Kingdom of Poland (1916-1918)|kingdom of Poland]] and the [[United Baltic Duchy]]. After the destructive and indecisive [[battle of Jutland]] (1916) and the mutiny of its sailors in 1917, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] spent most of the war in port, only to be turned over to the allies and scuttled at surrender by its own officers. The lack of an obvious military defeat was one of the pillars that held together the ''[[Dolchstosslegende]]'' (\"Stab-in-the-back myth\") and gave the Nazis another propaganda tool at their disposal.\n\n===French security demands===\nFrench security demands, such as reparations, coal payments, and a demilitarized Rhineland, took precedence at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and shaped the Treaty of Versailles by severely punishing Germany; however, Austria found the treaty to be unjust which encouraged Hitler's popularity.

The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding century. The old philosophy of \"concert of nations\", growing out of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815), saw Europe as a shifting map of alliances among nation-states, creating a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] maintained by strong armies and secret agreements. Under the new philosophy, the League was a government of governments, with the role of settling disputes between individual nations in an open and legalist forum.

However, they were often very reluctant to do so. After numerous notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the [[Axis powers]] in the 1930s. The reliance upon unanimous decisions, the lack of an armed force, and the continued self-interest of its leading members meant that this failure was arguably inevitable.<ref>{{cite book|author=David T.

Mason had contended that a \"flight into war\" had been imposed on [[Adolf Hitler]] by a structural economic crisis, which confronted Hitler with the choice of making difficult economic decisions or aggression. Overy argued against Mason's thesis, maintaining that though Germany was faced with economic problems in 1939, the extent of these problems cannot explain aggression against [[Poland]] and the reasons for the outbreak of war were due to the choices made by the Nazi leadership.\n\nMason had argued that the German working-class was always  to the Nazi dictatorship; that in the over-heated German economy of the late 1930s, German workers could force employers to grant higher wages by leaving for another firm that would grant the desired wage increases; that this was a form of political resistance and this resistance forced [[Adolf Hitler]] to go to war in 1939.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\">Perry, Matt \"Mason, Timothy\" pages&nbsp;780\u2013781 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1999 page 780</ref> Thus, the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] was caused by structural economic problems, a \"flight into war\" imposed by a domestic crisis.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> The key aspects of the crisis were according to Mason, a shaky economic recovery was threatened by a rearmament program that was overwhelming the economy and in which the Nazi regime's nationalist bluster limited its options.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> In this way, Mason articulated a ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' (\"primacy of domestic politics\")  view of World War II's origins through the concept of [[social imperialism]].<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages&nbsp;6\u20137</ref> Mason's ''Primat der Innenpolitik'' thesis was in marked contrast to the ''Primat der Au\u00dfenpolitik'' (\"primacy of foreign politics) usually used to explain World War II.<ref name=\"autogenerated780\"/> In Mason's opinion, German foreign policy was driven by domestic political considerations, and the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a \"barbaric variant of social imperialism\".<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 7</ref>\n\nMason argued that \"Nazi Germany was always bent ''at some time'' upon a major war of expansion.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated165\">Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 165</ref> However, Mason argued that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy, and had nothing to do with what Hitler wanted.<ref name=\"autogenerated165\"/> In Mason's view in the period between 1936\u201341, it was the state of the German economy, and not Hitler's 'will' or 'intentions' that was the most important determinate on German decision-making on foreign policy.<ref name=\"autogenerated88\">Kershaw, Ian'' The Nazi Dictatorship'' London : Arnold 2000 page 88.</ref> Mason argued that the Nazi leaders were deeply haunted by the November Revolution of 1918, and was most unwilling to see any fall in working class living standards out of the fear that it might provoke another November Revolution.<ref name=\"autogenerated88\"/> According to Mason, by 1939, the \"overheating\" of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans produced by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and the sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\">Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pages&nbsp;165\u2013166</ref> Mason contended that when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless 'smash and grab' foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 166</ref> Mason described German foreign policy as driven by an opportunistic 'next victim' syndrome after the ''[[Anschluss]]'', in which the \"promiscuity of aggressive intentions\" was nurtured by every successful foreign policy move.<ref>Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 151</ref> In Mason's opinion, the decision to sign the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact]] with the Soviet Union and to attack Poland and the running of the risk of a war with Britain and France were the abandonment by Hitler of his foreign policy program outlined in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' forced on him by his need to stop a collapsing German economy by seizing territory abroad to be plundered.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\nFor Overy, the problem with Mason's thesis was that it rested on the assumption that in a way not shown by records, information was passed on to Hitler about the ''Reich'''s economic problems.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J. \"Debate: Germany, 'domestic crisis' and the war in 1939\" from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Patrick

raw materials, industry and foreign reserves of neighboring states as a way of accelerating the Four Year Plan.<ref>Overy, Richard \"Germany, 'Domestic Crisis' and War in 1939\" from ''The Third

unhappiness.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/> Finally, Overy argued that there is considerable evidence that the German state felt they could master the economic problems of rearmament; as one civil servant put it in January 1940 \"we have already mastered so many difficulties in the past, that here too, if one or other raw material became extremely scarce, ways and means will always yet be found to get out

In 1937 the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] triggered the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].\n\nThe invasion was launched by the bombing of many cities such as [[battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], [[Nanjing]] and [[Guangzhou]]. The latest, which began on 22 and 23 September 1937, called forth widespread protests culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the League of Nations.  The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] captured the Chinese capital city of Nanjing, and committed [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] in the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing massacre]].  The war tied down large numbers of Chinese soldiers, so Japan set up three different Chinese puppet states to enlist some Chinese support.<ref>David M.

Historically, the [[Pan-Germanism]] idea of creating a [[Greater Germany]] to include all [[ethnic Germans]] into one nation-state was popular for Germans in both Austria and Germany.\n[[File:Sprachenkarte Mitteleuropas (1937).png|thumb|upright=1.5|1937 ethno-linguistic situation in central Europe]]\n\nOne of the [[National Socialist Program|Nazi party]]'s points was \"We demand the unification of all Germans in the Greater Germany on the basis of the people's right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe [[Stresa Front]] of 1935 between Britain, France and Italy had guaranteed the independence of Austria, but after the creation of the [[Axis powers|Rome-Berlin Axis]] Mussolini was much less interested in upholding its independence.\n\nThe Austrian government resisted as long as possible, but had no outside support and finally gave in to Hitler's fiery demands. No fighting occurred as most Austrians were enthusiastic, and Austria was fully absorbed as part of Germany. Outside powers did nothing. Italy had little reason for continued opposition to Germany, and was if anything drawn in closer to the Nazis.<ref>David Faber, ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2010) pp 139\u201368</ref><ref>Sister Mary Antonia Wathen, ''The policy of England and France toward the\" Anschluss\" of 1938'' (Catholic University of America Press, 1954).</ref>\n\n===Munich Agreement===\n{{Further|Munich Agreement|Appeasement}}\nThe [[Sudetenland]] was a predominantly German region inside [[Czechoslovakia]] alongside its border with Germany. Its more than 3 million ethnic Germans comprised almost a quarter of the population of Czechoslovakia. In the [[Treaty of Versailles]] it was given to the new Czechoslovak state against the wishes of much of the local population. The decision to disregard their right to [[self determination]] was based on French intent to weaken Germany. Much of Sudetenland was industrialized.<ref>David Faber, ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2010)</ref> \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-063-32, Bad Godesberg, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Vorbereitung.jpg|thumb|upright|British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and Hitler at a meeting in Germany on 24 September 1938, where Hitler demanded annexation of Czech border areas without delay]]\n\nCzechoslovakia had a modern army of 38 divisions, backed by a well-noted armament industry ([[\u0160koda Works|\u0160koda]]) as well as military alliances with France and the Soviet Union. However its defensive strategy against Germany was based on the mountains of the Sudetenland.\n\nHitler pressed for the Sudetenland's incorporation into the Reich, supporting German separatist groups within the Sudeten region. Alleged Czech brutality and persecution under Prague helped to stir up nationalist tendencies, as did the Nazi press. After the Anschluss, all German parties (except the German Social-Democratic party) merged with the [[Sudeten German Party]] (SdP). Paramilitary activity and extremist violence peaked during this period and the Czechoslovakian government declared martial law in parts of the Sudetenland to maintain order. This only complicated the situation, especially now that Slovakian nationalism was rising, out of suspicion towards Prague and Nazi encouragement. Citing the need to protect the Germans in Czechoslovakia, Germany requested the immediate annexation of the Sudetenland.\n\nIn the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 30, 1938, British, French and Italian prime ministers appeased Hitler by giving him what he wanted, hoping he would not want any more. The conferring powers allowed Germany to move troops into the region and incorporate it into the Reich \"for the sake of peace.\" In exchange for this, Hitler gave his word that Germany would make no further territorial claims in Europe.<ref>[http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pv/munich/czdoc09.html Chamberlain's radio broadcast] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607043817/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pv/munich/czdoc09.html# |date=2007-06-07 }}, 27 September 1938</ref> Czechoslovakia was not allowed to participate in the conference. When the French and British negotiators informed the Czechoslovak representatives about the agreement, and that if Czechoslovakia would not accept it, France and Britain would consider Czechoslovakia to be responsible for war, President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] capitulated. Germany took the Sudetenland unopposed.<ref>Robert A.

The historians' assessments have ranged from condemnation for allowing Hitler's Germany to grow too strong, to the judgment that Germany was so strong that it might  well win a war and that postponement of a showdown was in their country's best interests. <ref>Andrew Roberts, \"\u2018Appeasement\u2019 Review: What Were They Thinking?

The entire ordeal was the last show of the French and British policy of appeasement.\n\n===Italian invasion of Albania===\n{{Further|Italian invasion of Albania}}\nAfter the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, [[Benito Mussolini]] feared for Italy becoming a second-rate member of the Axis. Rome delivered Tirana an ultimatum on March 25, 1939, demanding that it accede to Italy's occupation of Albania. [[King Zog]] refused to accept money in exchange for countenancing a full Italian takeover and colonization of Albania. On April 7, 1939, Italian troops invaded Albania. Albania was occupied after a 3 days campaign with minimal resistance offered by the Albanian forces.\n\n===Soviet\u2013Japanese Border War===\n{{Further|Battle of Khalkhin Gol}}\nIn 1939, the Japanese attacked west from Manchuria into the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], following the earlier [[Battle of Lake Khasan]] in 1938. They were decisively beaten by Soviet units under General [[Georgy Zhukov]]. Following this battle, the Soviet Union and Japan were at peace until 1945. Japan looked south to expand its empire, leading to conflict with the United States over the Philippines and control of shipping lanes to the Dutch East Indies. The Soviet Union focused on her western border, but leaving 1 million to 1.5 million troops to guard the frontier with Japan.\n\n===Danzig crisis===\n[[File:Polish Corridor.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Polish Corridor]] and the [[Free City of Danzig (interwar)|Free City of Danzig]]]]\n{{Further|Free City of Danzig (interwar)|Polish Corridor}}\n\nAfter the final fate of Czechoslovakia proved that the F\u00fchrer's word could not be trusted, Britain and France decided on a change of strategy. They decided any further unilateral German expansion would be met by force. The natural next target for the Third Reich's further expansion was Poland, whose [[Polish Corridor|access to the Baltic sea]] had been carved out of [[West Prussia]] by the Versailles treaty, making [[East Prussia]] an [[exclave]]. The main port of the area, [[Danzig]], had been made [[Free City of Danzig (interwar)|a free city-state]] under Polish influence guaranteed by the League of Nations, a stark reminder to German nationalists of the [[Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic free city]] established after the French emperor's crushing victory over [[Prussia]] in 1807.\n\nAfter taking power, the Nazi government made efforts to establish friendly relations with Poland, resulting in the signing of the ten-year [[German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] with the Pi\u0142sudski regime in 1934. In 1938, Poland participated in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia by annexing [[Zaolzie]]. In 1939, Hitler claimed [[extraterritoriality]] for the [[Reichsautobahn Berlin-K\u00f6nigsberg]] and a change in Danzig's status, in exchange for promises of territory in Poland's neighbours and a 25-year extension of the non-aggression pact. Poland refused, fearing losing de facto access to the sea, subjugation as a German [[satellite|satellite state]] or [[client state]], and future further German demands.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/fyb/part_4.html The German-Polish Crisis (March 27 \u2013 May 9, 1939)]</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite book|author=John Ashley Soames Grenville|title=A History of the World from the 20th to the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNmfAL0CBBIC&pg=PA234|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-28955-9|pages=234\u2013}}</ref> In August 1939, Hitler delivered an [[ultimatum]] to Poland on Danzig's status.\n\n====Polish alliance with the Entente====\n{{Further|British-Polish Military Alliance|Franco-Polish alliance (1921)}}\n{{expand section|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn March 1939, Britain and France guaranteed the independence of Poland. Hitler's claims in the summer of 1939 on Danzig and the Polish Corridor provoked yet another [[international crisis]]. On August 25, Britain signed the Polish-British Common Defence Pact.\n\n====Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact====\n{{Further|Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Soviet invasion of Poland|Occupation of the Baltic States|Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Winter War}}\nNominally, the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] was a [[non-aggression treaty]] between Germany and the Soviet Union. It was signed in [[Moscow]] on August 23, 1939, by the Soviet foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and the German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]].\n\nIn 1939, neither Germany nor the Soviet Union were ready to go to war with each other. The Soviet Union had lost territory to Poland in 1920. Although officially labeled a \"non-aggression treaty\", the pact included a secret protocol, in which the independent countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties. The secret protocol explicitly assumed ''\"territorial and political rearrangements\"'' in the areas of these countries.\n\nSubsequently, all the mentioned countries were invaded, occupied, or forced to cede part of their territory by either the Soviet Union, Germany, or both.\n\n====Invasion of Poland====\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|upright=1.5|thumb|Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939 which directly led to the Anglo-French declaration of War on Germany on 3 Sept.

The USSR, however, gained control of the Baltic states and parts of Poland by allying with Germany, which it did through the secret [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] in August 1939. London's attempt at deterrence failed, but Hitler did not expect a wider war. Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and rejected the British and French demands that it withdraw, resulting in their declaration of war on September 3, 1939, in accordance with the defense treaties with Poland that they had signed and publicly announced.<ref>Halik Kochanski, ''The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War'' (2012) pp&nbsp;34\u201393</ref><ref>Zara Steiner, ''The Triumph of the Dark: European International History, 1933\u20131939'' (2011) pp&nbsp;690\u201392, 738\u201341</ref>\n\n===Invasion of the Soviet Union===\n{{Further|Operation Barbarossa|Soviet offensive plans controversy}}\nGermany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. Hitler believed that the Soviet Union could be defeated in a fast-paced and relentless assault that capitalized on the Soviet Union's ill-prepared state, and hoped that success there would bring Britain to the negotiation table, ending the war altogether.\n\n===Attacks on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, British Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong===\n{{Further|Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor}}\nThe US government and the American public in general had been supportive of China, condemning the [[century of humiliation|colonialist policies]] of the European powers and Japan, and promoting a so-called [[Open Door Policy]]. Many Americans viewed the Japanese as an aggressive and/or inferior race. The [[Nationalist Government]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] held friendly relations with the United States, which opposed Japan's invasion of China in 1937 that it considered an [[international law|illegal]] violation of the [[sovereignty]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]], and offered the Nationalist Government diplomatic, economic, and military assistance during its war against Japan. Diplomatic friction between the US and Japan manifested itself in events like the [[Panay incident]] in 1937 and the [[Allison incident]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Japanese troops entering Saigon in 1941.jpg|thumb|Japanese troops entering [[Saigon]]]]\nReacting to Japanese pressure on French authorities of [[French Indochina]] to stop trade with China, the U.S. began restricting trade with Japan in July 1940.

Japan stepped in as a mediator for the French-Thai war in May 1941, allowing its ally to occupy bordering provinces in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]. In July 1941, as operation Barbarossa had effectively neutralized the Soviet threat, the faction of the Japanese military junta supporting the \"Southern Strategy\", pushed through the occupation of the rest of French Indochina.\n\nThe United States reacted by seeking to bring the Japanese war effort to a complete halt by imposing [[ABCD line|a full embargo]] on all trade between the United States to Japan on 1&nbsp;August 1941, demanding that Japan withdraw all troops from both China and Indochina.

The eastern cougar was first assigned to the subspecies ''Felis concolor couguar'' and the [[Florida panther]] to ''F. c. coryi''.<ref name=r1/> Young and Goldman based their description of the eastern subspecies on their examination of eight of the existing 26 historic specimens.<ref name=r5/>\n\nIn 1955, Jackson described a new subspecies, the Wisconsin puma (''F. c. schorgeri''), from a small sample of skulls.<ref name=r6/>\n\nA 1981 taxonomy by Hall accepted ''F. c. schorgeri'', the Wisconsin puma, and also extended the range of the eastern puma into Nova Scotia and mapped the [[Florida panther]]'s (''F. c. coryi'') range as far north as South Carolina and southwestern Tennessee.<ref>Hall, E.R. (1981). ''The Mammals of North America, Second edition.'' John Wiley and Sons, New York.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Culver et al., recommended that based on recent genetic research, all [[North American cougar]]s be classified as a single subspecies, ''Puma concolor couguar'' following the oldest named subspecies (Kerr<ref name=r1/> in 1792).<ref name=\"Culver, M. 2000\"/>\n\nThe 2005 edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]''<ref name=msw3/> followed Culver's recommendations. This revision was made by Dr. W. Chris Wozencraft of Bethel University, Indiana, as the sole reviewer. However, the publication's Web site as of 2011, as well as that of its affiliate, the [[Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]], continued to maintain the ''Puma concolor couguar'' (both western and eastern cougars) as a subspecies of ''Puma concolor''.<ref name=msw3>[http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?s=y&id=14000204 ''Puma concolor''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521172614/http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?s=y&id=14000204 |date=2011-05-21 }}.

The federal government of Canada has taken no position on the subspecies' existence, continued or otherwise, and terms the evidence \"inconclusive.\"<ref name=\"gazette\"/>\n\nThe FWS reviewed all available research and other information, and concluded in 2011 that the eastern cougar has been extinct since the 1930s, and recommended that it be removed from [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|its list of endangered species]].<ref name=\"usfaws11\"/> The agency used the 1946 taxonomy of S.P. Young and E.A. Goldman in defining the eastern cougar subspecies. While noting that some taxonomists in recent years have classified all North American cougars within a single subspecies, the agency's 2011 report said, \"a full taxonomic analysis is necessary to conclude that a revision to the Young and Goldman (1946) taxonomy is warranted.\"<ref name=r1/>\n\nThe agency acknowledged the occasional presence of cougars in eastern North America, but believes these are of wanderers from western breeding ranges or escaped captives. Its review expressed skepticism that breeding populations exist north of Florida, noting, among other things, the lack of consistent road kill evidence comparable to known cougar ranges. However, the presence of cougars in the wild \u2014 whatever their [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] or origin \u2014 in eastern North America continues to be controversial.<ref name=\"barringer\"/>\n\nVarious residents of eastern North America, especially in rural regions, have reported as many as 10,000 cougar sightings since the 1960s,<ref name=r2/> and many continue to believe the subspecies has survived.<ref name=\"barringer\"/>\n\nBruce Wright \u2014 a wildlife biologist and former student of [[Aldo Leopold]] \u2014 popularized the idea that a breeding population of cougars persisted in northern New England and the Maritime provinces through a series of articles and books published between 1960 and 1973. Wright based his idea mostly on unconfirmed sightings, track photos, and plaster casts, and photographs of pumas killed in New Brunswick in 1932 and in Maine in 1938.<ref>Bolgiano, C. (1995). ''Mountain lion: An unnatural history of pumas and people''. Stackpole Books, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, {{ISBN|0811710440}}.</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, privately run groups have formed in nearly every state to compile and investigate records of cougar sightings. Many of these groups are convinced that breeding populations of cougars exist throughout the region. Some believe that a conspiracy to hide information or secretly reintroduce cougars is actively underway by state and federal governments. Some endeavor to promote the recovery of cougars in eastern North America.<ref name=r2/> Large numbers of cougar sightings have been reliably reported throughout the Midwest.<ref name=w10/>\n\n===Possible colonization of the east by western cougars===\nAt least several dozen or more reported sightings have been confirmed by biologists, many of whom believe they are accounted for by escaped captives or individual members of the western subspecies that have wandered hundreds of miles from their established breeding ranges in the Dakotas or elsewhere in the west.<ref name=\"Baron\"/>\n\nEastern U.S. reported sightings, many of which reviewed in the recent federal report,<ref name=\"cnn11\"/> in various locations, including [[Michigan]]<ref name=\"Johnson\"/><ref name=\"Tribune\"/><ref name=\"Bolgiano\"/><ref name=\"Butz\"/> (See [[Upper Peninsula]]), [[Wisconsin]],<ref name=w1/><ref name=w2/> [[Southern Indiana]], [[Illinois]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Missouri]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/><ref name=w3/> [[Kentucky]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Connecticut]],<ref name=\"Baron\"/><ref name=w11/> [[New York (state)|New York]]<ref name=\"New York\"/> [[Maine]],<ref name= \"Bangor\"/> [[Pennsylvania]],<ref name=\"Pennsylvania\"/> [[Massachusetts]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[New Hampshire]],<ref name=\"Hampshire\"/> [[North Carolina]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Virginia]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Arkansas]],<ref name=\"southeast\"/> [[Vermont]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Alabama]]<ref name=\"southeast\"/> [[Louisiana]],<ref name=\"southeast\"/><ref name=\"southeast2\"/> and [[Tennessee]].<ref name=\"Tennessee\">[http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/field-notes/tennessee-officials-confirm-first-cougar-sighting-in-100-years Tennessee Officials Confirm First Cougar Sighting in 100 Years], Field & Stream</ref>\n\nUntil around 1990, reports of mountain lions in the Midwest and East were highly influenced by the \"[[Bigfoot]] factor\", according to Mark Dowling, co-founder of the Eastern Cougar Network. \"None of it was really real\", he said in an interview,<ref name=insight/> but the situation has changed dramatically since that time according to Dowling, whose group collects and disseminates data on the shifting mountain lion population.<ref name=insight>{{cite journal |journal=Insight on the News |title=Mountain Lions Headed for Atlantic City?|date= August 5, 2003 |volume=19 |issue=#17 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nDowling said in 2003 that sightings in the eastern half of the nation, including Michigan, etc., were \"almost certainly\" escaped captives, but he added that the notion that (western) cougars \"will eventually reach New Jersey\" is a reasonable prediction, in part due to increased populations of [[white-tailed deer]].<ref name=insight/>\n\nHowever, some of these cougars found far in the east were established to be of western origin. As noted in an opinion piece by David Baron in the ''New York Times'', concerning a cougar killed by a car in Connecticut in 2011:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Wildlife officials, who at first assumed the cat was a captive animal that had escaped its owners, examined its DNA and concluded that it was a wild cougar from the Black Hills of South Dakota. It had wandered at least 1,500 miles before meeting its end at the front of an SUV in Connecticut.\"<ref name=\"Baron\" /></blockquote>\n\nRecolonization is entirely dependent upon dispersing subadult females, who typically range far less than subadult males. While subadult females with Black Hills DNA have been documented since 2015 in Tennessee, Missouri and Iowa, as of 2018, the easternmost breeding colony north of Florida is the Niobrara River Valley in central Nebraska.<ref>Nebraska Game & Parks: http://outdoornebraska.gov/mountainlions/</ref>\n\n===Canadian views===\nA 1998 study for Canada's national [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] concluded \"that there is no objective evidence (actual cougar specimens or other unequivocal confirmation) for the continuous presence of cougars since the last century anywhere in eastern Canada or the eastern United States outside of Florida.\"<ref>Scott, F.W. (1998). ''Update of COSEWIC status report on cougar (''Felis concolor couguar''), eastern population''. Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, Environment Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.</ref> Based on this, in 1999, the magazine ''Canadian Geographic'' reported that for the previous half century, a debate over whether or not Canada's eastern woods host a cougar species all its own has raged. \"Now the answer appears to be 'no.' Experts say past sightings were cases of mistaken identification.\"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Canadian Geographic |title=Can the eastern cougar debate be laid to rest?|author=Harry Thurston|date=September\u2013October 1999 |volume=119 |issue=#6 |page=18}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Canadian committee's website as of 2011 says that data are \"insufficient\" to draw conclusions regarding the subspecies\u2019 continued existence, or even whether it ever existed at all.<ref name=\"gazette\"/><ref name=\"barringer\"/><ref name=w4/>\n\nIn March 2011, an official with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources stated that cougars are present in the province.<ref>[https://www.ontario.ca/page/mountain-lion-cougar Mountain lion (Cougar)], Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry</ref> This official said individual cougars in Ontario may be escaped zoo animals or pets or may have migrated from the western parts of North America.<ref name=\"Citizen\"/>\n\nAs in the eastern U.S.,  numerous cougar sightings have been  reported by Canadians in [[Ontario]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/><ref name=\"Citizen\"/> [[Quebec]],<ref name=\"Citizen\"/> [[New Brunswick]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Nova Scotia]],<ref name=\"Citizen\"/><ref name=w5/><ref name=w6/><ref name=w7/><ref name=w8/> and [[Newfoundland]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/west-coast-hunters-aim-to-capture-cat-on-camera-cougar-1.4410930 | title=Newfoundland west coasters set up motion activated camera near Deer Lake in hopes of spotting cougar &#124; CBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe privately run Ontario Puma Foundation estimates that 550 pumas are in the province and their numbers are increasing steadily to a sustainable population.<ref name=w9/> However, no evidence of breeding has been documented east of Saskatchewan.<ref>Klandagi/Cougar Rewilding Foundation: Correspondence with Manitoba/Saskatchewan biologists, March/2017</ref>\n\n===Extinction recognized===\nIn 2011, the FWS opened an extensive review into the status of the eastern cougar. In 2015, the agency determined the eastern cougar no longer warranted protection under the Endangered Species Act and planned to de-list it. On January 22, 2018 the de-listing became final and they were officially declared extinct.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cougars/eastern-u-s-cougar-declared-extinct-80-years-after-last-sighting-idUSKBN1FC06Z |title=Eastern U.S. cougar declared extinct 80 years after last sighting |newspaper=Reuters |author=Laura Zuckerman |date=January 23, 2018 |accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref> According to the Center for Biological Diversity, \"The eastern cougar was extinct well before it was protected under the Endangered Species Act, as was the case with eight of the other 10 species that have been de-listed for extinction.\"<ref name=\"CBD\"/>\n\n==Genetic study==\nIn 2015, a group of students and scholars at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] formed a research group to sequence the mitochondrial DNA genome of this extinct subspecies.<ref name=\"wsjgenome\" /> The [[Nittany Lion]] genome project took samples from preserved eastern cougar skins to obtain DNA for sequencing and further analysis. Complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequences were obtained for five of the six individuals sampled, and the results were compared to previously published cougar sequences. The researchers found that \"Nittany Lions are not more similar to each other than to individuals from the Western U.S. and Florida\", which only strengthens the position that all North American cougars are a single subspecies.<ref>{{cite biorxiv|last1=Evanitsky|first1=Maya N.|last2=George|first2=Richard J.|last3=Johnson|first3=Stephen|last4=Dowell|first4=Stephanie|last5=Perry|first5=George

The eastern cougar was first assigned to the subspecies ''Felis concolor couguar'' and the [[Florida panther]] to ''F. c. coryi''.<ref name=r1/> Young and Goldman based their description of the eastern subspecies on their examination of eight of the existing 26 historic specimens.<ref name=r5/>\n\nIn 1955, Jackson described a new subspecies, the Wisconsin puma (''F. c. schorgeri''), from a small sample of skulls.<ref name=r6/>\n\nA 1981 taxonomy by Hall accepted ''F. c. schorgeri'', the Wisconsin puma, and also extended the range of the eastern puma into Nova Scotia and mapped the [[Florida panther]]'s (''F. c. coryi'') range as far north as South Carolina and southwestern Tennessee.<ref>Hall, E.R. (1981). ''The Mammals of North America, Second edition.'' John Wiley and Sons, New York.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Culver et al., recommended that based on recent genetic research, all [[North American cougar]]s be classified as a single subspecies, ''Puma concolor couguar'' following the oldest named subspecies (Kerr<ref name=r1/> in 1792).<ref name=\"Culver, M. 2000\"/>\n\nThe 2005 edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]''<ref name=msw3/> followed Culver's recommendations. This revision was made by Dr. W. Chris Wozencraft of Bethel University, Indiana, as the sole reviewer. However, the publication's Web site as of 2011, as well as that of its affiliate, the [[Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]], continued to maintain the ''Puma concolor couguar'' (both western and eastern cougars) as a subspecies of ''Puma concolor''.<ref name=msw3>[http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?s=y&id=14000204 ''Puma concolor''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521172614/http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?s=y&id=14000204 |date=2011-05-21 }}.

The federal government of Canada has taken no position on the subspecies' existence, continued or otherwise, and terms the evidence \"inconclusive.\"<ref name=\"gazette\"/>\n\nThe FWS reviewed all available research and other information, and concluded in 2011 that the eastern cougar has been extinct since the 1930s, and recommended that it be removed from [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|its list of endangered species]].<ref name=\"usfaws11\"/> The agency used the 1946 taxonomy of S.P. Young and E.A. Goldman in defining the eastern cougar subspecies. While noting that some taxonomists in recent years have classified all North American cougars within a single subspecies, the agency's 2011 report said, \"a full taxonomic analysis is necessary to conclude that a revision to the Young and Goldman (1946) taxonomy is warranted.\"<ref name=r1/>\n\nThe agency acknowledged the occasional presence of cougars in eastern North America, but believes these are of wanderers from western breeding ranges or escaped captives. Its review expressed skepticism that breeding populations exist north of Florida, noting, among other things, the lack of consistent road kill evidence comparable to known cougar ranges. However, the presence of cougars in the wild \u2014 whatever their [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] or origin \u2014 in eastern North America continues to be controversial.<ref name=\"barringer\"/>\n\nVarious residents of eastern North America, especially in rural regions, have reported as many as 10,000 cougar sightings since the 1960s,<ref name=r2/> and many continue to believe the subspecies has survived.<ref name=\"barringer\"/>\n\nBruce Wright \u2014 a wildlife biologist and former student of [[Aldo Leopold]] \u2014 popularized the idea that a breeding population of cougars persisted in northern New England and the Maritime provinces through a series of articles and books published between 1960 and 1973. Wright based his idea mostly on unconfirmed sightings, track photos, and plaster casts, and photographs of pumas killed in New Brunswick in 1932 and in Maine in 1938.<ref>Bolgiano, C. (1995).

Stackpole Books, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, {{ISBN|0811710440}}.</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s, privately run groups have formed in nearly every state to compile and investigate records of cougar sightings. Many of these groups are convinced that breeding populations of cougars exist throughout the region. Some believe that a conspiracy to hide information or secretly reintroduce cougars is actively underway by state and federal governments. Some endeavor to promote the recovery of cougars in eastern North America.<ref name=r2/> Large numbers of cougar sightings have been reliably reported throughout the Midwest.<ref name=w10/>\n\n===Possible colonization of the east by western cougars===\nAt least several dozen or more reported sightings have been confirmed by biologists, many of whom believe they are accounted for by escaped captives or individual members of the western subspecies that have wandered hundreds of miles from their established breeding ranges in the Dakotas or elsewhere in the west.<ref name=\"Baron\"/>\n\nEastern U.S. reported sightings, many of which reviewed in the recent federal report,<ref name=\"cnn11\"/> in various locations, including [[Michigan]]<ref name=\"Johnson\"/><ref name=\"Tribune\"/><ref name=\"Bolgiano\"/><ref name=\"Butz\"/> (See [[Upper Peninsula]]), [[Wisconsin]],<ref name=w1/><ref name=w2/> [[Southern Indiana]], [[Illinois]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Missouri]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/><ref name=w3/> [[Kentucky]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Connecticut]],<ref name=\"Baron\"/><ref name=w11/> [[New York (state)|New York]]<ref name=\"New York\"/> [[Maine]],<ref name= \"Bangor\"/> [[Pennsylvania]],<ref name=\"Pennsylvania\"/> [[Massachusetts]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[New Hampshire]],<ref name=\"Hampshire\"/> [[North Carolina]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Virginia]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Arkansas]],<ref name=\"southeast\"/> [[Vermont]],<ref name=\"biofortean\"/> [[Alabama]]<ref name=\"southeast\"/> [[Louisiana]],<ref name=\"southeast\"/><ref name=\"southeast2\"/> and [[Tennessee]].<ref name=\"Tennessee\">[http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/field-notes/tennessee-officials-confirm-first-cougar-sighting-in-100-years Tennessee Officials Confirm First Cougar Sighting in 100 Years], Field & Stream</ref>\n\nUntil around 1990, reports of mountain lions in the Midwest and East were highly influenced by the \"[[Bigfoot]] factor\", according to Mark Dowling, co-founder of the Eastern Cougar Network. \"None of it was really real\", he said in an interview,<ref name=insight/> but the situation has changed dramatically since that time according to Dowling, whose group collects and disseminates data on the shifting mountain lion population.<ref name=insight>{{cite journal |journal=Insight on the News |title=Mountain Lions Headed for Atlantic City?|date= August 5, 2003 |volume=19 |issue=#17 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nDowling said in 2003 that sightings in the eastern half of the nation, including Michigan, etc., were \"almost certainly\" escaped captives, but he added that the notion that (western) cougars \"will eventually reach New Jersey\" is a reasonable prediction, in part due to increased populations of [[white-tailed deer]].<ref name=insight/>\n\nHowever, some of these cougars found far in the east were established to be of western origin. As noted in an opinion piece by David Baron in the ''New York Times'', concerning a cougar killed by a car in Connecticut in 2011:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Wildlife officials, who at first assumed the cat was a captive animal that had escaped its owners, examined its DNA and concluded that it was a wild cougar from the Black Hills of South Dakota. It had wandered at least 1,500 miles before meeting its end at the front of an SUV in Connecticut.\"<ref name=\"Baron\" /></blockquote>\n\nRecolonization is entirely dependent upon dispersing subadult females, who typically range far less than subadult males. While subadult females with Black Hills DNA have been documented since 2015 in Tennessee, Missouri and Iowa, as of 2018, the easternmost breeding colony north of Florida is the Niobrara River Valley in central Nebraska.<ref>Nebraska Game & Parks: http://outdoornebraska.gov/mountainlions/</ref>\n\n===Canadian views===\nA 1998 study for Canada's national [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] concluded \"that there is no objective evidence (actual cougar specimens or other unequivocal confirmation) for the continuous presence of cougars since the last century anywhere in eastern Canada or the eastern United States outside of Florida.\"<ref>Scott, F.W.

Complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequences were obtained for five of the six individuals sampled, and the results were compared to previously published cougar sequences. The researchers found that \"Nittany Lions are not more similar to each other than to individuals from the Western U.S. and Florida\", which only strengthens the position that all North American

It appeared during the Ottoman period and was a captaincy of [[Principality of Montenegro]] in the 19th century. Today, it forms part of northeastern [[Podgorica Municipality]]. In Montenegro, the majority of people who trace their origin in Bratono\u017ei\u0107i identify as Christian Orthodox [[Montenegrins]] and a part identify as Christian Orthodox [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]]. Brotherhoods (''bratstvo'') from the historical tribe that settled in [[Bijelo Polje Municipality|Bijelo Polje]] and became Muslims in the Ottoman period identify as [[Bosniaks]]. In the 18th century, many families from the region settled in western Serbia. In [[Kosovo]], a part of the Serbs of western Kosovo come from Bratono\u017ei\u0107i. The best known descendant of the Bratono\u017ei\u0107i tribe is Prince [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I of Serbia]], founder of the [[House of Obrenovi\u0107]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe Bratono\u017ei\u0107i tribal region is rugged, hilly area at an altitude which ranges from 400 to 450m. It is situated between the [[Mora\u010da river]], [[Mala Rijeka]] and [[Crna Planina]]; it borders the tribes of [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north, [[Rov\u010dani]] to the northwest, [[Ku\u010di]] to the east and south, and [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] to the west. The region ends after Mala Rijeka pours into the Mora\u010da, near the settlement of Mrke, about 13km to the northeast of Podgorica. With the exception of Mrke, most of the other settlements (Klopot, Pelev Brijeg, Duga) of Bratono\u017ei\u0107i are semi-deserted or completely abandoned as their inhabitants moved to Podgorica. As of 2011, Mrke had 207 residents. 118 identify as Montenegrins, 60 as Serbs, 25 chose not to declare any ethnicity.<ref name=\"monstat\">{{cite web |title=Census 2011 data - Montenegro |url=https://www.monstat.org/eng/page.php?id=395&pageid=57|website=Monstat |publisher=Statistical Office of Montenegro |accessdate=15 February 2020 |ref=monstat}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn a Venetian document dating to 1455, ''Banovichi'' is mentioned as one of the villages of Upper Zeta;

It appeared during the Ottoman period and was a captaincy of [[Principality of Montenegro]] in the 19th century. Today, it forms part of northeastern [[Podgorica Municipality]]. The majority of people who trace their origin in Bratono\u017ei\u0107i identify as Christian Orthodox [[Montenegrins]] and a part identify as Christian Orthodox [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]]. Brotherhoods (''bratstvo'') from the historical tribe that settled in [[Bijelo Polje Municipality|Bijelo Polje]] and became Muslims in the Ottoman period identify as [[Bosniaks]]. In the 18th century, many families from the region settled in western Serbia. In [[Kosovo]], a part of the Serbs of western Kosovo come from Bratono\u017ei\u0107i. The best known descendant of the Bratono\u017ei\u0107i tribe is Prince [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I of Serbia]], founder of the [[House of Obrenovi\u0107]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe Bratono\u017ei\u0107i tribal region is rugged, hilly area at an altitude which ranges from 400 to 450m. It is situated between the [[Mora\u010da river]], [[Mala Rijeka]] and [[Crna Planina]]; it borders the tribes of [[Vasojevi\u0107i]] to the north, [[Rov\u010dani]] to the northwest, [[Ku\u010di]] to the east and south, and [[Piperi (tribe)|Piperi]] to the west. The region ends after Mala Rijeka pours into the Mora\u010da, near the settlement of Mrke, about 13km to the northeast of Podgorica. With the exception of Mrke, most of the other settlements (Klopot, Pelev Brijeg, Duga) of Bratono\u017ei\u0107i are semi-deserted or completely abandoned as their inhabitants moved to Podgorica. As of 2011, Mrke had 207 residents. 118 identify as Montenegrins, 60 as Serbs, 25 chose not to declare any ethnicity.<ref name=\"monstat\">{{cite web |title=Census 2011 data - Montenegro |url=https://www.monstat.org/eng/page.php?id=395&pageid=57|website=Monstat |publisher=Statistical Office of Montenegro |accessdate=15 February 2020 |ref=monstat}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn a Venetian document dating to 1455, ''Banovichi'' is mentioned as one of the villages of Upper Zeta;

These first colonists were captained by Jo\u00e3o Soares, native of [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], who settled in the area of [[Lajedo (Lajes das Flores)|Lajedo]].\n\nFaj\u00e3zinha was de-annexed from [[Lajes das Flores]] in July 1676, by provision of the bishop of Angra, friar D. Louren\u00e7o de Castro. The parish of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios das Faj\u00e3s was established, with a jurisdiction that included the western coast from Ponta da  Faj\u00e3 until Mosteiro. It is the fourth oldest religious parish on the island.\n\nOne of the first stories from Faj\u00e3zinha was in 1789, by a judge, Jos\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves da Silva, who referred to the construction of a stone bridge over the Ribeira Grande. It was a formidable construction for the era. It became historically referred to as ''a ponte da m\u00e1 mem\u00f3ria'' (''the bridge of bad memories''); as Father Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es would relate:\n:''[There was a flood in 1794] that did not just destroy the bridge, but not as much as a small vestige, no remains, it disappeared from the rivers course, disappearing into the sea, leaving a large sandy debris field to a distance of 300 [[bra\u00e7a]]s [{{Convert|660|m|disp=comma}}], with unmeasurable loss for the farmers who had lands along the river's banks, and whom to the sea lost all.''\n\nAdministratively, Faj\u00e3zinha has always been an administrative division of [[Lajes das Flores]]. Between 1895 and 1898, it was de-annexed from Lajes and incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of [[Santa Cruz das Flores]]. Since 1616 it was the religious center of the parish of the Faj\u00e3s, a Catholic organ whose principal patron was Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios, that included Ponta, Faj\u00e3 Grande, Caldeira and Mosteiro. But by 1850, Mosteiro and Caldeira become their own parishes, and in 1861, [[Faj\u00e3 Grande]] and [[Ponta Delgada (Santa Cruz das Flores)|Ponta Delgada das Flores]], received the same privilege.\n\n===20th century===\nOn 3 December 2010, around 5:00 am, following 72 consecutive hours of rain, a mudslide hit the town, causing severe destruction.<ref name=DAzores>{{cite web|title=Grande derrocada na Faj\u00e3zinha, ilhas das Flores|editor=Di\u00e1rio dos A\u00e7ores|url=http://www.ilhadasflores.com/the-news/69-grande-derrocada-na-fajazinha-ilha-das-flores.html|date=3 December 2010|accessdate=29 December 2010|language=Portuguese}}</ref> During the event, homes were inundated, while cars and property were dragged away by a river of mud, water, vegetation and refuse from the village.<ref name=DAzores /> At about 11:50&nbsp;a.m., as the showers dissipated, the extent of the damage was made evident: the ''junta de freguesia'' ({{lang-pt|parish offices}}), main access to the hamlet, and electricity were cut off (although EDA, the local utility, was able to put the village on generators quickly).<ref name=DAzores /> As some villagers congregated in the primary school and local church, some were immediately evacuated to the tourist village of Cuada to the south of parish.<ref name=DAzores />\n\nOn 13 June 2012, the ''Secretaria Regional da Ci\u00eancia, Tecnologia e Equipamentos'' (''Regional Secretariat for Science, Technology and Equipment'') awarded the contract for construction of two retaining walls, construction of ditches and new paving of the parish to Tecnovia A\u00e7ores, S.A. in order to improve access to the region following the mudslides.<ref>{{citation|title=Governo refor\u00e7a acessibilidade e seguran\u00e7a no acesso \u00e0 Faj\u00e3zinha, nas Flores |url=http://www.azores.gov.pt/Portal/pt/entidades/pgra-gacs/noticias/Governo+refor%C3%A7a+acessibilidade+e+seguran%C3%A7a+no+acesso+%C3%A0+Faj%C3%A3zinha+nas+Flores.htm |publisher=Governo Regional dos A\u00e7ores/GaCS/VS |location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal |language=Portuguese |date=23 August 2012 |editor=Presid\u00eancia dos A\u00e7ores }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Azoren Flores Fajazinha 2.jpg|235px|left|thumb|The valley of Fajazinha, bounded in the west by the Atlantic and surrounded by the cliffs on the remaining sides]]\nThe parish is located on the west coast of the Flores, south of the Faj\u00e3 Grande, and extends through an irregular plain that includes four crater-lakes: ''Lagoa Funda'' (''Deep Lake'', which is {{Convert|108|m}} deep), ''Lagoa Comprida'' (''Long Lake''), ''Lagoa Branca'' (''White Lake''), and ''Lagoa Seca'' (Dry Lake).  It is an area of many peat-bogs, and forests of endemic plants, including the ''cedro-do-mato'' ([[Juniperus brevifolia|Azorean juniper]]), used by local artisans. Nearby is the waterfall, [[Cascata da Ribeira Grande]].\n\nFaj\u00e3zinha is intersected by the Ribeira Grande, a major river/rapids on the island, which, apart from its crystalline waters, is known for its innumerable floods.  Father [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es]], in his work '''''Roteiro Exacto da Costa da Ilha''''', mentions the following:\n:''Passing that population you will encounter Ribeira Grande, which divides this parish...its exaggerated force and impetuousness, which is truly great. The waters fall from a formidable height, extreme in the parish of Faj\u00e3zinha, from a height of 200 bra\u00e7as [{{Convert|440|m|disp=comma}}] it falls; it incorporates and aggregates all the waters of the headlands, which demarcate the parish, from the east to southwest, which is the river-valley of the blacksmiths, four grottoes, without name in the Rocha do Velho, the grotto do Enchente, whose waters increase in volume and become furious in the winter, and also when there is rain in the summer, its invariable.''\n\nThe region is a natural jewel, that  Jo\u00e3o Vieira wrote:\n:''\u201cAlong the difficult, the hand of  man, with much sweat, constructed a church  and houses, opened a road  where heavy trucks cross, means of communication with the rest of the  island.  It's an admirable example of the implantation in the land and  harmony with  nature.  Seen from above, the houses, maybe because of  jealousy, run to the seas, accompanying Ribeira Grande, which has for four centuries have filled the navigable waters that crossed between the  Old and New World.  Between cereal fields of corn that circle the white  homes, a road of black asphalt serpentine between greenery.  If a  biblical paradise existed by the sea...we could think that this corner  was part of it...''\n\nThe [[2011 Lorca earthquake]] was responsible for creating a special wetland around the coast of Fajazinha. Baptized the ''Lagoa do Rolo'', it has become the most westerly lake in Europe, although it is considerably small, spawning a small habitat for migrating birds from North America, during the fall (including the [[hawfinch]] and the [[hooded merganser]]).<ref>{{citation|first=Rui Jorge|last=Cabral|date=17 February 2011|language=Portuguese|title=Derrocada criou nova lagoa nas Flores que \u00e9 santu\u00e1rio para aves|publisher=A\u00e7oreano Oriental|location=Ponta Delgada, Portugal}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n===Civic===\n* Haylofts of Ramal ({{lang-pt|Palheiros ao Ramal da Faj\u00e3 Grande}}), a series of two-storey basalt buildings used for the collection of hay and stores for the winter months;\n* Watermill of Ribeira da Alagoa ({{lang-pt|Moinho de \u00c1gua de Ribeira da Alagoa}}), a 19th-century watermill consisting of an \"L\"-shape structure that served as home and workplace for a corn miller, today used as museological pole to perpetuate agricultural history.\n\n===Religious===\n* [[Church of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios (Faj\u00e3zinha)|Church of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios]] ({{lang-pt|Igreja de Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios}}), triple nave structure constructed through the dedication of Father Alexandre Mesquito, and later supported by contributions of its parishioners (resulting in the addition of the belltower).\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |last=Cam\u00f5es |first=J.A. |contribution=Roteiro Exacto da Costa da Ilha |editor-first=Jos\u00e9 Arlindo Armas |editor-last=Trigueiro |title=Padre Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es: Obras | publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal das Lajes das Flores |year=2006 |language=Portuguese}}\n* {{citation |last=Vieira |first=J. |title=Vigens na Nossa Terra |editor=C\u00e2mara Municipal |publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal das Lajes das Flores |language=Portuguese |year=2014}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fajazinha}}\n[[Category:Parishes of Lajes das Flores]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the village in Cape Verde|Faj\u00e3zinha, Cape Verde}}\n{{Infobox Portuguese subdivision\n| type                    = parish\n| name                    = Faj\u00e3zinha\n| image_skyline           = Azoren Flores Fajazinha 1.jpg\n| image_caption           = The central square of Faj\u00e3zinha, with the Church of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios along the roadway, and the Ladeira do Picado in the background\n| image_flag              = \n| image_shield            = \n| region                  = Azores\n| island                  = [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]\n| municipality            = [[Lajes das Flores]]\n| coordinates             = {{coord|39|26|1|N|31|15|9|W|display=inline,title}}\n| established_date        = Parish: July 1676<br>Civil parish: 28 November 1684\n| area_total_km2          = 6.16\n| elevation_m             = 90\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_total        = 76\n| postal_code             = 9960-440\n| area_code               = 292 \n| patron                  = [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios]]\n| website                 = {{url|http://www.cmlajesflores.com/fajazinha/fajazinha.htm|www.cmlajesflores.com}}\n<!-- | footnotes               = Geographic detail from CAOP (2010)<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/cadastro/caop/download/Areas_Freg_Mun_Dist_CAOP2010.zip |title=Carta Administrativa Oficial de Portugal |publisher=Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Portugu\u00eas |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |accessdate=1 July 2011 |year=2010 |editor=IGP |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521174146/http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/cadastro/caop/download/Areas_Freg_Mun_Dist_CAOP2010.zip |archivedate=21 May 2011 }}</ref> produced by Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Portugu\u00eas (IGP) -->\n}}\n'''Faj\u00e3zinha''' is a [[freguesia|civil parish]] in the [[concelho|municipality]] of [[Lajes das Flores]] located {{convert|15|km|mi}} from the main town of [[Lajes das Flores]], on the western coast of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] island of [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]].

Louren\u00e7o de Castro. The parish of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios das Faj\u00e3s was established, with a jurisdiction that included the western coast from Ponta da  Faj\u00e3 until Mosteiro. It is the fourth oldest religious parish on the island.\n\nOne of the first stories from Faj\u00e3zinha was in 1789, by a judge, Jos\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves da Silva, who referred to the construction of a stone bridge over the Ribeira Grande. It was a formidable construction for the era. It became historically referred to as ''a ponte da m\u00e1 mem\u00f3ria'' (''the bridge of bad memories''); as Father Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es would relate:\n:''[There was a flood in 1794] that did not just destroy the bridge, but not as much as a small vestige, no remains, it disappeared from the rivers course, disappearing into the sea, leaving a large sandy debris field to a distance of 300 [[bra\u00e7a]]s [{{Convert|660|m|disp=comma}}], with unmeasurable loss for the farmers who had lands along the river's banks, and whom to the sea lost all.''\n\nAdministratively, Faj\u00e3zinha has always been an administrative division of [[Lajes das Flores]]. Between 1895 and 1898, it was de-annexed from Lajes and incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of [[Santa Cruz das Flores]]. Since 1616 it was the religious center of the parish of the Faj\u00e3s, a Catholic organ whose principal patron was Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios, that included Ponta, Faj\u00e3 Grande, Caldeira and Mosteiro. But by 1850, Mosteiro and Caldeira become their own parishes, and in 1861, [[Faj\u00e3 Grande]] and [[Ponta Delgada (Santa Cruz das Flores)|Ponta Delgada das Flores]], received the same privilege.\n\n===20th century===\nOn 3 December 2010, around 5:00 am, following 72 consecutive hours of rain, a mudslide hit the town, causing severe destruction.<ref name=DAzores>{{cite web|title=Grande derrocada na Faj\u00e3zinha, ilhas das Flores|editor=Di\u00e1rio dos A\u00e7ores|url=http://www.ilhadasflores.com/the-news/69-grande-derrocada-na-fajazinha-ilha-das-flores.html|date=3 December 2010|accessdate=29 December 2010|language=Portuguese}}</ref> During the event, homes were inundated, while cars and property were dragged away by a river of mud, water, vegetation and refuse from the village.<ref name=DAzores /> At about 11:50&nbsp;a.m., as the showers dissipated, the extent of the damage was made evident: the ''junta de freguesia'' ({{lang-pt|parish offices}}), main access to the hamlet, and electricity were cut off (although EDA, the local utility, was able to put the village on generators quickly).<ref name=DAzores /> As some villagers congregated in the primary school and local church, some were immediately evacuated to the tourist village of Cuada to the south of parish.<ref name=DAzores />\n\nOn 13 June 2012, the ''Secretaria Regional da Ci\u00eancia, Tecnologia e Equipamentos'' (''Regional Secretariat for Science, Technology and Equipment'') awarded the contract for construction of two retaining walls, construction of ditches and new paving of the parish to Tecnovia A\u00e7ores, S.A. in order to improve access to the region following the mudslides.<ref>{{citation|title=Governo refor\u00e7a acessibilidade e seguran\u00e7a no acesso \u00e0 Faj\u00e3zinha, nas Flores |url=http://www.azores.gov.pt/Portal/pt/entidades/pgra-gacs/noticias/Governo+refor%C3%A7a+acessibilidade+e+seguran%C3%A7a+no+acesso+%C3%A0+Faj%C3%A3zinha+nas+Flores.htm |publisher=Governo Regional dos A\u00e7ores/GaCS/VS |location=Ponta Delgada (Azores), Portugal |language=Portuguese |date=23 August 2012 |editor=Presid\u00eancia dos A\u00e7ores }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Azoren Flores Fajazinha 2.jpg|235px|left|thumb|The valley of Fajazinha, bounded in the west by the Atlantic and surrounded by the cliffs on the remaining sides]]\nThe parish is located on the west coast of the Flores, south of the Faj\u00e3 Grande, and extends through an irregular plain that includes four crater-lakes: ''Lagoa Funda'' (''Deep Lake'', which is {{Convert|108|m}} deep), ''Lagoa Comprida'' (''Long Lake''), ''Lagoa Branca'' (''White Lake''), and ''Lagoa Seca'' (Dry Lake).  It is an area of many peat-bogs, and forests of endemic plants, including the ''cedro-do-mato'' ([[Juniperus brevifolia|Azorean juniper]]), used by local artisans. Nearby is the waterfall, [[Cascata da Ribeira Grande]].\n\nFaj\u00e3zinha is intersected by the Ribeira Grande, a major river/rapids on the island, which, apart from its crystalline waters, is known for its innumerable floods.  Father [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es]], in his work '''''Roteiro Exacto da Costa da Ilha''''', mentions the following:\n:''Passing that population you will encounter Ribeira Grande, which divides this parish...its exaggerated force and impetuousness, which is truly great. The waters fall from a formidable height, extreme in the parish of Faj\u00e3zinha, from a height of 200 bra\u00e7as [{{Convert|440|m|disp=comma}}] it falls; it incorporates and aggregates all the waters of the headlands, which demarcate the parish, from the east to southwest, which is the river-valley of the blacksmiths, four grottoes, without name in the Rocha do Velho, the grotto do Enchente, whose waters increase in volume and become furious in the winter, and also when there is rain in the summer, its invariable.''\n\nThe region is a natural jewel, that  Jo\u00e3o Vieira wrote:\n:''\u201cAlong the difficult, the hand of  man, with much sweat, constructed a church  and houses, opened a road  where heavy trucks cross, means of communication with the rest of the  island.  It's an admirable example of the implantation in the land and  harmony with  nature.  Seen from above, the houses, maybe because of  jealousy, run to the seas, accompanying Ribeira Grande, which has for four centuries have filled the navigable waters that crossed between the  Old and New World.  Between cereal fields of corn that circle the white  homes, a road of black asphalt serpentine between greenery.  If a  biblical paradise existed by the sea...we could think that this corner  was part of it...''\n\nThe [[2011 Lorca earthquake]] was responsible for creating a special wetland around the coast of Fajazinha. Baptized the ''Lagoa do Rolo'', it has become the most westerly lake in Europe, although it is considerably small, spawning a small habitat for migrating birds from North America, during the fall (including the [[hawfinch]] and the [[hooded merganser]]).<ref>{{citation|first=Rui Jorge|last=Cabral|date=17 February 2011|language=Portuguese|title=Derrocada criou nova lagoa nas Flores que \u00e9 santu\u00e1rio para aves|publisher=A\u00e7oreano Oriental|location=Ponta Delgada, Portugal}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n===Civic===\n* Haylofts of Ramal ({{lang-pt|Palheiros ao Ramal da Faj\u00e3 Grande}}), a series of two-storey basalt buildings used for the collection of hay and stores for the winter months;\n* Watermill of Ribeira da Alagoa ({{lang-pt|Moinho de \u00c1gua de Ribeira da Alagoa}}), a 19th-century watermill consisting of an \"L\"-shape structure that served as home and workplace for a corn miller, today used as museological pole to perpetuate agricultural history.\n\n===Religious===\n* [[Church of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios (Faj\u00e3zinha)|Church of Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios]] ({{lang-pt|Igreja de Nossa Senhora dos Rem\u00e9dios}}), triple nave structure constructed through the dedication of Father Alexandre Mesquito, and later supported by contributions of its parishioners (resulting in the addition of the belltower).\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{citation |last=Cam\u00f5es |first=J.A. |contribution=Roteiro Exacto da Costa da Ilha |editor-first=Jos\u00e9 Arlindo Armas |editor-last=Trigueiro |title=Padre Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio Cam\u00f5es: Obras | publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal das Lajes das Flores |year=2006 |language=Portuguese}}\n* {{citation |last=Vieira |first=J. |title=Vigens na Nossa Terra |editor=C\u00e2mara Municipal |publisher=C\u00e2mara Municipal das Lajes das Flores |language=Portuguese |year=2014}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fajazinha}}\n[[Category:Parishes of Lajes das Flores]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSources:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faj%C3%A3zinha"}

In this application it is referred to as '''Interior Border Gateway Protocol''', '''Internal BGP''', or '''iBGP'''. In contrast, the Internet application of the protocol may be referred to as '''Exterior Border Gateway Protocol''', '''External BGP''', or '''eBGP'''.\n\nA [[#512k day|Y2K-like overflow]] (512k day) triggered in 2014 for those models that were not appropriately updated.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Border Gateway Protocol has been in use on the Internet since 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://datapath.io/resources/blog/the-history-of-border-gateway-protocol/|title=The History of Border Gateway Protocol|work=blog.datapath.io}}</ref> The current version of BGP is version 4 (BGP4), which was published as RFC 4271 in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271|title=RFC 4271 - A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)|work=ietf.org}}</ref> after progressing through 20 drafts from documents based on RFC 1771 version 4. RFC 4271 corrected errors, clarified ambiguities and updated the specification with common industry practices. The major enhancement was the support for [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) and use of [[route aggregation]] to decrease the size of [[routing table]]s.\n\n[[IPv6]] BGP was first defined in RFC 1883 in 1995, and it was improved to RFC 2283 in 1998. The new RFC allows BGP4 to carry a wide range of [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] \"address families\". It is also called the Multiprotocol Extensions which is Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP).\n\n== Operation ==\n\nBGP neighbors, called peers, are established by manual configuration among [[Router (computing)|router]]s to create a [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] session on [[port (computer networking)|port]] 179. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte keep-alive messages every 60 seconds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/ip/routing/bgp/operation/messages/keepalives.shtml|title=BGP Keepalive Messages |work= InetDaemon's IT Tutorials }}</ref> to maintain the connection.<ref>RFC 4274</ref> Among routing protocols, BGP is unique in using TCP as its transport protocol.\n\nWhen BGP runs between two peers in the same [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS), it is referred to as ''Internal BGP'' (''i-BGP'' or ''Interior Border Gateway Protocol''). When it runs between different autonomous systems, it is called ''External BGP'' (''eBGP'' or ''Exterior Border Gateway Protocol''). Routers on the boundary of one AS exchanging information with another AS are called ''border'' or ''edge routers'' or simply ''eBGP peers'' and are typically connected directly, while ''i-BGP peers'' can be interconnected through other intermediate routers. Other deployment [[Network topology|topologies]] are also possible, such as running eBGP peering inside a [[VPN]] tunnel, allowing two remote sites to exchange routing information in a secure and isolated manner. The main difference between iBGP and eBGP peering is in the way routes that were received from one peer are propagated to other peers. For instance, new routes learned from an eBGP peer are typically redistributed to all iBGP peers as well as all other eBGP peers (if ''transit'' mode is enabled on the router). However, if new routes are learned on an iBGP peering, then they are re-advertised only to all eBGP peers. These route-propagation rules effectively require that all iBGP peers inside an AS are interconnected in a full mesh.\n\nHow routes are propagated can be controlled in detail via the ''route-maps'' mechanism. This mechanism consists of a set of rules. Each rule describes, for routes matching some given criteria, what action should be taken. The action could be to drop the route, or it could be to modify some attributes of the route before inserting it in the [[routing table]].\n\n=== Extensions negotiation ===\n[[File:BGP FSM.svg|thumb|BGP state machine]]\n\nDuring the peering handshake, when OPEN messages are exchanged, BGP speakers can negotiate<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2842.txt Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4], RFC 2842, R. Chandra & J. Scudder, May 2000</ref> optional capabilities of the session, including [[Multiprotocol BGP|multiprotocol extensions]] and various recovery modes. If the multiprotocol extensions to BGP<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2858.txt Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4], RFC 2858, T. Bates ''et al.'', June 2000</ref> are negotiated at the time of creation, the BGP speaker can prefix the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) it advertises with an address family prefix. These families include the IPv4 (default), IPv6, IPv4/IPv6 Virtual Private Networks and multicast BGP. Increasingly, BGP is used as a generalized signaling protocol to carry information about routes that may not be part of the global Internet, such as VPNs.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2547.txt BGP/MPLS VPNs.], RFC 2547, E. Rosen and Y. Rekhter, April 2004</ref>\n\nIn order to make decisions in its operations with peers, a BGP peer uses a simple [[finite state machine]] (FSM) that consists of six states: Idle; Connect; Active; OpenSent; OpenConfirm; and Established. For each peer-to-peer session, a BGP implementation maintains a state variable that tracks which of these six states the session is in. The BGP defines the messages that each peer should exchange in order to change the session from one state to another. The first state is the \"Idle\" state. In the \"Idle\" state, BGP initializes all resources, refuses all inbound BGP connection attempts and initiates a TCP connection to the peer. The second state is \"Connect\". In the \"Connect\" state, the router waits for the TCP connection to complete and transitions to the \"OpenSent\" state if successful. If unsuccessful, it starts the ConnectRetry timer and transitions to the \"Active\" state upon expiration. In the \"Active\" state, the router resets the ConnectRetry timer to zero and returns to the \"Connect\" state. In the \"OpenSent\" state, the router sends an Open message and waits for one in return in order to transition to the \"OpenConfirm\" state. Keepalive messages are exchanged and, upon successful receipt, the router is placed into the \"Established\" state. In the \"Established\" state, the router can send/receive: Keepalive; Update; and Notification messages to/from its peer.\n\n* '''Idle State''':\n** Refuse all incoming BGP connections.\n** Start the initialization of event triggers.\n** Initiates a TCP connection with its configured BGP peer.\n** Listens for a TCP connection from its peer.\n** Changes its state to Connect.\n** If an error occurs at any state of the FSM process, the BGP session is terminated immediately and returned to the Idle state. Some of the reasons why a router does not progress from the Idle state are:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** Peer address configured incorrectly on either router.\n*** AS number configured incorrectly on either router.\n* '''Connect State''':\n** Waits for successful TCP negotiation with peer.\n** BGP does not spend much time in this state if the TCP session has been successfully established.\n** Sends Open message to peer and changes state to OpenSent.\n** If an error occurs, BGP moves to the Active state. Some reasons for the error are:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** Peer address configured incorrectly on either router.\n*** AS number configured incorrectly on either router.\n* '''Active State''':\n** If the router was unable to establish a successful TCP session, then it ends up in the Active state.\n** BGP FSM tries to restart another TCP session with the peer and, if successful, then it sends an Open message to the peer.\n** If it is unsuccessful again, the FSM is reset to the Idle state.\n** Repeated failures may result in a router cycling between the Idle and Active states. Some of the reasons for this include:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** BGP configuration error.\n*** Network congestion.\n*** Flapping network interface.\n* '''OpenSent State''':\n** BGP FSM listens for an Open message from its peer.\n** Once the message has been received, the router checks the validity of the Open message.\n** If there is an error it is because one of the fields in the Open message does not match between the peers, e.g., BGP version mismatch, the peering router expects a different My AS, etc. The router then sends a Notification message to the peer indicating why the error occurred.\n** If there is no error, a Keepalive message is sent, various timers are set and the state is changed to OpenConfirm.\n* '''OpenConfirm State''':\n** The peer is listening for a Keepalive message from its peer.\n** If a Keepalive message is received and no timer has expired before reception of the Keepalive, BGP transitions to the Established state.\n** If a timer expires before a Keepalive message is received, or if an error condition occurs, the router transitions back to the Idle state.\n* '''Established State''':\n** In this state, the peers send Update messages to exchange information about each route being advertised to the BGP peer.\n** If there is any error in the Update message then a Notification message is sent to the peer, and BGP transitions back to the Idle state.\n\n=== Router connectivity and learning routes ===\nIn the simplest arrangement, all routers within a single AS and participating in BGP routing must be configured in a full mesh: each router must be configured as peer to every other router. This causes scaling problems, since the number of required connections [[quadratic growth|grows quadratically]] with the number of routers involved. To alleviate the problem, BGP implements two options: [[route reflector]]s (RFC 4456) and [[BGP confederation]]s (RFC 5065). The following discussion of basic UPDATE processing assumes a full iBGP mesh.\n\nA given BGP router may accept Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) UPDATEs from multiple neighbors and advertise NLRI to the same, or a different set, of neighbors. Conceptually, BGP maintains its own \"master\" routing table, called the Local [[Routing Information Base]] (''Loc-RIB''), separate from the main routing table of the router. For each neighbor, the BGP process maintains a conceptual Adjacent Routing Information Base, Incoming (''Adj-RIB-In'') containing the NLRI received from the neighbor, and a conceptual ''Adj-RIB-Out'' (Outgoing) for NLRI to be sent to the neighbor.\n\n\"Conceptual\", in the preceding paragraph, means that the physical storage and structure of these various tables are decided by the implementer of the BGP code. Their structure is not visible to other BGP routers, although they usually can be interrogated with management commands on the local router. It is quite common, for example, to store the two Adj-RIBs and the Loc-RIB together in the same data structure, with additional information attached to the RIB entries. The additional information tells the BGP process such things as whether individual entries belong in the Adj-RIBs for specific neighbors, whether the peer-neighbor route selection process made received policies eligible for the Loc-RIB, and whether Loc-RIB entries are eligible to be submitted to the local router's routing table management process.\n\nBy ''eligible to be submitted'', BGP will submit the routes that it considers best to the main routing table process. Depending on the implementation of that process, the BGP route is not necessarily selected. For example, a directly connected prefix, learned from the router's own hardware, is usually most preferred. As long as that directly connected route's interface is active, the BGP route to the destination will not be put into the routing table. Once the interface goes down, and there are no more preferred routes, the Loc-RIB route would be installed in the main routing table.\nUntil recently, it was a common mistake to say ''BGP carries policies''. BGP actually carried the information with which rules inside BGP-speaking routers could make policy decisions. Some of the information carried that is explicitly intended to be used in policy decisions are communities and multi-exit discriminators (MED).\n\nThe BGP standard specifies a number of decision factors, more than the ones that are used by any other common routing process, for selecting NLRI to go into the Loc-RIB. The first decision point for evaluating NLRI is that its next-hop attribute must be reachable (or resolvable). Another way of saying the next-hop must be reachable is that there must be an active route, already in the main routing table of the router, to the prefix in which the next-hop address is reachable.\n\nNext, for each neighbor, the BGP process applies various standard and implementation-dependent criteria to decide which routes conceptually should go into the Adj-RIB-In. The neighbor could send several possible routes to a destination, but the first level of preference is at the neighbor level. Only one route to each destination will be installed in the conceptual Adj-RIB-In. This process will also delete, from the Adj-RIB-In, any routes that are withdrawn by the neighbor.\n\nWhenever a conceptual Adj-RIB-In changes, the main BGP process decides if any of the neighbor's new routes are preferred to routes already in the Loc-RIB. If so, it replaces them. If a given route is withdrawn by a neighbor, and there is no other route to that destination, the route is removed from the Loc-RIB, and no longer sent, by BGP, to the main routing table manager. If the router does not have a route to that destination from any non-BGP source, the withdrawn route will be removed from the main routing table.\n\nAfter verifying that the next hop is reachable, if the route comes from an internal (i.e. iBGP) peer, the first rule to apply, according to the standard, is to examine the LOCAL_PREFERENCE attribute. If there are several iBGP routes from the neighbor, the one with the highest LOCAL_PREFERENCE is selected unless there are several routes with the same LOCAL_PREFERENCE. In the latter case the route selection process moves to the next tie breaker. While LOCAL_PREFERENCE is the first rule in the standard, once reachability of the NEXT_HOP is verified, Cisco and several other vendors first consider a decision factor called WEIGHT which is local to the router (i.e. not transmitted by BGP). The route with the highest WEIGHT is preferred.\n\nThe LOCAL_PREFERENCE, WEIGHT, and other criteria can be manipulated by local configuration and software capabilities. Such manipulation is outside the scope of the standard but is commonly used. For example, the COMMUNITY attribute (see below) is not directly used by the BGP selection process. The BGP neighbor process however can have a rule to set LOCAL_PREFERENCE or another factor based on a manually programmed rule to set the attribute if the COMMUNITY value matches some pattern matching criterion. If the route was learned from an external peer the per-neighbor BGP process computes a LOCAL_PREFERENCE value from local policy rules and then compares the LOCAL_PREFERENCE of all routes from the neighbor.\n\nAt the per-neighbor level{{snd}} ignoring implementation-specific policy modifiers{{snd}} the order of tie breaking rules is:\n\n# Prefer the route with the shortest AS_PATH. An AS_PATH is the set of AS numbers that must be traversed to reach the advertised destination. AS1-AS2-AS3 is shorter than AS4-AS5-AS6-AS7.\n# Prefer routes with the lowest value of their ORIGIN attribute.\n# Prefer routes with the lowest MULTI_EXIT_DISC (multi-exit discriminator or MED) value.\n''Before the most recent edition of the BGP standard, if an UPDATE had no MULTI_EXIT_DISC value, several implementations created a MED with the highest possible value. The current standard however specifies that missing MEDs are to be treated as the lowest possible value. Since the current rule may cause different behavior than the vendor interpretations, BGP implementations that used the nonstandard default value have a configuration feature that allows the old or standard rule to be selected.''\n\nOnce candidate routes are received from neighbors, the Loc-RIB software applies additional tie-breakers to routes to the same destination.\n\n# If at least one route was learned from an external neighbor (i.e., the route was learned from eBGP), drop all routes learned from iBGP.\n# Prefer the route with the lowest interior cost to the NEXT_HOP, according to the main routing table. If two neighbors advertised the same route, but one neighbor is reachable via a low-bitrate link and the other by a high-bitrate link, and the interior routing protocol calculates lowest cost based on highest bitrate, the route through the high-bitrate link would be preferred and other routes dropped.\n''If there is more than one route still tied at this point, several BGP implementations offer a configurable option to load-share among the routes, accepting all (or all up to some number).''\n# Prefer the route learned from the BGP speaker with the numerically lowest BGP identifier\n# Prefer the route learned from the BGP speaker with the lowest peer IP address\n\n=== Communities ===\n\nBGP communities are attribute tags that can be applied to incoming or outgoing prefixes to achieve some common goal (RFC 1997). While it is common to say that BGP allows an administrator to set policies on how prefixes are handled by ISPs, this is generally not possible, strictly speaking. For instance, BGP natively has no concept to allow one AS to tell another AS to restrict advertisement of a prefix to only North American peering customers. Instead, an ISP generally publishes a list of well-known or proprietary communities with a description for each one, which essentially becomes an agreement of how prefixes are to be treated. RFC 1997 also defines three well-known communities that have global significance; NO_EXPORT, NO_ADVERTISE and NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED. RFC 7611 defines ACCEPT_OWN. Examples of common communities include local preference adjustments, geographic or peer type restrictions, DoS avoidance (black holing), and AS prepending options. An ISP might state that any routes received from customers with community XXX:500 will be advertised to all peers (default) while community XXX:501 will restrict advertisement to North America. The customer simply adjusts their configuration to include the correct community or communities for each route, and the ISP is responsible for controlling who the prefix is advertised to. The end user has no technical ability to enforce correct actions being taken by the ISP, though problems in this area are generally rare and accidental.\n\nIt is a common tactic for end customers to use BGP communities (usually ASN:70,80,90,100) to control the local preference the ISP assigns to advertised routes instead of using MED (the effect is similar). The community attribute is transitive, but communities applied by the customer very rarely become propagated outside the next-hop AS. Not all ISPs give out their communities to the public, while some other do.<ref>{{cite web|title=BGP Community Guides|url=http://www.onesc.net/communities/|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe BGP Extended Community Attribute was added in 2006, in order to extend the range of such attributes and to provide a community attribute structuring by means of a type field. The extended format consists of one or two octets for the type field followed by seven or six octets for the respective community attribute content. The definition of this Extended Community Attribute is documented in RFC 4360. The IANA administers the registry for BGP Extended Communities Types.<ref>[http://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-extended-communities IANA registry for BGP Extended Communities Types], IANA,2008</ref> The Extended Communities Attribute itself is a transitive optional BGP attribute. However, a bit in the type field within the attribute decides whether the encoded extended community is of a transitive or non-transitive nature. The IANA registry therefore provides different number ranges for the attribute types. Due to the extended attribute range, its usage can be manifold. RFC 4360 exemplarly{{typo help inline|reason=similar to exemplarily|date=December 2019}} defines the \"Two-Octet AS Specific Extended Community\", the \"IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community\", the \"Opaque Extended Community\", the \"Route Target Community\", and the \"Route Origin Community\". A number of BGP QoS drafts<ref>[http://www.bgp-qos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=6 IETF drafts on BGP signalled QoS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223214439/http://www.bgp-qos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=6 |date=2009-02-23 }}, Thomas Knoll,2008</ref> also use this Extended Community Attribute structure for inter-domain QoS signalling.\n\nNote: since RFC 7153, extended communities are compatible with 32 bits ASNs.\n\nWith the introduction of 32 bits AS numbers, some issues were immediately obvious with the community attribute that only defines a 16 bits ASN field, which prevents the matching between this field and the real ASN value. It is the reason why RFC 8092 and RFC 8195 introduce a [http://largebgpcommunities.net/ Large Community] attribute of 12 bytes, divided in three field of 4 bytes each (AS:function:parameter).\n\n=== Multi-exit discriminators ===\n\nMEDs, defined in the main BGP standard, were originally intended to show to another neighbor AS the advertising AS's preference as to which of several links are preferred for inbound traffic. Another application of MEDs is to advertise the value, typically based on delay, of multiple AS that have presence at an [[IXP]], that they impose to send traffic to some destination.\n\n=== Message header format ===\n\nThe following is the BGP version 4 message header format:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:4%;\"|bit offset\n! colspan=\"16\" style=\"width:50%;\"| 0\u201315\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"width:25%;\"| 16\u201323\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"width:25%;\"| 24\u201331\n|-\n! 0\n| rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"32\"| Marker\n|-\n! 32\n|-\n! 64\n|-\n! 96\n|-\n! 128\n| colspan=\"16\"| Length\n| colspan=\"8\"| Type\n| colspan=\"8\"|\n|}\n\n* '''Marker''': Included for compatibility, must be set to all ones.\n* '''Length''': Total length of the message in [[Octet (computing)|octets]], including the header.\n* '''Type''': Type of BGP message. The following values are defined:\n** Open (1)\n** Update (2)\n** Notification (3)\n** KeepAlive (4)\n** Route-Refresh (5)\n\n== Problems and mitigation ==\n{{criticism section|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Internal scalability ==\n\nAn autonomous system with internal BGP (iBGP) must have all of its iBGP peers connect to each other in a [[Complete graph|full mesh]] (where everyone speaks to everyone directly). This full-mesh configuration requires that each router maintain a session to every other router. In large networks, this number of sessions may degrade performance of routers, due to either a lack of memory, or high CPU process requirements.\n\n===Route reflectors===\n[[Route reflector]]s<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4456.txt BGP Route Reflection: An Alternative to Full Mesh Internal BGP (iBGP)], RFC 4456, T. Bates ''et al.'', April 2006</ref> reduce the number of connections required in an AS. A single router (or two for redundancy) can be made a route reflector: other routers in the AS need only be configured as peers to them. A route reflector offers an alternative to the logical full-mesh requirement of [[internal border gateway protocol]] (IBGP). A RR acts as a {{clarify span|focal point|date=October 2013}} for IBGP sessions. The purpose of the RR is concentration. Multiple BGP routers can peer with a central point, the RR \u2013 acting as a route reflector server \u2013 rather than peer with every other router in a full mesh. All the other IBGP routers become route reflector clients.\n\nThis approach, similar to [[OSPF]]'s DR/BDR feature, provides large networks with added IBGP scalability. In a fully meshed IBGP network of 10 routers, 90 individual CLI statements (spread throughout all routers in the topology) are needed just to define the remote-AS of each peer: this quickly becomes a headache to administer. A RR topology could cut these 90 statements down to 18, offering a viable solution for the larger networks administered by ISPs.\n\nA route reflector is a [[single point of failure]], therefore at least a second route reflector may be configured in order to provide redundancy. As it is an additional peer for the other 10 routers, it comes with the additional statement count to double that minus 2 of the single Route Reflector setup. An additional 11*2-2=20 statements in this case due to adding the additional Router. Additionally, in a BGP multipath Environment this also can benefit by adding local switching/Routing throughput if the RRs are acting as traditional Routers instead of just a dedicated Route Reflector Server role.\n\n====Rules====\n[[File:RR_BGP.svg|thumbnail|300px|A typical configuration of BGP Route Reflector deployment, as proposed by Section 6, RFC 4456.]]\nRR servers propagate routes inside the AS based on the following rules:\n* If a route is received from a non-client peer, reflect to clients only and EBGP peers.\n* If a route is received from a client peer, reflect to all non-client peers and also to client peers, except the originator of the route and reflect to EBGP peers.\n\n====Cluster====\nRR and its clients form a \"Cluster\". The \"Cluster-ID\" is then attached to every route advertised by RR to its client or nonclient peers. Cluster-ID is a cumulative, non-transitive BGP attribute and every RR MUST prepend the local CLUSTER_ID to the CLUSTER_LIST in order to avoid routing loops.\nRoute reflectors and confederations both reduce the number of iBGP peers to each router and thus reduce processing overhead. Route reflectors are a pure performance-enhancing technique, while confederations also can be used to implement more fine-grained policy.\n\n===BGP confederation===\nConfederations are sets of autonomous systems. In common practice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5065.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref> only one of the confederation AS numbers is seen by the Internet as a whole. Confederations are used in very large networks where a large AS can be configured to encompass smaller more manageable internal ASs.\n\nThe confederated AS is composed of multiple ASs. Each confederated AS alone has iBGP fully meshed and has connections to other ASs inside the confederation. Even though these ASs have eBGP peers to ASs within the confederation, the ASs exchange routing as if they used iBGP. In this way, the confederation preserves next hop, metric, and local preference information. To the outside world, the confederation appears to be a single AS. With this solution, iBGP transit AS problems can be resolved as iBGP requires a full mesh between all BGP routers: large number of TCP sessions and unnecessary duplication of routing traffic.\n\nConfederations can be used in conjunction with route reflectors. Both confederations and route reflectors can be subject to persistent oscillation unless specific design rules, affecting both BGP and the interior routing protocol, are followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3345.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these alternatives can introduce problems of their own, including the following:\n* route oscillation\n* sub-optimal routing\n* increase of BGP convergence time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4098.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, route reflectors and BGP confederations were not designed to ease BGP router configuration. Nevertheless, these are common tools for experienced BGP network architects. These tools may be combined, for example, as a hierarchy of route reflectors.\n\n== Stability ==\n\nThe routing tables managed by a BGP implementation are adjusted continually to reflect actual changes in the network, such as links breaking and being restored or routers going down and coming back up. In the network as a whole it is normal for these changes to happen almost continuously, but for any particular router or link, changes are supposed to be relatively infrequent. If a router is misconfigured or mismanaged then it may get into a rapid cycle between down and up states. This pattern of repeated withdrawal and re-announcement known as [[route flapping]] can cause excessive activity in all the other routers that know about the broken link, as the same route is continually injected and withdrawn from the routing tables. The BGP design is such that delivery of traffic may not function while routes are being updated. On the Internet, a BGP routing change may cause outages for several minutes.\n\nA feature known as ''route flap damping'' ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2439.txt RFC 2439]) is built into many BGP implementations in an attempt to mitigate the effects of route flapping. Without damping, the excessive activity can cause a heavy processing load on routers, which may in turn delay updates on other routes, and so affect overall routing stability. With damping, a route's flapping is [[exponential decay|exponentially decayed]]. At the first instance when a route becomes unavailable and quickly reappears, damping does not take effect, so as to maintain the normal fail-over times of BGP. At the second occurrence, BGP shuns that prefix for a certain length of time; subsequent occurrences are timed out exponentially. After the abnormalities have ceased and a suitable length of time has passed for the offending route, prefixes can be reinstated and its slate wiped clean. Damping can also mitigate [[denial of service]] attacks; damping timings are highly customizable.\n\nIt is also suggested in RFC 2439 (under \"Design Choices -> Stability Sensitive Suppression of Route Advertisement\") that route flap damping is a feature more desirable if implemented to Exterior Border Gateway Protocol Sessions (eBGP sessions or simply called exterior peers) and not on Interior Border Gateway Protocol Sessions (iBGP sessions or simply called internal peers); With this approach when a route flaps inside an autonomous system, it is not propagated to the external ASs{{snd}} flapping a route to an eBGP will have a chain of flapping for the particular route throughout the backbone. This method also successfully avoids the overhead of route flap damping for iBGP sessions.\n\nHowever, subsequent research has shown that flap damping can actually lengthen convergence times in some cases, and can cause interruptions in connectivity even when links are not flapping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/Papers/sig02.pdf|format=PDF|title=Route Flap Damping Exacerbates Internet Routing Convergence|date=November 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~bzhang/paper/05-icdcs-dtimer.pdf | last = Zhang | first = Beichuan | title = Timer Interaction in Route Flap Damping | accessdate = 2006-09-26 |author2=Pei Dan |author3=Daniel Massey |author4=[[Lixia Zhang]] |date=June 2005 | work = IEEE 25th [[International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems]] | quote = We show that the current damping design leads to the intended behavior only under persistent route flapping.

If the global routing table grows to the point where some older, less capable routers cannot cope with the memory requirements or the CPU load of maintaining the table, these routers will cease to be effective gateways between the parts of the Internet they connect. In addition, and perhaps even more importantly, larger routing tables take longer to stabilize (see above) after a major connectivity change, leaving network service unreliable, or even unavailable, in the interim.\n\nUntil late 2001, the global routing table was [[exponential growth|growing exponentially]], threatening an eventual widespread breakdown of connectivity. In an attempt to prevent this, ISPs cooperated in keeping the global routing table as small as possible, by using [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) and [[route aggregation]]. While this slowed the growth of the routing table to a linear process for several years, with the expanded demand for [[multihoming]] by end user networks the growth was once again superlinear by the middle of 2004.\n\n===512k day===\nWhile a full IPv4 BGP table {{as of|August 2014|lc=on}} (512k day)<ref>as of the 12th of August 2014, multiple [[Router_(computing)|Internet routers]], manufactured by [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] and other vendors, encountered a default software limit of 512K (512,000 - 524,288) {{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html#.U-okMKwClYO.twitter  |title=Cisco switch problem}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes   |title=Renesys 512k global routes}}</ref> is in excess of 512,000 prefixes,<ref name=\"Potaroo&nbsp;\u2014 BGP Table data\">{{cite web|url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html|title=BGP Reports|work=potaroo.net}}</ref> many older routers have a limit of 512k (512,000\u2013524,288)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html#.U-okMKwClYO.twitter|title=CAT 6500 and 7600 Series Routers and Switches TCAM Allocation Adjustment Procedures|date=9 March 2015|work=Cisco}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes/|title=Internet Touches Half Million Routes: Outages Possible Next Week|author=Jim Cowie|work=Dyn Research}}</ref> routing table entries.

On impacted routers, the TCAM is default allocated to 512k entries for IPv4 routes, and 512k entries for IPv6 routes. While the reported number of IPv6 advertised routes was only about 20k, the number of advertised IPv4 routes reached the default limit, causing a [[spillover effect]] as routers attempted to compensate for the issue by using slow software routing (as opposed to fast hardware routing via TCAM). The main method for dealing with this issue involves operators changing the TCAM allocation to allow more IPv4 entries, by reallocating some of the TCAM reserved for IPv6 routes. This requires a reboot on most routers. The 512k problem was predicted in advance by a number of IT professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog39/presentations/bof-report.pdf |title=BOF report |publisher=www.nanog.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://etherealmind.com/tcam-detail-review/|title=TCAM&nbsp;\u2014 a Deeper Look and the impact of IPv6|author=Greg Ferro|work=EtherealMind}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipv4depletion.com/?p=672|title=The IPv4 Depletion site|work=ipv4depletion.com}}</ref>\n\nThe actual allocations which pushed the number of routes above 512k was the announcement of about 15,000 new routes in short order, starting at 07:48 UTC. Almost all of these routes were to [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] [[Autonomous System (Internet)|Autonomous Systems]] 701 and 705, created as a result of [[route aggregation|deaggregation]] of larger blocks, introducing thousands of new [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|{{IPaddr||24}} routes]], and making the routing table reach 515,000 entries. The new routes appear to have been reaggregated within 5 minutes, but instability across the Internet apparently continued for a number of hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bgpmon.net/what-caused-todays-internet-hiccup/|title=What caused today\u2019s Internet hiccup|work=bgpmon.net}}</ref> Even if Verizon had not caused the routing table to exceed 512k entries in the short spike, it would have happened soon anyway through natural growth.\n\nRoute summarization is often used to improve aggregation of the BGP global routing table, thereby reducing the necessary table size in routers of an AS. Consider AS1 has been allocated the big address space of {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, this would be counted as one route in the table, but due to customer requirement or traffic engineering purposes, AS1 wants to announce smaller, more specific routes of {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}. The prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}} does not have any hosts so AS1 does not announce a specific route {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}. This all counts as AS1 announcing four routes.\n\nAS2 will see the four routes from AS1 ({{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}) and it is up to the routing policy of AS2 to decide whether or not to take a copy of the four routes or, as {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}} overlaps all the other specific routes, to just store the summary, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}.\n\nIf AS2 wants to send data to prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}, it will be sent to the routers of AS1 on route {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0/16}}. At AS1's router, it will either be dropped or a destination unreachable [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] message will be sent back, depending on the configuration of AS1's routers.\n\nIf AS1 later decides to drop the route {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, leaving {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}, AS1 will drop the number of routes it announces to three. AS2 will see the three routes, and depending on the routing policy of AS2, it will store a copy of the three routes, or aggregate the prefix's {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0/18}} and {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}} to {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|17}}, thereby reducing the number of routes AS2 stores to only two: {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|17}} and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}.\n\nIf AS2 wants to send data to prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}, it will be dropped or a destination unreachable ICMP message will be sent back at the routers of AS2 (not AS1 as before), because {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}} would not be in the routing table.\n\n=== AS numbers depletion and 32 bits ASN ===\n\nThe RFC 1771 (''A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)'') planned the coding of AS numbers on 16 bits, for 64510 possible public AS, since ASN 64512 to 65534 were reserved for private use (0 and 65535 being forbidden). In 2011, only 15000 AS numbers were still available, and projections<ref>[http://www.potaroo.net/tools/asn16/ ''16-bit Autonomus System Report''], Geoff Huston 2011 (original archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20110906085724/http://www.potaroo.net/tools/asn16/)</ref> were envisioning a complete depletion of available AS numbers in September 2013.\n\nRFC 6793 extends AS coding from 16 to 32 bits (keeping the 16 bits AS range 0 to 65535, and its reserved AS numbers), which now allows up to 4 billion available AS. An additional private AS range is also defined in RFC 6996 (from 4200000000 to 4294967294, 4294967295 being forbidden by RFC 7300).\n\nTo allow the traversal of router groups not able to manage those new ASNs, the new attribute OT AS4_PATH is used.\n\n32 bits ASN assignments started in 2007.\n\n== Load balancing ==\n\nAnother factor causing this growth of the routing table is the need for load balancing of multi-homed networks. It is not a trivial task to balance the inbound traffic to a multi-homed network across its multiple inbound paths, due to limitation of the BGP route selection process. For a multi-homed network, if it announces the same network blocks across all of its BGP peers, the result may be that one or several of its inbound links become congested while the other links remain under-utilized, because external networks all picked that set of congested paths as optimal. Like most other routing protocols, BGP does not detect congestion.\n\nTo work around this problem, BGP administrators of that multihomed network may divide a large contiguous IP address block into smaller blocks and tweak the route announcement to make different blocks look optimal on different paths, so that external networks will choose a different path to reach different blocks of that multi-homed network. Such cases will increase the number of routes as seen on the global BGP table.\n\nOne method growing in popularity to address the load balancing issue is to deploy BGP/LISP ([[Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol]]) gateways within an [[Internet exchange point]] to allow ingress traffic engineering across multiple links. This technique does not increase the number of routes seen on the global BGP table.\n\n== Security ==\n\nBy design, routers running BGP accept advertised routes from other BGP routers by default. This allows for automatic and decentralized routing of traffic across the Internet, but it also leaves the Internet potentially vulnerable to accidental or malicious disruption, known as [[BGP hijacking]]. Due to the extent to which BGP is embedded in the core systems of the Internet, and the number of different networks operated by many different organizations which collectively make up the Internet, correcting this vulnerability (such as by introducing the use of cryptographic keys to verify the identity of BGP routers) is a technically and economically challenging problem.<ref>{{cite news|author=Craig Timberg |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/31/net-of-insecurity-part-2/|title=Quick fix for an early Internet problem lives on a quarter-century later|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2015-05-31 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}</ref>\n\n== Extensions ==\n\nAn extension to BGP is the use of multipathing{{snd}} this typically requires identical MED, weight, origin, and AS-path although some implementations provide the ability to relax the AS-path checking to only expect an equal path length rather than the actual AS numbers in the path being expected to match too. This can then be extended further with features like Cisco's dmzlink-bw which enables a ratio of traffic sharing based on bandwidth values configured on individual links.\n\nMultiprotocol Extensions for BGP (MBGP), sometimes referred to as Multiprotocol BGP or Multicast BGP and defined in IETF <nowiki>RFC 4760</nowiki>, is an extension to (BGP) that allows different types of addresses (known as address families) to be distributed in parallel. Whereas standard BGP supports only IPv4 unicast addresses, Multiprotocol BGP supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and it supports unicast and multicast variants of each. Multiprotocol BGP allows information about the topology of IP multicast-capable routers to be exchanged separately from the topology of normal IPv4 unicast routers. Thus, it allows a multicast routing topology different from the unicast routing topology. Although MBGP enables the exchange of inter-domain multicast routing information, other protocols such as the Protocol Independent Multicast family are needed to build trees and forward multicast traffic.\n\nMultiprotocol BGP is also widely deployed in case of MPLS L3 VPN, to exchange VPN labels learned for the routes from the customer sites over the MPLS network, in order to distinguish between different customer sites when the traffic from the other customer sites comes to the Provider Edge router (PE router) for routing.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nBGP4 is standard for Internet routing and required of most [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to establish routing between one another. Very large private [[Internet Protocol|IP]] networks use BGP internally. An example is the joining of a number of large [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) networks, when OSPF by itself does not scale to the size required. Another reason to use BGP is multihoming a network for better redundancy, either to multiple access points of a single ISP or to multiple ISPs.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nRouters, especially small ones intended for [[Small office/home office|Small Office/Home Office]] (SOHO) use, may not include BGP software. Some SOHO routers simply are not capable of running BGP / using BGP routing tables of any size. Other commercial routers may need a specific software executable image that contains BGP, or a license that enables it. Open source packages that run BGP include [[GNU Zebra]], [[Quagga (software)|Quagga]], [[OpenBGPD]], [[Bird Internet routing daemon|BIRD]], [[XORP]], and [[Vyatta]]. Devices marketed as [[Layer 3 switch]]es are less likely to support BGP than devices marketed as [[Router (computing)|routers]], but high-end Layer 3 Switches usually can run BGP.\n\nProducts marketed as switches may or may not have a size limitation on BGP tables, such as 20,000 routes, far smaller than a full Internet table plus internal routes. These devices, however, may be perfectly reasonable and useful when used for BGP routing of some smaller part of the network, such as a [[confederation-AS]] representing one of several smaller enterprises that are linked, by a BGP [[backbone of backbones]], or a small enterprise that announces routes to an ISP but only accepts a [[default route]] and perhaps a small number of aggregated routes.\n\nA BGP router used only for a network with a single point of entry to the Internet may have a much smaller routing table size (and hence RAM and CPU requirement) than a multihomed network. Even simple multihoming can have modest routing table size. See RFC 4098 for vendor-independent performance parameters for single BGP router convergence in the control plane. The actual amount of memory required in a BGP router depends on the amount of BGP information exchanged with other BGP speakers and the way in which the particular router stores BGP information. The router may have to keep more than one copy of a route, so it can manage different policies for route advertising and acceptance to a specific neighboring AS. The term view is often used for these different policy relationships on a running router.\n\nIf one router implementation takes more memory per route than another implementation, this may be a legitimate design choice, trading processing speed against memory. A full IPv4 BGP table {{as of|August 2015|lc=on}} is in excess of 590,000 prefixes.<ref name=\"Potaroo&nbsp;\u2014 BGP Table data\"/> Large ISPs may add another 50% for internal and customer routes. Again depending on implementation, separate tables may be kept for each view of a different peer AS.\n\nNotable free and open source implementations of BGP include:\n\n* [[Bird Internet routing daemon|BIRD Internet Routing Daemon]], a GPL routing package for Unix-like systems.\n*[[FRRouting]], a fork of Quagga for [[Unix-like]] systems.\n* [[GNU Zebra]], a [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] routing suite supporting BGP4.

In this application it is referred to as '''Interior Border Gateway Protocol''', '''Internal BGP''', or '''iBGP'''. In contrast, the Internet application of the protocol may be referred to as '''Exterior Border Gateway Protocol''', '''External BGP''', or '''eBGP'''.\n\nA [[#512k day|Y2K-like overflow]] (512k day) triggered in 2014 for those models that were not appropriately updated.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Border Gateway Protocol has been in use on the Internet since 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://datapath.io/resources/blog/the-history-of-border-gateway-protocol/|title=The History of Border Gateway Protocol|work=blog.datapath.io}}</ref> The current version of BGP is version 4 (BGP4), which was published as RFC 4271 in 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271|title=RFC 4271 - A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)|work=ietf.org}}</ref> after progressing through 20 drafts from documents based on RFC 1771 version 4. RFC 4271 corrected errors, clarified ambiguities and updated the specification with common industry practices. The major enhancement was the support for [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) and use of [[route aggregation]] to decrease the size of [[routing table]]s.\n\n[[IPv6]] BGP was first defined in RFC 1883 in 1995, and it was improved to RFC 2283 in 1998. The new RFC allows BGP4 to carry a wide range of [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] \"address families\". It is also called the Multiprotocol Extensions which is Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP).\n\n== Operation ==\n\nBGP neighbors, called peers, are established by manual configuration among [[Router (computing)|router]]s to create a [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] session on [[port (computer networking)|port]] 179. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte keep-alive messages every 60 seconds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/ip/routing/bgp/operation/messages/keepalives.shtml|title=BGP Keepalive Messages |work= InetDaemon's IT Tutorials }}</ref> to maintain the connection.<ref>RFC 4274</ref> Among routing protocols, BGP is unique in using TCP as its transport protocol.\n\nWhen BGP runs between two peers in the same [[autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]] (AS), it is referred to as ''Internal BGP'' (''i-BGP'' or ''Interior Border Gateway Protocol''). When it runs between different autonomous systems, it is called ''External BGP'' (''eBGP'' or ''Exterior Border Gateway Protocol''). Routers on the boundary of one AS exchanging information with another AS are called ''border'' or ''edge routers'' or simply ''eBGP peers'' and are typically connected directly, while ''i-BGP peers'' can be interconnected through other intermediate routers. Other deployment [[Network topology|topologies]] are also possible, such as running eBGP peering inside a [[VPN]] tunnel, allowing two remote sites to exchange routing information in a secure and isolated manner. The main difference between iBGP and eBGP peering is in the way routes that were received from one peer are propagated to other peers. For instance, new routes learned from an eBGP peer are typically redistributed to all iBGP peers as well as all other eBGP peers (if ''transit'' mode is enabled on the router). However, if new routes are learned on an iBGP peering, then they are re-advertised only to all eBGP peers. These route-propagation rules effectively require that all iBGP peers inside an AS are interconnected in a full mesh.\n\nHow routes are propagated can be controlled in detail via the ''route-maps'' mechanism. This mechanism consists of a set of rules. Each rule describes, for routes matching some given criteria, what action should be taken. The action could be to drop the route, or it could be to modify some attributes of the route before inserting it in the [[routing table]].\n\n=== Extensions negotiation ===\n[[File:BGP FSM.svg|thumb|BGP state machine]]\n\nDuring the peering handshake, when OPEN messages are exchanged, BGP speakers can negotiate<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2842.txt Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4], RFC 2842, R. Chandra & J. Scudder, May 2000</ref> optional capabilities of the session, including [[Multiprotocol BGP|multiprotocol extensions]] and various recovery modes. If the multiprotocol extensions to BGP<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2858.txt Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4], RFC 2858, T. Bates ''et al.'', June 2000</ref> are negotiated at the time of creation, the BGP speaker can prefix the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) it advertises with an address family prefix. These families include the IPv4 (default), IPv6, IPv4/IPv6 Virtual Private Networks and multicast BGP. Increasingly, BGP is used as a generalized signaling protocol to carry information about routes that may not be part of the global Internet, such as VPNs.<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2547.txt BGP/MPLS VPNs.], RFC 2547, E. Rosen and Y. Rekhter, April 2004</ref>\n\nIn order to make decisions in its operations with peers, a BGP peer uses a simple [[finite state machine]] (FSM) that consists of six states: Idle; Connect; Active; OpenSent; OpenConfirm; and Established. For each peer-to-peer session, a BGP implementation maintains a state variable that tracks which of these six states the session is in. The BGP defines the messages that each peer should exchange in order to change the session from one state to another. The first state is the \"Idle\" state. In the \"Idle\" state, BGP initializes all resources, refuses all inbound BGP connection attempts and initiates a TCP connection to the peer. The second state is \"Connect\". In the \"Connect\" state, the router waits for the TCP connection to complete and transitions to the \"OpenSent\" state if successful. If unsuccessful, it starts the ConnectRetry timer and transitions to the \"Active\" state upon expiration. In the \"Active\" state, the router resets the ConnectRetry timer to zero and returns to the \"Connect\" state. In the \"OpenSent\" state, the router sends an Open message and waits for one in return in order to transition to the \"OpenConfirm\" state. Keepalive messages are exchanged and, upon successful receipt, the router is placed into the \"Established\" state. In the \"Established\" state, the router can send/receive: Keepalive; Update; and Notification messages to/from its peer.\n\n* '''Idle State''':\n** Refuse all incoming BGP connections.\n** Start the initialization of event triggers.\n** Initiates a TCP connection with its configured BGP peer.\n** Listens for a TCP connection from its peer.\n** Changes its state to Connect.\n** If an error occurs at any state of the FSM process, the BGP session is terminated immediately and returned to the Idle state. Some of the reasons why a router does not progress from the Idle state are:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** Peer address configured incorrectly on either router.\n*** AS number configured incorrectly on either router.\n* '''Connect State''':\n** Waits for successful TCP negotiation with peer.\n** BGP does not spend much time in this state if the TCP session has been successfully established.\n** Sends Open message to peer and changes state to OpenSent.\n** If an error occurs, BGP moves to the Active state. Some reasons for the error are:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** Peer address configured incorrectly on either router.\n*** AS number configured incorrectly on either router.\n* '''Active State''':\n** If the router was unable to establish a successful TCP session, then it ends up in the Active state.\n** BGP FSM tries to restart another TCP session with the peer and, if successful, then it sends an Open message to the peer.\n** If it is unsuccessful again, the FSM is reset to the Idle state.\n** Repeated failures may result in a router cycling between the Idle and Active states. Some of the reasons for this include:\n*** TCP port 179 is not open.\n*** A random TCP port over 1023 is not open.\n*** BGP configuration error.\n*** Network congestion.\n*** Flapping network interface.\n* '''OpenSent State''':\n** BGP FSM listens for an Open message from its peer.\n** Once the message has been received, the router checks the validity of the Open message.\n** If there is an error it is because one of the fields in the Open message does not match between the peers, e.g., BGP version mismatch, the peering router expects a different My AS, etc. The router then sends a Notification message to the peer indicating why the error occurred.\n** If there is no error, a Keepalive message is sent, various timers are set and the state is changed to OpenConfirm.\n* '''OpenConfirm State''':\n** The peer is listening for a Keepalive message from its peer.\n** If a Keepalive message is received and no timer has expired before reception of the Keepalive, BGP transitions to the Established state.\n** If a timer expires before a Keepalive message is received, or if an error condition occurs, the router transitions back to the Idle state.\n* '''Established State''':\n** In this state, the peers send Update messages to exchange information about each route being advertised to the BGP peer.\n** If there is any error in the Update message then a Notification message is sent to the peer, and BGP transitions back to the Idle state.\n\n=== Router connectivity and learning routes ===\nIn the simplest arrangement, all routers within a single AS and participating in BGP routing must be configured in a full mesh: each router must be configured as peer to every other router. This causes scaling problems, since the number of required connections [[quadratic growth|grows quadratically]] with the number of routers involved. To alleviate the problem, BGP implements two options: [[route reflector]]s (RFC 4456) and [[BGP confederation]]s (RFC 5065). The following discussion of basic UPDATE processing assumes a full iBGP mesh.\n\nA given BGP router may accept Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) UPDATEs from multiple neighbors and advertise NLRI to the same, or a different set, of neighbors. Conceptually, BGP maintains its own \"master\" routing table, called the Local [[Routing Information Base]] (''Loc-RIB''), separate from the main routing table of the router. For each neighbor, the BGP process maintains a conceptual Adjacent Routing Information Base, Incoming (''Adj-RIB-In'') containing the NLRI received from the neighbor, and a conceptual ''Adj-RIB-Out'' (Outgoing) for NLRI to be sent to the neighbor.\n\n\"Conceptual\", in the preceding paragraph, means that the physical storage and structure of these various tables are decided by the implementer of the BGP code. Their structure is not visible to other BGP routers, although they usually can be interrogated with management commands on the local router. It is quite common, for example, to store the two Adj-RIBs and the Loc-RIB together in the same data structure, with additional information attached to the RIB entries. The additional information tells the BGP process such things as whether individual entries belong in the Adj-RIBs for specific neighbors, whether the peer-neighbor route selection process made received policies eligible for the Loc-RIB, and whether Loc-RIB entries are eligible to be submitted to the local router's routing table management process.\n\nBy ''eligible to be submitted'', BGP will submit the routes that it considers best to the main routing table process. Depending on the implementation of that process, the BGP route is not necessarily selected. For example, a directly connected prefix, learned from the router's own hardware, is usually most preferred. As long as that directly connected route's interface is active, the BGP route to the destination will not be put into the routing table. Once the interface goes down, and there are no more preferred routes, the Loc-RIB route would be installed in the main routing table.\nUntil recently, it was a common mistake to say ''BGP carries policies''. BGP actually carried the information with which rules inside BGP-speaking routers could make policy decisions. Some of the information carried that is explicitly intended to be used in policy decisions are communities and multi-exit discriminators (MED).\n\nThe BGP standard specifies a number of decision factors, more than the ones that are used by any other common routing process, for selecting NLRI to go into the Loc-RIB. The first decision point for evaluating NLRI is that its next-hop attribute must be reachable (or resolvable). Another way of saying the next-hop must be reachable is that there must be an active route, already in the main routing table of the router, to the prefix in which the next-hop address is reachable.\n\nNext, for each neighbor, the BGP process applies various standard and implementation-dependent criteria to decide which routes conceptually should go into the Adj-RIB-In. The neighbor could send several possible routes to a destination, but the first level of preference is at the neighbor level. Only one route to each destination will be installed in the conceptual Adj-RIB-In. This process will also delete, from the Adj-RIB-In, any routes that are withdrawn by the neighbor.\n\nWhenever a conceptual Adj-RIB-In changes, the main BGP process decides if any of the neighbor's new routes are preferred to routes already in the Loc-RIB. If so, it replaces them. If a given route is withdrawn by a neighbor, and there is no other route to that destination, the route is removed from the Loc-RIB, and no longer sent, by BGP, to the main routing table manager. If the router does not have a route to that destination from any non-BGP source, the withdrawn route will be removed from the main routing table.\n\nAfter verifying that the next hop is reachable, if the route comes from an internal (i.e. iBGP) peer, the first rule to apply, according to the standard, is to examine the LOCAL_PREFERENCE attribute. If there are several iBGP routes from the neighbor, the one with the highest LOCAL_PREFERENCE is selected unless there are several routes with the same LOCAL_PREFERENCE. In the latter case the route selection process moves to the next tie breaker. While LOCAL_PREFERENCE is the first rule in the standard, once reachability of the NEXT_HOP is verified, Cisco and several other vendors first consider a decision factor called WEIGHT which is local to the router (i.e. not transmitted by BGP). The route with the highest WEIGHT is preferred.\n\nThe LOCAL_PREFERENCE, WEIGHT, and other criteria can be manipulated by local configuration and software capabilities. Such manipulation is outside the scope of the standard but is commonly used. For example, the COMMUNITY attribute (see below) is not directly used by the BGP selection process. The BGP neighbor process however can have a rule to set LOCAL_PREFERENCE or another factor based on a manually programmed rule to set the attribute if the COMMUNITY value matches some pattern matching criterion. If the route was learned from an external peer the per-neighbor BGP process computes a LOCAL_PREFERENCE value from local policy rules and then compares the LOCAL_PREFERENCE of all routes from the neighbor.\n\nAt the per-neighbor level{{snd}} ignoring implementation-specific policy modifiers{{snd}} the order of tie breaking rules is:\n\n# Prefer the route with the shortest AS_PATH. An AS_PATH is the set of AS numbers that must be traversed to reach the advertised destination. AS1-AS2-AS3 is shorter than AS4-AS5-AS6-AS7.\n# Prefer routes with the lowest value of their ORIGIN attribute.\n# Prefer routes with the lowest MULTI_EXIT_DISC (multi-exit discriminator or MED) value.\n''Before the most recent edition of the BGP standard, if an UPDATE had no MULTI_EXIT_DISC value, several implementations created a MED with the highest possible value. The current standard however specifies that missing MEDs are to be treated as the lowest possible value. Since the current rule may cause different behavior than the vendor interpretations, BGP implementations that used the nonstandard default value have a configuration feature that allows the old or standard rule to be selected.''\n\nOnce candidate routes are received from neighbors, the Loc-RIB software applies additional tie-breakers to routes to the same destination.\n\n# If at least one route was learned from an external neighbor (i.e., the route was learned from eBGP), drop all routes learned from iBGP.\n# Prefer the route with the lowest interior cost to the NEXT_HOP, according to the main routing table. If two neighbors advertised the same route, but one neighbor is reachable via a low-bitrate link and the other by a high-bitrate link, and the interior routing protocol calculates lowest cost based on highest bitrate, the route through the high-bitrate link would be preferred and other routes dropped.\n''If there is more than one route still tied at this point, several BGP implementations offer a configurable option to load-share among the routes, accepting all (or all up to some number).''\n# Prefer the route learned from the BGP speaker with the numerically lowest BGP identifier\n# Prefer the route learned from the BGP speaker with the lowest peer IP address\n\n=== Communities ===\n\nBGP communities are attribute tags that can be applied to incoming or outgoing prefixes to achieve some common goal (RFC 1997). While it is common to say that BGP allows an administrator to set policies on how prefixes are handled by ISPs, this is generally not possible, strictly speaking. For instance, BGP natively has no concept to allow one AS to tell another AS to restrict advertisement of a prefix to only North American peering customers. Instead, an ISP generally publishes a list of well-known or proprietary communities with a description for each one, which essentially becomes an agreement of how prefixes are to be treated. RFC 1997 also defines three well-known communities that have global significance; NO_EXPORT, NO_ADVERTISE and NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED. RFC 7611 defines ACCEPT_OWN. Examples of common communities include local preference adjustments, geographic or peer type restrictions, DoS avoidance (black holing), and AS prepending options. An ISP might state that any routes received from customers with community XXX:500 will be advertised to all peers (default) while community XXX:501 will restrict advertisement to North America. The customer simply adjusts their configuration to include the correct community or communities for each route, and the ISP is responsible for controlling who the prefix is advertised to. The end user has no technical ability to enforce correct actions being taken by the ISP, though problems in this area are generally rare and accidental.\n\nIt is a common tactic for end customers to use BGP communities (usually ASN:70,80,90,100) to control the local preference the ISP assigns to advertised routes instead of using MED (the effect is similar). The community attribute is transitive, but communities applied by the customer very rarely become propagated outside the next-hop AS. Not all ISPs give out their communities to the public, while some other do.<ref>{{cite web|title=BGP Community Guides|url=http://www.onesc.net/communities/|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe BGP Extended Community Attribute was added in 2006, in order to extend the range of such attributes and to provide a community attribute structuring by means of a type field. The extended format consists of one or two octets for the type field followed by seven or six octets for the respective community attribute content. The definition of this Extended Community Attribute is documented in RFC 4360. The IANA administers the registry for BGP Extended Communities Types.<ref>[http://www.iana.org/assignments/bgp-extended-communities IANA registry for BGP Extended Communities Types], IANA,2008</ref> The Extended Communities Attribute itself is a transitive optional BGP attribute. However, a bit in the type field within the attribute decides whether the encoded extended community is of a transitive or non-transitive nature. The IANA registry therefore provides different number ranges for the attribute types. Due to the extended attribute range, its usage can be manifold. RFC 4360 exemplarly{{typo help inline|reason=similar to exemplarily|date=December 2019}} defines the \"Two-Octet AS Specific Extended Community\", the \"IPv4 Address Specific Extended Community\", the \"Opaque Extended Community\", the \"Route Target Community\", and the \"Route Origin Community\". A number of BGP QoS drafts<ref>[http://www.bgp-qos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=6 IETF drafts on BGP signalled QoS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223214439/http://www.bgp-qos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=6 |date=2009-02-23 }}, Thomas Knoll,2008</ref> also use this Extended Community Attribute structure for inter-domain QoS signalling.\n\nNote: since RFC 7153, extended communities are compatible with 32 bits ASNs.\n\nWith the introduction of 32 bits AS numbers, some issues were immediately obvious with the community attribute that only defines a 16 bits ASN field, which prevents the matching between this field and the real ASN value. It is the reason why RFC 8092 and RFC 8195 introduce a [http://largebgpcommunities.net/ Large Community] attribute of 12 bytes, divided in three field of 4 bytes each (AS:function:parameter).\n\n=== Multi-exit discriminators ===\n\nMEDs, defined in the main BGP standard, were originally intended to show to another neighbor AS the advertising AS's preference as to which of several links are preferred for inbound traffic. Another application of MEDs is to advertise the value, typically based on delay, of multiple AS that have presence at an [[IXP]], that they impose to send traffic to some destination.\n\n=== Message header format ===\n\nThe following is the BGP version 4 message header format:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:4%;\"|bit offset\n! colspan=\"16\" style=\"width:50%;\"| 0\u201315\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"width:25%;\"| 16\u201323\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"width:25%;\"| 24\u201331\n|-\n! 0\n| rowspan=\"4\" colspan=\"32\"| Marker\n|-\n! 32\n|-\n! 64\n|-\n! 96\n|-\n! 128\n| colspan=\"16\"| Length\n| colspan=\"8\"| Type\n| colspan=\"8\"|\n|}\n\n* '''Marker''': Included for compatibility, must be set to all ones.\n* '''Length''': Total length of the message in [[Octet (computing)|octets]], including the header.\n* '''Type''': Type of BGP message. The following values are defined:\n** Open (1)\n** Update (2)\n** Notification (3)\n** KeepAlive (4)\n** Route-Refresh (5)\n\n== Problems and mitigation ==\n{{criticism section|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Internal scalability ==\n\nAn autonomous system with internal BGP (iBGP) must have all of its iBGP peers connect to each other in a [[Complete graph|full mesh]] (where everyone speaks to everyone directly). This full-mesh configuration requires that each router maintain a session to every other router. In large networks, this number of sessions may degrade performance of routers, due to either a lack of memory, or high CPU process requirements.\n\n===Route reflectors===\n[[Route reflector]]s<ref>[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4456.txt BGP Route Reflection: An Alternative to Full Mesh Internal BGP (iBGP)], RFC 4456, T. Bates ''et al.'', April 2006</ref> reduce the number of connections required in an AS. A single router (or two for redundancy) can be made a route reflector: other routers in the AS need only be configured as peers to them. A route reflector offers an alternative to the logical full-mesh requirement of [[internal border gateway protocol]] (IBGP). A RR acts as a {{clarify span|focal point|date=October 2013}} for IBGP sessions. The purpose of the RR is concentration. Multiple BGP routers can peer with a central point, the RR \u2013 acting as a route reflector server \u2013 rather than peer with every other router in a full mesh. All the other IBGP routers become route reflector clients.\n\nThis approach, similar to [[OSPF]]'s DR/BDR feature, provides large networks with added IBGP scalability. In a fully meshed IBGP network of 10 routers, 90 individual CLI statements (spread throughout all routers in the topology) are needed just to define the remote-AS of each peer: this quickly becomes a headache to administer. A RR topology could cut these 90 statements down to 18, offering a viable solution for the larger networks administered by ISPs.\n\nA route reflector is a [[single point of failure]], therefore at least a second route reflector may be configured in order to provide redundancy. As it is an additional peer for the other 10 routers, it comes with the additional statement count to double that minus 2 of the single Route Reflector setup. An additional 11*2-2=20 statements in this case due to adding the additional Router. Additionally, in a BGP multipath Environment this also can benefit by adding local switching/Routing throughput if the RRs are acting as traditional Routers instead of just a dedicated Route Reflector Server role.\n\n====Rules====\n[[File:RR_BGP.svg|thumbnail|300px|A typical configuration of BGP Route Reflector deployment, as proposed by Section 6, RFC 4456.]]\nRR servers propagate routes inside the AS based on the following rules:\n* If a route is received from a non-client peer, reflect to clients only and EBGP peers.\n* If a route is received from a client peer, reflect to all non-client peers and also to client peers, except the originator of the route and reflect to EBGP peers.\n\n====Cluster====\nRR and its clients form a \"Cluster\". The \"Cluster-ID\" is then attached to every route advertised by RR to its client or nonclient peers. Cluster-ID is a cumulative, non-transitive BGP attribute and every RR MUST prepend the local CLUSTER_ID to the CLUSTER_LIST in order to avoid routing loops.\nRoute reflectors and confederations both reduce the number of iBGP peers to each router and thus reduce processing overhead. Route reflectors are a pure performance-enhancing technique, while confederations also can be used to implement more fine-grained policy.\n\n===BGP confederation===\nConfederations are sets of autonomous systems. In common practice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5065.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref> only one of the confederation AS numbers is seen by the Internet as a whole. Confederations are used in very large networks where a large AS can be configured to encompass smaller more manageable internal ASs.\n\nThe confederated AS is composed of multiple ASs. Each confederated AS alone has iBGP fully meshed and has connections to other ASs inside the confederation. Even though these ASs have eBGP peers to ASs within the confederation, the ASs exchange routing as if they used iBGP. In this way, the confederation preserves next hop, metric, and local preference information. To the outside world, the confederation appears to be a single AS. With this solution, iBGP transit AS problems can be resolved as iBGP requires a full mesh between all BGP routers: large number of TCP sessions and unnecessary duplication of routing traffic.\n\nConfederations can be used in conjunction with route reflectors. Both confederations and route reflectors can be subject to persistent oscillation unless specific design rules, affecting both BGP and the interior routing protocol, are followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3345.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n\nHowever, these alternatives can introduce problems of their own, including the following:\n* route oscillation\n* sub-optimal routing\n* increase of BGP convergence time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4098.txt |title=Info |publisher=www.ietf.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, route reflectors and BGP confederations were not designed to ease BGP router configuration. Nevertheless, these are common tools for experienced BGP network architects. These tools may be combined, for example, as a hierarchy of route reflectors.\n\n== Stability ==\n\nThe routing tables managed by a BGP implementation are adjusted continually to reflect actual changes in the network, such as links breaking and being restored or routers going down and coming back up. In the network as a whole it is normal for these changes to happen almost continuously, but for any particular router or link, changes are supposed to be relatively infrequent. If a router is misconfigured or mismanaged then it may get into a rapid cycle between down and up states. This pattern of repeated withdrawal and re-announcement known as [[route flapping]] can cause excessive activity in all the other routers that know about the broken link, as the same route is continually injected and withdrawn from the routing tables. The BGP design is such that delivery of traffic may not function while routes are being updated. On the Internet, a BGP routing change may cause outages for several minutes.\n\nA feature known as ''route flap damping'' ([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2439.txt RFC 2439]) is built into many BGP implementations in an attempt to mitigate the effects of route flapping. Without damping, the excessive activity can cause a heavy processing load on routers, which may in turn delay updates on other routes, and so affect overall routing stability. With damping, a route's flapping is [[exponential decay|exponentially decayed]]. At the first instance when a route becomes unavailable and quickly reappears, damping does not take effect, so as to maintain the normal fail-over times of BGP. At the second occurrence, BGP shuns that prefix for a certain length of time; subsequent occurrences are timed out exponentially. After the abnormalities have ceased and a suitable length of time has passed for the offending route, prefixes can be reinstated and its slate wiped clean. Damping can also mitigate [[denial of service]] attacks; damping timings are highly customizable.\n\nIt is also suggested in RFC 2439 (under \"Design Choices -> Stability Sensitive Suppression of Route Advertisement\") that route flap damping is a feature more desirable if implemented to Exterior Border Gateway Protocol Sessions (eBGP sessions or simply called exterior peers) and not on Interior Border Gateway Protocol Sessions (iBGP sessions or simply called internal peers); With this approach when a route flaps inside an autonomous system, it is not propagated to the external ASs{{snd}} flapping a route to an eBGP will have a chain of flapping for the particular route throughout the backbone. This method also successfully avoids the overhead of route flap damping for iBGP sessions.\n\nHowever, subsequent research has shown that flap damping can actually lengthen convergence times in some cases, and can cause interruptions in connectivity even when links are not flapping.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/Papers/sig02.pdf|format=PDF|title=Route Flap Damping Exacerbates Internet Routing Convergence|date=November 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~bzhang/paper/05-icdcs-dtimer.pdf | last = Zhang | first = Beichuan | title = Timer Interaction in Route Flap Damping | accessdate = 2006-09-26 |author2=Pei Dan |author3=Daniel Massey |author4=[[Lixia Zhang]] |date=June 2005 | work = IEEE 25th [[International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems]] | quote = We show that the current damping design leads to the intended behavior only under persistent route flapping.

If the global routing table grows to the point where some older, less capable routers cannot cope with the memory requirements or the CPU load of maintaining the table, these routers will cease to be effective gateways between the parts of the Internet they connect. In addition, and perhaps even more importantly, larger routing tables take longer to stabilize (see above) after a major connectivity change, leaving network service unreliable, or even unavailable, in the interim.\n\nUntil late 2001, the global routing table was [[exponential growth|growing exponentially]], threatening an eventual widespread breakdown of connectivity. In an attempt to prevent this, ISPs cooperated in keeping the global routing table as small as possible, by using [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) and [[route aggregation]]. While this slowed the growth of the routing table to a linear process for several years, with the expanded demand for [[multihoming]] by end user networks the growth was once again superlinear by the middle of 2004.\n\n===512k day===\nWhile a full IPv4 BGP table {{as of|August 2014|lc=on}} (512k day)<ref>as of the 12th of August 2014, multiple [[Router_(computing)|Internet routers]], manufactured by [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] and other vendors, encountered a default software limit of 512K (512,000 - 524,288) {{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html#.U-okMKwClYO.twitter  |title=Cisco switch problem}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes   |title=Renesys 512k global routes}}</ref> is in excess of 512,000 prefixes,<ref name=\"Potaroo&nbsp;\u2014 BGP Table data\">{{cite web|url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html|title=BGP Reports|work=potaroo.net}}</ref> many older routers have a limit of 512k (512,000\u2013524,288)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/switches/catalyst-6500-series-switches/117712-problemsolution-cat6500-00.html#.U-okMKwClYO.twitter|title=CAT 6500 and 7600 Series Routers and Switches TCAM Allocation Adjustment Procedures|date=9 March 2015|work=Cisco}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renesys.com/2014/08/internet-512k-global-routes/|title=Internet Touches Half Million Routes: Outages Possible Next Week|author=Jim Cowie|work=Dyn Research}}</ref> routing table entries.

On impacted routers, the TCAM is default allocated to 512k entries for IPv4 routes, and 512k entries for IPv6 routes. While the reported number of IPv6 advertised routes was only about 20k, the number of advertised IPv4 routes reached the default limit, causing a [[spillover effect]] as routers attempted to compensate for the issue by using slow software routing (as opposed to fast hardware routing via TCAM). The main method for dealing with this issue involves operators changing the TCAM allocation to allow more IPv4 entries, by reallocating some of the TCAM reserved for IPv6 routes. This requires a reboot on most routers. The 512k problem was predicted in advance by a number of IT professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog39/presentations/bof-report.pdf |title=BOF report |publisher=www.nanog.org |date= |accessdate=2019-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://etherealmind.com/tcam-detail-review/|title=TCAM&nbsp;\u2014 a Deeper Look and the impact of IPv6|author=Greg Ferro|work=EtherealMind}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipv4depletion.com/?p=672|title=The IPv4 Depletion site|work=ipv4depletion.com}}</ref>\n\nThe actual allocations which pushed the number of routes above 512k was the announcement of about 15,000 new routes in short order, starting at 07:48 UTC. Almost all of these routes were to [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] [[Autonomous System (Internet)|Autonomous Systems]] 701 and 705, created as a result of [[route aggregation|deaggregation]] of larger blocks, introducing thousands of new [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|{{IPaddr||24}} routes]], and making the routing table reach 515,000 entries. The new routes appear to have been reaggregated within 5 minutes, but instability across the Internet apparently continued for a number of hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bgpmon.net/what-caused-todays-internet-hiccup/|title=What caused today\u2019s Internet hiccup|work=bgpmon.net}}</ref> Even if Verizon had not caused the routing table to exceed 512k entries in the short spike, it would have happened soon anyway through natural growth.\n\nRoute summarization is often used to improve aggregation of the BGP global routing table, thereby reducing the necessary table size in routers of an AS. Consider AS1 has been allocated the big address space of {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, this would be counted as one route in the table, but due to customer requirement or traffic engineering purposes, AS1 wants to announce smaller, more specific routes of {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}. The prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}} does not have any hosts so AS1 does not announce a specific route {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}. This all counts as AS1 announcing four routes.\n\nAS2 will see the four routes from AS1 ({{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}) and it is up to the routing policy of AS2 to decide whether or not to take a copy of the four routes or, as {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}} overlaps all the other specific routes, to just store the summary, {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}.\n\nIf AS2 wants to send data to prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}, it will be sent to the routers of AS1 on route {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0/16}}. At AS1's router, it will either be dropped or a destination unreachable [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] message will be sent back, depending on the configuration of AS1's routers.\n\nIf AS1 later decides to drop the route {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|16}}, leaving {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|18}}, {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}}, and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}, AS1 will drop the number of routes it announces to three. AS2 will see the three routes, and depending on the routing policy of AS2, it will store a copy of the three routes, or aggregate the prefix's {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0/18}} and {{IPaddr|172.16.64.0|18}} to {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|17}}, thereby reducing the number of routes AS2 stores to only two: {{IPaddr|172.16.0.0|17}} and {{IPaddr|172.16.128.0|18}}.\n\nIf AS2 wants to send data to prefix {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}}, it will be dropped or a destination unreachable ICMP message will be sent back at the routers of AS2 (not AS1 as before), because {{IPaddr|172.16.192.0|18}} would not be in the routing table.\n\n=== AS numbers depletion and 32 bits ASN ===\n\nThe RFC 1771 (''A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)'') planned the coding of AS numbers on 16 bits, for 64510 possible public AS, since ASN 64512 to 65534 were reserved for private use (0 and 65535 being forbidden). In 2011, only 15000 AS numbers were still available, and projections<ref>[http://www.potaroo.net/tools/asn16/ ''16-bit Autonomus System Report''], Geoff Huston 2011 (original archived at https://web.archive.org/web/20110906085724/http://www.potaroo.net/tools/asn16/)</ref> were envisioning a complete depletion of available AS numbers in September 2013.\n\nRFC 6793 extends AS coding from 16 to 32 bits (keeping the 16 bits AS range 0 to 65535, and its reserved AS numbers), which now allows up to 4 billion available AS. An additional private AS range is also defined in RFC 6996 (from 4200000000 to 4294967294, 4294967295 being forbidden by RFC 7300).\n\nTo allow the traversal of router groups not able to manage those new ASNs, the new attribute OT AS4_PATH is used.\n\n32 bits ASN assignments started in 2007.\n\n== Load balancing ==\n\nAnother factor causing this growth of the routing table is the need for load balancing of multi-homed networks. It is not a trivial task to balance the inbound traffic to a multi-homed network across its multiple inbound paths, due to limitation of the BGP route selection process. For a multi-homed network, if it announces the same network blocks across all of its BGP peers, the result may be that one or several of its inbound links become congested while the other links remain under-utilized, because external networks all picked that set of congested paths as optimal. Like most other routing protocols, BGP does not detect congestion.\n\nTo work around this problem, BGP administrators of that multihomed network may divide a large contiguous IP address block into smaller blocks and tweak the route announcement to make different blocks look optimal on different paths, so that external networks will choose a different path to reach different blocks of that multi-homed network. Such cases will increase the number of routes as seen on the global BGP table.\n\nOne method growing in popularity to address the load balancing issue is to deploy BGP/LISP ([[Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol]]) gateways within an [[Internet exchange point]] to allow ingress traffic engineering across multiple links. This technique does not increase the number of routes seen on the global BGP table.\n\n== Security ==\n\nBy design, routers running BGP accept advertised routes from other BGP routers by default. This allows for automatic and decentralized routing of traffic across the Internet, but it also leaves the Internet potentially vulnerable to accidental or malicious disruption, known as [[BGP hijacking]]. Due to the extent to which BGP is embedded in the core systems of the Internet, and the number of different networks operated by many different organizations which collectively make up the Internet, correcting this vulnerability (such as by introducing the use of cryptographic keys to verify the identity of BGP routers) is a technically and economically challenging problem.<ref>{{cite news|author=Craig Timberg |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/31/net-of-insecurity-part-2/|title=Quick fix for an early Internet problem lives on a quarter-century later|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=2015-05-31 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}</ref>\n\n== Extensions ==\n\nAn extension to BGP is the use of multipathing{{snd}} this typically requires identical MED, weight, origin, and AS-path although some implementations provide the ability to relax the AS-path checking to only expect an equal path length rather than the actual AS numbers in the path being expected to match too. This can then be extended further with features like Cisco's dmzlink-bw which enables a ratio of traffic sharing based on bandwidth values configured on individual links.\n\nMultiprotocol Extensions for BGP (MBGP), sometimes referred to as Multiprotocol BGP or Multicast BGP and defined in IETF <nowiki>RFC 4760</nowiki>, is an extension to (BGP) that allows different types of addresses (known as address families) to be distributed in parallel. Whereas standard BGP supports only IPv4 unicast addresses, Multiprotocol BGP supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and it supports unicast and multicast variants of each. Multiprotocol BGP allows information about the topology of IP multicast-capable routers to be exchanged separately from the topology of normal IPv4 unicast routers. Thus, it allows a multicast routing topology different from the unicast routing topology. Although MBGP enables the exchange of inter-domain multicast routing information, other protocols such as the Protocol Independent Multicast family are needed to build trees and forward multicast traffic.\n\nMultiprotocol BGP is also widely deployed in case of MPLS L3 VPN, to exchange VPN labels learned for the routes from the customer sites over the MPLS network, in order to distinguish between different customer sites when the traffic from the other customer sites comes to the Provider Edge router (PE router) for routing.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nBGP4 is standard for Internet routing and required of most [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) to establish routing between one another. Very large private [[Internet Protocol|IP]] networks use BGP internally. An example is the joining of a number of large [[Open Shortest Path First]] (OSPF) networks, when OSPF by itself does not scale to the size required. Another reason to use BGP is multihoming a network for better redundancy, either to multiple access points of a single ISP or to multiple ISPs.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nRouters, especially small ones intended for [[Small office/home office|Small Office/Home Office]] (SOHO) use, may not include BGP software. Some SOHO routers simply are not capable of running BGP / using BGP routing tables of any size. Other commercial routers may need a specific software executable image that contains BGP, or a license that enables it. Open source packages that run BGP include [[GNU Zebra]], [[Quagga (software)|Quagga]], [[OpenBGPD]], [[Bird Internet routing daemon|BIRD]], [[XORP]], and [[Vyatta]]. Devices marketed as [[Layer 3 switch]]es are less likely to support BGP than devices marketed as [[Router (computing)|routers]], but high-end Layer 3 Switches usually can run BGP.\n\nProducts marketed as switches may or may not have a size limitation on BGP tables, such as 20,000 routes, far smaller than a full Internet table plus internal routes. These devices, however, may be perfectly reasonable and useful when used for BGP routing of some smaller part of the network, such as a [[confederation-AS]] representing one of several smaller enterprises that are linked, by a BGP [[backbone of backbones]], or a small enterprise that announces routes to an ISP but only accepts a [[default route]] and perhaps a small number of aggregated routes.\n\nA BGP router used only for a network with a single point of entry to the Internet may have a much smaller routing table size (and hence RAM and CPU requirement) than a multihomed network. Even simple multihoming can have modest routing table size. See RFC 4098 for vendor-independent performance parameters for single BGP router convergence in the control plane. The actual amount of memory required in a BGP router depends on the amount of BGP information exchanged with other BGP speakers and the way in which the particular router stores BGP information. The router may have to keep more than one copy of a route, so it can manage different policies for route advertising and acceptance to a specific neighboring AS. The term view is often used for these different policy relationships on a running router.\n\nIf one router implementation takes more memory per route than another implementation, this may be a legitimate design choice, trading processing speed against memory. A full IPv4 BGP table {{as of|August 2015|lc=on}} is in excess of 590,000 prefixes.<ref name=\"Potaroo&nbsp;\u2014 BGP Table data\"/> Large ISPs may add another 50% for internal and customer routes. Again depending on implementation, separate tables may be kept for each view of a different peer AS.\n\nNotable free and open source implementations of BGP include:\n\n* [[Bird Internet routing daemon|BIRD Internet Routing Daemon]], a GPL routing package for Unix-like systems.\n*[[FRRouting]], a fork of Quagga for [[Unix-like]] systems.\n* [[GNU Zebra]], a [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] routing suite supporting BGP4.
