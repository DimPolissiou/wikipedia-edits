He also represents the [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australian national team]]. He primarily plays at the [[small forward]] and [[shooting guard]] positions, but he is versatile enough to play at the [[point guard]] as he often plays a [[point forward]] role.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Happy Valley, South Australia|Happy Valley]], Ingles played junior basketball for the Southern Tigers. Ingles attended both [[UC Senior Secondary College Lake Ginninderra|Lake Ginninderra College]] and the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) in Canberra with future [[Australia men's national basketball team|Boomers]] teammate [[Brad Newley]]. He played basketball for the AIS in 2005 and 2006. Along with basketball, Ingles also played [[Australian rules football]] and [[cricket]] in his younger years but gave up both sports to focus on basketball.<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/sports/2398908-155/monson-utah-jazzs-regular-joe-ingles Utah Jazz\u2019s regular Joe Ingles is anything but ordinary]</ref>\n\nIngles' two basketball goals as a boy were to play for the [[Adelaide 36ers]] and Australia. He was highly sought after when he came out of the AIS in 2006, and he subsequently met with the 36ers as a 17-year-old, but a couple of Adelaide blunders set him off interstate. Ingles said of the situation, \"The minimum salary at the time was $20\u2013$22,000 and while money wasn't a primary concern for me, they offered me a two-year deal at $12,500 per, plus two season tickets.\" Ingles had several other contract bids to consider, all offering at least the minimum and many of them providing additional incentives. His decision to not sign with the 36ers came when his contract from the club arrived with his name misspelt. It did not leave a glowing impression on Ingles or his family, so he moved his attention to Melbourne.<ref>[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/basketball/jo-ingles-still-hopes-to-play-for-the-adelaide-36ers-one-day/news-story/c1c024525bc4493f9ab885e2481b307f Joe Ingles still hopes to play for the Adelaide 36ers one day]</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===South Dragons (2006-2009)===\nOn 17 March 2006, Ingles signed a multi-year deal with the [[South Dragons]] of the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]], becoming the very first player to sign with the club.<ref name=dragons>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/Sport/Dragons-make-inaugural-NBL-signing/2006/03/17/1142098654414.html Dragons make inaugural NBL signing]</ref> In the Dragons' debut game, the 18-year-old Ingles made league history by scoring the most points by an Australian on debut \u2013 29, on 11-of-15 shooting from the field.

professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Utah Jazz]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He also represents the [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australian national team]]. He primarily plays at the [[small forward]] and [[shooting guard]] positions, but he is versatile enough to play at the [[point guard]] as he often plays a [[point forward]] role.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Happy Valley, South Australia|Happy Valley]], Ingles played junior basketball for the Southern Tigers. Ingles attended both [[UC Senior Secondary College Lake Ginninderra|Lake Ginninderra College]] and the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) in Canberra with future [[Australia men's national basketball team|Boomers]] teammate [[Brad Newley]]. He played basketball for the AIS in 2005 and 2006. Along with basketball, Ingles also played [[Australian rules football]] and [[cricket]] in his younger years but gave up both sports to focus on basketball.<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/sports/2398908-155/monson-utah-jazzs-regular-joe-ingles Utah Jazz\u2019s regular Joe Ingles is anything but ordinary]</ref>\n\nIngles' two basketball goals as a boy were to play for the [[Adelaide 36ers]] and Australia. He was highly sought after when he came out of the AIS in 2006, and he subsequently met with the 36ers as a 17-year-old, but a couple of Adelaide blunders set him off interstate. Ingles said of the situation, \"The minimum salary at the time was $20\u2013$22,000 and while money wasn't a primary concern for me, they offered me a two-year deal at $12,500 per, plus two season tickets.\" Ingles had several other contract bids to consider, all offering at least the minimum and many of them providing additional incentives. His decision to not sign with the 36ers came when his contract from the club arrived with his name misspelt. It did not leave a glowing impression on Ingles or his family, so he moved his attention to Melbourne.<ref>[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/basketball/jo-ingles-still-hopes-to-play-for-the-adelaide-36ers-one-day/news-story/c1c024525bc4493f9ab885e2481b307f Joe Ingles still hopes to play for the Adelaide 36ers one day]</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n===South Dragons (2006-2009)===\nOn 17 March 2006, Ingles signed a multi-year deal with the [[South Dragons]] of the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]], becoming the very first player to sign with the club.<ref name=dragons>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/Sport/Dragons-make-inaugural-NBL-signing/2006/03/17/1142098654414.html Dragons make inaugural NBL signing]</ref> In the Dragons' debut game, the 18-year-old Ingles made league history by scoring the most points by an Australian on debut \u2013 29, on 11-of-15 shooting from the field.

The two brothers were separated when Sinatra's parents gave Marlon up for adoption. The two brothers never met until their friendship in their careers in entertainment. After their deaths, tests showed their DNA to be related. \n\nBorn to Italian immigrants in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], Sinatra began his musical career in the [[swing era]] with bandleaders [[Harry James]] and [[Tommy Dorsey]]. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"[[Bobby soxer (music)|bobby soxers]]\". He released his debut album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to [[Las Vegas]], where he became one of its best known [[concert residency|residency]] performers as part of the [[Rat Pack]]. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with his performance subsequently winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958), ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' (1958) and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'' (1960).\n\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, [[Reprise Records]], and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, ''[[September of My Years]]'' and starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]''. After releasing ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', recorded at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Vegas with frequent collaborator [[Count Basie]] in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''. It was followed by 1968's ''[[Francis A. & Edward K.]]'' with [[Duke Ellington]]. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at [[Caesars Palace]], and released \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.\n\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', he starred in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1971. On television, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia.\n\nWhile Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife [[Ava Gardner]]. He later married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966 and [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Marx]] in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He was collectively included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's compilation [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.]] After Sinatra's death, American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\",<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}\n\n== Early life ==\n{{Main|Early life of Frank Sinatra}}\n\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"They'd fought through his childhood and continued to do so until her dying day.

His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a \"certain feeling\" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}}\n\nBy the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: \"Air for Oboe\", \"Air for English Horn\", \"Air for Flute\", \"Air for Bassoon\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Theme and Variations\".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard \"a couple of little strangers\" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody \"This Happy Madness\", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra & Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nVoice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, \"He has far more voice than people think he has.

His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was \"virtually undetectable\", with his diction becoming \"precise\" and articulation \"meticulous\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to \"toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would \"take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars.\" Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95\u201396}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59\u201360}}\n[[File:(Portrait of Frank Sinatra and Axel Stordahl, Liederkrantz Hall, New York, N.Y., ca. 1947) (LOC) (4843758568).jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra with Axel Stordahl at the Liederkrantz Hall in New York, {{circa}} 1947]]\n\nArrangers Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a \"perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly\", and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', \"if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday\". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a \"rhythm\" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28\u201329}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as \"Isn't that a pretty ballad\" or \"Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song\", delivered with \"childlike delight\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be \"in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers.

Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was \"not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=69}} Author Granata considered Sinatra a \"master of the art of recording\", noting that his work in the studio \"set him apart from other gifted vocalists\". During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii\u2013xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as \"the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s\", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an \"ultra-sensitive\" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. As disc jockey [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] said, \"Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length\". In the words of author John Lahr, \"As many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69\u201370}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, \"Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs. Track after track, the brilliant concept albums redefined the nature of pop vocal art\".{{Sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=239}}\n\n== Film career ==\n{{See also|Frank Sinatra filmography}}\n\n=== Debut, musical films, and career slump (1941\u20131952) ===\n\n[[File:Frank Sinatra in Till the Clouds Roll By.jpg|thumb|left|Sinatra in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]\n\nSinatra attempted to pursue an acting career in Hollywood in the early 1940s.

Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"[[Bobby soxer (music)|bobby soxers]]\". He released his debut album, ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', in 1946. But by the early 1950s his professional career had stalled and he turned to [[Las Vegas]], where he became one of its best known [[concert residency|residency]] performers as part of the [[Rat Pack]]. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', with his performance subsequently winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including ''[[In the Wee Small Hours]]'' (1955), ''[[Songs for Swingin' Lovers!]]'' (1956), ''[[Come Fly with Me (Frank Sinatra album)|Come Fly with Me]]'' (1958), ''[[Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely]]'' (1958) and ''[[Nice 'n' Easy]]'' (1960).\n\nSinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, [[Reprise Records]], and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album, ''[[September of My Years]]'' and starred in the [[Emmy]]-winning television special ''[[Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music]]''. After releasing ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'', recorded at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino]] in Vegas with frequent collaborator [[Count Basie]] in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with [[Tom Jobim]], the album ''[[Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]]''. It was followed by 1968's ''[[Francis A. & Edward K.]]'' with [[Duke Ellington]]. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at [[Caesars Palace]], and released \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured both within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.\n\nSinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', he starred in ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), and ''[[Pal Joey (film)|Pal Joey]]'' (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward the end of his career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in ''[[Tony Rome]]'' (1967). Sinatra would later receive the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1971. On television, ''[[The Frank Sinatra Show (ABC TV series)|The Frank Sinatra Show]]'' began on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the Mafia.\n\nWhile Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. His bright blue eyes earned him the popular nickname \"Ol' Blue Eyes\". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife [[Ava Gardner]]. He later married [[Mia Farrow]] in 1966 and [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Marx]] in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1983, was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven [[Grammy Awards]], including the [[Grammy Trustees Award]], [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. He was collectively included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's compilation [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|of the 20th century's 100 most influential people.]] After Sinatra's death, American music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called him \"the greatest singer of the 20th century\",<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.{{sfn|Rojek|2004|p=1}}\n\n== Early life ==\n{{Main|Early life of Frank Sinatra}}\n\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"They'd fought through his childhood and continued to do so until her dying day.

His personal favorite was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=93}} He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a \"certain feeling\" to perform live surrounded by musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=112}}\n\nBy the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an [[air check]] of some compositions by [[Alec Wilder]] which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: \"Air for Oboe\", \"Air for English Horn\", \"Air for Flute\", \"Air for Bassoon\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Theme and Variations\".{{efn|Mitch Miller played English horn and oboe on the Sinatra-led recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}}}} The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} At one recording session with arranger [[Claus Ogerman]] and an orchestra, Sinatra heard \"a couple of little strangers\" in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors.{{sfn|Lees|1998|p=102}} Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist and the author of the words to the Jobim melody \"This Happy Madness\", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on ''[[Sinatra & Company]]'' (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nVoice coach John Quinlan was impressed by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, \"He has far more voice than people think he has.

His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was \"virtually undetectable\", with his diction becoming \"precise\" and articulation \"meticulous\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=11}} His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to \"toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric\".{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=13}}  Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would \"take a musical phrase and play it all the way through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars.\" Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone,{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=95\u201396}} and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=59\u201360}}\n[[File:(Portrait of Frank Sinatra and Axel Stordahl, Liederkrantz Hall, New York, N.Y., ca. 1947) (LOC) (4843758568).jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra with Axel Stordahl at the Liederkrantz Hall in New York, {{circa}} 1947]]\n\nArrangers Nelson Riddle and Anthony Fanzo found Sinatra to be a \"perfectionist who drove himself and everybody around him relentlessly\", and stated that his collaborators approached him with a sense of uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=234}}  Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=50}} On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=105}}  After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and was always looking for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told [[Sammy Cahn]], who wrote songs for ''Anchors Aweigh'', \"if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday\". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by [[Jule Styne]], and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nUnlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it was a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it was a \"rhythm\" number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior.{{sfn|Friedwald|1995|pp=28\u201329}} Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter at the end of each number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as \"Isn't that a pretty ballad\" or \"Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song\", delivered with \"childlike delight\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=140}} She states that after each show, Sinatra would be \"in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given\".{{sfn|Sinatra|2011|p=142}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=\"His voice is more interesting now: he has separated his voice into different colors, in different registers.

During his career he made over 1000 recordings.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=xiii\u2013xvi}} Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for them by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound.{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=36}} During his Columbia years Sinatra used an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as \"the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s\", though when performing on talk shows later he used a bullet-shaped [[RCA Type 77-DX microphone|RCA 77]].{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=37}} At Capitol he used a [[Neumann U47]], an \"ultra-sensitive\" microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.{{sfn|Granata|2003|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Sinatra's career was facilitated by developments in technology. As disc jockey [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] said, \"Never before had there been an opportunity for a popular singer to express emotions at an extended length\". In the words of author John Lahr, \"As many as sixteen songs could be held by the twelve-inch L.P., and this allowed Sinatra to use song in a novelistic way, turning each track in a kind of chapter, which built and counterpointed moods to illuminate a larger theme\".{{sfn|Lahr|2000|pp=69\u201370}} Santopietro writes that through the 1950s and well into the 1960s, \"Every Sinatra LP was a masterpiece of one sort of another, whether uptempo, torch song, or swingin' affairs.
