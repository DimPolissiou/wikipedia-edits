He moved to London in 1906, to become a clerk in the [[Post Office Savings Bank]] at [[Blythe House]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He was a member of the [[London GAA]], through which  HE DIED he became associated with the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] and the [[Gaelic League]]. He returned to Ireland in 1916 and fought in the [[Easter Rising]]. He was subsequently imprisoned in the [[Frongoch internment camp]] as a [[prisoner of war]], but was released in December 1916.\n\nCollins rose through the ranks of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] after his release from Frongoch. He became a [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] for [[South Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cork]] in [[1918 Irish general election|1918]], and was appointed [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] in the [[First D\u00e1il]]. He was present when the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il]] convened on 21 January 1919 and [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the [[Irish Republic]]. In the ensuing [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], he was Director of Organisation and Adjutant General for the Irish Volunteers, and Director of Intelligence of the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]]. He gained fame as a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategist, planning and directing many successful attacks on British forces, such as the [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|\"Bloody Sunday\" assassinations]] of key British intelligence agents in November 1920.\n\nAfter the July 1921 ceasefire, Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]] were sent to London by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] to negotiate peace terms. The resulting [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] established the [[Irish Free State]] but depended on an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] to [[the Crown]], a condition with which de Valera and other republican leaders had difficulty reconciling. Collins viewed the treaty as offering \"the freedom to achieve freedom\", and persuaded a majority in the [[Second D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il]] to ratify the treaty. A [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|provisional government]] was formed under his [[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|chairmanship]] in early 1922 but was soon disrupted by the [[Irish Civil War]], in which Collins was [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]]. He was shot and killed in an ambush by anti-treaty forces on 22 August 1922.\n\n==Early years==\nCollins was born in [[Michael Collins Birthplace|Woodfield, Sam's Cross]], near [[Clonakilty]] [[County Cork]], on 16 October 1890,<ref name=birth>{{cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/birth_returns/births_1890/02404/1896440.pdf|title=16th October 1890 \u2013 Birth of Michael Collins|work=Civil Records on Irish Genealogy Site|accessdate=27 May 2017}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|name=n 1|His gravestone in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] erroneously gives his birth date as 12 October 1890.}} the third son and youngest of eight children.

Collins is fifth from the right with an 'x' over his head.]]\n\nThe struggle for [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule]], along with labour unrest, had led to the formation in 1913 of two major nationalist paramilitary groups who later launched the [[Easter Rising]]: the [[Irish Citizen Army]] was established by [[James Connolly]], [[James Larkin]] and his [[Irish Transport and General Workers Union]] (ITGWU) to protect strikers from the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] during the [[1913 Dublin Lockout]]. The [[Irish Volunteers]] were created in the same year by nationalists in response to the formation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF), an [[Ulster loyalist]] body pledged to oppose Home Rule by force.\n\nAn organiser of considerable intelligence, Collins had become highly respected in the IRB. This led to his appointment as financial advisor to [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]], father of one of the [[Easter Rising]]'s organisers, [[Joseph Plunkett]]. Collins took part in preparing arms and drilling troops for the insurrection.\n\nThe Rising was Collins' first appearance in national events. When it commenced on [[Easter Monday]] 1916, Collins served as Joseph Plunkett's aide-de-camp at the rebellion's headquarters in the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]] (GPO) in [[Dublin]]. There he fought alongside [[Patrick Pearse]], James Connolly, and other members of the Rising leadership. The Rising was put down after six days, but the insurgents achieved their goal of holding their positions for the minimum time required to justify a claim to independence under international criteria.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first= Kathleen|title=Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman|publisher=Dublin: O'Brien Press Ltd |year=2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Collins was arrested and taken into British custody. He was processed at Dublin's [[Richmond Barracks]] by \"[[G Division (Dublin Metropolitan Police)|G-Men]]\", plain-clothes officers from [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]]. During his screening, Collins was identified as someone who should be selected for further interrogation, harsher treatment, or execution. However, he overheard his name being called out so he moved to the other side of the building to identify the speaker. In doing so, he joined the group that was transferred to [[Frongoch internment camp]] in Wales, a movement that historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] describes as \"one of the luckiest escapes of his life.\"<ref name=\"TP\">{{cite book|authorlink=Tim Pat Coogan|first= Tim Pat|last=Coogan|title=Michael Collins: A Biography|page= 50|publisher=Arrow|year=2015|isbn= 978-1784753269}}</ref>\n\nCollins first began to emerge as a major figure in the vacuum created by the executions of the 1916 leadership. He began hatching plans for \"next time\" even before the prison ships left Dublin.<ref>{{citebook|first= Margery|last= Forester|quote= Nancy O'Brien cousin of Michael Collins|title=The Lost Leader|publisher= Gill & MacMillan, Limited|year= 2006|isbn= 978-0717140145}}</ref>\n\nAt Frongoch he was one of the organisers of a program of protest and non-cooperation with authorities, similar to that later carried on by IRA internees in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s. The camp proved an excellent opportunity for networking with [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical-force republicans]] from all over the country, of which he became a key organiser.<ref name=\"TP\"/><ref>Teilifl\u00eds Gaeltachta / Radio Teilifl\u00eda \u00c9ireann \"An gCoilaiste R\u00e9abhloid\" 2010</ref>\n\nWhile some celebrated the fact that a rising had happened at all, believing in Pearse's theory of \"blood sacrifice\" (namely that the deaths of the Rising's leaders would inspire others), Collins railed against the military blunders made, such as the seizure of indefensible and very vulnerable positions like [[St Stephen's Green]], which were impossible to escape from and difficult to supply. Public outcry placed pressure on the British government to end the internment. In December 1916, the Frongoch prisoners were sent home.\n\n==1917\u20131918==\nBefore his death, [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], first signatory of the 1916 Proclamation and widely considered the Rising's foremost organiser, had designated his wife [[Kathleen Clarke]] as the official caretaker of Rising official business, in the event that the leadership did not survive. By June 1916, Mrs. Clarke had sent out the first post-Rising communiqu\u00e9 to the IRB, declaring the Rising to be only the beginning and directing nationalists to prepare for \"the next blow.\" Soon after his release Mrs. Clarke appointed Collins Secretary to the National Aid and Volunteers Dependents Fund (NAVDF) and subsequently passed on to him the secret organisational information and contacts which she had held in trust for the independence movement.\n\n[[File:Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Michael Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]]]]\n\nCollins became one of the leading figures in the post-Rising independence movement spearheaded by [[Arthur Griffith]], editor/publisher of the main [[nationalist]] newspaper [[The United Irishman]], (which Collins had read avidly as a boy.)<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\">Coogan, TP. ''Michael Collins'', 1990</ref> Griffith's organisation [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] had been founded in 1905 as an umbrella group to unify all the various factions within the nationalist movement.\n\nUnder Griffith's policy, Collins and other advocates of the \"physical-force\" approach to independence gained the cooperation of non-violent Sinn F\u00e9in, while agreeing to disagree with Griffith's moderate ideas of a [[dual monarchy]] solution based on the Hungarian model.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Feeney, Brian. ''Sinn Fein: a Hundred Turbulent Years'', Dublin; O'Brien Press Ltd., 2002</ref> The British government and mainstream Irish media had wrongly blamed Sinn F\u00e9in for the Rising. This attracted Rising participants to join the organisation in order to exploit the reputation with which such British propaganda had imbued the organisation. By October 1917 Collins had risen to become a member of the executive of Sinn F\u00e9in and director of organisation for the [[Irish Volunteers]]. [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], another veteran of 1916, stood for the presidency of Sinn F\u00e9in against Griffith, who stepped aside and supported de Valera's presidency.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n==First D\u00e1il==\n[[File:First dail restoration3.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|''Members of the First D\u00e1il'' <br /> First row, left to right: [[Laurence Ginnell]], Michael Collins, [[Cathal Brugha]], [[Arthur Griffith]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]], [[Eoin MacNeill]], [[W. T. Cosgrave]], [[Kevin O'Higgins]] (third row, right)]]\n\nIn the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] Sinn F\u00e9in swept the polls throughout much of Ireland, with many seats uncontested, and formed an overwhelming parliamentary majority in Ireland. Like many senior Sinn F\u00e9in representatives Collins was elected as an MP (for [[South Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|Cork South]]) with the right to sit in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in London. Unlike their rivals in the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP), Sinn F\u00e9in MPs had announced that they would not take their seats in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] but instead would set up an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in Dublin.<ref name=\"elecs_irl\">{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=6695|title=Michael Collins|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nBefore the new body's first meeting, Collins, tipped off by his network of spies, warned his colleagues of plans to arrest all its members in overnight raids. De Valera and others ignored the warnings on the argument that, if the arrests happened, they would constitute a [[propaganda]] coup. The intelligence proved accurate and de Valera, along with Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who followed his advice, were arrested; Collins and others evaded incarceration.\n\nThe new parliament, called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (meaning \"Assembly of Ireland\", see [[First D\u00e1il]]) met in the [[Mansion House, Dublin]] in January 1919. In de Valera's absence, [[Cathal Brugha]] was elected [[Pr\u00edomh Aire]] ('First' or 'Prime' Minister but often translated as 'President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann'). The following April, Collins engineered de Valera's escape from [[Lincoln (HM Prison)|Lincoln Prison]] in England, after which Brugha was replaced by de Valera.\n\nNo [[Nation state|state]] gave diplomatic recognition to the 1919 Republic, despite sustained lobbying in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by de Valera and prominent [[Irish-Americans]] and at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris peace conference]]. In January 1919 the D\u00e1il ratified the [[Irish Republican Army]]'s (IRA) claim to be the army of the [[Irish Republic]]. The IRA had begun a military campaign coincidentally on the same day as the D\u00e1il's first sitting with the [[Soloheadbeg Ambush]], and the IRA's respect for the D\u00e1il's authority was highly conditional. (The Irish Volunteers began to be referred to as the IRA since their internment at Frongoch. Up until the Civil War, the two terms were used interchangeably.)\n\n==Minister for Finance==\nDe Valera appointed Collins as [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] in the [[Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] in 1919.<ref>Mackay, p. 116</ref> Most of the ministries existed only on paper or as one or two people working in a room of a private house, given the circumstances of war in which they were liable to be arrested or killed by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], [[British Army]], [[Black and Tans]] or [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]].\n\nDespite that, Collins managed to produce a Finance Ministry that was able to organise a large bond issue in the form of a \"National Loan\" to fund the new Irish Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://generalmichaelcollins.com/National_Loan/National_Loan_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515172519/http://generalmichaelcollins.com/National_Loan/National_Loan_1.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }} Collins 22 Society Page on \"The National Loan 1920\"</ref> According to [[Batt O'Connor]], the D\u00e1il Loan raised almost \u00a3400,000, of which \u00a325,000 was in gold.

The gold was kept under the floor of O'Connor's house until 1922.<ref>[http://aubanehistoricalsociety.org] O'Connor, Batt.

The jewels remained in a Dublin safe, forgotten by all sides, until the 1930s, when they were found by chance.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==War of Independence==\nThe [[Irish War of Independence]] in effect began on the day that the First D\u00e1il convened, 21 January 1919.

The two policemen were shot dead during the engagement. This ambush is considered the first action in the Irish War of Independence.<ref>Breen, Dan. ''My Fight For Irish Freedom'', Dublin, Talbot Press 1924</ref> The engagement had no advance authorisation from the nascent government.

That summer he was elected president of the IRB (and therefore, in the doctrine of that organisation, {{lang|la|de jure}} President of the Irish Republic). In September, he was made Director of [[espionage|Intelligence]] for the [[Irish Republican Army]] which now had a mandate to pursue an armed campaign, as the official military of the Irish nation. With [[Cathal Brugha]] as Minister of Defence, Collins became Director of Organisation and Adjutant General of the Volunteers. Collins spent much of this period helping to organise the Volunteers as an effective military force, and concentrating on forcing the RIC&nbsp;\u2013 which represented British authority in Ireland&nbsp;\u2013 out of isolated barracks and seizing their weapons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|title=The Roots and Consequences of 20th-Century Warfare: Conflicts that Shaped the Modern World|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1610698023|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3nEDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA97|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> Collins was determined to avoid the massive destruction, military and civilian losses for merely symbolic victories that had characterised the 1916 Rising. Instead, he directed a guerrilla war against the British, suddenly attacking then just as quickly withdrawing, minimising losses and maximising effectiveness.<ref>Michael Collins, personal correspondence 1916\u201317</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Barry, Tom. ''Guerrilla Days in Ireland'', Dublin, Irish Press 1949</ref>\n\nThe Crown responded with escalation of the war, with the importation of special forces such as the \"[[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]]\", the \"[[Black and Tans]]\", the \"[[Cairo Gang]]\", and others. Officially or unofficially, many of these groups were given a free hand to institute a reign of terror, shooting Irish people indiscriminately, invading homes, looting and burning.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>[[Kathleen Clarke|Clarke, Kathleen]]. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'', O'Brien Press 2008</ref>\n\nAs the war began in earnest, de Valera travelled to the United States for an extended speaking tour to raise funds for the outlawed Republican government. It was in publicity for this tour that de Valera (who had been elected [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|Pr\u00edomh Aire]] by the D\u00e1il) was first referred to as \"President\". While financially successful, grave political conflicts followed in de Valera's wake there which threatened the unity of Irish-American support for the rebels. Some members of the IRB also objected to the use of the presidential title because their organisation's constitution had a different definition of that title.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref>Clarke, Kathleen. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'', Dublin O'Brien Press Ltd 2008</ref>\n\nBack in Ireland, Collins arranged the \"National Loan\", organised the IRA, effectively led the government, and managed arms-smuggling operations. Local guerrilla units received supplies, training and had largely a free hand to develop the war in their own region. These were the \"flying columns\" who comprised the bulk of the War of Independence rank and file in the south-west. Collins, [[Dick McKee]] and regional commanders such as [[Dan Breen]] and [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] oversaw tactics and general strategy. There were also regional organisers, such as Ernie O'Malley and Liam Mellows, who reported directly to Collins at St Ita's secret basement GHQ in central Dublin.<ref>E O'Malley. ''On Another Man's Wound'', (Dublin 1937)</ref> They were supported by a vast intelligence network of men and women in all walks of life that reached deep into the British administration in Ireland.<ref>[[Tom Barry (soldier)|Barry, Tom]].

''Florence and Josephine O'Donoghue's War of Independence'', Dublin, Irish Academic Press, 2006</ref>\n[[File:General Collins.jpg|upright|thumb|Collins inspects a soldier.]]\nIt was at this time that Collins created a special [[assassination]] unit called [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]] expressly to kill British agents and informers. Collins was criticised for these tactics but cited the universal war-time practice of executing enemy spies who were, in his words, \"hunting victims for execution.\" Campaigning for Irish independence, even non-violently, was still targeted both by prosecutions under British law entailing the death penalty and also by extrajudicial killings such as that of [[Tomas MacCurtain]], nationalist mayor of Cork City.\n\nIn 1920 the British offered [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]10,000 (equivalent to GB\u00a3300,000 / \u20ac360,000 in 2010) for information leading to Collins' capture or death. He evaded capture and continued to strike against British forces, often operating from safe-houses near government buildings, such as Vaughan's and [[An Stad]].\n\nIn 1920, following Westminster's prominent announcements that it had the Irish insurgents on the run, Collins and his Squad killed several British secret service agents in a series of coordinated raids. In retaliation, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary went to Croke Park, where a G.A.A. football match was taking place between Dublin and Tipperary. The police officers opened fire on the crowd, killing twelve and wounding sixty.  This event became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]]. A stampede of panicking British operatives sought the shelter of [[Dublin Castle]] next day. About the same time, Tom Barry's 3rd Cork Brigade took no prisoners in a bitter battle with British forces at [[Kilmichael Ambush|Kilmichael]]. In many regions, the RIC and other crown forces became all but confined to the strongest barracks in the larger towns as rural areas came increasingly under rebel control.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/><ref>[[Neligan, David]].

In addition, Britain's efforts at a military solution had already resulted in a powerful peace movement, which demanded an end to the unrest in Ireland. Prominent voices calling for negotiation included the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], ''[[The Times]]'' and other leading periodicals, members of the [[House of Lords]], [[English Catholics]], and famous authors such as [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref>Cabinet Office, (Westminster government) London</ref><ref>British Cabinet minutes, 1921</ref>\n\nStill, it was not the British government that initiated negotiations. Individual English activists, including clergy, made private overtures which reached Arthur Griffith. Griffith expressed his welcome for dialogue. The British MP [[Brigadier General Cockerill]] sent an open letter to Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] that was printed in the Times, outlining how a peace conference with the Irish should be organised. The Pope made an urgent public appeal for a negotiated end to the violence. Whether or not Lloyd George welcomed such advisors, he could no longer hold out against this tide.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/>\n\nIn July, Lloyd George's government [[Irish War of Independence#Truce: July\u2013December 1921|offered a truce]]. Arrangements were made for a conference between British government and the leaders of the yet-unrecognised Republic. There remains uncertainty as to the two sides' capability to have carried on the conflict much longer. Collins told Hamar Greenwood after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty: \"You had us dead beat. We could not have lasted another three weeks. When we were told of the offer of a truce we were astonished. We thought you must have gone mad\".<ref>L. S. Amery, ''My Political Life. Volume Two: War and Peace 1914\u20131929'' (London: Hutchinson, 1953), p. 230.</ref> However he stated on the record that \"there will be no compromise and no negotiations with any British Government until Ireland is recognised as an independent republic. The same effort that would get us Dominion Home Rule will get us a republic.\"<ref>Michael Collins, quoted by columnist CW Ackerman August 1920</ref> At no time had the D\u00e1il or the IRA asked for a conference or a truce.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Deasy, Liam. ''Brother Against Brother''</ref>\n\nHowever, the D\u00e1il as a whole was less uncompromising. It decided to proceed to a peace conference, although it was ascertained in the preliminary stages that a fully independent republic would not be on the table and that the loss of some northeastern counties was a foregone conclusion.<ref>Phoenix, Eamonn. ''Michael Collins \u2013 The Northern Question 1916\u201322'', in. ''Michael Collins and the Making of the Irish State'', (Doherty & Keogh, editors)</ref>\n\nMany of the rebel forces on the ground first heard of the Truce when it was announced in the newspapers and this gave rise to the first fissures in nationalist unity, which had serious consequences later on. They felt they had not been included in consultations regarding its terms.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/><ref>O'Donoghue, Florence. ''No Other Law'', Dublin, Irish Press 1954</ref>\n\nDe Valera was widely acknowledged as the most skillful negotiator on the D\u00e1il government side and he participated in the initial parlays, agreeing the basis on which talks could begin. The first meetings were held in strict secrecy soon after the Customs House battle, with Andrew Cope representing Dublin Castle's British authorities. Later, de Valera travelled to London for the first official contact with Lloyd George. The two met one-on-one in a private meeting, the proceedings of which have never been revealed.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceG\">Neligan, David. ''The Spy In the Castle'', London, Prendeville Publishing 1999</ref>\n\nDuring this Truce period, de Valera sued for official designation as President of the Irish Republic and obtained it from the D\u00e1il in August 1921, in place of the title which had previously been used of [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat. ''The IRA: A History'', p. 76</ref> Not long after, the Cabinet was obliged to select the delegation that would travel to the London peace conference and negotiate a treaty. In an extraordinary departure from his usual role, de Valera adamantly declined to attend, insisting instead that Collins should take his place there, along with Arthur Griffith.<ref>British Cabinet minutes, memoranda</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}<ref>De Valera, Eamonn, correspondence to Michael Collins, 13 July 1921</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nCollins resisted the appointment, protesting that he was \"a soldier, not a politician\" and that his exposure to the London authorities would reduce his effectiveness as a guerrilla leader should hostilities resume. (He had kept his public visibility to a minimum during the conduct of the war; up to this time the British still had very few reliable photographs of him.)<ref name=\"ReferenceH\">O'Connor, Batt. ''With Michael Collins in the Fight For Irish Independence'', 1929</ref> The Cabinet of seven split on the issue, with de Valera casting the deciding vote. Many of Collins's associates warned him not to go, that he was being set up as a political scapegoat. Following intense soul-searching and all-night consultations with his most trusted advisors, he resolved to attend \"in the spirit of a soldier obeying orders.\" In private correspondence he foresaw the catastrophe ahead: \"Let them make a scapegoat or whatever they like of me. Someone must go.\"\n\n==Anglo-Irish Treaty==\n[[File:Michael Collins 1921.jpg|right|thumb|Collins in [[London]] as delegate to the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] negotiations.]]\nThe Irish delegates sent  to London were designated as \"plenipotentiaries\", meaning that they had full authority to sign an agreement on behalf of the D\u00e1il government. The Treaty would then be subject to approval by the D\u00e1il.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Jeremy|title=Britain and Ireland: From Home Rule to Independence|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317884934|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbqOAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA128|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> The majority of the delegates, including [[Arthur Griffith]] (leader), [[Robert Barton]] and [[Eamonn Duggan]] (with [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]] as Secretary General to the delegation) set up headquarters at 22 [[Hans Place]] in [[Knightsbridge]] on 11 October 1921. Collins shared quarters at 15 Cadogan Gardens with the delegation's publicity department, secretary [[Diarmuid O'Hegarty]], [[Joseph McGrath (Irish politician)|Joseph McGrath]] as well as substantial intelligence and bodyguard personnel including [[Liam Tobin]], Tom Cullen, [[Eamon Broy|Ned Broy]], [[Emmet Dalton]] and Joseph Dolan of [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]].<ref>Mackay, p. 217</ref>\n\nThe British team were led by their Prime Minister Lloyd George, the Colonial Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] and [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|F. E. Smith]]. During two months of arduous negotiations the Irish delegates made frequent crossings between London and Dublin to confer with their D\u00e1il colleagues, and Collins's correspondence reflects his frustration at D\u00e1il debates and the Irish delegate's inability to agree clear instruction as to whether or not they should accept a treaty.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins''</ref> \n\nIn November, with the London peace talks still in progress, Collins attended a large meeting of regional IRA commanders at Parnell Place in Dublin. In a private conference he informed [[Liam Deasy]], [[Florence O'Donoghue]] and [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] that there would have to be some compromise in the current negotiations in London. \"There was no question of our getting all the demands we were making.\" He was advised by Lynch not to bring this out in the full assembly. Reviewing subsequent events, Deasy later doubted the wisdom of that advice.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> \n\nThe negotiations ultimately resulted in the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] which was signed on 6 December 1921. The agreement provided for a [[Dominion]] status \"[[Irish Free State]]\", whose relationship to the British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] would be modelled after Canada's. This was a compromise, half-way between an independent republic and a province of the Empire. The Treaty was signed under considerable pressure from the British. The negotiators had agreed at the cabinet meeting in Dublin that they would not sign the Treaty without bringing it back for the Dail cabinet to ratify. But once back in London on December 5th at 7:30 pm, Lloyd George told them it was immediate signature or 'immediate and terrible war' and that he had to know by the next day. The Treaty was signed at 2:20 am, December 6, 1921. <ref>Frank Pakenham, Peace by Ordeal, (1972) p.245-247</ref>\n\nThe settlement overturned the Act of Union by recognising the native Irish legislature's independence. Under a [[bicameral parliament]], executive authority would remain vested in the king, represented in Ireland by a [[Governor General]], but exercised by an Irish government elected by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a \"[[lower house]]\". British forces would depart the Free State forthwith and be replaced by an Irish army. Along with an independent judiciary, the Treaty granted the new Free State greater [[independence]] than any Irish state, and went well beyond the Home Rule which had been sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] or by his [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] successors John Redmond and John Dillon.\n\nThe Treaty acknowledged the partition of Ireland. Before Treaty negotiations had concluded, executive powers had already been passed to the government of [[Northern Ireland]] created under the [[Government of Ireland Act]] in 1920. <ref>Ronan, Fanning, The Fatal Path, British Government and Irish Revolution 1910-1922, p288</ref> Northern Ireland, which had a majority [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] population, could opt out of the Free State, a year after the signing of the Treaty. An [[Irish Boundary Commission]] was to be established to draw a border, 'in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants' and \u2018economic and geographic conditions\u2019.<ref>Liam Weeks, Michael O Fatharthaigh, The Treaty, p.279</ref> Collins anticipated a redrawing of the border would result in much of the south and west of Northern Ireland becoming part of the Free State, making Northern Ireland economically non-viable,and facilitating the reunification of the 32 counties in the near future.<ref>Phoenix, Eamonn. ''Michael Collins \u2013 The Northern Question 1916\u201322'', in. ''Michael Collins and the Making of the Irish State'', (Doherty & Keogh, editors)</ref>\n\nCollins argued that he had signed the Treaty as the alternative was a war that the Irish people did not want. 'I say that rejection of the Treaty is a declaration of war until you have beaten the British Empire, apart from any alternative document. Rejection of the Treaty means your national policy is war.... The Treaty was signed by me, not because they held up the alternative of immediate war. I signed it because I would not be one of those to commit the Irish people to war without the Irish people committing themselves to war'. <ref>Dail Debate on Treaty 19 December 1921, https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-19/2/</ref>  While the Treaty fell short of the republic for which he had fought, Collins concluded that the Treaty offered Ireland \"not the freedom that all nations desire and develop to, but the freedom to achieve it.\" .<ref>Collins, Michael. ''The Path To Freedom'', Cork, Mercier 1968</ref> \n\nNonetheless, he knew that elements of the Treaty would cause controversy in Ireland. Upon signing the treaty, F. E. Smith remarked \"I may have signed my political death warrant tonight\". Collins replied \"I may have signed my actual death warrant\".<ref name=\"generalmichaelcollins.com\" />\n\n===Treaty debates===\n\nThis remark encapsulated his acknowledgement that the Treaty was a compromise that would be vulnerable to charges of \"sell-out\" from purist Republicans. It did not establish the fully independent republic that Collins himself had shortly before demanded as a non-negotiable condition. The \"physical force republicans\" who made up the bulk of the army which had fought the British to a draw would be loath to accept dominion status within the [[British Empire]] or an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] that mentioned the King. Also controversial was the British retention of [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] on the south coast of Ireland for the [[Royal Navy]]. These factors diminished Irish sovereignty and threatened to allow British interference in Ireland's foreign policy. Collins and Griffith were well aware of these issues and strove tenaciously, against British resistance, to achieve language which could be accepted by all constituents. They succeeded in obtaining an oath to the Irish Free State, with a subsidiary oath of fidelity to the King, rather than to the king unilaterally.\n\nEamon De Valera, the President of the Dail objected to the Treaty on the grounds that it had been signed without cabinet consent and that it secured neither the full independence of Ireland nor Irish unity. <ref>Frank Pakenham, Peace by Ordeal, (1972), p209-211</ref> Collins and his supporters argued that de Valera had refused strenuous pleas from Collins, Griffith and others to lead the London negotiations in person. He had  refused the delegates' continual requests for instruction, and in fact had been at the centre of the original decision to enter negotiations without the possibility of an independent republic on the table.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceI\">O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins'', Dublin, Gill & MacMillan 1980</ref>\n\nThe Treaty controversy split the entire nationalist movement. Sinn F\u00e9in, the D\u00e1il, the IRB and the army each divided into pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The Supreme Council of the IRB had been informed in detail about every facet of the Treaty negotiations and had approved many of its provisions, and they voted unanimously to accept the Treaty with the single notable exception of [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]], later COS of the anti-Treaty IRA.<ref>Coogan, ''Michael Collins'', pp. 236\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe D\u00e1il debated the Treaty bitterly for ten days until it was approved by a vote of 64 to 57.<ref>[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E900003-001/ Debate on the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland...] from University College Cork</ref> Having lost this vote, de Valera announced his intent to withdraw his participation from the D\u00e1il and called on all deputies who had voted against the Treaty to follow him. A substantial number did so, officially splitting the government.\n\nA large part of the Irish Republican Army opposed the Treaty and in March 1922 voted at an Army Convention to reject the authority of the Dail, Collins' GHQ and to elect their own Executive. Anti-Treaty IRA units began to seize buildings and take other guerrilla actions against the Provisional Government. On 14 April 1922, a group of 200 anti-Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin under [[Rory O'Connor (Irish republican)|Rory O'Connor]], a hero of the War of Independence. The [[Four Courts]] was the centre of the Irish courts system, originally under the British and then the Free State. Collins was charged by his Free State colleagues with putting down these insurgents, however, he resisted firing on former comrades and staved off a shooting war throughout this period.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\">Provisional Government minutes, Public Records Office, Dublin</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceK\">O'Donoghue, Florence. ''No Other Law'', Dublin, Irish Press, 1954</ref>\n\nWhile the country teetered on the edge of civil war, continuous meetings were carried on among the various factions from January to June 1922. In these discussions the nationalists strove to resolve the issue without armed conflict. Collins and his close associate, [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) [[Harry Boland]] were among those who worked desperately to heal the rift.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>Fitzpatrick, David. ''Harry Boland's Irish Revolution'', Cork, Cork University Press, 2003</ref>\n\nTo foster military unity, Collins and the IRB established an \"army re-unification committee\", including delegates from pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The still-secret Irish Republican Brotherhood continued to meet, fostering dialogue between pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers. In the IRB's stormy debates on the subject, Collins held out the Constitution of the new Free State as a possible solution. Collins was then in the process of co-writing that document and was striving to make it a republican constitution that included provisions that would allow anti-Treaty TDs to take their seats in good conscience, without any oath concerning the Crown.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/>\n\n==Northern Ireland==\n\nCollins' policy toward Northern Ireland was ambiguous. He told the Dail during the Treaty debates that, 'We have stated we would not coerce the North-East ... Surely we recognise that the North-East corner does exist, and surely our intention was that we should take such steps as would sooner or later lead to mutual understanding. The Treaty has made an effort to deal with it .. on lines that will lead very rapidly to goodwill, and the entry of the North-East under the Irish Parliament. I don't say it is an ideal arrangement, but if our policy is, as has been stated, a policy of non-coercion'. <ref>Dail Debate on Treaty 19 December 1921, https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-19/2/</ref>\n\nHowever he told the Northern Divisions of the IRA in private, early in 1922 that, \u2018although the Treaty may have seemed as an outward expression of partition, the [Provisional Irish] Government plans to make it [partition] impossible\u2026even if it meant smashing the Treaty\u2019. <ref>Donnacha O Beachain, From Partition to Brexit, The Irish Government and Northern Ireland, 2019, p. 13 </ref> Collins' Provisional Government also funded county councils and paid the salaries of teachers in Northern Ireland who recognised the Free State.\n\nIn Northern Ireland in the first half of 1922, there was considerable violence between rival forces along the new border, the IRA on the southern side and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] on the Northern side. There were also many killings of civilians, notably by \"unauthorised loyalist paramilitary forces\" who targeted Catholics. Catholic were also driven out of their jobs, notably in Belfast's shipyards.\n\nIn March, Collins met [[Sir James Craig]], Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, in London. They signed an agreement declaring peace in the north which promised cooperation between Catholics and Protestants in policing and security, a generous budget for restoring Catholics to homes which had been destroyed, and many other measures.<ref>British Cabinet Office</ref> The day after the agreement was published, violence erupted again. A policeman was shot dead in Belfast and in reprisal, police entered Catholic homes nearby and shot residents in their beds, including children. There was no response to Collins's demands for an inquiry. He and his Cabinet warned that they would deem the agreement broken unless Craig took action.<ref>MC official correspondence, 5 and 10 April 1922</ref> In his continual correspondence with Churchill over violence in the north, Collins protested repeatedly that such breaches of the Truce threatened to invalidate the Treaty entirely.<ref>Michael Collins letter to Churchill 6 June 1922</ref> The prospect was real enough that on 3 June 1922 Churchill presented to the Committee of Imperial Defence his plans \"to protect Ulster from invasion by the South.\"<ref>British Cabinet minutes 16/42 Public Records Office, London</ref>\n\nThroughout the early months of 1922, Collins had been sending IRA units to the border and sending arms and money to the northern units of the IRA. Collins joined other IRB and IRA leadership in developing secret plans to launch a clandestine guerrilla war in the northeast. Some British arms that had been supplied to the Provisional government in Dublin were turned over by Collins to IRA units in the north. In May\u2013June 1922 Collins and IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch organised an offensive that would involve mobilising and arming ''both'' pro- and anti-Treaty IRA units along the border area.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-44083967 BBC Northern Ireland]</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Derrig |first1=Mick |title=Michael Collins' Unfinished Revolution |url=https://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/5476 |accessdate=12 June 2019 |work=An Phoblacht |date=21 October 1999}}</ref> Because of this, most northern IRA units supported Collins and 524 individual volunteers came south to join the National Army in the Irish Civil War.\n\nThis activity was supposed to culminate in a 'joint Northern offensive' in May 1922 that was to involve both pro and anti-Treaty IRA units. However, it appears that Collins countermanded the offensive at the last minute. While the Northern units took part, the Divisions based in southern territory and under Collins' authority, the 1st, 4th and 5th Northern Divisions did not, leading to the suppression of the offensive with relative ease by the Northern authorities.<ref> [https://www.theirishstory.com/2019/08/12/michael-collins-northern-ireland-and-the-northern-offensive-may-1922/#.Xl0rwPTgrIV Patrick Concannon, Michael Collins, Northern Ireland and the Northern Offensive, May 1922, The Irish Story August 2019.

Accessed March 2020]</ref>\n\nAt the time of his death in August 1922, it was still unclear what Collins' true intentions towards Northern Ireland were.\n\n==Provisional government==\n[[File:Michael Collins addressing crowd in Cork cph.3b15295.jpg|left|thumb|Michael Collins addresses a crowd in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], 1922.]]\nDe Valera resigned the presidency and sought re-election but Arthur Griffith replaced him after a close vote on 9 January 1922. Griffith chose as his title President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, rather than President of the Republic as de Valera had favoured.<ref>Younger, Calton. ''Arthur Griffith'', Dublin, Gill & Macmillan 1981</ref> The D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann government did not hold legal status in British [[constitutional law]]. The provisions of the Treaty required the formation of a ''new'' government, which would be recognised by Westminster as pertaining to the Free State dominion that had been established by the Treaty. Despite the abdication of a large part of the D\u00e1il, the [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government (Rialtas Sealadach na h\u00c9ireann)]] was formed by Arthur Griffith as President and Michael Collins as Chairman of the Cabinet (effectively [[Prime Minister]]). Collins retained his position as Minister for Finance.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\"/>\n\nIn British legal tradition, Collins was now a Crown-appointed prime minister of a Commonwealth state, installed under the [[Royal Prerogative]]. To be so installed he had to formally meet the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] [[Edmund FitzAlan-Howard, 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent|Viscount FitzAlan]] the head of the British administration in Ireland. The republican view of the same meeting is that Collins met FitzAlan to accept the surrender of [[Dublin Castle]], the official seat of British government in Ireland. Having surrendered, FitzAlan still remained in place as viceroy until December 1922.\n\nThe Provisional Government's first obligation was to create a Constitution for the Free State. This was undertaken by Collins and a team of solicitors. The outcome of their work became the Irish Constitution of 1922.<ref>The Constitution of the Irish Free State 1922 http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/E900003-004/</ref> He drew up a republican constitution which, without repudiating the Treaty, would include no mention of the British king. His object was that the Constitution would allow participation in the D\u00e1il by dissenting TDs who opposed the Treaty and refused to take any oath mentioning the Crown. Under the Treaty, the Free State was obliged to submit its new Constitution to Westminster for approval. Upon doing so, in June 1922, Collins and Griffith found Lloyd George determined to veto the provisions they had fashioned to prevent civil war.<ref>Coogan, TP. ''Michael Collins''</ref>\n\nThe meetings with Lloyd George and Churchill were bitter and contentious. Collins, although less diplomatic than Griffith or de Valera, had no less penetrating comprehension of political issues. He complained that he was being manipulated into \"doing Churchill's dirty work\", in a potential civil war with his own former troops.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\"/><ref>Michael Collins \u2013 Winston Churchill correspondence June 1922</ref>\n\n==Pact elections==\nNegotiations to prevent civil war resulted in, among others, \"The Army Document\" published in May 1922 which was signed by an equal number of pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers including Collins, Dan Breen, and [[Gear\u00f3id O'Sullivan]]. This manifesto declared that \"a closing of ranks all round is necessary\" to prevent \"the greatest catastrophe in Irish history.\" It called for new elections, to be followed by the re-unification of the government and army, whatever the result.\n\nIn this spirit and with the organising efforts of moderates on both sides the Collins-de Valera \"Pact\" was created. This pact agreed that new elections to the D\u00e1il would be held with each candidate running as explicitly pro- or anti-Treaty and that, regardless of which side obtained a majority, the two factions would then join to form a coalition government of national unity.\n\nA referendum on the Treaty was also planned but it never took place. The Pact elections on 16 June 1922 therefore comprise the best quantitative record of the Irish public's direct response to the Treaty. The results were pro-Treaty 58 seats, anti-Treaty 35, Labour Party 17, Independents 7, Farmers party 7, plus 4 Unionists from Trinity College, Dublin.<ref>Public Records Office, Dublin</ref>\n\n==Assassination of Sir Henry Wilson==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2018}}\nSix days after the Pact elections, [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Wilson]] was assassinated on 22 June 1922 in broad daylight on the steps of his London home by a pair of London IRA men. A British Army [[field marshal]], Wilson had recently resigned his commission and been elected an MP for a constituency in Northern Ireland. He had a long history as one of the chief British leaders opposing Collins in the Irish conflict. At that time Wilson had served as military advisor to the Northern Ireland government led by [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], in which role he was seen to be responsible for the B-Specials and for other sources of loyalist violence in the north.\n\nThe debate concerning Collins's involvement continued in the 1950s, when a number of statements and rebuttals on the subject were published in periodicals. These were re-printed with additions in Rex Taylor's 1961 book ''Assassination: the death of Sir Henry Wilson and the tragedy of Ireland''. Participants in that discussion were Joe Dolan, Florence O'Donoghue, Denis P. Kelleher, Patrick O'Sullivan and others.<ref>Taylor, Rex. ''Assassination: the death of Sir Henry Wilson and the tragedy of Ireland'', (London 1961)</ref>\n\n==Civil War==\n{{Main|Irish Civil War}}\n[[File:Bombarded Four Courts Irish Civil War.jpg|right|thumb|The Provisional Government, led by Collins, gave the order to bombard the [[Four Courts]] with artillery shells in an attempt to remove Anti-treaty IRA. This was the start of the [[Irish Civil War]].]]\nThe death of Sir Henry Wilson caused a furor in London. Lloyd George, the prime Minister sent a letter to Collins saying that the 'ambiguous position' of the Provisional government with regard to the IRA in the Four Courts could no longer be tolerated. <ref>Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, The Irish Civil War,(2004) p.114</ref>.  The British cabinet met the day after assassination and agreed that Collins reply had not given a 'definite enough commitment' to disperse the Four Courts occupation. They ordered [[Nevil Macready]] commander of the British garrison still in Dublin, to attack the Four Courts, whose republican garrison they blamed from the shooting of Wilson. <ref>Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, The Irish Civil War,(2004) p.115</ref>. The plan was put on hold at the last minute when Macready advised the government, on June 26, to give Collins' Provisional Government one more chance to act against the Four Courts. <ref>Ibid. p.116</ref> \n\nCollins himself was in Cork at the time of the crisis. President Arthur Griffith and military officer Emmet Dalton met with British official to discuss 'the continued occupation of the Four Courts by the Irregulars under Rory O'Connor'. <ref>Sean Boyne, Emmet Dalton, Somme Soldier, Irish General, Film Pioneer p.138 </ref> There is little documentation of the decision to taken by the Provisional government, headed by Collins, to attack the Four Courts; Historian Michael Hopkinson writes, 'the scarcity of evidence is explained by the acute sensitivity of the subject, both at the time and since'. <ref>Hopkinson, p.116</ref> When Collins arrived back in Dublin, his forces began to act against the anti-Treatyites. On June 27 they arrested anti-Treaty IRA officer Leo Henderson as he was enforcing the Belfast Boycott by seizing cars. <ref>Hopkinson p.117</ref> In retaliation the anti-Treaty IRA men abducted [[J.J. \"Ginger\" O'Connell]], a Free State general and held him in the Four Courts. <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.406</ref>\n\nThese two developments led to the Provisional Government's 27 June 1922 order serving notice on the Four Courts garrison to surrender the building, their arms and release O'Connell, that night or face military action \"at once\". <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.406</ref> According to historian Charles Townsend, 'Collins must have consented to this though the actual decision seems to have been taken by Griffith'. <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.407</ref> [[Peter Hart (historian)|Peter Hart]] similarly writes, 'it was Griffith rather than Collins who took the lead in this decision'. <ref>Peter Hart, Mick, The Real Michael Collins, p.398</ref> However cabinet member Ernest Blythe recalled that, 'the decision to attack the Four Courts was almost automatic once Collins had agreed to it.<ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.117</ref>\n\nCollins' position in this conflict was extraordinary indeed. A majority perhaps of the IRA he had helped lead in the War of Independence, were now ranged against the Provisional Government, which he represented. In addition, the force which by the will of the electorate he was obliged to lead had been re-organised since the Truce. Formed from a nucleus of pro-Treaty IRA men, it had evolved into a more formal, structured, uniformed [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] that was armed and funded by Britain. Many of the new members [[Ireland and World War I|were World War I veterans]] and others who had not fought on the nationalist side before. Collins's profoundly mixed feelings about this situation are recorded in his private and official correspondence.<ref>Kissane, Bill.

[[Emmet Dalton]], an Irishman who had served in the British Army and the IRA, who was now a leading Free State commander and close associate of Collins, was placed in charge of it. The Four Courts surrendered after three days of fighting.\n\nHeavy [[Battle of Dublin (1922)|fighting broke out in Dublin]] between the anti-Treaty IRA Dublin Brigade and the Free State troops. Much of O'Connell Street suffered heavy damage; the Gresham Hotel was burned and the Four Courts reduced to a ruin. Still, under Collins' direction, the Free State rapidly took control of the capital. By July 1922 anti-Treaty forces held much of the southern province of Munster and several other areas of the country. At the height of their success, they administered local government and policing in large regions.<ref>Clarke, Kathleen. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'' O'Brien Press 2008</ref> Collins, Richard Mulcahy, and Eoin O'Duffy decided on a series of seaborne landings into republican held areas, which re-took Munster and the west in July\u2013August.\n\nThat July, Collins set aside his title as Chairman of the Provisional Government to become Commander-in-Chief of the National Army. However, according to Charles Townshend, he became 'a kind of generalisimo, combining military and political supremacy. Griffith had no desire or capacity to dispute the day to day conduct of government with him and while Mulcahy had great administrative capacity, he deferred to Collins as a strategist and thinker'.<ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.423</ref> He also [[prorogued]] the meeting of the Dail, or parliament until the end of hostilities, a move that historians such as John Regan have seen as an unconstitutional concentration of power in Collins himself and his military colleagues.<ref>John Regan, Myth and the Irish State (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2013), pp. 91</ref>\n\n===Civil War peace moves===\n\nRoughly two weeks after Cork city had been taken by Provisional Government forces, Collins travelled there to attempt to seize large sums of money that the anti-Treaty Republicans had lodged in various banks, under the account of the Land Bank. <ref>Dermot Keogh, Michael Collins, the making of the Irish Free State, (2006) p.67-68</ref>\n\nThere is also considerable evidence that Collins's journey to Cork in August 1922 was made in order to meet republican leaders with a view to ending the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\">Feehan, John M. ''The Shooting of Michael Collins: Murder or Accident?'', Cork, Mercier 1981</ref>\n\nCollins also conducted a series of meetings, regarding the possibility of peace talks in Cork on 21\u201322 August 1922. In Cork city, Collins met with neutral IRA members [[Se\u00e1n O'Hegarty]] and [[Florence O'Donoghue]] with a view to contacting Anti-Treaty IRA leaders [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] and [[Tom Hales (Irish republican)|Tom Hales]] to propose a truce. The anti-Treaty side had called a major convocation of officers to B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th, a remote crossroads, with ending the war on the agenda.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/>\n[[File:Michael Collins Risteard Mulcahy Glasnevin Cemetery at the funeral of Arthur Griffith.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Collins and [[Richard Mulcahy]] at [[Arthur Griffith]]'s funeral, a few days before Collins' own death.]]\nDe Valera was present there, however, Michel Hopkinson writes that 'there is no evidence that there was any prospect of a meeting between de Valera and Collins <ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.177</ref>. The People's Rights Association, a local initiative in Cork City, had been mediating a discussion of terms between the Provisional Government and the anti-Treaty side for some weeks.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/>\n\nCollins's personal diary outlined his proposals for peace. Republicans must \"accept the People's Verdict\" on the Treaty, but could then \"go home without their arms. We don't ask for any surrender of their principles\".<ref>Hopkinson, Green against Green, p. 177</ref> He argued that the Provisional Government was upholding \"the people's rights\" and would continue to do so. \"We want to avoid any possible unnecessary destruction and loss of life. We do not want to mitigate their weakness by resolute action beyond what is required\". But if Republicans did not accept his terms, \"further blood is on their shoulders\".<ref>Hopkinson, Green against Green, p. 177-178</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Michael Collins body lying in hospital.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Collins' body laid out at [[St. Vincent's University Hospital|St Vincent's Hospital]] in Dublin.]]\nIn August 1922, it seemed as though the Civil War was winding down. The Free State had regained control of most of the country, and Collins was making frequent trips to inspect areas recently recovered from anti-Treaty forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/>\n\nHis plan to travel to his native Cork on 20 August was considered particularly dangerous, and he was strenuously advised against it by several trusted associates. County Cork was an IRA stronghold as much of it was still held by anti-Treaty forces. Yet he was determined to make the trip without delay. He had fended off a number of attempts on his life in the preceding weeks and had acknowledged more than once, in private conversation, that the Civil War might end his life at any moment. On several occasions, Collins assured his advisors \"they won't shoot me in my own county,\" or words to that effect.\n\n[[File:Crossley Tender rear 146440.jpg|right|thumb|A replica of the Crossley Tender in Collins' convoy on the day of his death in a replica of the road where it happened on display at the Michael Collins Centre, Clonakilty<ref>[http://www.michaelcollinscentre.com/index.html Michael Collins Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301105029/http://www.michaelcollinscentre.com/index.html |date=1 March 2012 }}, Clonakilty</ref>]]\nOn 22 August 1922 Collins set out from Cork City on a circuitous tour of West Cork. He passed first through Macroom then took the [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] road via [[Crookstown, County Cork|Crookstown]]. This led through [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]], an isolated crossroads. There they stopped at a local pub named 'Long's Pub', now known as [[The Diamond Bar]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thediamondbar.wordpress.com/history/ | title=History| date=2015-04-28}}</ref> to ask a question of a man standing at the crossroad. The man turned out to be an anti-Treaty sentry. He and an associate recognised Collins in the back of the open-top car.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nAs a result, an ambush was laid by an anti-Treaty column at that point, on the chance that the convoy might come through again on their return journey.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Between 7:30 and 8:00 pm, Collins' convoy approached B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th for the second time. By then most of the ambush party had dispersed and gone for the day, leaving just five or six men on the scene. Two were disarming a mine in the road, while three on a laneway overlooking them, provided cover. A dray cart, placed across the road, remained at the far end of the ambush site.\n\nThe Irregulars in the laneway opened fire with rifles on the convoy. Emmet Dalton ordered the driver of the touring car to 'drive like hell', but Collins said 'no, stop and we'll fight 'em' and jumped from the vehicle along with the others. Collins first took cover behind the low grass bank bordering the road but then jumped up and ran back along the road to begin firing with his Lee Enfield rifle from behind the armoured car. The Vickers machine gun in that car had also been firing at the attackers but then stopped because a badly-loaded ammunition belt caused it to jam. Apparently, to get a better view of the laneway, Collins left the protection of the armoured car and moved even farther back along the road. Now standing in the open, he fired a couple of shots and as he was once more working the bolt of his rifle he was struck in the head by a bullet fired by one of the ambushing party \u2013 Denis \"Sonny\" O'Neill, a former [[British Army]] [[sniper]].<ref>'Gunman believed to have killed Michael Collins was granted a military pension', 'The Irish Times', 3 October 2014.</ref>\n\nCollins was the only fatality sustained in the ambush, although another member of his party suffered a neck wound. After he was shot the fire from the ambushing party quickly fell off and they withdrew from the scene. Collins was found, face down, on the roadway. One of his men whispered an [[Act of Contrition]] into his ear, but Collins was clearly dead. He was lifted into the back of the touring car with his head resting against the shoulder of Emmet Dalton. The convoy cleared the dray cart obstruction and resumed its journey to Cork.\n\nThe lengthy time the convoy took to cover the twenty miles back to Cork City was because many of the roads were blocked and the convoy had to travel across muddy fields and through farms to circumnavigate the obstacles, all in darkness. At times, when the vehicles became bogged down, members of the convoy had to carry Collins' body on their shoulders. The touring car eventually had to be abandoned because of mechanical trouble.\n\nThere was no autopsy. Collins' field diary was taken by General Emmet Dalton who had been with him during his tour of the south. The body was first presented at Shanakiel Hospital in Cork, a small military establishment, and then shipped around the coast to Dublin where it was laid out in St Vincent's Hospital Dublin. From there it was removed to the City Hall beside Dublin Castle where it was laid in state.\n\n===Conspiracy and collusion===\nNumerous questions remain about the events surrounding the death of Collins because the only witnesses to his death were the members of the Free State Army convoy and the anti-Treaty ambushers. As no two stories match and participant statements from both sides are contradictory and inconsistent, unanswered questions linger about what happened that day.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nThe man believed to have fired the fatal shot, Denis \"Sonny\" O'Neill, was a former officer from the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] who served as a [[sniper]] in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]], joined the IRA in 1918 and had met Collins on more than one occasion. However, when the Irish Civil War started in June 1922, O'Neill joined the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Anti-Treaty IRA]]; becoming one of the ambushers of Collins' convoy at [[Beal na Blath]] that August.<ref name=\"Sonny\"/>\n\nO'Neill remains a mysterious figure because of the contradictions in his biography: such as serving in the British Army but then joining the IRA. He provided them with information concerning the [[Igoe Gang]] that worked for the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|British Army Intelligence Centre]]. Twenty years after Collins' death, the Irish State granted O'Neill a Captain's military pension in the 1940s.<ref name=\"Sonny\">{{cite news|title=Gunman believed to have killed Michael Collins was granted a military pension|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date= 3 October 2014|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/gunman-believed-to-have-killed-michael-collins-was-granted-military-pension-1.1949934}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Sean Collins behind the coffin of his brother Michael.jpg|left|thumb|Sean Collins behind the coffin of his brother Michael.]]\n\nCollins lay in state for three days. Tens of thousands of mourners filed past his [[coffin]] to pay their respects, including many British soldiers departing Ireland who had fought against him. His funeral mass took place at Dublin's [[Pro Cathedral]] where a number of foreign and Irish dignitaries were in attendance. Some 500,000 people attended his funeral, almost one fifth of the country's population at that time.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/>\n\nNo official inquiry was ever undertaken into Collins's death and consequently, there is no official version of what happened, nor are there any authoritative, detailed contemporary records.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\n[[File:Collinsfuneral.jpg|right|thumb|Funeral of Michael Collins in the [[St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral|Pro-Cathedral]], Dublin (contemporary newspaper depiction of the [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]])]]\n\nIn this vacuum, independent investigations and conspiracy theorists have put forward a number of suspects as having executed or ordered his death, including an anti-Treaty sharpshooter, members of his own escort, the British secret service, or de Valera himself.\n\nDe Valera is alleged to have declared in 1966, \"It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Michael Collins; and it will be recorded at my expense.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= Dolan|first=Anne|title=Commemorating the Irish Civil War: History and Memory, 1923\u20132000 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=iS_3r0vHMxsC&pg=PA87 |series=Studies in the Social and Cultural History of Modern Warfare|volume=13|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02698-7|page=87}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Michael Collins On Bicycle.jpg|right|thumb|Collins on his bicycle.]]\nCollins's elderly father inspired his fondness and respect for older people. His mother, who had spent her youth caring for her own invalid mother and raising her own brothers and sisters, was a powerful influence. The entire management of the Collins farm fell to her, as her husband succumbed to old age and died. In a society which honoured hospitality as a prime virtue, Mrs Collins was eulogised as \"a hostess in ten thousand.\" Her five daughters avowedly doted on their youngest brother.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/> He enjoyed rough-housing and outdoor sports. Having won a local wrestling championship while still a boy, he is said to have made a pastime of challenging larger, older opponents, with frequent success. A very fit, active man throughout life, in the most stressful times he continued to enjoy wrestling as a form of relaxation and valued friendships which afforded opportunities to share athletic pursuits.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/> He could be abrasive, demanding, and inconsiderate of those around him, but frequently made up for it with gestures such as confectionery and other small gifts.<ref>O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins'', Dublin, Gill & MacMillan 1980.{{Page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlike some of his political opponents, he was characterized by many close personal friendships within the movement. It has been justly said that while some were devoted to \"the idea of Ireland\", Collins was a people person whose patriotism was rooted in affection and respect for the people of Ireland around him. Among his famous last words is the final entry in his pocket diary, written on the journey which ended his life, \"The people are splendid.\"<ref>Michael Collins field diary, 22 August 1922</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/>\n\n[[File:Kitty Kiernan.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Kitty Kiernan]]\n\nIn 1921\u201322, he became engaged to [[Kitty Kiernan]].\n\nCollins was a complex man whose character abounded in contradictions. Although Minister of Finance and an accountant by pre-war profession, he seems never to have pursued personal profit; indeed he was sometimes all but homeless during the war for independence. This characteristic was exemplified by a letter he wrote on 4 August 1922 to his canvassing agent; offering to pay half the bill for a hired election car because some of the journeys had been for personal trips.<ref>Kennerk, Barry and Alison Healy, Evidence of an Irish Politician's Scruples on Expenses...in 1922 in  ''Irish Times'', 8 Nov. 2010</ref> While clearly fond of command and keen to take charge, he had an equal appetite for input and advice from people at every level of the organisation, prompting the comment that \"he took advice from his chauffeur.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceG\"/> Although acknowledged by friends and foes as \"head centre\" of the movement, he continually chose a title just short of actual head of state; becoming Chairman of the Provisional Government only after the abdication of half the D\u00e1il forced him to do so. While his official and personal correspondence records his solicitous care for the wants of insurgents in need, during the war he showed no hesitation in ordering the death of opponents who threatened nationalist lives.<ref>Collins, Michael (Costello, Francis J., Ed.) ''Michael Collins In His Own Words'', Dublin, Gill & Macmillan, 1997</ref>\n\nCertainly a man of fierce pride, his pride was tempered by a sense of humour that included a keen sense of the absurd in his own situation.<ref>Michael Collins personal correspondence</ref> While mastermind of a clandestine military, he remained a public figure. When official head of the Free State government, he continued to cooperate in the IRA's secret operations. He was capable of bold, decisive actions on his own authority, which caused friction with his colleagues, such as his falling out with [[Cathal Brugha]]; but at critical junctures he could also bow to majority decisions which were profoundly disadvantageous and dangerous to his own interests (such as his appointment to the Treaty negotiating team).\n\n==Commemoration==\n[[File:Grave of Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 Coile\u00e1in.jpg|left|thumb|Memorial cross at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th.]]\nAn annual commemoration ceremony takes place each year in August at the ambush site at [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]], County Cork, organised by The B\u00e9al na mBl\u00e1th Commemoration Committee.

Selections have been published in ''The Path to Freedom'' (Mercier, 1968) and in ''Michael Collins in His Own Words'' (Gill & Macmillan, 1997). In the 1960s, Taoiseach Se\u00e1n Lemass, himself a veteran of the 1916 Rising and War of Independence, credited Collins's ideas as the basis for his successes in revitalizing Ireland's economy.\n\nNine years after his death, the UK Parliament passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which removed virtually all of London's remaining authority over the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of making the Free State the first internationally recognised independent Irish state, thus fulfilling Collins' vision of having \"the freedom to achieve freedom.\"\n\n==Societies==\nThe '''Collins 22 Society''' established in 2002 is an international organisation dedicated to keeping the name and legacy of Michael Collins in living memory. The patron of the society is Ireland's former Minister for Justice and TD [[Nora Owen]], grand-niece of Michael Collins.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:Bust of Michael Collins at Merrion Square Park, Dublin, Ireland..JPG|left|thumb|Bust of Michael Collins at Merrion Square Park, Dublin, Ireland.]]\nThe 1936 film ''[[Beloved Enemy]]'' is a fictionalised account of Collins's life. Unlike the real Michael Collins, the fictionalised \"Dennis Riordan\" (played by [[Brian Aherne]]) is shot, but recovers. ''[[Hang Up Your Brightest Colours]]'', a British [[documentary film|documentary]] by [[Kenneth Griffith]], was made for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1973, but refused transmission. It was eventually screened by the [[BBC]] in [[Wales]] in 1993 and across the United Kingdom the following year.\n\nIn 1969, [[Dominic Behan]] wrote an episode of the UK television series [[Play for today]] entitled 'Michael Collins'. The play dealt with Collins' attempt to take the gun out of Irish politics and took the perspective of the Republican argument. At the time of writing the script, [[the troubles]] had just begun in Northern Ireland and the [[BBC]] were reluctant to broadcast the production. An appeal by the author to [[David Attenborough]] (Director of Programming for the BBC at that time) resulted in the play eventually being broadcast; Attenborough took the view that the imperatives of free speech could not be compromised in the cause of political expediency.\n\nAn [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] documentary made by Colm Connolly for [[RT\u00c9 Television]] in 1989 called ''The Shadow of B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th'' covered Collins's death. A made-for-TV film, ''[[The Treaty (film)|The Treaty]]'', was produced in 1991 and starred [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Collins and [[Ian Bannen]] as [[David Lloyd George]].

It details Collins's career, from the [[Easter Rising]] to his death at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th. Irish [[Folk music|folk]] band the [[Wolfe Tones]] recorded a song titled \"Michael Collins\" on ''[[A Sense of Freedom (album)|A Sense of Freedom]]'' (1983) about Collins's life and death, although it begins when he was about 16 and took a job in London. Celtic metal band [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]] recorded a song also titled \"Michael Collins\" on their 2004 album ''[[Pagan (album)|Pagan]]'' which dealt with his role in the Civil War, the treaty and his eventual death. Also a song by [[Johnny McEvoy]], simply named \"Michael\", depicts Collins's death and the sadness surrounding his funeral.\n\nThe poem \"The laughing boy\" by [[Brendan Behan]] lamenting the death of Collins was translated into Greek in 1961 by Vasilis Rotas. In October of the same year, [[Mikis Theodorakis]] composed the song \"T\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af\" (\"The laughing boy\") using Rotas' translation.

It was the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' (1969). \"The laughing boy\" became the song of protest against the [[dictatorship in Greece]] (1967\u20131974) and remains to date one of the most popular songs in Greek popular culture.\n\n===Plays===\nJournalist Eamonn O'Neill wrote the play ''God Save Ireland Cried the Hero'' about Collins' last night alive.

He moved to London in 1906, to become a clerk in the [[Post Office Savings Bank]] at [[Blythe House]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He was a member of the [[London GAA]], through which he became associated with the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] and the [[Gaelic League]]. He returned to Ireland in 1916 and fought in the [[Easter Rising]]. He was subsequently imprisoned in the [[Frongoch internment camp]] as a [[prisoner of war]], but was released in December 1916.\n\nCollins rose through the ranks of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] after his release from Frongoch. He became a [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] for [[South Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|South Cork]] in [[1918 Irish general election|1918]], and was appointed [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] in the [[First D\u00e1il]]. He was present when the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il]] convened on 21 January 1919 and [[Irish Declaration of Independence|declared the independence]] of the [[Irish Republic]]. In the ensuing [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], he was Director of Organisation and Adjutant General for the Irish Volunteers, and Director of Intelligence of the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]]. He gained fame as a [[guerrilla warfare]] strategist, planning and directing many successful attacks on British forces, such as the [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|\"Bloody Sunday\" assassinations]] of key British intelligence agents in November 1920.\n\nAfter the July 1921 ceasefire, Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]] were sent to London by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] to negotiate peace terms. The resulting [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] established the [[Irish Free State]] but depended on an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] to [[the Crown]], a condition with which de Valera and other republican leaders had difficulty reconciling. Collins viewed the treaty as offering \"the freedom to achieve freedom\", and persuaded a majority in the [[Second D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il]] to ratify the treaty. A [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|provisional government]] was formed under his [[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|chairmanship]] in early 1922 but was soon disrupted by the [[Irish Civil War]], in which Collins was [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]]. He was shot and killed in an ambush by anti-treaty forces on 22 August 1922.\n\n==Early years==\nCollins was born in [[Michael Collins Birthplace|Woodfield, Sam's Cross]], near [[Clonakilty]] [[County Cork]], on 16 October 1890,<ref name=birth>{{cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/images/birth_returns/births_1890/02404/1896440.pdf|title=16th October 1890 \u2013 Birth of Michael Collins|work=Civil Records on Irish Genealogy Site|accessdate=27 May 2017}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|name=n 1|His gravestone in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] erroneously gives his birth date as 12 October 1890.}} the third son and youngest of eight children.

Collins is fifth from the right with an 'x' over his head.]]\n\nThe struggle for [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule]], along with labour unrest, had led to the formation in 1913 of two major nationalist paramilitary groups who later launched the [[Easter Rising]]: the [[Irish Citizen Army]] was established by [[James Connolly]], [[James Larkin]] and his [[Irish Transport and General Workers Union]] (ITGWU) to protect strikers from the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]] during the [[1913 Dublin Lockout]]. The [[Irish Volunteers]] were created in the same year by nationalists in response to the formation of the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF), an [[Ulster loyalist]] body pledged to oppose Home Rule by force.\n\nAn organiser of considerable intelligence, Collins had become highly respected in the IRB. This led to his appointment as financial advisor to [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]], father of one of the [[Easter Rising]]'s organisers, [[Joseph Plunkett]]. Collins took part in preparing arms and drilling troops for the insurrection.\n\nThe Rising was Collins' first appearance in national events. When it commenced on [[Easter Monday]] 1916, Collins served as Joseph Plunkett's aide-de-camp at the rebellion's headquarters in the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]] (GPO) in [[Dublin]]. There he fought alongside [[Patrick Pearse]], James Connolly, and other members of the Rising leadership. The Rising was put down after six days, but the insurgents achieved their goal of holding their positions for the minimum time required to justify a claim to independence under international criteria.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first= Kathleen|title=Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman|publisher=Dublin: O'Brien Press Ltd |year=2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Collins was arrested and taken into British custody. He was processed at Dublin's [[Richmond Barracks]] by \"[[G Division (Dublin Metropolitan Police)|G-Men]]\", plain-clothes officers from [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]]. During his screening, Collins was identified as someone who should be selected for further interrogation, harsher treatment, or execution. However, he overheard his name being called out so he moved to the other side of the building to identify the speaker. In doing so, he joined the group that was transferred to [[Frongoch internment camp]] in Wales, a movement that historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] describes as \"one of the luckiest escapes of his life.\"<ref name=\"TP\">{{cite book|authorlink=Tim Pat Coogan|first= Tim Pat|last=Coogan|title=Michael Collins: A Biography|page= 50|publisher=Arrow|year=2015|isbn= 978-1784753269}}</ref>\n\nCollins first began to emerge as a major figure in the vacuum created by the executions of the 1916 leadership. He began hatching plans for \"next time\" even before the prison ships left Dublin.<ref>{{citebook|first= Margery|last= Forester|quote= Nancy O'Brien cousin of Michael Collins|title=The Lost Leader|publisher= Gill & MacMillan, Limited|year= 2006|isbn= 978-0717140145}}</ref>\n\nAt Frongoch he was one of the organisers of a program of protest and non-cooperation with authorities, similar to that later carried on by IRA internees in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s. The camp proved an excellent opportunity for networking with [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical-force republicans]] from all over the country, of which he became a key organiser.<ref name=\"TP\"/><ref>Teilifl\u00eds Gaeltachta / Radio Teilifl\u00eda \u00c9ireann \"An gCoilaiste R\u00e9abhloid\" 2010</ref>\n\nWhile some celebrated the fact that a rising had happened at all, believing in Pearse's theory of \"blood sacrifice\" (namely that the deaths of the Rising's leaders would inspire others), Collins railed against the military blunders made, such as the seizure of indefensible and very vulnerable positions like [[St Stephen's Green]], which were impossible to escape from and difficult to supply. Public outcry placed pressure on the British government to end the internment. In December 1916, the Frongoch prisoners were sent home.\n\n==1917\u20131918==\nBefore his death, [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], first signatory of the 1916 Proclamation and widely considered the Rising's foremost organiser, had designated his wife [[Kathleen Clarke]] as the official caretaker of Rising official business, in the event that the leadership did not survive. By June 1916, Mrs. Clarke had sent out the first post-Rising communiqu\u00e9 to the IRB, declaring the Rising to be only the beginning and directing nationalists to prepare for \"the next blow.\" Soon after his release Mrs. Clarke appointed Collins Secretary to the National Aid and Volunteers Dependents Fund (NAVDF) and subsequently passed on to him the secret organisational information and contacts which she had held in trust for the independence movement.\n\n[[File:Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Michael Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]]]]\n\nCollins became one of the leading figures in the post-Rising independence movement spearheaded by [[Arthur Griffith]], editor/publisher of the main [[nationalist]] newspaper [[The United Irishman]], (which Collins had read avidly as a boy.)<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\">Coogan, TP. ''Michael Collins'', 1990</ref> Griffith's organisation [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] had been founded in 1905 as an umbrella group to unify all the various factions within the nationalist movement.\n\nUnder Griffith's policy, Collins and other advocates of the \"physical-force\" approach to independence gained the cooperation of non-violent Sinn F\u00e9in, while agreeing to disagree with Griffith's moderate ideas of a [[dual monarchy]] solution based on the Hungarian model.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Feeney, Brian. ''Sinn Fein: a Hundred Turbulent Years'', Dublin; O'Brien Press Ltd., 2002</ref> The British government and mainstream Irish media had wrongly blamed Sinn F\u00e9in for the Rising. This attracted Rising participants to join the organisation in order to exploit the reputation with which such British propaganda had imbued the organisation. By October 1917 Collins had risen to become a member of the executive of Sinn F\u00e9in and director of organisation for the [[Irish Volunteers]]. [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], another veteran of 1916, stood for the presidency of Sinn F\u00e9in against Griffith, who stepped aside and supported de Valera's presidency.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n==First D\u00e1il==\n[[File:First dail restoration3.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|''Members of the First D\u00e1il'' <br /> First row, left to right: [[Laurence Ginnell]], Michael Collins, [[Cathal Brugha]], [[Arthur Griffith]], [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], [[George Noble Plunkett|Count Plunkett]], [[Eoin MacNeill]], [[W.

Like many senior Sinn F\u00e9in representatives Collins was elected as an MP (for [[South Cork (UK Parliament constituency)|Cork South]]) with the right to sit in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in London. Unlike their rivals in the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP), Sinn F\u00e9in MPs had announced that they would not take their seats in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] but instead would set up an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in Dublin.<ref name=\"elecs_irl\">{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=6695|title=Michael Collins|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nBefore the new body's first meeting, Collins, tipped off by his network of spies, warned his colleagues of plans to arrest all its members in overnight raids. De Valera and others ignored the warnings on the argument that, if the arrests happened, they would constitute a [[propaganda]] coup. The intelligence proved accurate and de Valera, along with Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who followed his advice, were arrested; Collins and others evaded incarceration.\n\nThe new parliament, called [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (meaning \"Assembly of Ireland\", see [[First D\u00e1il]]) met in the [[Mansion House, Dublin]] in January 1919. In de Valera's absence, [[Cathal Brugha]] was elected [[Pr\u00edomh Aire]] ('First' or 'Prime' Minister but often translated as 'President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann'). The following April, Collins engineered de Valera's escape from [[Lincoln (HM Prison)|Lincoln Prison]] in England, after which Brugha was replaced by de Valera.\n\nNo [[Nation state|state]] gave diplomatic recognition to the 1919 Republic, despite sustained lobbying in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by de Valera and prominent [[Irish-Americans]] and at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris peace conference]]. In January 1919 the D\u00e1il ratified the [[Irish Republican Army]]'s (IRA) claim to be the army of the [[Irish Republic]]. The IRA had begun a military campaign coincidentally on the same day as the D\u00e1il's first sitting with the [[Soloheadbeg Ambush]], and the IRA's respect for the D\u00e1il's authority was highly conditional. (The Irish Volunteers began to be referred to as the IRA since their internment at Frongoch. Up until the Civil War, the two terms were used interchangeably.)\n\n==Minister for Finance==\nDe Valera appointed Collins as [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] in the [[Ministry of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] in 1919.<ref>Mackay, p. 116</ref> Most of the ministries existed only on paper or as one or two people working in a room of a private house, given the circumstances of war in which they were liable to be arrested or killed by the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]], [[British Army]], [[Black and Tans]] or [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]].\n\nDespite that, Collins managed to produce a Finance Ministry that was able to organise a large bond issue in the form of a \"National Loan\" to fund the new Irish Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://generalmichaelcollins.com/National_Loan/National_Loan_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515172519/http://generalmichaelcollins.com/National_Loan/National_Loan_1.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }} Collins 22 Society Page on \"The National Loan 1920\"</ref> According to [[Batt O'Connor]], the D\u00e1il Loan raised almost \u00a3400,000, of which \u00a325,000 was in gold.

The jewels remained in a Dublin safe, forgotten by all sides, until the 1930s, when they were found by chance.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==War of Independence==\nThe [[Irish War of Independence]] in effect began on the day that the First D\u00e1il convened, 21 January 1919.

The two policemen were shot dead during the engagement. This ambush is considered the first action in the Irish War of Independence.<ref>Breen, Dan. ''My Fight For Irish Freedom'', Dublin, Talbot Press 1924</ref> The engagement had no advance authorisation from the nascent government.

That summer he was elected president of the IRB (and therefore, in the doctrine of that organisation, {{lang|la|de jure}} President of the Irish Republic). In September, he was made Director of [[espionage|Intelligence]] for the [[Irish Republican Army]] which now had a mandate to pursue an armed campaign, as the official military of the Irish nation. With [[Cathal Brugha]] as Minister of Defence, Collins became Director of Organisation and Adjutant General of the Volunteers. Collins spent much of this period helping to organise the Volunteers as an effective military force, and concentrating on forcing the RIC&nbsp;\u2013 which represented British authority in Ireland&nbsp;\u2013 out of isolated barracks and seizing their weapons.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|title=The Roots and Consequences of 20th-Century Warfare: Conflicts that Shaped the Modern World|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1610698023|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3nEDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA97|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> Collins was determined to avoid the massive destruction, military and civilian losses for merely symbolic victories that had characterised the 1916 Rising. Instead, he directed a guerrilla war against the British, suddenly attacking then just as quickly withdrawing, minimising losses and maximising effectiveness.<ref>Michael Collins, personal correspondence 1916\u201317</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceE\">Barry, Tom. ''Guerrilla Days in Ireland'', Dublin, Irish Press 1949</ref>\n\nThe Crown responded with escalation of the war, with the importation of special forces such as the \"[[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]]\", the \"[[Black and Tans]]\", the \"[[Cairo Gang]]\", and others. Officially or unofficially, many of these groups were given a free hand to institute a reign of terror, shooting Irish people indiscriminately, invading homes, looting and burning.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>[[Kathleen Clarke|Clarke, Kathleen]]. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'', O'Brien Press 2008</ref>\n\nAs the war began in earnest, de Valera travelled to the United States for an extended speaking tour to raise funds for the outlawed Republican government. It was in publicity for this tour that de Valera (who had been elected [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|Pr\u00edomh Aire]] by the D\u00e1il) was first referred to as \"President\". While financially successful, grave political conflicts followed in de Valera's wake there which threatened the unity of Irish-American support for the rebels. Some members of the IRB also objected to the use of the presidential title because their organisation's constitution had a different definition of that title.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref>Clarke, Kathleen. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'', Dublin O'Brien Press Ltd 2008</ref>\n\nBack in Ireland, Collins arranged the \"National Loan\", organised the IRA, effectively led the government, and managed arms-smuggling operations. Local guerrilla units received supplies, training and had largely a free hand to develop the war in their own region. These were the \"flying columns\" who comprised the bulk of the War of Independence rank and file in the south-west. Collins, [[Dick McKee]] and regional commanders such as [[Dan Breen]] and [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] oversaw tactics and general strategy. There were also regional organisers, such as Ernie O'Malley and Liam Mellows, who reported directly to Collins at St Ita's secret basement GHQ in central Dublin.<ref>E O'Malley. ''On Another Man's Wound'', (Dublin 1937)</ref> They were supported by a vast intelligence network of men and women in all walks of life that reached deep into the British administration in Ireland.<ref>[[Tom Barry (soldier)|Barry, Tom]].

''Florence and Josephine O'Donoghue's War of Independence'', Dublin, Irish Academic Press, 2006</ref>\n[[File:General Collins.jpg|upright|thumb|Collins inspects a soldier.]]\nIt was at this time that Collins created a special [[assassination]] unit called [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]] expressly to kill British agents and informers. Collins was criticised for these tactics but cited the universal war-time practice of executing enemy spies who were, in his words, \"hunting victims for execution.\" Campaigning for Irish independence, even non-violently, was still targeted both by prosecutions under British law entailing the death penalty and also by extrajudicial killings such as that of [[Tomas MacCurtain]], nationalist mayor of Cork City.\n\nIn 1920 the British offered [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]10,000 (equivalent to GB\u00a3300,000 / \u20ac360,000 in 2010) for information leading to Collins' capture or death. He evaded capture and continued to strike against British forces, often operating from safe-houses near government buildings, such as Vaughan's and [[An Stad]].\n\nIn 1920, following Westminster's prominent announcements that it had the Irish insurgents on the run, Collins and his Squad killed several British secret service agents in a series of coordinated raids. In retaliation, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary went to Croke Park, where a G.A.A. football match was taking place between Dublin and Tipperary. The police officers opened fire on the crowd, killing twelve and wounding sixty.  This event became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]]. A stampede of panicking British operatives sought the shelter of [[Dublin Castle]] next day. About the same time, Tom Barry's 3rd Cork Brigade took no prisoners in a bitter battle with British forces at [[Kilmichael Ambush|Kilmichael]]. In many regions, the RIC and other crown forces became all but confined to the strongest barracks in the larger towns as rural areas came increasingly under rebel control.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/><ref>[[Neligan, David]]. ''The Spy In the Castle'', London, Prendeville Publishing 1999</ref>\n\nThese republican victories would have been impossible without widespread support from the Irish population, which included every level of society and reached deep into the British administration in Ireland. This pattern of guerrilla success against sophisticated imperialist powers was repeated around the world in the early 20th century.<ref>[[Deasy, Liam]]. ''Brother Against Brother'', Cork, Mercier 1982</ref>\n\nAt the time of the ceasefire in July 1921 a major operation was allegedly in planning to execute every British secret service agent in Dublin, while a major ambush involving eighty officers and men was also planned for [[Templeglantine]], County Limerick.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"generalmichaelcollins.com\">[http://generalmichaelcollins.com/Michael_Collins_Life_and_Times/8.THE_TRUCE.html Page at generalmichaelcollins.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515210232/http://generalmichaelcollins.com/Michael_Collins_Life_and_Times/8.THE_TRUCE.html |date=15 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Truce==\nIn 1921 General Macready, commander of British forces in Ireland, reported to his government that the Empire's only hope of holding Ireland was by martial law, including the suspension of \"all normal life.\"<ref>''Wilson Diaries'', Vol II p. 293</ref> Westminster's foreign policy ruled out this option: Irish-American public opinion was important to British agendas in Asia. In addition, Britain's efforts at a military solution had already resulted in a powerful peace movement, which demanded an end to the unrest in Ireland. Prominent voices calling for negotiation included the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], ''[[The Times]]'' and other leading periodicals, members of the [[House of Lords]], [[English Catholics]], and famous authors such as [[George Bernard Shaw]].<ref>Cabinet Office, (Westminster government) London</ref><ref>British Cabinet minutes, 1921</ref>\n\nStill, it was not the British government that initiated negotiations. Individual English activists, including clergy, made private overtures which reached Arthur Griffith. Griffith expressed his welcome for dialogue. The British MP [[Brigadier General Cockerill]] sent an open letter to Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] that was printed in the Times, outlining how a peace conference with the Irish should be organised. The Pope made an urgent public appeal for a negotiated end to the violence. Whether or not Lloyd George welcomed such advisors, he could no longer hold out against this tide.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/>\n\nIn July, Lloyd George's government [[Irish War of Independence#Truce: July\u2013December 1921|offered a truce]]. Arrangements were made for a conference between British government and the leaders of the yet-unrecognised Republic. There remains uncertainty as to the two sides' capability to have carried on the conflict much longer. Collins told Hamar Greenwood after signing the Anglo-Irish Treaty: \"You had us dead beat. We could not have lasted another three weeks. When we were told of the offer of a truce we were astonished. We thought you must have gone mad\".<ref>L. S. Amery, ''My Political Life. Volume Two: War and Peace 1914\u20131929'' (London: Hutchinson, 1953), p. 230.</ref> However he stated on the record that \"there will be no compromise and no negotiations with any British Government until Ireland is recognised as an independent republic. The same effort that would get us Dominion Home Rule will get us a republic.\"<ref>Michael Collins, quoted by columnist CW Ackerman August 1920</ref> At no time had the D\u00e1il or the IRA asked for a conference or a truce.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Deasy, Liam. ''Brother Against Brother''</ref>\n\nHowever, the D\u00e1il as a whole was less uncompromising. It decided to proceed to a peace conference, although it was ascertained in the preliminary stages that a fully independent republic would not be on the table and that the loss of some northeastern counties was a foregone conclusion.<ref>Phoenix, Eamonn. ''Michael Collins \u2013 The Northern Question 1916\u201322'', in. ''Michael Collins and the Making of the Irish State'', (Doherty & Keogh, editors)</ref>\n\nMany of the rebel forces on the ground first heard of the Truce when it was announced in the newspapers and this gave rise to the first fissures in nationalist unity, which had serious consequences later on. They felt they had not been included in consultations regarding its terms.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/><ref>O'Donoghue, Florence. ''No Other Law'', Dublin, Irish Press 1954</ref>\n\nDe Valera was widely acknowledged as the most skillful negotiator on the D\u00e1il government side and he participated in the initial parlays, agreeing the basis on which talks could begin. The first meetings were held in strict secrecy soon after the Customs House battle, with Andrew Cope representing Dublin Castle's British authorities. Later, de Valera travelled to London for the first official contact with Lloyd George. The two met one-on-one in a private meeting, the proceedings of which have never been revealed.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceG\">Neligan, David. ''The Spy In the Castle'', London, Prendeville Publishing 1999</ref>\n\nDuring this Truce period, de Valera sued for official designation as President of the Irish Republic and obtained it from the D\u00e1il in August 1921, in place of the title which had previously been used of [[President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]].<ref>Coogan, Tim Pat. ''The IRA: A History'', p. 76</ref> Not long after, the Cabinet was obliged to select the delegation that would travel to the London peace conference and negotiate a treaty. In an extraordinary departure from his usual role, de Valera adamantly declined to attend, insisting instead that Collins should take his place there, along with Arthur Griffith.<ref>British Cabinet minutes, memoranda</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}<ref>De Valera, Eamonn, correspondence to Michael Collins, 13 July 1921</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nCollins resisted the appointment, protesting that he was \"a soldier, not a politician\" and that his exposure to the London authorities would reduce his effectiveness as a guerrilla leader should hostilities resume. (He had kept his public visibility to a minimum during the conduct of the war; up to this time the British still had very few reliable photographs of him.)<ref name=\"ReferenceH\">O'Connor, Batt. ''With Michael Collins in the Fight For Irish Independence'', 1929</ref> The Cabinet of seven split on the issue, with de Valera casting the deciding vote. Many of Collins's associates warned him not to go, that he was being set up as a political scapegoat. Following intense soul-searching and all-night consultations with his most trusted advisors, he resolved to attend \"in the spirit of a soldier obeying orders.\" In private correspondence he foresaw the catastrophe ahead: \"Let them make a scapegoat or whatever they like of me.

E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|F. E. Smith]]. During two months of arduous negotiations the Irish delegates made frequent crossings between London and Dublin to confer with their D\u00e1il colleagues, and Collins's correspondence reflects his frustration at D\u00e1il debates and the Irish delegate's inability to agree clear instruction as to whether or not they should accept a treaty.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins''</ref> \n\nIn November, with the London peace talks still in progress, Collins attended a large meeting of regional IRA commanders at Parnell Place in Dublin. In a private conference he informed [[Liam Deasy]], [[Florence O'Donoghue]] and [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] that there would have to be some compromise in the current negotiations in London. \"There was no question of our getting all the demands we were making.\" He was advised by Lynch not to bring this out in the full assembly. Reviewing subsequent events, Deasy later doubted the wisdom of that advice.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> \n\nThe negotiations ultimately resulted in the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] which was signed on 6 December 1921. The agreement provided for a [[Dominion]] status \"[[Irish Free State]]\", whose relationship to the British [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] would be modelled after Canada's. This was a compromise, half-way between an independent republic and a province of the Empire. The Treaty was signed under considerable pressure from the British. The negotiators had agreed at the cabinet meeting in Dublin that they would not sign the Treaty without bringing it back for the Dail cabinet to ratify. But once back in London on December 5th at 7:30 pm, Lloyd George told them it was immediate signature or 'immediate and terrible war' and that he had to know by the next day. The Treaty was signed at 2:20 am, December 6, 1921. <ref>Frank Pakenham, Peace by Ordeal, (1972) p.245-247</ref>\n\nThe settlement overturned the Act of Union by recognising the native Irish legislature's independence. Under a [[bicameral parliament]], executive authority would remain vested in the king, represented in Ireland by a [[Governor General]], but exercised by an Irish government elected by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a \"[[lower house]]\". British forces would depart the Free State forthwith and be replaced by an Irish army. Along with an independent judiciary, the Treaty granted the new Free State greater [[independence]] than any Irish state, and went well beyond the Home Rule which had been sought by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] or by his [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] successors John Redmond and John Dillon.\n\nThe Treaty acknowledged the partition of Ireland. Before Treaty negotiations had concluded, executive powers had already been passed to the government of [[Northern Ireland]] created under the [[Government of Ireland Act]] in 1920. <ref>Ronan, Fanning, The Fatal Path, British Government and Irish Revolution 1910-1922, p288</ref> Northern Ireland, which had a majority [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] population, could opt out of the Free State, a year after the signing of the Treaty. An [[Irish Boundary Commission]] was to be established to draw a border, 'in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants' and \u2018economic and geographic conditions\u2019.<ref>Liam Weeks, Michael O Fatharthaigh, The Treaty, p.279</ref> Collins anticipated a redrawing of the border would result in much of the south and west of Northern Ireland becoming part of the Free State, making Northern Ireland economically non-viable,and facilitating the reunification of the 32 counties in the near future.<ref>Phoenix, Eamonn. ''Michael Collins \u2013 The Northern Question 1916\u201322'', in. ''Michael Collins and the Making of the Irish State'', (Doherty & Keogh, editors)</ref>\n\nCollins argued that he had signed the Treaty as the alternative was a war that the Irish people did not want. 'I say that rejection of the Treaty is a declaration of war until you have beaten the British Empire, apart from any alternative document. Rejection of the Treaty means your national policy is war.... The Treaty was signed by me, not because they held up the alternative of immediate war. I signed it because I would not be one of those to commit the Irish people to war without the Irish people committing themselves to war'. <ref>Dail Debate on Treaty 19 December 1921, https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-19/2/</ref>  While the Treaty fell short of the republic for which he had fought, Collins concluded that the Treaty offered Ireland \"not the freedom that all nations desire and develop to, but the freedom to achieve it.\" .<ref>Collins, Michael. ''The Path To Freedom'', Cork, Mercier 1968</ref> \n\nNonetheless, he knew that elements of the Treaty would cause controversy in Ireland. Upon signing the treaty, F. E. Smith remarked \"I may have signed my political death warrant tonight\". Collins replied \"I may have signed my actual death warrant\".<ref name=\"generalmichaelcollins.com\" />\n\n===Treaty debates===\n\nThis remark encapsulated his acknowledgement that the Treaty was a compromise that would be vulnerable to charges of \"sell-out\" from purist Republicans. It did not establish the fully independent republic that Collins himself had shortly before demanded as a non-negotiable condition. The \"physical force republicans\" who made up the bulk of the army which had fought the British to a draw would be loath to accept dominion status within the [[British Empire]] or an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]] that mentioned the King. Also controversial was the British retention of [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] on the south coast of Ireland for the [[Royal Navy]]. These factors diminished Irish sovereignty and threatened to allow British interference in Ireland's foreign policy. Collins and Griffith were well aware of these issues and strove tenaciously, against British resistance, to achieve language which could be accepted by all constituents. They succeeded in obtaining an oath to the Irish Free State, with a subsidiary oath of fidelity to the King, rather than to the king unilaterally.\n\nEamon De Valera, the President of the Dail objected to the Treaty on the grounds that it had been signed without cabinet consent and that it secured neither the full independence of Ireland nor Irish unity. <ref>Frank Pakenham, Peace by Ordeal, (1972), p209-211</ref> Collins and his supporters argued that de Valera had refused strenuous pleas from Collins, Griffith and others to lead the London negotiations in person. He had  refused the delegates' continual requests for instruction, and in fact had been at the centre of the original decision to enter negotiations without the possibility of an independent republic on the table.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceI\">O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins'', Dublin, Gill & MacMillan 1980</ref>\n\nThe Treaty controversy split the entire nationalist movement. Sinn F\u00e9in, the D\u00e1il, the IRB and the army each divided into pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The Supreme Council of the IRB had been informed in detail about every facet of the Treaty negotiations and had approved many of its provisions, and they voted unanimously to accept the Treaty with the single notable exception of [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]], later COS of the anti-Treaty IRA.<ref>Coogan, ''Michael Collins'', pp. 236\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe D\u00e1il debated the Treaty bitterly for ten days until it was approved by a vote of 64 to 57.<ref>[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E900003-001/ Debate on the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland...] from University College Cork</ref> Having lost this vote, de Valera announced his intent to withdraw his participation from the D\u00e1il and called on all deputies who had voted against the Treaty to follow him. A substantial number did so, officially splitting the government.\n\nA large part of the Irish Republican Army opposed the Treaty and in March 1922 voted at an Army Convention to reject the authority of the Dail, Collins' GHQ and to elect their own Executive. Anti-Treaty IRA units began to seize buildings and take other guerrilla actions against the Provisional Government. On 14 April 1922, a group of 200 anti-Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin under [[Rory O'Connor (Irish republican)|Rory O'Connor]], a hero of the War of Independence. The [[Four Courts]] was the centre of the Irish courts system, originally under the British and then the Free State. Collins was charged by his Free State colleagues with putting down these insurgents, however, he resisted firing on former comrades and staved off a shooting war throughout this period.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\">Provisional Government minutes, Public Records Office, Dublin</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceK\">O'Donoghue, Florence. ''No Other Law'', Dublin, Irish Press, 1954</ref>\n\nWhile the country teetered on the edge of civil war, continuous meetings were carried on among the various factions from January to June 1922. In these discussions the nationalists strove to resolve the issue without armed conflict. Collins and his close associate, [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) [[Harry Boland]] were among those who worked desperately to heal the rift.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/><ref>Fitzpatrick, David. ''Harry Boland's Irish Revolution'', Cork, Cork University Press, 2003</ref>\n\nTo foster military unity, Collins and the IRB established an \"army re-unification committee\", including delegates from pro- and anti-Treaty factions. The still-secret Irish Republican Brotherhood continued to meet, fostering dialogue between pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers. In the IRB's stormy debates on the subject, Collins held out the Constitution of the new Free State as a possible solution. Collins was then in the process of co-writing that document and was striving to make it a republican constitution that included provisions that would allow anti-Treaty TDs to take their seats in good conscience, without any oath concerning the Crown.<ref name=\"ReferenceK\"/>\n\n==Northern Ireland==\n\nCollins' policy toward Northern Ireland was ambiguous. He told the Dail during the Treaty debates that, 'We have stated we would not coerce the North-East ... Surely we recognise that the North-East corner does exist, and surely our intention was that we should take such steps as would sooner or later lead to mutual understanding. The Treaty has made an effort to deal with it .. on lines that will lead very rapidly to goodwill, and the entry of the North-East under the Irish Parliament. I don't say it is an ideal arrangement, but if our policy is, as has been stated, a policy of non-coercion'. <ref>Dail Debate on Treaty 19 December 1921, https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/1921-12-19/2/</ref>\n\nHowever he told the Northern Divisions of the IRA in private, early in 1922 that, \u2018although the Treaty may have seemed as an outward expression of partition, the [Provisional Irish] Government plans to make it [partition] impossible\u2026even if it meant smashing the Treaty\u2019. <ref>Donnacha O Beachain, From Partition to Brexit, The Irish Government and Northern Ireland, 2019, p. 13 </ref> Collins' Provisional Government also funded county councils and paid the salaries of teachers in Northern Ireland who recognised the Free State.\n\nIn Northern Ireland in the first half of 1922, there was considerable violence between rival forces along the new border, the IRA on the southern side and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] on the Northern side. There were also many killings of civilians, notably by \"unauthorised loyalist paramilitary forces\" who targeted Catholics. Catholic were also driven out of their jobs, notably in Belfast's shipyards.\n\nIn March, Collins met [[Sir James Craig]], Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, in London. They signed an agreement declaring peace in the north which promised cooperation between Catholics and Protestants in policing and security, a generous budget for restoring Catholics to homes which had been destroyed, and many other measures.<ref>British Cabinet Office</ref> The day after the agreement was published, violence erupted again. A policeman was shot dead in Belfast and in reprisal, police entered Catholic homes nearby and shot residents in their beds, including children. There was no response to Collins's demands for an inquiry. He and his Cabinet warned that they would deem the agreement broken unless Craig took action.<ref>MC official correspondence, 5 and 10 April 1922</ref> In his continual correspondence with Churchill over violence in the north, Collins protested repeatedly that such breaches of the Truce threatened to invalidate the Treaty entirely.<ref>Michael Collins letter to Churchill 6 June 1922</ref> The prospect was real enough that on 3 June 1922 Churchill presented to the Committee of Imperial Defence his plans \"to protect Ulster from invasion by the South.\"<ref>British Cabinet minutes 16/42 Public Records Office, London</ref>\n\nThroughout the early months of 1922, Collins had been sending IRA units to the border and sending arms and money to the northern units of the IRA. Collins joined other IRB and IRA leadership in developing secret plans to launch a clandestine guerrilla war in the northeast. Some British arms that had been supplied to the Provisional government in Dublin were turned over by Collins to IRA units in the north. In May\u2013June 1922 Collins and IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch organised an offensive that would involve mobilising and arming ''both'' pro- and anti-Treaty IRA units along the border area.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-44083967 BBC Northern Ireland]</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Derrig |first1=Mick |title=Michael Collins' Unfinished Revolution |url=https://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/5476 |accessdate=12 June 2019 |work=An Phoblacht |date=21 October 1999}}</ref> Because of this, most northern IRA units supported Collins and 524 individual volunteers came south to join the National Army in the Irish Civil War.\n\nThis activity was supposed to culminate in a 'joint Northern offensive' in May 1922 that was to involve both pro and anti-Treaty IRA units. However, it appears that Collins countermanded the offensive at the last minute. While the Northern units took part, the Divisions based in southern territory and under Collins' authority, the 1st, 4th and 5th Northern Divisions did not, leading to the suppression of the offensive with relative ease by the Northern authorities.<ref> [https://www.theirishstory.com/2019/08/12/michael-collins-northern-ireland-and-the-northern-offensive-may-1922/#.Xl0rwPTgrIV Patrick Concannon, Michael Collins, Northern Ireland and the Northern Offensive, May 1922, The Irish Story August 2019.

Accessed March 2020]</ref>\n\nAt the time of his death in August 1922, it was still unclear what Collins' true intentions towards Northern Ireland were.\n\n==Provisional government==\n[[File:Michael Collins addressing crowd in Cork cph.3b15295.jpg|left|thumb|Michael Collins addresses a crowd in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], 1922.]]\nDe Valera resigned the presidency and sought re-election but Arthur Griffith replaced him after a close vote on 9 January 1922. Griffith chose as his title President of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, rather than President of the Republic as de Valera had favoured.<ref>Younger, Calton. ''Arthur Griffith'', Dublin, Gill & Macmillan 1981</ref> The D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann government did not hold legal status in British [[constitutional law]]. The provisions of the Treaty required the formation of a ''new'' government, which would be recognised by Westminster as pertaining to the Free State dominion that had been established by the Treaty. Despite the abdication of a large part of the D\u00e1il, the [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government (Rialtas Sealadach na h\u00c9ireann)]] was formed by Arthur Griffith as President and Michael Collins as Chairman of the Cabinet (effectively [[Prime Minister]]). Collins retained his position as Minister for Finance.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\"/>\n\nIn British legal tradition, Collins was now a Crown-appointed prime minister of a Commonwealth state, installed under the [[Royal Prerogative]]. To be so installed he had to formally meet the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] [[Edmund FitzAlan-Howard, 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent|Viscount FitzAlan]] the head of the British administration in Ireland. The republican view of the same meeting is that Collins met FitzAlan to accept the surrender of [[Dublin Castle]], the official seat of British government in Ireland. Having surrendered, FitzAlan still remained in place as viceroy until December 1922.\n\nThe Provisional Government's first obligation was to create a Constitution for the Free State. This was undertaken by Collins and a team of solicitors. The outcome of their work became the Irish Constitution of 1922.<ref>The Constitution of the Irish Free State 1922 http://www.ucc.ie/celt/online/E900003-004/</ref> He drew up a republican constitution which, without repudiating the Treaty, would include no mention of the British king. His object was that the Constitution would allow participation in the D\u00e1il by dissenting TDs who opposed the Treaty and refused to take any oath mentioning the Crown. Under the Treaty, the Free State was obliged to submit its new Constitution to Westminster for approval. Upon doing so, in June 1922, Collins and Griffith found Lloyd George determined to veto the provisions they had fashioned to prevent civil war.<ref>Coogan, TP. ''Michael Collins''</ref>\n\nThe meetings with Lloyd George and Churchill were bitter and contentious. Collins, although less diplomatic than Griffith or de Valera, had no less penetrating comprehension of political issues. He complained that he was being manipulated into \"doing Churchill's dirty work\", in a potential civil war with his own former troops.<ref name=\"ReferenceJ\"/><ref>Michael Collins \u2013 Winston Churchill correspondence June 1922</ref>\n\n==Pact elections==\nNegotiations to prevent civil war resulted in, among others, \"The Army Document\" published in May 1922 which was signed by an equal number of pro- and anti-Treaty IRA officers including Collins, Dan Breen, and [[Gear\u00f3id O'Sullivan]]. This manifesto declared that \"a closing of ranks all round is necessary\" to prevent \"the greatest catastrophe in Irish history.\" It called for new elections, to be followed by the re-unification of the government and army, whatever the result.\n\nIn this spirit and with the organising efforts of moderates on both sides the Collins-de Valera \"Pact\" was created. This pact agreed that new elections to the D\u00e1il would be held with each candidate running as explicitly pro- or anti-Treaty and that, regardless of which side obtained a majority, the two factions would then join to form a coalition government of national unity.\n\nA referendum on the Treaty was also planned but it never took place. The Pact elections on 16 June 1922 therefore comprise the best quantitative record of the Irish public's direct response to the Treaty. The results were pro-Treaty 58 seats, anti-Treaty 35, Labour Party 17, Independents 7, Farmers party 7, plus 4 Unionists from Trinity College, Dublin.<ref>Public Records Office, Dublin</ref>\n\n==Assassination of Sir Henry Wilson==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2018}}\nSix days after the Pact elections, [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Wilson]] was assassinated on 22 June 1922 in broad daylight on the steps of his London home by a pair of London IRA men. A British Army [[field marshal]], Wilson had recently resigned his commission and been elected an MP for a constituency in Northern Ireland. He had a long history as one of the chief British leaders opposing Collins in the Irish conflict. At that time Wilson had served as military advisor to the Northern Ireland government led by [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], in which role he was seen to be responsible for the B-Specials and for other sources of loyalist violence in the north.\n\nThe debate concerning Collins's involvement continued in the 1950s, when a number of statements and rebuttals on the subject were published in periodicals. These were re-printed with additions in Rex Taylor's 1961 book ''Assassination: the death of Sir Henry Wilson and the tragedy of Ireland''. Participants in that discussion were Joe Dolan, Florence O'Donoghue, Denis P. Kelleher, Patrick O'Sullivan and others.<ref>Taylor, Rex. ''Assassination: the death of Sir Henry Wilson and the tragedy of Ireland'', (London 1961)</ref>\n\n==Civil War==\n{{Main|Irish Civil War}}\n[[File:Bombarded Four Courts Irish Civil War.jpg|right|thumb|The Provisional Government, led by Collins, gave the order to bombard the [[Four Courts]] with artillery shells in an attempt to remove Anti-treaty IRA. This was the start of the [[Irish Civil War]].]]\nThe death of Sir Henry Wilson caused a furor in London. Lloyd George, the prime Minister sent a letter to Collins saying that the 'ambiguous position' of the Provisional government with regard to the IRA in the Four Courts could no longer be tolerated. <ref>Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, The Irish Civil War,(2004) p.114</ref>.  The British cabinet met the day after assassination and agreed that Collins reply had not given a 'definite enough commitment' to disperse the Four Courts occupation. They ordered [[Nevil Macready]] commander of the British garrison still in Dublin, to attack the Four Courts, whose republican garrison they blamed from the shooting of Wilson. <ref>Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, The Irish Civil War,(2004) p.115</ref>. The plan was put on hold at the last minute when Macready advised the government, on June 26, to give Collins' Provisional Government one more chance to act against the Four Courts. <ref>Ibid. p.116</ref> \n\nCollins himself was in Cork at the time of the crisis. President Arthur Griffith and military officer Emmet Dalton met with British official to discuss 'the continued occupation of the Four Courts by the Irregulars under Rory O'Connor'. <ref>Sean Boyne, Emmet Dalton, Somme Soldier, Irish General, Film Pioneer p.138 </ref> There is little documentation of the decision to taken by the Provisional government, headed by Collins, to attack the Four Courts; Historian Michael Hopkinson writes, 'the scarcity of evidence is explained by the acute sensitivity of the subject, both at the time and since'. <ref>Hopkinson, p.116</ref> When Collins arrived back in Dublin, his forces began to act against the anti-Treatyites. On June 27 they arrested anti-Treaty IRA officer Leo Henderson as he was enforcing the Belfast Boycott by seizing cars. <ref>Hopkinson p.117</ref> In retaliation the anti-Treaty IRA men abducted [[J.J. \"Ginger\" O'Connell]], a Free State general and held him in the Four Courts. <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.406</ref>\n\nThese two developments led to the Provisional Government's 27 June 1922 order serving notice on the Four Courts garrison to surrender the building, their arms and release O'Connell, that night or face military action \"at once\". <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.406</ref> According to historian Charles Townsend, 'Collins must have consented to this though the actual decision seems to have been taken by Griffith'. <ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.407</ref> [[Peter Hart (historian)|Peter Hart]] similarly writes, 'it was Griffith rather than Collins who took the lead in this decision'. <ref>Peter Hart, Mick, The Real Michael Collins, p.398</ref> However cabinet member Ernest Blythe recalled that, 'the decision to attack the Four Courts was almost automatic once Collins had agreed to it.<ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.117</ref>\n\nCollins' position in this conflict was extraordinary indeed. A majority perhaps of the IRA he had helped lead in the War of Independence, were now ranged against the Provisional Government, which he represented. In addition, the force which by the will of the electorate he was obliged to lead had been re-organised since the Truce. Formed from a nucleus of pro-Treaty IRA men, it had evolved into a more formal, structured, uniformed [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] that was armed and funded by Britain. Many of the new members [[Ireland and World War I|were World War I veterans]] and others who had not fought on the nationalist side before. Collins's profoundly mixed feelings about this situation are recorded in his private and official correspondence.<ref>Kissane, Bill.

[[Emmet Dalton]], an Irishman who had served in the British Army and the IRA, who was now a leading Free State commander and close associate of Collins, was placed in charge of it. The Four Courts surrendered after three days of fighting.\n\nHeavy [[Battle of Dublin (1922)|fighting broke out in Dublin]] between the anti-Treaty IRA Dublin Brigade and the Free State troops. Much of O'Connell Street suffered heavy damage; the Gresham Hotel was burned and the Four Courts reduced to a ruin. Still, under Collins' direction, the Free State rapidly took control of the capital. By July 1922 anti-Treaty forces held much of the southern province of Munster and several other areas of the country. At the height of their success, they administered local government and policing in large regions.<ref>Clarke, Kathleen. ''Kathleen Clarke: Revolutionary Woman'' O'Brien Press 2008</ref> Collins, Richard Mulcahy, and Eoin O'Duffy decided on a series of seaborne landings into republican held areas, which re-took Munster and the west in July\u2013August.\n\nThat July, Collins set aside his title as Chairman of the Provisional Government to become Commander-in-Chief of the National Army. However, according to Charles Townshend, he became 'a kind of generalisimo, combining military and political supremacy. Griffith had no desire or capacity to dispute the day to day conduct of government with him and while Mulcahy had great administrative capacity, he deferred to Collins as a strategist and thinker'.<ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight for Irish Independence (2013), p.423</ref> He also [[prorogued]] the meeting of the Dail, or parliament until the end of hostilities, a move that historians such as John Regan have seen as an unconstitutional concentration of power in Collins himself and his military colleagues.<ref>John Regan, Myth and the Irish State (Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 2013), pp. 91</ref>\n\n===Civil War peace moves===\n\nRoughly two weeks after Cork city had been taken by Provisional Government forces, Collins travelled there to attempt to seize large sums of money that the anti-Treaty Republicans had lodged in various banks, under the account of the Land Bank. <ref>Dermot Keogh, Michael Collins, the making of the Irish Free State, (2006) p.67-68</ref>\n\nThere is also considerable evidence that Collins's journey to Cork in August 1922 was made in order to meet republican leaders with a view to ending the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\">Feehan, John M.

In Cork city, Collins met with neutral IRA members [[Se\u00e1n O'Hegarty]] and [[Florence O'Donoghue]] with a view to contacting Anti-Treaty IRA leaders [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] and [[Tom Hales (Irish republican)|Tom Hales]] to propose a truce. The anti-Treaty side had called a major convocation of officers to B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th, a remote crossroads, with ending the war on the agenda.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/>\n[[File:Michael Collins Risteard Mulcahy Glasnevin Cemetery at the funeral of Arthur Griffith.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Collins and [[Richard Mulcahy]] at [[Arthur Griffith]]'s funeral, a few days before Collins' own death.]]\nDe Valera was present there, however, Michel Hopkinson writes that 'there is no evidence that there was any prospect of a meeting between de Valera and Collins <ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p.177</ref>.

Republicans must \"accept the People's Verdict\" on the Treaty, but could then \"go home without their arms. We don't ask for any surrender of their principles\".<ref>Hopkinson, Green against Green, p. 177</ref> He argued that the Provisional Government was upholding \"the people's rights\" and would continue to do so. \"We want to avoid any possible unnecessary destruction and loss of life. We do not want to mitigate their weakness by resolute action beyond what is required\". But if Republicans did not accept his terms, \"further blood is on their shoulders\".<ref>Hopkinson, Green against Green, p. 177-178</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Michael Collins body lying in hospital.jpg|right|thumb|Michael Collins' body laid out at [[St. Vincent's University Hospital|St Vincent's Hospital]] in Dublin.]]\nIn August 1922, it seemed as though the Civil War was winding down.

County Cork was an IRA stronghold as much of it was still held by anti-Treaty forces. Yet he was determined to make the trip without delay. He had fended off a number of attempts on his life in the preceding weeks and had acknowledged more than once, in private conversation, that the Civil War might end his life at any moment. On several occasions, Collins assured his advisors \"they won't shoot me in my own county,\" or words to that effect.\n\n[[File:Crossley Tender rear 146440.jpg|right|thumb|A replica of the Crossley Tender in Collins' convoy on the day of his death in a replica of the road where it happened on display at the Michael Collins Centre, Clonakilty<ref>[http://www.michaelcollinscentre.com/index.html Michael Collins Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301105029/http://www.michaelcollinscentre.com/index.html |date=1 March 2012 }}, Clonakilty</ref>]]\nOn 22 August 1922 Collins set out from Cork City on a circuitous tour of West Cork. He passed first through Macroom then took the [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] road via [[Crookstown, County Cork|Crookstown]]. This led through [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]], an isolated crossroads. There they stopped at a local pub named 'Long's Pub', now known as [[The Diamond Bar]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thediamondbar.wordpress.com/history/ | title=History| date=2015-04-28}}</ref> to ask a question of a man standing at the crossroad. The man turned out to be an anti-Treaty sentry. He and an associate recognised Collins in the back of the open-top car.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nAs a result, an ambush was laid by an anti-Treaty column at that point, on the chance that the convoy might come through again on their return journey.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Between 7:30 and 8:00 pm, Collins' convoy approached B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th for the second time. By then most of the ambush party had dispersed and gone for the day, leaving just five or six men on the scene. Two were disarming a mine in the road, while three on a laneway overlooking them, provided cover. A dray cart, placed across the road, remained at the far end of the ambush site.\n\nThe Irregulars in the laneway opened fire with rifles on the convoy. Emmet Dalton ordered the driver of the touring car to 'drive like hell', but Collins said 'no, stop and we'll fight 'em' and jumped from the vehicle along with the others. Collins first took cover behind the low grass bank bordering the road but then jumped up and ran back along the road to begin firing with his Lee Enfield rifle from behind the armoured car. The Vickers machine gun in that car had also been firing at the attackers but then stopped because a badly-loaded ammunition belt caused it to jam. Apparently, to get a better view of the laneway, Collins left the protection of the armoured car and moved even farther back along the road. Now standing in the open, he fired a couple of shots and as he was once more working the bolt of his rifle he was struck in the head by a bullet fired by one of the ambushing party \u2013 Denis \"Sonny\" O'Neill, a former [[British Army]] [[sniper]].<ref>'Gunman believed to have killed Michael Collins was granted a military pension', 'The Irish Times', 3 October 2014.</ref>\n\nCollins was the only fatality sustained in the ambush, although another member of his party suffered a neck wound. After he was shot the fire from the ambushing party quickly fell off and they withdrew from the scene. Collins was found, face down, on the roadway. One of his men whispered an [[Act of Contrition]] into his ear, but Collins was clearly dead. He was lifted into the back of the touring car with his head resting against the shoulder of Emmet Dalton. The convoy cleared the dray cart obstruction and resumed its journey to Cork.\n\nThe lengthy time the convoy took to cover the twenty miles back to Cork City was because many of the roads were blocked and the convoy had to travel across muddy fields and through farms to circumnavigate the obstacles, all in darkness. At times, when the vehicles became bogged down, members of the convoy had to carry Collins' body on their shoulders. The touring car eventually had to be abandoned because of mechanical trouble.\n\nThere was no autopsy. Collins' field diary was taken by General Emmet Dalton who had been with him during his tour of the south. The body was first presented at Shanakiel Hospital in Cork, a small military establishment, and then shipped around the coast to Dublin where it was laid out in St Vincent's Hospital Dublin. From there it was removed to the City Hall beside Dublin Castle where it was laid in state.\n\n===Conspiracy and collusion===\nNumerous questions remain about the events surrounding the death of Collins because the only witnesses to his death were the members of the Free State Army convoy and the anti-Treaty ambushers. As no two stories match and participant statements from both sides are contradictory and inconsistent, unanswered questions linger about what happened that day.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\nThe man believed to have fired the fatal shot, Denis \"Sonny\" O'Neill, was a former officer from the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] who served as a [[sniper]] in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]], joined the IRA in 1918 and had met Collins on more than one occasion. However, when the Irish Civil War started in June 1922, O'Neill joined the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Anti-Treaty IRA]]; becoming one of the ambushers of Collins' convoy at [[Beal na Blath]] that August.<ref name=\"Sonny\"/>\n\nO'Neill remains a mysterious figure because of the contradictions in his biography: such as serving in the British Army but then joining the IRA. He provided them with information concerning the [[Igoe Gang]] that worked for the [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|British Army Intelligence Centre]]. Twenty years after Collins' death, the Irish State granted O'Neill a Captain's military pension in the 1940s.<ref name=\"Sonny\">{{cite news|title=Gunman believed to have killed Michael Collins was granted a military pension|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date= 3 October 2014|url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/gunman-believed-to-have-killed-michael-collins-was-granted-military-pension-1.1949934}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Sean Collins behind the coffin of his brother Michael.jpg|left|thumb|Sean Collins behind the coffin of his brother Michael.]]\n\nCollins lay in state for three days. Tens of thousands of mourners filed past his [[coffin]] to pay their respects, including many British soldiers departing Ireland who had fought against him. His funeral mass took place at Dublin's [[Pro Cathedral]] where a number of foreign and Irish dignitaries were in attendance. Some 500,000 people attended his funeral, almost one fifth of the country's population at that time.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/>\n\nNo official inquiry was ever undertaken into Collins's death and consequently, there is no official version of what happened, nor are there any authoritative, detailed contemporary records.<ref name=\"ReferenceL\"/>\n\n[[File:Collinsfuneral.jpg|right|thumb|Funeral of Michael Collins in the [[St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral|Pro-Cathedral]], Dublin (contemporary newspaper depiction of the [[List of Irish state funerals|state funeral]])]]\n\nIn this vacuum, independent investigations and conspiracy theorists have put forward a number of suspects as having executed or ordered his death, including an anti-Treaty sharpshooter, members of his own escort, the British secret service, or de Valera himself.\n\nDe Valera is alleged to have declared in 1966, \"It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Michael Collins; and it will be recorded at my expense.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= Dolan|first=Anne|title=Commemorating the Irish Civil War: History and Memory, 1923\u20132000 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=iS_3r0vHMxsC&pg=PA87 |series=Studies in the Social and Cultural History of Modern Warfare|volume=13|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02698-7|page=87}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Michael Collins On Bicycle.jpg|right|thumb|Collins on his bicycle.]]\nCollins's elderly father inspired his fondness and respect for older people. His mother, who had spent her youth caring for her own invalid mother and raising her own brothers and sisters, was a powerful influence. The entire management of the Collins farm fell to her, as her husband succumbed to old age and died. In a society which honoured hospitality as a prime virtue, Mrs Collins was eulogised as \"a hostess in ten thousand.\" Her five daughters avowedly doted on their youngest brother.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/> He enjoyed rough-housing and outdoor sports. Having won a local wrestling championship while still a boy, he is said to have made a pastime of challenging larger, older opponents, with frequent success. A very fit, active man throughout life, in the most stressful times he continued to enjoy wrestling as a form of relaxation and valued friendships which afforded opportunities to share athletic pursuits.<ref name=\"Coogan, TP Michael Collins 1990\"/> He could be abrasive, demanding, and inconsiderate of those around him, but frequently made up for it with gestures such as confectionery and other small gifts.<ref>O'Broin, Leon. ''Michael Collins'', Dublin, Gill & MacMillan 1980.{{Page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlike some of his political opponents, he was characterized by many close personal friendships within the movement. It has been justly said that while some were devoted to \"the idea of Ireland\", Collins was a people person whose patriotism was rooted in affection and respect for the people of Ireland around him. Among his famous last words is the final entry in his pocket diary, written on the journey which ended his life, \"The people are splendid.\"<ref>Michael Collins field diary, 22 August 1922</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceH\"/>\n\n[[File:Kitty Kiernan.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Kitty Kiernan]]\n\nIn 1921\u201322, he became engaged to [[Kitty Kiernan]].\n\nCollins was a complex man whose character abounded in contradictions. Although Minister of Finance and an accountant by pre-war profession, he seems never to have pursued personal profit; indeed he was sometimes all but homeless during the war for independence. This characteristic was exemplified by a letter he wrote on 4 August 1922 to his canvassing agent; offering to pay half the bill for a hired election car because some of the journeys had been for personal trips.<ref>Kennerk, Barry and Alison Healy, Evidence of an Irish Politician's Scruples on Expenses...in 1922 in  ''Irish Times'', 8 Nov. 2010</ref> While clearly fond of command and keen to take charge, he had an equal appetite for input and advice from people at every level of the organisation, prompting the comment that \"he took advice from his chauffeur.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceG\"/> Although acknowledged by friends and foes as \"head centre\" of the movement, he continually chose a title just short of actual head of state; becoming Chairman of the Provisional Government only after the abdication of half the D\u00e1il forced him to do so. While his official and personal correspondence records his solicitous care for the wants of insurgents in need, during the war he showed no hesitation in ordering the death of opponents who threatened nationalist lives.<ref>Collins, Michael (Costello, Francis J., Ed.) ''Michael Collins In His Own Words'', Dublin, Gill & Macmillan, 1997</ref>\n\nCertainly a man of fierce pride, his pride was tempered by a sense of humour that included a keen sense of the absurd in his own situation.<ref>Michael Collins personal correspondence</ref> While mastermind of a clandestine military, he remained a public figure. When official head of the Free State government, he continued to cooperate in the IRA's secret operations. He was capable of bold, decisive actions on his own authority, which caused friction with his colleagues, such as his falling out with [[Cathal Brugha]]; but at critical junctures he could also bow to majority decisions which were profoundly disadvantageous and dangerous to his own interests (such as his appointment to the Treaty negotiating team).\n\n==Commemoration==\n[[File:Grave of Miche\u00e1l \u00d3 Coile\u00e1in.jpg|left|thumb|Memorial cross at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th.]]\nAn annual commemoration ceremony takes place each year in August at the ambush site at [[B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th]], County Cork, organised by The B\u00e9al na mBl\u00e1th Commemoration Committee. In 2009, former President of Ireland [[Mary Robinson]] gave the oration. In 2010 the Minister for Finance [[Brian Lenihan Jnr]] became the first Fianna F\u00e1il person to give the oration. In 2012 on the 90th anniversary of the death of Collins, the [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] gave the oration, the first serving head of government to do so.\n\nThere is also a remembrance ceremony at Collins's grave in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] on the anniversary of his death every year.\n\n[[File:2017-06-20 4904x7356 dublin glasnevin cemetery michael collins grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael Collins grave at Glasnevin Cemetery]]\nMichael Collins House museum in Clonakilty, Cork is a museum dedicated to Michael Collins and the history of Irish Independence.

Selections have been published in ''The Path to Freedom'' (Mercier, 1968) and in ''Michael Collins in His Own Words'' (Gill & Macmillan, 1997). In the 1960s, Taoiseach Se\u00e1n Lemass, himself a veteran of the 1916 Rising and War of Independence, credited Collins's ideas as the basis for his successes in revitalizing Ireland's economy.\n\nNine years after his death, the UK Parliament passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which removed virtually all of London's remaining authority over the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of making the Free State the first internationally recognised independent Irish state, thus fulfilling Collins' vision of having \"the freedom to achieve freedom.\"\n\n==Societies==\nThe '''Collins 22 Society''' established in 2002 is an international organisation dedicated to keeping the name and legacy of Michael Collins in living memory. The patron of the society is Ireland's former Minister for Justice and TD [[Nora Owen]], grand-niece of Michael Collins.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:Bust of Michael Collins at Merrion Square Park, Dublin, Ireland..JPG|left|thumb|Bust of Michael Collins at Merrion Square Park, Dublin, Ireland.]]\nThe 1936 film ''[[Beloved Enemy]]'' is a fictionalised account of Collins's life. Unlike the real Michael Collins, the fictionalised \"Dennis Riordan\" (played by [[Brian Aherne]]) is shot, but recovers. ''[[Hang Up Your Brightest Colours]]'', a British [[documentary film|documentary]] by [[Kenneth Griffith]], was made for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1973, but refused transmission. It was eventually screened by the [[BBC]] in [[Wales]] in 1993 and across the United Kingdom the following year.\n\nIn 1969, [[Dominic Behan]] wrote an episode of the UK television series [[Play for today]] entitled 'Michael Collins'. The play dealt with Collins' attempt to take the gun out of Irish politics and took the perspective of the Republican argument. At the time of writing the script, [[the troubles]] had just begun in Northern Ireland and the [[BBC]] were reluctant to broadcast the production. An appeal by the author to [[David Attenborough]] (Director of Programming for the BBC at that time) resulted in the play eventually being broadcast; Attenborough took the view that the imperatives of free speech could not be compromised in the cause of political expediency.\n\nAn [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] documentary made by Colm Connolly for [[RT\u00c9 Television]] in 1989 called ''The Shadow of B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th'' covered Collins's death. A made-for-TV film, ''[[The Treaty (film)|The Treaty]]'', was produced in 1991 and starred [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Collins and [[Ian Bannen]] as [[David Lloyd George]]. In 2007, RT\u00c9 produced a documentary entitled ''Get Collins'', about the intelligence war which took place in [[Dublin]].<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/tv/hiddenhistory/getcollins.html RTE.ie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030033543/http://www.rte.ie/tv/hiddenhistory/getcollins.html |date=30 October 2008 }}, \"Get Collins\"</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1227857/ IMDb.com], \"Get Collins\"</ref>\n\nCollins was the subject of [[film director|director]] [[Neil Jordan]]'s 1996 film ''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]'', with [[Liam Neeson]] in the title role. Collins's great-grandnephew, Aengus O'Malley, played a student in a scene filmed in [[Marsh's Library]].\n\nIn 2005 [[Cork Opera House]] commissioned a musical drama about Collins.<ref>[http://www.corkoperahouse.ie/musicals/Old_Musical_Files/michael_collins_a%20_musical_drama.php Cork Opera House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415160923/http://corkoperahouse.ie/musicals/Old_Musical_Files/michael_collins_a%20_musical_drama.php |date=15 April 2009 }}</ref> \"Michael Collins\" by Brian Flynn had a successful run in 2009 at Cork opera house and later in the [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin|Olympia Theatre]] in Dublin.\n\n''[[Infamous Assassinations]]'', a 2007 British documentary television series, devoted its eighth episode to the death of Collins.\n\nThe 2016 miniseries, ''[[Rebellion (miniseries)|Rebellion]]'', focused on the 1916 Easter Rising. Collins appeared as a background character, taking part in the uprising, played by Sebastian Thommen.\n\nCollins was portrayed by Gavin Drea in the 2019 sequel to Rebellion, [[Resistance (miniseries)|Resistance]].\n\n===Songs===\n[[File:Wax figure of Michael Collins at the National Wax Plus Museum, Dublin, Ireland..JPG|right|thumb|Wax figure of Michael Collins at the [[National Wax Plus Museum]], Dublin, Ireland.]]\nIrish-American [[folk rock]] band [[Black 47]] recorded a song entitled \"[[The Big Fellah]]\" which was the first track on their 1994 album ''Home of the Brave''. It details Collins's career, from the [[Easter Rising]] to his death at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th. Irish [[Folk music|folk]] band the [[Wolfe Tones]] recorded a song titled \"Michael Collins\" on ''[[A Sense of Freedom (album)|A Sense of Freedom]]'' (1983) about Collins's life and death, although it begins when he was about 16 and took a job in London. Celtic metal band [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]] recorded a song also titled \"Michael Collins\" on their 2004 album ''[[Pagan (album)|Pagan]]'' which dealt with his role in the Civil War, the treaty and his eventual death. Also a song by [[Johnny McEvoy]], simply named \"Michael\", depicts Collins's death and the sadness surrounding his funeral.\n\nThe poem \"The laughing boy\" by [[Brendan Behan]] lamenting the death of Collins was translated into Greek in 1961 by Vasilis Rotas. In October of the same year, [[Mikis Theodorakis]] composed the song \"T\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03af\" (\"The laughing boy\") using Rotas' translation. The song was recorded by [[Maria Farantouri]] in 1966 on the album \"\u0388\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" (\"The hostage\") and became an instant success. It was the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' (1969). \"The laughing boy\" became the song of protest against the [[dictatorship in Greece]] (1967\u20131974) and remains to date one of the most popular songs in Greek popular culture.\n\n===Plays===\nJournalist Eamonn O'Neill wrote the play ''God Save Ireland Cried the Hero'' about Collins' last night alive. Set in his hotel room, the one-man production started Liam Brennan in the role of Collins and was produced by the Wiseguise Company. It was performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooper |first1=Neil |title=Edinburgh Festival: God Save Ireland Cried The Hero |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/fringe-round-up-5602596.html |accessdate=21 August 2019 |work=Independent |date=30  August 1996}}</ref>\n\n[[Mary Kenny]] wrote a play ''Allegiance'', about a meeting between [[Winston Churchill]] and Michael Collins.

It was introduced by [[Napoleon I]] in 1808.\n\nSimilar academic qualification exist elsewhere in Europe, variously known as ''[[Abitur]]'' in [[Germany]], ''maturit\u00e0'' in [[Italy]], ''bachillerato'' in [[Spain]] (also in [[Mexico]] and [[South America]]), as well as ''baccalaureus'' in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Sweden]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. There is also the [[European Baccalaureate]], which students take at the end of the [[European School]] education.\n\nIn France, there are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' obtained in different places, and which are completely different: the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general baccalaureate), the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'' (technological baccalaureate), and the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate).\n\n==Overview==\nMuch like the European ''[[Matura]]'' or British [[Advanced Level (UK)|A levels]], the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' allows French and international students to obtain a standardised qualification, typically at the age of 18 (end of the ''lyc\u00e9e''). It qualifies holders to work in certain areas, go on to [[tertiary education]] (''universit\u00e9s''), or acquire some other professional qualification or training. Even though it is not legally required, the vast majority of students in their final year of secondary school take a final exam.\n\nThe word ''bac'' is also used to refer to one of the end-of-year exams that students must pass to get their ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' diploma: ''le bac de philo'', for example, is the philosophy exam, which all students must take, regardless of their field of study.\n\nWithin France, there are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' obtained in different places, and which are completely different:\n\n*the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general baccalaureate), specially made to enter university and continue studies;\n*the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'' (technological baccalaureate), specially made to work or continue short technical studies;\n*the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate), specially made to enter professional life.\n\nFor entrance to regular universities within France, however, there are some restrictions as to the type of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' that can be presented. In some cases, it may be possible to enter a French university without the ''bac'' by taking a special exam, the \"diploma for entrance to higher education\".\n\nThough most students take the ''bac'' at the end of secondary school, it is also possible to enter as a ''candidat libre'' (literally, \"free candidate\") without affiliation to a school. Students who did not take the ''bac'' upon completion of [[secondary school]] (or did not manage to pass it) and would like to attend university, or feel that the ''bac'' would help them accomplish professional aspirations, may exercise that option.\n\n==''Baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''==\nThe main purpose of the general baccalaureate is to allow access to [[List of public universities in France|universities]] and [[grandes \u00e9coles]] to pursue studies. It attests to an advanced level in general skills. It is obtained in a ''Lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.\n\nBefore 2021, the students who sit for the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' choose one of three streams (termed ''s\u00e9ries'') in the penultimate ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' year (S for Sciences; ES for Economics and Social sciences; and L for Literature). Each stream results in a specialization and carries different weights (''coefficients'') associated with each subject.\n\nIn 2021, the S, ES and L streams of the general baccalaureate are deleted. On this date, students of the general baccalaureate now choose three specialty courses, then keep two in the final year. There are 12 specialties : [[The arts|arts]], [[ecology]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[humanities]], [[Language|languages]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[Economics|economic]] and [[Social science|social sciences]], [[Engineering|engineering sciences]], [[biology]] & [[geology]]. These specialties are added to a part common to all : [[French language|french]], [[philosophy]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[Language|languages]], [[Science|sciences]], [[sport]]. A large part of the tests is now in continuous control but the students also have a final [[Oral tradition|oral]] test.\n\nThe streams of the ''Baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' before 2021 : \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:33%\" | S <br /> S''cientifique''<br /> (Sciences)\n! style=\"width:33%\" | ES <br />''sciences \u00c9conomiques et Sociales''<br /> (Economics and Social sciences)\n! style=\"width:33%\" | L <br />''Litt\u00e9raire''<br /> (Literature)\n|- \n| The science stream (''bac S - bac scientifique'') requires a high level in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[biology]] & [[geology]] and, if available, [[Engineering|engineering sciences]] and [[computer science]].\n| The ''bac ES'' (''bac \u00e9conomique et social'') requires a high level in [[economics]] and [[Social science|social]] courses of studies; also in [[mathematics]], [[history]] & [[geography]]. \n| The ''bac L'' (''bac litt\u00e9raire'') weighs [[French literature]], [[philosophy]], [[Foreign language|foreign languages]] and [[The arts|arts]] heavily.\n|}\n\nAnother terminology is sometimes used, which existed before 1994 and further divided the different ''s\u00e9ries''. Until then, it was possible to sit for a ''bac C'' or ''D'' (which is now S), ''B'' (now ES), or ''A1, A2, A3'' (now L). People who passed the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' before the reform still use that terminology in referring their diploma. \n\nThe ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' permits students to choose to sit for exams in over forty world languages or French regional languages (such as [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] or [[Norman language|Norman]]).\n\n=== ''Baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral : s\u00e9rie'' ''Scientifique'' (S) ===\nThe S stream prepares students for work in scientific fields such as [[medicine]], [[engineering]] and the [[natural sciences]].

It is obtained in a ''Lyc\u00e9e technologique''. The teaching of the lessons is based on inductive reasoning and experimentation. It allows you to work or to pursue short and technical studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant, management etc.).\n\nIt currently has eight sections : STMG (Sciences and Technologies of Management), ST2S (Sciences and Technologies of Healthcare), STI2D (Sciences and Technologies of Industry and Sustainable Development), STD2A (Sciences and Technologies of Design and Applied Art), STHR (Hospitality Industry and Business), STL (Science and Technologies of Laboratory), STAV (Science and Technologies of Agronomy and Living Organisms), S2TMD (Science and Technologies of Theater, Music and Dance).\n\n== ''Baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' ==\nThe professional baccalaureate allows rapid integration into working life. It is obtained in a ''Lyc\u00e9e professionnel''.  \n\nThe professional baccalaureate includes nearly 100 specialties like : Leather crafts; Building technician; Maintenance of industrial equipment; Cooked; Road freight transport driver; Butcher etc. \n\n==Format==\nThe ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' examination takes place in the two last years of the ''lyc\u00e9e'' : ''premi\u00e8re'' and ''terminale''. From 2021 a large part of the tests is now in continuous control.\n\nMost examinations are given in [[essay]]-form. The student is given a substantial block of time (depending on the exam, that is from two to five hours) to complete a multiple-page, well-argued paper. The number of pages varies from exam to exam but is usually substantial considering all answers have to be written down, explained and justified. [[Mathematics]] and [[science]] exams are problem sets but some science questions also require an essay-type answer. Foreign-language exams often have a short [[translation]] section, as well. Mathematics and the Earth & Life Sciences examinations may occasionally contain some [[multiple-choice questions]] (''choix multiples''), but this is rare and when it occurs, it does not constitute the majority of the exam.\n\nStudents of ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' also have to work on an oral [[scientific research|research]] project (final oral test, ''travaux personnels encadr\u00e9s'', or TPE). It is focus on their specialties, under the supervision of a faculty member. The oral examination takes place in front of a jury of teachers. There are also several oral in language; practical work in science or arts; or physical evaluation in sport.\n\nWhen taken in mainland France, the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' material is the same for all students in a given stream. The secrecy surrounding the material is very tight, and the envelopes containing the exams are unsealed by a high-ranking school officer (usually a principal or vice-principal) in front of the examinees only a few minutes prior to the start of the examination. The procedure is the same for each subject, in each stream. Students usually have an identification number and an assigned seat. The number is written on all exam material and the name is hidden by folding and sealing the upper right-hand corner of the examination sheet(s). That way, anonymity is respected. The correcting staff is usually a member of the teaching staff in the same district or, at a larger scale, in the same ''acad\u00e9mie''. To avoid conflicts of interests, a teacher who has lectured to a student or group of students cannot grade that exam. Also, to ensure greater objectivity on the part of the examiners, the test is anonymous. The grader sees only an exam paper with a serial number, with all personally identifying material stripped away and forbidden from appearing, thus curbing any favoritism based upon sex, religion, national origin, or ethnicity.\n\nUnlike the English [[GCSE]]s, [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Standard Grade]]s or the American [[SAT]], the French ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' is not a completely-standardised test. Since most answers, even for biology questions, are given in essay form, the grades may vary from grader to grader, especially in subjects like [[philosophy]] and [[French literature]].\n\nStudents generally take the [[French language]] and literature exam at the end of ''premi\u00e8re'' since that subject is not taught in ''terminale'', where it is replaced with a philosophy course. It also has an oral examination component, along with the written part. The oral exam covers works studied throughout ''premi\u00e8re''.\n\n===Weight system===\nEach ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' stream has its own set of subjects that each carry a different weight (''coefficient''). That allows some subjects to be more important than others. For example, in the ES stream, [[Economics]] & [[Social Science]] carry more weight than the [[Natural Sciences]] and so the former is more important than the latter. Students usually study more for exams that carry heavier weights since the grade that they obtain in these exams have a bigger impact on their mean grade. Whether or not one passes the ''bac'' and/or receives eventual honours are determined in the calculation of that mean.\n\n=== Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at ===\nThe general baccalaur\u00e9at offers several additional variants. The best-known subset is the \"option internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at\" (OIB). Sometimes confusingly translated as the \"French international baccalaureat\",  it is, however, unrelated to the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB).\n\nThe OIB adds further subjects to the French national exam. Students choose one of the L, ES or S streams. It differs, as students take a two-year syllabus in literature, history, and geography in a foreign language. That syllabus and the way that it is examined is modelled on the national exam of the target nation. For instance, the British Section (administered by the [[University of Cambridge]]) models the programmes on A-levels in English, History, and Geography. It is therefore necessary to be fully bilingual to complete this qualification. To date there are 15 different sections supporting 14 different languages. The list is as follows: American, Arabic, British, (mainland) Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.<ref>[http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid23092/les-sections-internationales-au-lycee.html \"les sections Internationales au lyc\u00e9e\"] Education.gouv.fr Retrieved 2013-07-04</ref>\n\nAt the end of ''terminale'', OIB students have extra exams in Literature and History/Geography. Those exams have a high weight in the final mark of the baccalaureate and do not give extra points to OIB students. Overall, these students work much more (up to an additional 10 hours per week of classes, with a significant amount of required reading and homework attached as well) than the other general baccalaur\u00e9at students, and many of them tend to go to foreign universities. University admissions tutors often consider reducing the entrance requirements for students taking the OIB compared with those taking the standard French baccalaureate to reflect the additional demands of the OIB.<ref>{{cite web|title=OIB: The Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at Explained|url=http://www.gsgi.co.uk/articles/curricula-and-exams/oib-option-internationale-du-baccalaureat|website=The Good Schools Guide|accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince the students that attend these schools make up a fairly-small demographic, they tend to be spread over a far larger area than would traditionally be expected of a normal lyc\u00e9e or secondary school. As a consequence, many of these students must commute long distances, with one-hour trips each way being fairly common. The long commutes to the longer days and the increased workload that come with the OIB make the system be highly demanding of students, and many students cannot handle the workload and so transfer to schools teaching the standard French baccalaureate. Thus, many consider the OIB qualification to be highly challenging and a sign of not only academic prowess but also one of tenacity and hard work.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Different languages ===\n\nTo test their foreign or regional language students can choose among these different languages (not at all schools): [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Modern Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]; regional languages: [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Auvergnat (dialect)|Auvergnat]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], [[Languedoc]], [[Limousin (dialect)|Limousin]], [[Ni\u00e7ard]], [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]], [[Vivaro-Alpine]], regional languages of [[Alsace]] regional languages of [[Moselle]]), [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Amharic]], [[Melanesian languages]], [[Bambara language|Bambara]], [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Hindi]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]], [[Laotian language|Laotian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Fula language|Fulani]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2003/30/MENE0301542N.htm |title=Bulletin officiel n\u00b030 du 24 juillet 2003 - M.J.E.N.R |publisher=Education.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>\n\n==Passing and honours==\nThe pass mark is 10 out of 20.

The same applies when marking the ''baccalaur\u00e9at''. Therefore, students are very unlikely to get a 20 out of 20 or more (it is actually possible to get more than 20 because of options like Arts, Music, Latin etc.). It is also very rare to see scores lower than 5.\n\n[[Grade inflation]] has become a concern. Between 2005 and 2016, the proportion of students who received an honour in the general baccalaureate doubled.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.euronews.com/2017/07/05/what-is-the-bac\n | title =What is the bac?\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =5 July 2017\n | website =Euronews\n | publisher =\n | access-date =12 July 2017\n | quote = }}</ref>\n\n===European section===\nA European section is an option in [[France|French]] [[high school]]s to teach a subject through a [[European language]] other than French. It also gives pupils the opportunity of having more hours in the language studied. It is also an opportunity to learn more about the culture of the country of which the language is being spoken. For example, learning History in Spanish the history of Spain and that of Central and South America would be emphasized. Teachers present their lessons in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nAt the end, students can receive a \"European section\" mention on their [[baccalaureat]]. To have that mention, they need to get at least 12/20 on their language examination and at least 10/20 at an additional oral examination on the subject in the language.\n\nFor example, those who choose History in Spanish as an additional subject would take their Spanish examination like the rest of their classmates, who do not have History in Spanish, and get at least 12/20. They then have to pass an oral examination on history in Spanish and get at least 10/20.\n\n===Supplemental examination===\nA student who averages between 8 and 10 is permitted to sit for the ''\u00e9preuve de rattrapage'' (also called the ''second groupe''), a supplemental oral examination is given in two subjects of the student's choice. A student who does well enough in those examinations to raise the overall weighted grade to a 10 gets the ''baccalaur\u00e9at''. A student who does poorly in the orals and receives below a 10 may choose to repeat the final year of lyc\u00e9e (''terminale'').\n\nStudents may not redo the entire examination in September; the September examinations may be taken only by those who have not been able to take the June examinations for serious reasons (such as illness).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|Education}}\n* [[Academic grading in France]]\n* [[Education in France]]\n* [[Baccalaur\u00e9at technologique]]\n* [[International Baccalaureate]]\n* [[European Baccalaureate]]\n\n==Note==\n# The formula was taken from the [http://www.claudel.org Lyc\u00e9e Claudel website], a French lyc\u00e9e in Ottawa, Canada and might only be accurate for Canadian\u2014and even Ontarian\u2014percentage grades.  In Ontario, an 80% grade is an \"A\" on the American Scale and the student is awarded an Ontario Scholar Diploma.  A 90% grade is an A+ on the American Scale is considered a grade with honours and automatically qualifies the student for government-funded scholarships and bursaries.

There is also the [[European Baccalaureate]], which students take at the end of the [[European School]] education.\n\nIn France, there are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' obtained in different places, and which are completely different: the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general baccalaureate), the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'' (technological baccalaureate), and the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate).\n\n==Overview==\nMuch like the European ''[[Matura]]'' or British [[Advanced Level (UK)|A levels]], the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' allows French and international students to obtain a standardised qualification, typically at the age of 18 (end of the ''lyc\u00e9e''). It qualifies holders to work in certain areas, go on to [[tertiary education]] (''universit\u00e9s''), or acquire some other professional qualification or training. Even though it is not legally required, the vast majority of students in their final year of secondary school take a final exam.\n\nThe word ''bac'' is also used to refer to one of the end-of-year exams that students must pass to get their ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' diploma: ''le bac de philo'', for example, is the philosophy exam, which all students must take, regardless of their field of study.\n\nWithin France, there are three main types of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' obtained in different places, and which are completely different:\n\n*the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' (general baccalaureate), specially made to enter university and continue studies;\n*the ''baccalaur\u00e9at technologique'' (technological baccalaureate), specially made to work or continue short technical studies;\n*the ''baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' (professional baccalaureate), specially made to enter professional life.\n\nFor entrance to regular universities within France, however, there are some restrictions as to the type of ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' that can be presented. In some cases, it may be possible to enter a French university without the ''bac'' by taking a special exam, the \"diploma for entrance to higher education\".\n\nThough most students take the ''bac'' at the end of secondary school, it is also possible to enter as a ''candidat libre'' (literally, \"free candidate\") without affiliation to a school. Students who did not take the ''bac'' upon completion of [[secondary school]] (or did not manage to pass it) and would like to attend university, or feel that the ''bac'' would help them accomplish professional aspirations, may exercise that option.\n\n==''Baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''==\nThe main purpose of the general baccalaureate is to allow access to [[List of public universities in France|universities]] and [[grandes \u00e9coles]] to pursue studies. It attests to an advanced level in general skills. It is obtained in a ''Lyc\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9ral''.\n\nBefore 2021, the students who sit for the ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' choose one of three streams (termed ''s\u00e9ries'') in the penultimate ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' year (S for Sciences; ES for Economics and Social sciences; and L for Literature). Each stream results in a specialization and carries different weights (''coefficients'') associated with each subject.\n\nIn 2021, the S, ES and L streams of the general baccalaureate are deleted. On this date, students of the general baccalaureate now choose three specialty courses, then keep two in the final year. There are 12 specialties : [[The arts|arts]], [[ecology]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[humanities]], [[Language|languages]], [[literature]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[Economics|economic]] and [[Social science|social sciences]], [[Engineering|engineering sciences]], [[biology]] & [[geology]]. These specialties are added to a part common to all : [[French language|french]], [[philosophy]], [[history]] & [[geography]], [[Language|languages]], [[Science|sciences]], [[sport]]. A large part of the tests is now in continuous control but the students also have a final [[Oral tradition|oral]] test.\n\nThe streams of the ''Baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' before 2021 : \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:33%\" | S <br /> S''cientifique''<br /> (Sciences)\n! style=\"width:33%\" | ES <br />''sciences \u00c9conomiques et Sociales''<br /> (Economics and Social sciences)\n! style=\"width:33%\" | L <br />''Litt\u00e9raire''<br /> (Literature)\n|- \n| The science stream (''bac S - bac scientifique'') requires a high level in [[mathematics]], [[physics]] & [[chemistry]], [[biology]] & [[geology]] and, if available, [[Engineering|engineering sciences]] and [[computer science]].\n| The ''bac ES'' (''bac \u00e9conomique et social'') requires a high level in [[economics]] and [[Social science|social]] courses of studies; also in [[mathematics]], [[history]] & [[geography]]. \n| The ''bac L'' (''bac litt\u00e9raire'') weighs [[French literature]], [[philosophy]], [[Foreign language|foreign languages]] and [[The arts|arts]] heavily.\n|}\n\nAnother terminology is sometimes used, which existed before 1994 and further divided the different ''s\u00e9ries''. Until then, it was possible to sit for a ''bac C'' or ''D'' (which is now S), ''B'' (now ES), or ''A1, A2, A3'' (now L). People who passed the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' before the reform still use that terminology in referring their diploma. \n\nThe ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' permits students to choose to sit for exams in over forty world languages or French regional languages (such as [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] or [[Norman language|Norman]]).\n\n=== ''Baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral : s\u00e9rie'' ''Scientifique'' (S) ===\nThe S stream prepares students for work in scientific fields such as [[medicine]], [[engineering]] and the [[natural sciences]]. Science students must specialise in either [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]] & [[Chemistry]], [[Computer science]] or [[Geology|Earth]] & [[Biology|Life Sciences]].

It is obtained in a ''Lyc\u00e9e technologique''. The teaching of the lessons is based on inductive reasoning and experimentation. It allows you to work or to pursue short and technical studies (laboratory, design and applied arts, hotel and restaurant, management etc.).\n\nIt currently has eight sections : STMG (Sciences and Technologies of Management), ST2S (Sciences and Technologies of Healthcare), STI2D (Sciences and Technologies of Industry and Sustainable Development), STD2A (Sciences and Technologies of Design and Applied Art), STHR (Hospitality Industry and Business), STL (Science and Technologies of Laboratory), STAV (Science and Technologies of Agronomy and Living Organisms), S2TMD ( Science and Technologies of Theater, Music and Dance).\n\n== ''Baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel'' ==\nThe professional baccalaureate allows rapid integration into working life. It is obtained in a ''Lyc\u00e9e professionnel''.  \n\nThe professional baccalaureate includes nearly 100 specialties like : Leather crafts; Building technician; Maintenance of industrial equipment; Cooked; Road freight transport driver; Butcher etc. \n\n==Format==\nThe ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' examination takes place in the two last years of the ''lyc\u00e9e'' : ''premi\u00e8re'' and ''terminale''. From 2021 a large part of the tests is now in continuous control.\n\nMost examinations are given in [[essay]]-form. The student is given a substantial block of time (depending on the exam, that is from two to five hours) to complete a multiple-page, well-argued paper. The number of pages varies from exam to exam but is usually substantial considering all answers have to be written down, explained and justified. [[Mathematics]] and [[science]] exams are problem sets but some science questions also require an essay-type answer. Foreign-language exams often have a short [[translation]] section, as well. Mathematics and the Earth & Life Sciences examinations may occasionally contain some [[multiple-choice questions]] (''choix multiples''), but this is rare and when it occurs, it does not constitute the majority of the exam.\n\nStudents of ''baccalaur\u00e9at g\u00e9n\u00e9ral'' also have to work on an oral [[scientific research|research]] project (final oral test, ''travaux personnels encadr\u00e9s'', or TPE). It is focus on their specialties, under the supervision of a faculty member. The oral examination takes place in front of a jury of teachers. There are also several oral in language; practical work in science or arts; or physical evaluation in sport.\n\nWhen taken in mainland France, the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' material is the same for all students in a given stream. The secrecy surrounding the material is very tight, and the envelopes containing the exams are unsealed by a high-ranking school officer (usually a principal or vice-principal) in front of the examinees only a few minutes prior to the start of the examination. The procedure is the same for each subject, in each stream. Students usually have an identification number and an assigned seat. The number is written on all exam material and the name is hidden by folding and sealing the upper right-hand corner of the examination sheet(s). That way, anonymity is respected. The correcting staff is usually a member of the teaching staff in the same district or, at a larger scale, in the same ''acad\u00e9mie''. To avoid conflicts of interests, a teacher who has lectured to a student or group of students cannot grade that exam. Also, to ensure greater objectivity on the part of the examiners, the test is anonymous. The grader sees only an exam paper with a serial number, with all personally identifying material stripped away and forbidden from appearing, thus curbing any favoritism based upon sex, religion, national origin, or ethnicity.\n\nUnlike the English [[GCSE]]s, [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Standard Grade]]s or the American [[SAT]], the French ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' is not a completely-standardised test. Since most answers, even for biology questions, are given in essay form, the grades may vary from grader to grader, especially in subjects like [[philosophy]] and [[French literature]].\n\nStudents generally take the [[French language]] and literature exam at the end of ''premi\u00e8re'' since that subject is not taught in ''terminale'', where it is replaced with a philosophy course. It also has an oral examination component, along with the written part. The oral exam covers works studied throughout ''premi\u00e8re''.\n\n===Weight system===\nEach ''baccalaur\u00e9at'' stream has its own set of subjects that each carry a different weight (''coefficient''). That allows some subjects to be more important than others. For example, in the ES stream, [[Economics]] & [[Social Science]] carry more weight than the [[Natural Sciences]] and so the former is more important than the latter. Students usually study more for exams that carry heavier weights since the grade that they obtain in these exams have a bigger impact on their mean grade. Whether or not one passes the ''bac'' and/or receives eventual honours are determined in the calculation of that mean.\n\n=== Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at ===\nThe general baccalaur\u00e9at offers several additional variants. The best-known subset is the \"option internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at\" (OIB). Sometimes confusingly translated as the \"French international baccalaureat\",  it is, however, unrelated to the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB).\n\nThe OIB adds further subjects to the French national exam. Students choose one of the L, ES or S streams. It differs, as students take a two-year syllabus in literature, history, and geography in a foreign language. That syllabus and the way that it is examined is modelled on the national exam of the target nation. For instance, the British Section (administered by the [[University of Cambridge]]) models the programmes on A-levels in English, History, and Geography. It is therefore necessary to be fully bilingual to complete this qualification. To date there are 15 different sections supporting 14 different languages. The list is as follows: American, Arabic, British, (mainland) Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.<ref>[http://www.education.gouv.fr/cid23092/les-sections-internationales-au-lycee.html \"les sections Internationales au lyc\u00e9e\"] Education.gouv.fr Retrieved 2013-07-04</ref>\n\nAt the end of ''terminale'', OIB students have extra exams in Literature and History/Geography. Those exams have a high weight in the final mark of the baccalaureate and do not give extra points to OIB students. Overall, these students work much more (up to an additional 10 hours per week of classes, with a significant amount of required reading and homework attached as well) than the other general baccalaur\u00e9at students, and many of them tend to go to foreign universities. University admissions tutors often consider reducing the entrance requirements for students taking the OIB compared with those taking the standard French baccalaureate to reflect the additional demands of the OIB.<ref>{{cite web|title=OIB: The Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at Explained|url=http://www.gsgi.co.uk/articles/curricula-and-exams/oib-option-internationale-du-baccalaureat|website=The Good Schools Guide|accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince the students that attend these schools make up a fairly-small demographic, they tend to be spread over a far larger area than would traditionally be expected of a normal lyc\u00e9e or secondary school. As a consequence, many of these students must commute long distances, with one-hour trips each way being fairly common. The long commutes to the longer days and the increased workload that come with the OIB make the system be highly demanding of students, and many students cannot handle the workload and so transfer to schools teaching the standard French baccalaureate. Thus, many consider the OIB qualification to be highly challenging and a sign of not only academic prowess but also one of tenacity and hard work.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Different languages ===\n\nTo test their foreign or regional language students can choose among these different languages (not at all schools): [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Arabic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Modern Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]; regional languages: [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Auvergnat (dialect)|Auvergnat]], [[Gascon language|Gascon]], [[Languedoc]], [[Limousin (dialect)|Limousin]], [[Ni\u00e7ard]], [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]], [[Vivaro-Alpine]], regional languages of [[Alsace]] regional languages of [[Moselle]]), [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Amharic]], [[Melanesian languages]], [[Bambara language|Bambara]], [[Berber language|Berber]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Hindi]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]], [[Laotian language|Laotian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Fula language|Fulani]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2003/30/MENE0301542N.htm |title=Bulletin officiel n\u00b030 du 24 juillet 2003 - M.J.E.N.R |publisher=Education.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-10-04}}</ref>\n\n==Passing and honours==\nThe pass mark is 10 out of 20.

The same applies when marking the ''baccalaur\u00e9at''. Therefore, students are very unlikely to get a 20 out of 20 or more (it is actually possible to get more than 20 because of options like Arts, Music, Latin etc.). It is also very rare to see scores lower than 5.\n\n[[Grade inflation]] has become a concern. Between 2005 and 2016, the proportion of students who received an honour in the general baccalaureate doubled.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.euronews.com/2017/07/05/what-is-the-bac\n | title =What is the bac?\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =5 July 2017\n | website =Euronews\n | publisher =\n | access-date =12 July 2017\n | quote = }}</ref>\n\n===European section===\nA European section is an option in [[France|French]] [[high school]]s to teach a subject through a [[European language]] other than French. It also gives pupils the opportunity of having more hours in the language studied. It is also an opportunity to learn more about the culture of the country of which the language is being spoken. For example, learning History in Spanish the history of Spain and that of Central and South America would be emphasized. Teachers present their lessons in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nAt the end, students can receive a \"European section\" mention on their [[baccalaureat]]. To have that mention, they need to get at least 12/20 on their language examination and at least 10/20 at an additional oral examination on the subject in the language.\n\nFor example, those who choose History in Spanish as an additional subject would take their Spanish examination like the rest of their classmates, who do not have History in Spanish, and get at least 12/20. They then have to pass an oral examination on history in Spanish and get at least 10/20.\n\n===Supplemental examination===\nA student who averages between 8 and 10 is permitted to sit for the ''\u00e9preuve de rattrapage'' (also called the ''second groupe''), a supplemental oral examination is given in two subjects of the student's choice. A student who does well enough in those examinations to raise the overall weighted grade to a 10 gets the ''baccalaur\u00e9at''. A student who does poorly in the orals and receives below a 10 may choose to repeat the final year of lyc\u00e9e (''terminale'').\n\nStudents may not redo the entire examination in September; the September examinations may be taken only by those who have not been able to take the June examinations for serious reasons (such as illness).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|Education}}\n* [[Academic grading in France]]\n* [[Education in France]]\n* [[Baccalaur\u00e9at technologique]]\n* [[International Baccalaureate]]\n* [[European Baccalaureate]]\n\n==Note==\n# The formula was taken from the [http://www.claudel.org Lyc\u00e9e Claudel website], a French lyc\u00e9e in Ottawa, Canada and might only be accurate for Canadian\u2014and even Ontarian\u2014percentage grades.  In Ontario, an 80% grade is an \"A\" on the American Scale and the student is awarded an Ontario Scholar Diploma.  A 90% grade is an A+ on the American Scale is considered a grade with honours and automatically qualifies the student for government-funded scholarships and bursaries.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hardal]] (\u200e \u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 \u1e24aredi Le'umi, lit.\u2009\"Nationalist [[Haredi]]\") are a sub-community; stricter in observance, and more \"statist\" in their politics.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]].

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hardal]] (\u200e \u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 \u1e24aredi Le'umi, lit.\u2009\"Nationalist [[Haredi]]\") are a sub-community; stricter in observance, and more \"statist\" in their politics.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination.

The version of the legend in which Diocletian appears as persecutor is not primitive. Diocletian is only a rationalized form of the name Dadianus. Moreover, the connection of the saint's name with Nicomedia is inconsistent with the early cultus at Diospolis.

[[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] attributed the victory of the Portuguese in the [[battle of Aljubarrota]] in 1385 to Saint George. During the reign of [[John I of Portugal]] (1357\u20131433), Saint George became the patron saint of Portugal and the King ordered that the saint's image on the horse be carried in the ''[[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]'' procession. The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on 23 April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art - \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" - probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]]. Particularly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and Saint George's association with the [[crusades]], he is often portrayed mounted upon a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]]. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's death) depicts an armoured Saint George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |title=Vatican stamps |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |access-date=23 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001194032/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |archive-date=1 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEastern Orthodox iconography also permits Saint George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/russian_icons/catalogue_of_russian_icons/the_british_museum_collection/british_museum_collection_2.aspx Bobrov, Yury. \"A catalogue of the Russian icons in the British Museum\", The British Museum]</ref>\nIn the south Lebanese village of [[Mieh Mieh]], the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire), the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of Saint George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noursat.tv/ar/news-details.php?id=2996|title=\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629|website=Noursat|access-date=11 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nSaint George may also be portrayed with [[Saint Demetrius]], another early [[soldier saint]]. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized). \nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{For|equestrian depictions|Saint George and the Dragon#Iconography}}\n{{commons|Saint George structured art gallery}}\n\n===Eastern===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tetarteron sb1975.jpg|[[Tetarteron]] of [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (12th century) showing a bust of Saint George\nFile:Novgorod George.jpg|[[Saint George (icon, 1130)|Novgorod icon]] (1130)\nFile:Georgeladoga.jpg|A 12th-century depiction of St&nbsp;George in a church at the Russian village of [[Staraya Ladoga]]\nFile:LifeofStGeorge.JPG|Scenes from the life of Saint George, [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]], Bulgaria (15th century)\nFile:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|A 15th-century battle flag of [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] representing Saint George\nFile:St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter.JPG|A plaque, on which is represented St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter (15th century)\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De slag bij Adua TMnr 5956-2.jpg|\"[[Ethiopian Empire]] forces, assisted by St George (top), win the [[Battle of Adwa]] against [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

Moreover, the connection of the saint's name with Nicomedia is inconsistent with the early cultus at Diospolis.

In [[Pope Pius XII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955 calendar]] this rank was reduced to \"Simple\", and in [[Pope John XXIII]]'s [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|1960 calendar]] to a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|\"Commemoration\"]].

His [[calendar of saints|major feast day]] is on 23 April (Julian calendar 23 April currently corresponds to Gregorian calendar 6 May). If, however, the feast occurs before [[Easter]], it is celebrated on [[Easter Monday]], instead. The Russian Orthodox Church also celebrates two additional feasts in honour of St. George. One is on 3 November, commemorating the [[consecration]] of a [[cathedral]] dedicated to him in Lydda during the reign of [[Constantine the Great]] (305\u201337). When the church was consecrated, the [[relic]]s of the Saint George were transferred there.

The flag of Saint George (white with red cross) was also carried by the Portuguese troops and hoisted in the fortresses, during the 15th century. \"Portugal and Saint George\" became the battle cry of the Portuguese troops, being still today the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Army]], with simply \"Saint George\" being the battle cry of the [[Portuguese Navy]].<ref>{{citation | title = Daily Life in Portugal in the Late Middle Ages | first1 = AH | last1 = de Oliveira Marques | first2 = V\u00edtor | last2 = Andr\u00e9 | first3 = SS | last3 = Wyatt | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1971 | isbn = 0-299-05584-1 | page = 216}}.</ref>\n\nSaint George, is also the patron saint of the region of [[Aragon]], in [[Spain]], where his feast day is celebrated on 23 April and is known as \"Aragon Day\", ''or 'D\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n''' in Spanish.  He became the patron saint of the former [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Crown of Aragon]] when King [[Pedro I of Aragon]] won the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096.  Legend has it that victory eventually fell to the Christian armies when St. George appeared to them on the battlefield, helping them secure the reconquest of the city of [[Huesca]] which had been under the Muslim control of the [[Taifa]] of [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]]. The battle, which had begun two years earlier in 1094, was long and arduous, and had also taken the life of King Pedro's own father, King [[Sancho Ramirez]].  With the Aragonese spirits flagging, it is said that Saint George  descending from heaven on his charger and bearing a dark red cross, appeared at the head of the Christian cavalry leading the knights into battle.  Interpreting this as a sign of protection from God, the Christian militia returned emboldened to the battle field, more energized than ever, convinced theirs was the banner of the one true faith. Defeated, the [[moors]] rapidly abandoned the battlefield. After two years of being locked down under siege, Huesca was liberated and King Pedro made his triumphal entry into the city. To celebrate this victory, the cross of Saint George was adopted as the coat of arms of Huesca and Aragon, in honour of their saviour.  After the taking of Huesca, King Pedro aided the military leader and nobleman, Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar, otherwise known as [[El Cid]], with a coalition army from Aragon in the long reconquest of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].\n\nTales of King Pedro's success at Huesca and in leading his expedition of armies with El Cid against the Moors, under the auspices of Saint George on his standard, spread quickly throughout the realm and beyond the Crown of Aragon, and Christian armies throughout Europe quickly began adopting Saint George as their protector and patron, during all subsequent Crusades to the Holy Lands.  By 1117, the military order of Templars adopted the Cross of Saint George as a simple unifying sign for international Christian militia embroidered on the left hand side of their tunics, placed above the heart.\n\nThe Cross of Saint George, also known in Aragon as The Cross of Alcoraz, continues to emblazon the flags of all of Aragon's provinces.\n\nThe association of Saint George with chivalry and noblemen in Aragon continued through the ages.  Indeed, even the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], in his book on the Adventures of [[Don Quixote]], also mentions the [[Jousting]] events that took place at the festival of Saint George in [[Saragossa|Zaragoza]] in Aragon where one could gain international renown in winning a joust against any of the knights of Aragon.\n\nIn Valencia, Catalonia, the Balearics, Malta, Sicily and Sardinia, the origins of the veneration of Saint George go back to their shared history as territories under the [[Crown of Aragon]], thereby sharing the same legend.\n\nOne of the highest civil distinctions awarded in Catalonia is the [[Creu de Sant Jordi Award|Saint George's Cross]] (''Creu de Sant Jordi''). The [[Sant Jordi Awards]] have been awarded in Barcelona since 1957.\n\nSaint George (''Sant Jordi'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) is also the patron saint of [[Catalonia]]. His cross appears in many buildings and local flags, including the [[flag of Barcelona]], the Catalan capital.  A Catalan variation to the traditional legend places Saint George's life story as having occurred in the town of [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]], near [[Tarragona]].\n\n==Arms and flag==\n{{Main|Saint George's Cross}}\n[[File:Flag of England.svg|thumb|upright|Saint George's cross]]\n\nIt became fashionable in the 15th century, with the full development of classical heraldry, to provide [[attributed arms]] to saints and other historical characters from the pre-heraldic ages. The widespread attribution to Saint George of the red cross on a white field in western art - \"[[Saint George's Cross]]\" - probably first arose in [[Genoa]], which had adopted this image for [[Genoa#Flag|their flag]] and George as their patron saint in the 12th century. A ''vexillum beati Georgii'' is mentioned  in the Genovese annals for the year 1198, referring to a red flag with a depiction of Saint George and the dragon.  An illumination of this flag is shown in the annals for the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this \"George's flag\", from at least 1218, and was known as the '' insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' (\"cross ensign of the commune of Genoa\"). The flag showing the saint himself was the city's principal war flag, but the flag showing the plain cross was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, \"Genova\", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, \"Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani\", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World]]''.</ref>\n\nIn 1348 [[Edward III of England]] chose Saint George as the patron saint of his [[Order of the Garter]], and also took to using a red-on-white cross in the hoist of his [[Royal Standards of England|Royal Standard]].\n\nThe term \"Saint George's cross\" was at first associated with any plain [[Christian cross variants#Greek cross|Greek cross]] touching the edges of the field (not necessarily red on white).<ref>William Woo Seymour, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'', 1898, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/362/mode/2up/search/George p. 363]</ref> [[Thomas Fuller]] in 1647 spoke of \"the plain or St George's cross\" as \"the mother of all the others\" (that is, the other [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldic crosses]]).<ref>Fuller, ''A Supplement tu the Historie of the Holy Warre'' (Book V), 1647, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n==Iconography and models==\n[[File:Icon8.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Byzantine]] icon of Saint George, [[Athens]], Greece.]]\n\nSaint George is most commonly depicted in early icons, [[mosaic]]s, and [[fresco]]s wearing armour contemporary with the depiction, executed in gilding and silver colour, intended to identify him as a [[Roman army|Roman soldier]]. Particularly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and Saint George's association with the [[crusades]], he is often portrayed mounted upon a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]]. Thus, a 2003 Vatican stamp (issued on the anniversary of the Saint's death) depicts an armoured Saint George atop a white horse, killing the dragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |title=Vatican stamps |publisher=Vaticanstate.va |date= |access-date=23 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001194032/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/Services/Philatelic_and_Numismatic_Office/_listing_emissioni--id--Shop%20Francobolli--cat--2003.htm |archive-date=1 October 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEastern Orthodox iconography also permits Saint George to ride a black horse, as in a Russian icon in the British museum collection.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/russian_icons/catalogue_of_russian_icons/the_british_museum_collection/british_museum_collection_2.aspx Bobrov, Yury. \"A catalogue of the Russian icons in the British Museum\", The British Museum]</ref>\nIn the south Lebanese village of [[Mieh Mieh]], the Saint George Church for Melkite Catholics commissioned for its 75th jubilee in 2012 (under the guidance of Mgr Sassine Gregoire), the only icons in the world portraying the whole life of Saint George, as well as the scenes of his torture and martyrdom (drawn in eastern iconographic style).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noursat.tv/ar/news-details.php?id=2996|title=\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629 \u0645\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0648\u0631\u062c\u064a\u0648\u0633 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u064a\u0629|website=Noursat|access-date=11 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nSaint George may also be portrayed with [[Saint Demetrius]], another early [[soldier saint]]. When the two saintly warriors are together and mounted upon horses, they may resemble earthly manifestations of the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]]. Eastern traditions distinguish the two as Saint George rides a white horse and St. Demetrius a red horse (the red [[pigment]] may appear black if it has bituminized). \nSaint George can also be identified by his spearing a dragon, whereas Saint Demetrius may be spearing a human figure, representing [[Maximian]].\n\nDuring the early second millennium, Saint George became a model of [[chivalry]] in works of literature, including [[medieval romance]]s. In the 13th century, [[Jacobus de Voragine]], Archbishop of Genoa, compiled the ''Legenda Sanctorum'', (''Readings of the Saints'') also known as ''Legenda Aurea'' (the ''Golden Legend''). Its 177 chapters (182 in some editions) include the story of Saint George, among many others. After the invention of the printing press, the book became a bestseller.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{For|equestrian depictions|Saint George and the Dragon#Iconography}}\n{{commons|Saint George structured art gallery}}\n\n===Eastern===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tetarteron sb1975.jpg|[[Tetarteron]] of [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (12th century) showing a bust of Saint George\nFile:Novgorod George.jpg|[[Saint George (icon, 1130)|Novgorod icon]] (1130)\nFile:Georgeladoga.jpg|A 12th-century depiction of St&nbsp;George in a church at the Russian village of [[Staraya Ladoga]]\nFile:LifeofStGeorge.JPG|Scenes from the life of Saint George, [[Kremikovtsi Monastery]], Bulgaria (15th century)\nFile:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|A 15th-century battle flag of [[Stephen the Great]] of [[Moldavia]] representing Saint George\nFile:St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter.JPG|A plaque, on which is represented St.George rescuing the emperor's daughter (15th century)\nFile:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De slag bij Adua TMnr 5956-2.jpg|\"[[Ethiopian Empire]] forces, assisted by St George (top), win the [[Battle of Adwa]] against [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

Some Pakistani artists began experimenting with [[rap]] and [[hip hop]] as early as 1993 when [[Fakhar-e-Alam]] released his first album ''Rap Up'', where his single ''Bhangra Pao'' is commonly acknowledged as the \"first rap song in Pakistan\". In particular, the rise in popularity of [[Eminem]] in the late 1990s and [[50 Cent]] in the early 2000s influenced many of today's hip hop artists in Pakistan such as \"Party Wrecker\" (Mustafa Khan) of the Pashto rap group Fortitude, Qzer (Qasim Naqvi) and DirtJaw.<ref name=Muftah>https://muftah.org/pakistani-hip-hop/ {{unreliable?|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first Pakistani rap song was \"Bhangra Rap\" (1993) by Yatagaan ([[Fakhar-e-Alam]]), which became a major headliner on Pakistani music charts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horn |first1=David |last2=Laing |first2=Dave |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 2 Locations (5 Vol Set): Volumes III to VII |date=2005 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9780826474360 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShUKAQAAMAAJ |quote=The styles associated with rap, hip-hop and house all make their appearance in Pakistani popular music. Among the early leaders in this type of music were the Lahore duo Yatagaan. Their first video, 'Bhangara Rap' (1993), indicates the complex overlapping of musical styles and style labels in much popular music. The song became a major headliner on Pakistani music charts.}}</ref> The hit 1995 song \"[[Billo De Ghar]]\" by [[Abrar-ul-Haq]] also featured rapping.\n\nHip hop and rap culture in Pakistan during the 1990s and early 2000s was mainly centered around those with a good grasp of [[English language|English]] (a socioeconomically privileged group). Pakistani hip hop and rap artists at this time were mainly underground English acts and were dismissed by the media and mainstream as \"''Eminem ki aolad''\" (Eminem's children) and \"''yo-bache''\" (yo-kids).\n\n==Genre development==\nPakistani hip hop music is still an emerging genre. Since the early 90s, hip hop music has trended slowly from underground English scenes to regional Punjabi rap in the early 2000s, before branching out into various other languages.\n\nBy the late 2000s, Punjabi rap began influencing non-Punjabi speakers to experiment with hip hop in other [[Language of Pakistan|Pakistani languages]], thus leading to new Sindhi and Pashto hip hop scenes. Urdu rap artists tried initially but failed to make a mark on the Pakistan hip hop scene. This was due to class and linguistic politics dictated in the mid-nineteenth century by the [[British Raj]], who had replaced [[Persian language|Persian]] with [[Urdu]] as the official language. Combined with Pakistan's own tendency to privilege Urdu over indigenous languages a dichotomy was created in the country whereby Urdu is associated with urbanity, power, privilege and sophistication, while other Pakistani languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi and Pashto were considered \"crass vernacularism\". Although the genre has grown considerably in recent years, it is still considered fringe and underground by the older generation who tend to stick to traditional Pakistani music or [[Pakistani pop music]].\n\n===Languages===\n====Punjabi rap====\nIn February 2006, [[Universal Music]] produced the first commercially backed album of [[Pakistani American]] rapper, [[Bohemia]]. A [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Christians|Christian]], born in [[Karachi]], schooled in [[Peshawar]], and brought up in the working class minority communities of [[San Francisco]], Bohemia's music emerged from personal experiences, such as seeing his best friend murdered and several others sent to jail. ''[[Pesa Nasha Pyar]]'' (Punjabi for \"Money Drugs Love\") was Bohemia's second album and stood out as lyrically groundbreaking. With Universal's distribution network, Bohemia found a ready market among Pakistanis, both in the [[Overseas Pakistanis|diaspora]] and in Pakistan itself.\n\n====Pashto Rap====\nIn 2011, A rap group from [[Peshawar]], released a track named ''[[Pukhtoon Core]]'' by Fortitude, Which instantly became popular amongst [[Pakistanis]]. This was the first time anyone made a rap in [[Pashto]], language. Soon the band started making hits like ''No Borders'', ''Lewani'', ''Outrageous'', Alongside Rap Demon and in 2019 they finally dropped ''[[Era of Pushto]]'' which was a comeback music and it made waves across [[Tiktok]], Recently [[Fortitude Pukhtoon Core]], Released the official Anthem of [[Peshawar Zalmi]], for [[HBL PSL]], and it made an instant 2 Million views in a week. They are the most famous mainstream Pashto Rap group from [[Pakistan]].\n\n====Sindhi rap====\nThe Sindhi hip hop scene draws on a history of linguistic nationalism of Sindhis. Many Sindhi rap artists are attempting to resurrect and mainstream Sindhi culture in Pakistan using hip hop. Many Sindhi rap artists are also continuing the long Sindhi tradition of Sufi poetry, by including them into rhymes. [[Ali Gul Pir]]'s ''[[Waderai Ka Beta]]'', Meer Janweri \"''Piyar Jo Siphai''\" and are recent Sindhi rap songs that have gone mainstream and shows signs of the genre expanding beyond Punjabi.\n\n====Balochi rap====\nLyari Underground (L.U.G.) & breakout artists like Sami Amiri, Anas Baloch & Eva B are promoting the Lyari/Balochi culture through hip-hop.<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/1298067/baloch-rapper-anas-baloch-aims-conquer-coke-studio/</ref>\n\n====Urdu rap====\nDespite early unsuccessful acts, the Urdu rap scene genre is arguably the fastest growing in the country. Majority of the Urdu rappers are heavily influenced by Bohemia, a famous Punjabi Rapper. Urdu Rap came into limelight after amazing efforts put in by '''Farish Shafi''' when he released one of his controversial song Awaam back in 2012, the song targeted the system of governance, it was a hit. His other songs include Muskura, Jawab de, Waasta and several others. \n\nAfter that, '''Young Stunners''', an underground band consisting of two independent Urdu rappers '''Talha Anjum''' and '''Talha Yunus''', released their first popular song Burger-e-Karachi which was a classical satirical humor directed towards the burger boys. The song became instantly viral. After that, they threw back to back hits among which are Maila Majnu and Laam se Chaura. Since then, the band has seen their ups and downs but they have remained true to the game. They have a list of hit songs to their name. They are currently leading the Malir Rap Boys and have successfully collaborated with different artists like Irfan Junejo and big brands like Furor, Q-mobile and Pepsi. They are considered the pioneers of the urdu rap, a title they earned through a long hustle. They have fought their individual battles with drug issues, family issues and studies which they are very vocal about and often criticized for by some local artists like '''Chen-K''' and Sunny. Nevertheless, their hustle makes them an inspiration for the upcoming young artists who view them as their Guru. They recently collaborated with a cross border artist KR$NA, the song was named Quarantine and it was a super hit. \n\nThen there is the Pindi rap scene consisting of all rounder and someone whose help put hip-hop on the map in Pakistan, [[Osama Com Laude]] (one of the most viral, veteran & mainstream hip-hop artists in all of Pakistan with over 17 million views to his name alone, multiple shows globally, collaborating with international sensations like [[Edward Maya]], [[Ali Zafar]], [[Major Lazer]], [[Valentino Khan]] and rumored to have future acting projects lined up as well), Fadi, [[Hashim Nawaz]], Hamzee, Zeeru, [[Khawar Malik]] (categorized as more Pop and R&B) and Shuja Shah.

Some Pakistani artists began experimenting with [[rap]] and [[hip hop]] as early as 1993 when [[Fakhar-e-Alam]] released his first album ''Rap Up'', where his single ''Bhangra Pao'' is commonly acknowledged as the \"first rap song in Pakistan\". In particular, the rise in popularity of [[Eminem]] in the late 1990s and [[50 Cent]] in the early 2000s influenced many of today's hip hop artists in Pakistan such as \"Party Wrecker\" (Mustafa Khan) of the Pashto rap group Fortitude, Qzer (Qasim Naqvi) and DirtJaw.<ref name=Muftah>https://muftah.org/pakistani-hip-hop/ {{unreliable?|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first Pakistani rap song was \"Bhangra Rap\" (1993) by Yatagaan ([[Fakhar-e-Alam]]), which became a major headliner on Pakistani music charts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horn |first1=David |last2=Laing |first2=Dave |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 2 Locations (5 Vol Set): Volumes III to VII |date=2005 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9780826474360 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShUKAQAAMAAJ |quote=The styles associated with rap, hip-hop and house all make their appearance in Pakistani popular music. Among the early leaders in this type of music were the Lahore duo Yatagaan. Their first video, 'Bhangara Rap' (1993), indicates the complex overlapping of musical styles and style labels in much popular music. The song became a major headliner on Pakistani music charts.}}</ref> The hit 1995 song \"[[Billo De Ghar]]\" by [[Abrar-ul-Haq]] also featured rapping.\n\nHip hop and rap culture in Pakistan during the 1990s and early 2000s was mainly centered around those with a good grasp of [[English language|English]] (a socioeconomically privileged group). Pakistani hip hop and rap artists at this time were mainly underground English acts and were dismissed by the media and mainstream as \"''Eminem ki aolad''\" (Eminem's children) and \"''yo-bache''\" (yo-kids).\n\n==Genre development==\nPakistani hip hop music is still an emerging genre. Since the early 90s, hip hop music has trended slowly from underground English scenes to regional Punjabi rap in the early 2000s, before branching out into various other languages.\n\nBy the late 2000s, Punjabi rap began influencing non-Punjabi speakers to experiment with hip hop in other [[Language of Pakistan|Pakistani languages]], thus leading to new Sindhi and Pashto hip hop scenes. Urdu rap artists tried initially but failed to make a mark on the Pakistan hip hop scene. This was due to class and linguistic politics dictated in the mid-nineteenth century by the [[British Raj]], who had replaced [[Persian language|Persian]] with [[Urdu]] as the official language. Combined with Pakistan's own tendency to privilege Urdu over indigenous languages a dichotomy was created in the country whereby Urdu is associated with urbanity, power, privilege and sophistication, while other Pakistani languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi and Pashto were considered \"crass vernacularism\". Although the genre has grown considerably in recent years, it is still considered fringe and underground by the older generation who tend to stick to traditional Pakistani music or [[Pakistani pop music]].\n\n===Languages===\n====Punjabi rap====\nIn February 2006, [[Universal Music]] produced the first commercially backed album of [[Pakistani American]] rapper, [[Bohemia]]. A [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Christians|Christian]], born in [[Karachi]], schooled in [[Peshawar]], and brought up in the working class minority communities of [[San Francisco]], Bohemia's music emerged from personal experiences, such as seeing his best friend murdered and several others sent to jail. ''[[Pesa Nasha Pyar]]'' (Punjabi for \"Money Drugs Love\") was Bohemia's second album and stood out as lyrically groundbreaking. With Universal's distribution network, Bohemia found a ready market among Pakistanis, both in the [[Overseas Pakistanis|diaspora]] and in Pakistan itself.\n\n====Pashto Rap====\nIn 2011, A rap group from [[Peshawar]], released a track named ''[[Pukhtoon Core]]'' by Fortitude, Which instantly became popular amongst [[Pakistanis]]. This was the first time anyone made a rap in [[Pashto]], language. Soon the band started making hits like ''No Borders'', ''Lewani'', ''Outrageous'', Alongside Rap Demon and in 2019 they finally dropped ''[[Era of Pushto]]'' which was a comeback music and it made waves across [[Tiktok]], Recently [[Fortitude Pukhtoon Core]], Released the official Anthem of [[Peshawar Zalmi]], for [[HBL PSL]], and it made an instant 2 Million views in a week. They are the most famous mainstream Pashto Rap group from [[Pakistan]].\n\n====Sindhi rap====\nThe Sindhi hip hop scene draws on a history of linguistic nationalism of Sindhis. Many Sindhi rap artists are attempting to resurrect and mainstream Sindhi culture in Pakistan using hip hop. Many Sindhi rap artists are also continuing the long Sindhi tradition of Sufi poetry, by including them into rhymes. [[Ali Gul Pir]]'s ''[[Waderai Ka Beta]]'', Meer Janweri \"''Piyar Jo Siphai''\" and are recent Sindhi rap songs that have gone mainstream and shows signs of the genre expanding beyond Punjabi.\n\n====Balochi rap====\nLyari Underground (L.U.G.) & breakout artists like Sami Amiri, Anas Baloch & Eva B are promoting the Lyari/Balochi culture through hip-hop.<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/1298067/baloch-rapper-anas-baloch-aims-conquer-coke-studio/</ref>\n\n====Urdu rap====\nDespite early unsuccessful acts, the Urdu rap scene genre is arguably the fastest growing in the country. Majority of the Urdu rappers are heavily influenced by Bohemia, a famous Punjabi Rapper. Urdu Rap came into limelight after amazing efforts put in by '''Farish Shafi''' when he released one of his controversial song Awaam back in 2012, the song targeted the system of governance, it was a hit. His other songs include Muskura, Jawab de, Waasta and several others. \n\nAfter that, '''Young Stunners''', an underground band consisting of two independent Urdu rappers '''Talha Anjum''' and '''Talha Yunus''', released their first popular song Burger-e-Karachi which was a classical satirical humor directed towards the burger boys. The song became instantly viral. After that, they threw back to back hits among which are Maila Majnu and Laam se Chaura. Since then, the band has seen their ups and downs but they have remained true to the game. They have a list of hit songs to their name. They are currently leading the Malir Rap Boys and have successfully collaborated with different artists like Irfan Junejo and big brands like Furor, Q-mobile and Pepsi. They are considered the pioneers of the urdu rap, a title they earned through a long hustle. They have fought their individual battles with drug issues, family issues and studies which they are very vocal about and often criticized for by some local artists like '''Chen-K''' and Sunny. Nevertheless, their hustle makes them an inspiration for the upcoming young artists who view them as their Guru. They recently collaborated with a cross border artist KR$NA, the song was named Quarantine and it was a super hit. \n\nThen there is the Pindi rap scene consisting of all rounder and someone whose help put hip-hop on the map in Pakistan, [[Osama Com Laude]] (one of the most viral, veteran & mainstream hip-hop artists in all of Pakistan with over 17 million views to his name alone, multiple shows globally, collaborating with international sensations like [[Edward Maya]], [[Ali Zafar]], [[Major Lazer]], [[Valentino Khan]] and rumored to have future acting projects lined up as well), Fadi, [[Hashim Nawaz]], Hamzee, Zeeru, [[Khawar Malik]] (categorized as more Pop and R&B) and Shuja Shah. Their recent collaboration ''Pindi Aye'' became a super hit across the world.\n\nOther notable rappers include Chinese-Pakistani entertainer Chen-K, Rap Demon ''of Young Stunners'', Savage, Sunny Khan Durrani, Jani, Munab A. Manay and others. \n\nPakistani Urdu hip-hop is evolving and fans are seeing several salty beefs. This industry has a great potential and it is bound to prove itself in the  upcoming years.\n\n====Saraiki rap====\nStill very young, Saraiki hip hop scene is limited due to the fact the language is a dialect of western Punjabi lahnda but can be easily distinguished due to the poetic nature of language\n\n==Artists==\n{{main|List of Pakistani hip hop musicians}}\n\n===Urdu rappers===\nYoung Stunners\n\nFaris Shafi\n\nRap Demon\n\nChen K\n\nMunab A May\n\n===Punjabi rappers===\n* [[Young Desi]]\n* [[Frenzo Harami]]\n\n===Bilingual rappers===\n* [[Lazarus (rapper)|Lazarus]](English & Urdu) \n* [[Osama Com Laude]] (Urdu & English)\n* [[Adil Omar]] (English & Urdu)\n* [[Mustafa Kamal]] (Pashto & Urdu)\n* [[Rap Demon]] (Urdu & Punjabi)\n* [[Fortitude Pukhtoon Core]] (Pashto Rap & English Rap)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Music of Pakistan]]\n* [[List of Pakistani Hip Hop Musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{hiphop}}\n\n[[Category:Pakistani music|Hip hop]]\n[[Category:Pakistani hip hop]]\n", "name_user": "103.86.39.253", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eUrdu rappers)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_hip_hop_music"}

Some Christian churches built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] eras are decorated with swastikas, carrying over earlier Roman designs. Swastikas are prominently displayed in a [[mosaic]] in the St. Sophia church of [[Kiev]], Ukraine dating from the 12th century. They also appear as a repeating ornamental motif on a tomb in the Basilica of St. Ambrose in [[Milan]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n8YNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA541&dq=Basilica+of+St.+Ambrose+in+Milan+swastika#v=onepage|title=The Open Court|last=Carus|first=Paul|date=1907|publisher=Open Court Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA ceiling painted in 1910 in the church of St Laurent in [[Grenoble]] has many swastikas. It can be visited today because the church became the archaeological museum of the city. A proposed direct link between it and a swastika floor mosaic in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], which was built on top of a pagan site at [[Amiens]], France in the 13th century, is considered unlikely. The [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] worn by a priest in the 1445 [[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|painting of the Seven Sacraments]] by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] presents the swastika form simply as one way of depicting the cross.\n\nSwastikas also appear in art and architecture during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era. The fresco ''The School of Athens'' shows an ornament made out of swastikas, and the symbol can also be found on the facade of the ''Santa Maria della Salute'', a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of [[Venice]].\n\nIn the Polish First Republic the symbol of the swastika was also popular with the nobility. According to chronicles, the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] prince [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], who in the 9th century [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|attacked Constantinople]], nailed his shield (which had a large red swastika painted on it) to the city's gates.<ref name=\"distedu.ru\" /> Several noble houses, e.g. Boreyko, Borzym, and Radziechowski from Ruthenia, also had swastikas as their [[coat of arms]]. The family reached its greatness in the 14th and 15th centuries and its crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time.\nThe swastika was also a heraldic symbol, for example on the [[Boreyko coat of arms]], used by noblemen in Poland and Ukraine. In the 19th century the swastika was one of the Russian Empire's symbols, and was used on coinage as a backdrop to the [[Coat of arms of Russia#1721\u20131917: Russian Empire|Russian eagle]].<ref name=\"klk.pp.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://klk.pp.ru/2007/01/26/svastika_istoricheskie_korni.html |author=Vladimir Nikolaevich|title=The Swastika, the historical roots|publisher=Klk.pp.ru |language=Russian |date= |access-date=2 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"ruskolan.xpomo.com\" />\n\nA swastika can be seen on stonework at [[Valle Crucis Abbey]], near [[Llangollen]].{{clear left}}\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"230px\" heights=\"187px\">\nFile:Greca a svastica - palazzo Roncale - Rovigo.JPG|Because the outer lines point counterclockwise instead of the swastika's clockwise-pointing ends, this is referred to as a sauwastika.

Since its adoption by the [[Nazi Party]] of [[Adolf Hitler]], the swastika has been associated with Nazism, fascism, racism in its ([[white supremacy]]) form, the [[Axis powers]] in World War II, and [[the Holocaust]] in much of the West. The swastika remains a core symbol of neo-Nazi groups.\n\nThe Benedictine choir school at [[Lambach Abbey]], Upper Austria, which Hitler attended for several months as a boy, had a swastika chiseled into the monastery portal and also the wall above the spring grotto in the courtyard by 1868.

The Grand Cross with the swastika collar has been awarded 41 times to foreign heads of state. To avoid misunderstandings, the swastika decorations were replaced by fir crosses at the decision of president [[Urho Kekkonen]] in 1963 after it became known that the [[President of France]] [[Charles De Gaulle]] was uncomfortable with the swastika collar.\n\nAlso a design by Gallen-Kallela from 1918, the [[Order of the Cross of Liberty|Cross of Liberty]] has a swastika pattern in its arms.

The Federal Bureau of Termination logo appears as a white geometric design with a black outline, centered on vertical banners, in reference to the Third Reich banners. These banners were initially red, until the crew felt the allusion was too strong.

The boy's parents misinterpreted the symbol as the right-facing Nazi swastika and filed a complaint to the manufacturer. [[Nintendo of America]] announced that the cards would be discontinued, explaining that what was acceptable in one culture was not necessarily so in another; their action was welcomed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] who recognised that there was no intention to offend, but said that international commerce meant that, \"Isolating [the Swastika] in Asia would just create more problems.\"<ref name=\"Pok\u00e9mon cards\" />\n\nIn 2002, [[Christmas cracker]]s containing plastic toy red pandas sporting swastikas were pulled from shelves after complaints from consumers in Canada.

Some Christian churches built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] eras are decorated with swastikas, carrying over earlier Roman designs. Swastikas are prominently displayed in a [[mosaic]] in the St. Sophia church of [[Kiev]], Ukraine dating from the 12th century. They also appear as a repeating ornamental motif on a tomb in the Basilica of St. Ambrose in [[Milan]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n8YNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA541&dq=Basilica+of+St.+Ambrose+in+Milan+swastika#v=onepage|title=The Open Court|last=Carus|first=Paul|date=1907|publisher=Open Court Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA ceiling painted in 1910 in the church of St Laurent in [[Grenoble]] has many swastikas. It can be visited today because the church became the archaeological museum of the city. A proposed direct link between it and a swastika floor mosaic in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], which was built on top of a pagan site at [[Amiens]], France in the 13th century, is considered unlikely. The [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] worn by a priest in the 1445 [[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|painting of the Seven Sacraments]] by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] presents the swastika form simply as one way of depicting the cross.\n\nSwastikas also appear in art and architecture during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era. The fresco ''The School of Athens'' shows an ornament made out of swastikas, and the symbol can also be found on the facade of the ''Santa Maria della Salute'', a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of [[Venice]].\n\nIn the Polish First Republic the symbol of the swastika was also popular with the nobility. According to chronicles, the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] prince [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], who in the 9th century [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|attacked Constantinople]], nailed his shield (which had a large red swastika painted on it) to the city's gates.<ref name=\"distedu.ru\" /> Several noble houses, e.g. Boreyko, Borzym, and Radziechowski from Ruthenia, also had swastikas as their [[coat of arms]]. The family reached its greatness in the 14th and 15th centuries and its crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time.\nThe swastika was also a heraldic symbol, for example on the [[Boreyko coat of arms]], used by noblemen in Poland and Ukraine.

It is commonly found in Buddhist temples, religious artefacts, texts related to Buddhism and schools founded by Buddhist religious groups. It also appears as a design or motif (singularly or woven into a pattern) on textiles, architecture and various decorative objects as a symbol of luck and good fortune.

The [[Red Swastika Society]], which is the philanthropic branch of Guiyidao, runs two schools in Hong Kong (the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tai Po Secondary School<ref>[Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tai Po Secondary School Official website http://www.hkrsstpss.edu.hk]</ref> and the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tuen Mun Primary School<ref>[Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tuen Mun Primary School website http://www.hkrsstmps.edu.hk]</ref>) and one in Singapore ([[Red Swastika School]]). All of them show the swastika in their logos.\n\nAmong the predominantly Hindu population of [[Bali]], in [[Indonesia]], the swastika is common in temples, homes and public spaces. Similarly, the swastika is a common icon associated with Buddha's footprints in Theravada Buddhist communities of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.<ref name=lee86 />\n\nIn Japan, the swastika is also used as a [[List of Japanese map symbols|map symbol]] and is designated by the Survey Act and related Japanese governmental rules to denote a [[Buddhist temple]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/MAPSAKUSEI/25000SAKUSEI/zushiki-zushiki.html#tatemono |script-title=ja:\u5e73\u6210\uff11\uff14\u5e74\uff12\u4e07\uff15\u5343\u5206\uff11\u5730\u5f62\u56f3\u56f3\u5f0f |author= |date= |year= |website= |publisher=Geospatial Information Authority of Japan |language=Japanese |trans-title=2002 1:25000 Topographical Map Scheme |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Hirosaki]] in [[Aomori Prefecture]] designates this symbol as its official flag, which stemmed from its use in the emblem of the [[Tsugaru clan]], the lords of [[Hirosaki Domain]] during the [[Edo period]].\n\n==== Indian subcontinent ====\n[[File:Seal of Bihar.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Seal of Bihar]]]]\nIn Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the swastika is common.

This has resulted in several such products having been boycotted or pulled from shelves.{{cn|date=April 2020}}{{or|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhen a ten-year-old boy in [[Lynbrook, New York]], bought a set of [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game|Pok\u00e9mon cards]] imported from Japan in 1999, two of the cards contained the left-facing Buddhist swastika. The boy's parents misinterpreted the symbol as the right-facing Nazi swastika and filed a complaint to the manufacturer. [[Nintendo of America]] announced that the cards would be discontinued, explaining that what was acceptable in one culture was not necessarily so in another; their action was welcomed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] who recognised that there was no intention to offend, but said that international commerce meant that, \"Isolating [the Swastika] in Asia would just create more problems.\"<ref name=\"Pok\u00e9mon cards\" />\n\nIn 2002, [[Christmas cracker]]s containing plastic toy red pandas sporting swastikas were pulled from shelves after complaints from consumers in Canada.

Its usage is taken from traditional Chinese symbolism, and it alludes to [[Dan Tian]], a [[chakra]]-like portion of esoteric human anatomy, which is located in the stomach.\n* The swastika is a holy symbol in [[Germanic Heathenry]], along with the [[Mj\u00f6lnir|hammer of Thor]] and [[runes]]. This tradition \u2013 which is found in [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], and elsewhere \u2013 considers the swastika to be derived from a Norse symbol for the sun.

Many critics described his music as [[operatic]], nicknaming him \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\" and \"the Big O\". While most male [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability. He performed standing still, wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.\n\nOrbison began singing in a [[rockabilly]] and [[Country music|country-and-western]] band in high school. He was signed by [[Sam Phillips]], of [[Sun Records]], in 1956, but his greatest success came with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" (1960), \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\" (1961), \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" (1961), \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (1963), and \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" (1964). Soon afterward, he was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined.\n\nIn the 1980s, Orbison experienced a resurgence in popularity following the success of several [[cover version]]s of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the [[Traveling Wilburys]], a rock [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]], with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at the age of 52. One month later, Orbison's song \"[[You Got It]]\" (1989), co-written with Lynne and Petty, was released as a solo single and became his first hit to reach the U.S. Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in the same year, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time'. In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936, in [[Vernon, Texas]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carr|first=Joe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&pg=RA10-PP22|title=Prairie Nights to Neon Lights: The Story of Country Music in West Texas|last2=Munde|first2=Alan|date=October 1996|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=978-0-89672-365-8|pages=134|language=en}}</ref> the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913\u20131984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 \u2013 May 12, 1992),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Nadine-Orbison/6000000012909498491 |title=Nadine Vesta Orbison |website=geni}}</ref> a nurse.

He considered his voice memorable, but not great.<ref name=\"escott\"/>\n\nOn Roy's sixth birthday, his father gave him a guitar. He later recalled that by the age of seven, \"I was finished, you know, for anything else\"; music would be his life.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 7.</ref> His major musical influence as a youth was country music. He was particularly moved by [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s singing, with its slurred syllables.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 21.</ref> (When he later joined the British-American supergroup the [[Traveling Wilburys]], he adopted the name \u201cLefty\u201d Wilbury). He also enjoyed [[Hank Williams]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. One of the first musicians he heard in person was [[Ernest Tubb]], playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. In West Texas, he was exposed to many forms of music: \"sepia\" (a euphemism for [[rhythm and blues]]), [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and [[cajun]]. The cajun favorite \"[[Jole Blon]]\" was one of the first songs he sang in public. At the age of eight, he began singing on a local radio show. By the late 1940s, he was the show's host.<ref>Amburn, pp. 8, 9.</ref>\n\nIn high school, Orbison and some friends formed a band, the Wink Westerners. They played country standards and [[Glenn Miller]] songs at local honky-tonks and had a weekly radio show on [[KERB (AM)|KERB]] in [[Kermit, Texas|Kermit]].<ref name=\"royorb1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |title=History Maker |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401175007/http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |website=The Official Roy Orbison Site |access-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref> When they were offered $400 to play at a dance (about $3,800 in 2019 money), Orbison realized he could make a living in music. After graduating from [[Wink High School]], he enrolled at [[University of North Texas|North Texas State College]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], planning to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay.<ref>Amburn, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> When he heard that his schoolmate [[Pat Boone]] had signed a record deal, it further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician. While at North Texas State College, Roy heard a song called \"Ooby Dooby\", composed by [[Dick Penner]] and Wade Moore, and after his first year of college, he returned to Wink with \"Ooby Dooby\" in hand and continued performing with the Wink Westerners.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Orbison then enrolled in [[Odessa College|Odessa Junior College]]. As two members of the band quit, two new members were added,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and the group won a talent contest and obtained their own television show on KMID-TV in Midland, Texas.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} The Wink Westerners kept performing on local TV, played dances on the weekends, and attended college during the day.\n\nWhile living in Odessa, Orbison saw a performance by [[Elvis Presley]].{{efn|Orbison later said that he \"couldn't overemphasize how shocking [Presley] looked and seemed to [him] that night\".<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>}} [[Johnny Cash]] toured the area in 1955 and 1956,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Orbison did so and was told, \"Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!\"{{efn|Both Orbison and Cash mentioned this anecdote years later, but Phillips denied that he was so abrupt on the phone with Orbison or that he hung up on him. One of the Teen Kings later stated that the band did not meet Cash until they were on tour with him and other Sun Records artists.<ref>Amburn, pp. 42\u201343.</ref>}} The success of their KMID television show got them another show on KOSA-TV, and they changed their name to the Teen Kings.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Due to the rejection from Sam Phillips, the Teen Kings recorded \"Ooby Dooby\" in 1956 for the Odessa-based [[Je\u2013Wel]] label.<ref name=\"escott\"/>{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=245}}  After the local record store owner Poppa Holifield played it for him over the telephone, Sam Phillips offered the Teen Kings a contract.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}}\n\n==1956\u201359: Sun Records and Acuff-Rose==\n{{main|Roy Orbison's Sun Recordings}}\n[[File:Roy Orbison 1965 (2).png|thumb|Orbison with his original thick-rimmed glasses (photo dated 1965)]]\n\nThe Teen Kings went to [[Sun Studio]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], where Phillips wanted to record \"Ooby Dooby\" again, in his studio. The song was released on Sun 242 in May 1956{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and broke into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> The Teen Kings toured with [[Sonny James]], [[Johnny Horton]], Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing \"everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record\".<ref>Clayson, Alan p. 44.</ref> The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including \"[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go! Go! Go!]]\" and \"Rockhouse\". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there.{{efn|Alan Clayson's biography refers to her as Claudette Hestand.}} They stayed in Phillips' home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.<ref>Amburn, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A ballad Orbison wrote, \"The Clown\", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOrbison was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison wrote \"Claudette\"\u2014about Claudette Frady, whom he married in 1957\u2014and the [[Everly Brothers]] recorded it as the B-side of \"[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]\". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 56.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]], a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of [[Chet Atkins]], who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was \"Seems to Me\", by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then\u2014softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 62.</ref>\n\nPlaying shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together.<ref>Clayson, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Nashville]]. Only two singles were judged worthy of release by RCA.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\">Zak, p. 32.</ref> Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer [[Fred Foster]] at [[Monument Records]].\n\n== 1960\u201364: Monument Records ==\n===Early singles===\nOrbison was one of the first recording artists to popularize the \"[[Nashville sound]]\", with a group of session musicians known as the [[The Nashville A-Team|A-Team (see main entry)]] The Nashville sound was developed by producers Chet Atkins, [[Owen Bradley]] (who worked closely with [[Patsy Cline]]), Sam Phillips, and Fred Foster.<ref>Wolfe and Akenson, p. 24.</ref><ref>Hoffmann and Ferstler, p. 779.</ref> In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA had refused, \"Paper Boy\", backed by \"With the Bug\", but neither charted.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\">Zak, p. 33.</ref>\n\nAccording to musician and author Albin Zak, the studio (with sound engineer [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], who experimented with [[Microphone practice|close miking]] the [[doo-wop]] backing singers), the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a \"polished, professional sound&nbsp;... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\".<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\"/> Orbison requested a string section and with it, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \"Uptown\", written with Joe Melson.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\">Lehman, p. 48.</ref> Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/><ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' states that the music Orbison made in Nashville \"brought a new splendor to rock\", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=decurtis155>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 155.</ref>\n\n\"Uptown\" reached only number 72 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. His initial success came just as the '50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.<ref>Lehman, p. 19.</ref>\n\n===Top-10 hits===\n====1960\u201362====\n\nExperimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from \"Uptown\", and another song they had written called \"Come Back to Me (My Love)\", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\">Zak, p. 35.</ref> It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, \"came not from his throat but deeper within\".<ref>Clayson, p. 77.</ref> The song was \"[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]\". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, but were turned down.<ref>Amburn p. 91.</ref> They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\"/><ref name=Fremer>{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter \u2013 Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=July 14, 2011}}</ref> This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\"/>\n\n\"Only the Lonely\" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\"<ref name=\"rockhall\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard \"Only the Lonely\" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.<ref name=\"amburn98\">Amburn, p. 98.</ref> Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex \"Blue Angel\", which peaked at number nine in the US and number 11 in the UK. \"I'm Hurtin'\", with \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" as the B-side, rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Running Scared.ogg\n|title=\"Running Scared\" (1961)\n|description=The ending of \"Running Scared\" features Orbison's natural voice hitting high A natural.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and two sons Roy DeWayne and Anthony King.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of \"Only the Lonely\" and \"I'm Hurtin'\", Orbison worked on a new song, \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\", based loosely on the rhythm of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]''; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, whom he feared would try to take her away. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.<ref name=decurtis155/> On that third take, \"Running Scared\" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, \"He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> Just weeks later \"Running Scared\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected \"Running Scared\": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n\"Crying\" followed in July 1961 and reached number two; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, \"Candy Man\", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as \"The Big O\", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with \"[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]\", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. (Orbison's producer later formed [[the Candymen]] quintet, which was Orbison's backing band from 1965 to 1970 and released a few singles and two albums of its own). Also in 1962, he charted with \"The Crowd\", \"Leah\", and \"Workin' for the Man\", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref>Amburn, p. 32.</ref> His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 91.</ref>\n\n====1963\u201364====\n[[File:1965 Roy Orbison.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Orbison began performing while wearing sunglasses in 1963, later recalling that he \"wasn't trying to be weird ...

He had no publicist in the early 1960s, therefore he had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' called him an \"anonymous celebrity\".<ref>Lehman, p. 18.</ref> After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an aeroplane in 1963, while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe [[stage fright]]; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat.

His string of top-40 hits continued with \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (US number seven, UK number six), \"Falling\" (US number 22, UK number 9), and \"[[Mean Woman Blues]]\" (US number five, UK number three) coupled with \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" (US number 29, UK number three).{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\">Brown, Kutner, and Warwick, p. 645.</ref> According to the official Roy Orbison U.S. discography by Marcel Riesco,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=249}} a rare alternate version of \"Blue Bayou\" was released in Italy. Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by [[Willie Nelson]], \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).\n\nAs \"In Dreams\" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with the [[the Beatles|Beatles]]. When he arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, \"What's a Beatle, anyway?\" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, \"I am\".<ref>Amburn, p. 115.</ref> On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison sang through 14 encores.<ref name=\"clayson109-113\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 109\u2013113.</ref> Finally, when the audience began chanting \"We want Roy!\" again, Lennon and McCartney physically held Orbison back.<ref>Amburn, p. 117.</ref> Starr later said, \"In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting.

''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94</ref> Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.\n\nTouring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette had an affair with the contractor who built their home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963, she joined him.<ref>Amburn, pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately, he toured Australia and New Zealand with [[the Beach Boys]] and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.<ref>Amburn, p. 125.</ref> He travelled to Australia again, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]]. [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, \"a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.\"<ref name=\"amburn134\">Amburn, p. 134.</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Oh, Pretty Woman.ogg\n|title=\"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964)\n|description=The opening guitar riff of \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was a direct influence on \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" by the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]].<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 128 and Lehman, p. 169.</ref>\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote \"[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]\", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, \"A pretty woman never needs any money\".<ref>Amburn, p. 127.</ref> Just 40 minutes later, \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, \"In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964.

Orbison was a film enthusiast and, when not touring, writing or recording, dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nRose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Nashville's A-Team.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\"/> Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled ''There Is Only One Roy Orbison'', sold fewer than 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> With the onset of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964\u201365, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation were driven from the charts.<ref>Lehman, p. 14</ref>\n\nWhile on tour again in the UK in 1966,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=131}} Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to England to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}\n\nOrbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.<ref>Amburn, p. 126.</ref>\n\nOrbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but he claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles.<ref>Amburn, p. 54.</ref> Tragedy struck on June 6, 1966, however, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. She struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]], and died instantly.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 139.</ref>\n\nA grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.<ref>Lehman, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]], and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, \"I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time\", with\u2014according to biographer Colin Escott\u2014\"zero conviction\".<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box office flop.

During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: \"[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 152.</ref>\n\nDuring a tour of England and playing [[Birmingham]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 161\u201363.</ref> The property was sold to [[Johnny Cash]], who demolished the building and planted an orchard on it.

Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the 1960s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records.<ref>Amburn, p. 170.</ref> Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of \"[[Love Hurts]]\", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by [[Hard Rock music|hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by [[blues]] adept [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]] sent \"Only the Lonely\" to No. 1 on the country music charts.<ref>Amburn, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of \"Dream Baby\".\n\nA compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], who started as [[Linda Ronstadt|Linda Ronstadt's]] backup band. Ronstadt herself covered \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.<ref>Amburn, p. 178.</ref> He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded \"[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]\" with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.\n\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbison with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis for a televised 1977 Christmas special]]\n\nIn late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to overwinter in [[Hawaii]]. While there, he checked into a hospital where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed [[coronary arteries]]. On January 18, 1978, Orbison underwent a triple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass]]. He had suffered from [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]] since as early as 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 183\u2013184.</ref> He felt revitalized following the triple bypass, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated for the remainder of his life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1980, [[Don McLean]] charted with \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and his version unexpectedly went to the top of the charts at first in the Netherlands, afterward hitting No. 5 in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks, and also topped the Irish Charts.<ref>Amburn, p. 182.</ref> Although he was all but forgotten in the US, Orbison reached the most unlikely places for a rock and roll legend, like [[Bulgaria]] for example in 1982.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964; he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of [[Sofia]].<ref>Amburn, p. 183.</ref> In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris had won a [[Grammy Award]] for their duet \"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\" (from the comedy film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', in which Orbison also had a cameo role) and things were picking up.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}} It was his first such award, and he felt hopeful in making a full return to popular music.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 192.</ref> However, it would be several more years until this came to fruition.

It was lip-synched by an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] drug dealer played by [[Dean Stockwell]], after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere.<ref name=\"Amburn, p. 193\">Amburn, p. 193.</ref> Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, \"I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal&nbsp;...

He released an album of his re-recorded hits, titled ''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]''. \"Life Fades Away\", a song he co-wrote with his friend [[Glenn Danzig]] and recorded, was featured in the film ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |title=Glenn Danzig and Roy Orbison |publisher=RoyOrbison.com |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224630/http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}</ref> He and [[k.d. lang]] performed a duet of \"Crying\" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Hiding Out]]'' (1987); the pair received a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] after Orbison's death.<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/roy-orbison |title=GRAMMY Award Results for Roy Orbison |website=Recording Academy GRAMMY Awards |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and was initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album ''[[Born to Run]]'': \"I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector\u2014but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison.\"<ref name=\"clayson202-203\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 202\u2013203.</ref> In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt \"validated\" by the honor.<ref name=\"clayson202-203\"/> A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove nightclub]] in Los Angeles. They were joined by [[Jackson Browne]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[James Burton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.james-burton.net/biography/ |title=Biography |website=The Official James Burton Website |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> and [[k.d. lang]]. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: \"Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 207.</ref> The concert was filmed in one take and aired on [[Cinemax]] under the title ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.<ref>Amburn, p. 205.</ref>\n\n===Traveling Wilburys and ''Mystery Girl''===\n\nIt was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] bandleader [[Jeff Lynne]] on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on Harrison's new single.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=211}} They subsequently contacted [[Bob Dylan]], who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to [[Tom Petty]]'s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.<ref>Amburn, p. 218.</ref> By that evening, the group had written \"[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]\", which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the [[Traveling Wilburys]], representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself \"Lefty Wilbury\" after Lefty Frizzell.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 221.</ref>\n\nLynne later spoke of the recording sessions: \"Everybody just sat there going, 'Wow, it's Roy Orbison!'... Even though he's become your pal and you're hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he's doing his business, suddenly it's shudder time.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 208.</ref> Orbison was given one solo track, \"[[Not Alone Any More]]\", on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press. ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'' spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and topped out at No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group]].<ref name=\"grammy\"/> ''Rolling Stone'' included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.<ref>Amburn, p. 222.</ref>\n\nOrbison was in high demand for concerts and interviews once again, and was seemingly ecstatic about it. He began writing songs and collaborating with many musicians from his past and newer fans, to develop a solo album, ''[[Mystery Girl]]''.\n\n''Mystery Girl'' was co-produced by [[Jeff Lynne]], whom Orbison considered the best producer he had ever collaborated with.<ref>Amburn, p. 213.</ref> [[Elvis Costello]], Orbison's son Wesley and others offered their songs to him. The biggest hit from the album was \"[[You Got It]]\", written with Lynne and Tom Petty. It posthumously rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\"/>\n\nIn 2014, a demo of Orbison's \"The Way Is Love\" was released as part of the 25th-anniversary deluxe edition of ''Mystery Girl''. The song was originally recorded on a stereo cassette player around 1986. Orbison's sons contributed instrumentation on the track along with Roy's vocals; it was produced by [[John Carter Cash]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/21/unreleased-roy-orbison-track-the-way-is-love\n| title      = Unreleased Roy Orbison track resurrected by singer's sons\n| author     = Sean Michaels\n| date       = March 21, 2014\n| work       = The Guardian\n| accessdate = October 7, 2015\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the video for the Wilburys' \"Handle with Care\" was filmed with Orbison, the video for \"[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]\" was filmed and released posthumously.

In the final three months of his life, he gave ''Rolling Stone'' magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted [[Martin Sheen]] to play him in a biopic.<ref name=Pond/> In November 1988, ''Mystery Girl'' was completed, and ''Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1'' was rising up the charts. Around this time, Orbison confided in [[Johnny Cash]] that he was having chest pains. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in [[Antwerp]], where footage for the video for \"You Got It\" was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule. A few days later, a manager at a club in [[Boston]] was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show, to another standing ovation.<ref>Amburn, pp. 227\u2013228.</ref>\n\nOrbison performed at the Front Row Theater in [[Highland Heights, Ohio]], on December 4. Exhausted, he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for several days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys. On December 6, 1988, he spent the day flying [[model aircraft|model airplanes]] with his sons and ate dinner at his mother's home in Hendersonville.

The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\"<ref name=\"amburn97\">Amburn, p. 97.</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|first2=Stephen L.|last2=Betts|date=October 5, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> and \"the Big O\".<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/>\n\nRoys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison's sons to administer their father's catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018 release of ''Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra'' album as well as a fall 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called ''In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/10/roy-orbison-with-royal-philharmonic-unchained-melodies-releases-1116-includes-duet-with-country-musi.html|title=Roy Orbison with Royal Philharmonic \"Unchained Melodies\" Releases 11/16, Includes Duet With Country Music Sensation Cam|website=Music News Net}}</ref>\n\n===Songwriting===\n====Structures====\n\nMusic critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions \"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\".<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 20\">Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, \"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\".<ref name=\"watrous\">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). \"Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold\". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name=\"nswhof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way....So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes...But that's always after the fact\u2014as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me.\" | Roy Orbison}}\n\n[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made \"radical left turns\", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of \"Running Scared\" eventually depends on the final note, one word.<ref>Lehman, p. 52.</ref> Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\"/>\n\n====Themes====\n\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]]. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy\u2014try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\".<ref name=\"watrous\"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a postmodern nerve\".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\n===Voice quality===\n{{Quote box\n | width = 30%\n | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time.

[[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard \"Crying\" for the first time, \"That was it.

When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up.

During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age.

Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, \"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.'

Many critics described his music as [[operatic]], nicknaming him \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\" and \"the Big O\". While most male [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability. He performed standing still, wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.\n\nOrbison began singing in a [[rockabilly]] and [[Country music|country-and-western]] band in high school. He was signed by [[Sam Phillips]], of [[Sun Records]], in 1956, but his greatest success came with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of his singles reached the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 40, and he wrote or co-wrote almost all that rose to the Top 10, including \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" (1960), \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\" (1961), \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" (1961), \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (1963), and \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" (1964). Soon afterward, he was struck by a number of personal tragedies while his record sales declined.\n\nIn the 1980s, Orbison experienced a resurgence in popularity following the success of several [[cover version]]s of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the [[Traveling Wilburys]], a rock [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]], with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at the age of 52. One month later, Orbison's song \"[[You Got It]]\" (1989), co-written with Lynne and Petty, was released as a solo single and became his first hit to reach the U.S. Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in the same year, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time'. In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936, in [[Vernon, Texas]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Carr|first=Joe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Q2QhJf4jR0C&pg=RA10-PP22|title=Prairie Nights to Neon Lights: The Story of Country Music in West Texas|last2=Munde|first2=Alan|date=October 1996|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=978-0-89672-365-8|pages=134|language=en}}</ref> the middle son of Orbie Lee Orbison (1913\u20131984), an oil well driller and car mechanic, and Nadine Vesta Shults (July 25, 1913 \u2013 May 12, 1992),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Nadine-Orbison/6000000012909498491 |title=Nadine Vesta Orbison |website=geni}}</ref> a nurse.

He considered his voice memorable, but not great.<ref name=\"escott\"/>\n\nOn Roy's sixth birthday, his father gave him a guitar. He later recalled that by the age of seven, \"I was finished, you know, for anything else\"; music would be his life.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 7.</ref> His major musical influence as a youth was country music. He was particularly moved by [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s singing, with its slurred syllables.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 21.</ref> (When he later joined the British-American supergroup the [[Traveling Wilburys]], he adopted the name \u201cLefty\u201d Wilbury). He also enjoyed [[Hank Williams]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. One of the first musicians he heard in person was [[Ernest Tubb]], playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. In West Texas, he was exposed to many forms of music: \"sepia\" (a euphemism for [[rhythm and blues]]), [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and [[cajun]]. The cajun favorite \"[[Jole Blon]]\" was one of the first songs he sang in public. At the age of eight, he began singing on a local radio show. By the late 1940s, he was the show's host.<ref>Amburn, pp. 8, 9.</ref>\n\nIn high school, Orbison and some friends formed a band, the Wink Westerners. They played country standards and [[Glenn Miller]] songs at local honky-tonks and had a weekly radio show on [[KERB (AM)|KERB]] in [[Kermit, Texas|Kermit]].<ref name=\"royorb1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |title=History Maker |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401175007/http://www.royorbison.com/us/historymaker |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |website=The Official Roy Orbison Site |access-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref> When they were offered $400 to play at a dance (about $3,800 in 2019 money), Orbison realized he could make a living in music. After graduating from [[Wink High School]], he enrolled at [[University of North Texas|North Texas State College]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], planning to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay.<ref>Amburn, pp. 29\u201330.</ref> When he heard that his schoolmate [[Pat Boone]] had signed a record deal, it further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician. While at North Texas State College, Roy heard a song called \"Ooby Dooby\", composed by [[Dick Penner]] and Wade Moore, and after his first year of college, he returned to Wink with \"Ooby Dooby\" in hand and continued performing with the Wink Westerners.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Orbison then enrolled in [[Odessa College|Odessa Junior College]]. As two members of the band quit, two new members were added,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and the group won a talent contest and obtained their own television show on KMID-TV in Midland, Texas.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} The Wink Westerners kept performing on local TV, played dances on the weekends, and attended college during the day.\n\nWhile living in Odessa, Orbison saw a performance by [[Elvis Presley]].{{efn|Orbison later said that he \"couldn't overemphasize how shocking [Presley] looked and seemed to [him] that night\".<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>}} [[Johnny Cash]] toured the area in 1955 and 1956,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and suggested that Orbison approach Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Orbison did so and was told, \"Johnny Cash doesn't run my record company!\"{{efn|Both Orbison and Cash mentioned this anecdote years later, but Phillips denied that he was so abrupt on the phone with Orbison or that he hung up on him. One of the Teen Kings later stated that the band did not meet Cash until they were on tour with him and other Sun Records artists.<ref>Amburn, pp. 42\u201343.</ref>}} The success of their KMID television show got them another show on KOSA-TV, and they changed their name to the Teen Kings.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Due to the rejection from Sam Phillips, the Teen Kings recorded \"Ooby Dooby\" in 1956 for the Odessa-based [[Je\u2013Wel]] label.<ref name=\"escott\"/>{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=245}}  After the local record store owner Poppa Holifield played it for him over the telephone, Sam Phillips offered the Teen Kings a contract.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}}\n\n==1956\u201359: Sun Records and Acuff-Rose==\n{{main|Roy Orbison's Sun Recordings}}\n[[File:Roy Orbison 1965 (2).png|thumb|Orbison with his original thick-rimmed glasses (photo dated 1965)]]\n\nThe Teen Kings went to [[Sun Studio]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], where Phillips wanted to record \"Ooby Dooby\" again, in his studio. The song was released on Sun 242 in May 1956{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and broke into the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> The Teen Kings toured with [[Sonny James]], [[Johnny Horton]], Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing \"everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record\".<ref>Clayson, Alan p. 44.</ref> The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including \"[[Go Go Go (Down the Line)|Go! Go! Go!]]\" and \"Rockhouse\". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there.{{efn|Alan Clayson's biography refers to her as Claudette Hestand.}} They stayed in Phillips' home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice.<ref>Amburn, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> A ballad Orbison wrote, \"The Clown\", met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer [[Jack Clement]] told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOrbison was introduced to Elvis Presley's social circle, once going to pick up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison wrote \"Claudette\"\u2014about Claudette Frady, whom he married in 1957\u2014and the [[Everly Brothers]] recorded it as the B-side of \"[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]\". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled him to make a down payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 56.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at [[Acuff-Rose Music|Acuff-Rose]], a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to [[Wesley Rose]], who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] his recordings of songs by other writers, working with and being in awe of [[Chet Atkins]], who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was \"Seems to Me\", by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then\u2014softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 62.</ref>\n\nPlaying shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter [[Joe Melson]], an acquaintance of Orbison's, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together.<ref>Clayson, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs at [[RCA Studio B|RCA Nashville]]. Only two singles were judged worthy of release by RCA.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\">Zak, p. 32.</ref> Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer [[Fred Foster]] at [[Monument Records]].\n\n== 1960\u201364: Monument Records ==\n===Early singles===\nOrbison was one of the first recording artists to popularize the \"[[Nashville sound]]\", with a group of session musicians known as the [[The Nashville A-Team|A-Team (see main entry)]] The Nashville sound was developed by producers Chet Atkins, [[Owen Bradley]] (who worked closely with [[Patsy Cline]]), Sam Phillips, and Fred Foster.<ref>Wolfe and Akenson, p. 24.</ref><ref>Hoffmann and Ferstler, p. 779.</ref> In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA had refused, \"Paper Boy\", backed by \"With the Bug\", but neither charted.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\">Zak, p. 33.</ref>\n\nAccording to musician and author Albin Zak, the studio (with sound engineer [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], who experimented with [[Microphone practice|close miking]] the [[doo-wop]] backing singers), the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison's music a \"polished, professional sound&nbsp;... finally allow[ing] Orbison's stylistic inclinations free rein\".<ref name=\"Zak, p. 32.\"/> Orbison requested a string section and with it, he recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was \"Uptown\", written with Joe Melson.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\">Lehman, p. 48.</ref> Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, \"We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/><ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> ''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' states that the music Orbison made in Nashville \"brought a new splendor to rock\", and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of [[Phil Spector]].<ref name=decurtis155>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 155.</ref>\n\n\"Uptown\" reached only number 72 on the ''Billboard'' Top 100, and Orbison set his sights on negotiating a contract with an upscale nightclub somewhere. His initial success came just as the '50s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.<ref>Lehman, p. 19.</ref>\n\n===Top-10 hits===\n====1960\u201362====\n\nExperimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from \"Uptown\", and another song they had written called \"Come Back to Me (My Love)\", employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\">Zak, p. 35.</ref> It also featured a note hit by Orbison in [[falsetto]] that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, \"came not from his throat but deeper within\".<ref>Clayson, p. 77.</ref> The song was \"[[Only the Lonely|Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)]]\". Orbison and Melson tried to pitch it to Elvis Presley and the Everly Brothers, but were turned down.<ref>Amburn p. 91.</ref> They instead recorded the song at RCA's Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 48.\"/><ref name=Fremer>{{cite interview |interviewer=Michael Fremer |last=Porter |first=Bill |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |title=Recording Elvis and Roy With Legendary Studio Wiz Bill Porter \u2013 Part II |website=MusicAngle |access-date=February 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134327/http://www.musicangle.com/feat.php?id=108 |archive-date=2011-07-14}}</ref> This combination became Orbison's trademark sound.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 35.\"/>\n\n\"Only the Lonely\" shot to number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told ''Rolling Stone'' in 1988, \"I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Only the Lonely\", it kind of turned into a good voice.\"<ref name=\"rockhall\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/roy-orbison |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> Its success transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' out of New York City.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=78}} When Presley heard \"Only the Lonely\" for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.<ref name=\"amburn98\">Amburn, p. 98.</ref> Melson and Orbison followed it with the more complex \"Blue Angel\", which peaked at number nine in the US and number 11 in the UK. \"I'm Hurtin'\", with \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" as the B-side, rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Running Scared.ogg\n|title=\"Running Scared\" (1961)\n|description=The ending of \"Running Scared\" features Orbison's natural voice hitting high A natural.\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison was now able to move to Nashville permanently with his wife Claudette and two sons Roy DeWayne and Anthony King.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of \"Only the Lonely\" and \"I'm Hurtin'\", Orbison worked on a new song, \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\", based loosely on the rhythm of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bol\u00e9ro]]''; the song was about a man on the lookout for his girlfriend's previous boyfriend, whom he feared would try to take her away. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song's highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high 'A' naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing.<ref name=decurtis155/> On that third take, \"Running Scared\" was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, \"He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> Just weeks later \"Running Scared\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison's following hits reflected \"Running Scared\": a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison's dynamic voice.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}}\n\n\"Crying\" followed in July 1961 and reached number two; it was coupled with an up-tempo R&B song, \"Candy Man\", written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 30, staying on the charts for two months.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=470}} While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as \"The Big O\", partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison's second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with \"[[Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)]]\", an upbeat song by country songwriter [[Cindy Walker]]. (Orbison's producer later formed [[the Candymen]] quintet, which was Orbison's backing band from 1965 to 1970 and released a few singles and two albums of its own). Also in 1962, he charted with \"The Crowd\", \"Leah\", and \"Workin' for the Man\", which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref>Amburn, p. 32.</ref> His relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating over Melson's growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 91.</ref>\n\n====1963\u201364====\n[[File:1965 Roy Orbison.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.1|Orbison began performing while wearing sunglasses in 1963, later recalling that he \"wasn't trying to be weird ...

He had no publicist in the early 1960s, therefore he had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' called him an \"anonymous celebrity\".<ref>Lehman, p. 18.</ref> After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an aeroplane in 1963, while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had a good sense of humor and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe [[stage fright]]; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat.

His string of top-40 hits continued with \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (US number seven, UK number six), \"Falling\" (US number 22, UK number 9), and \"[[Mean Woman Blues]]\" (US number five, UK number three) coupled with \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" (US number 29, UK number three).{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}<ref name=\"britishhits\">Brown, Kutner, and Warwick, p. 645.</ref> According to the official Roy Orbison U.S. discography by Marcel Riesco,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=249}} a rare alternate version of \"Blue Bayou\" was released in Italy. Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by [[Willie Nelson]], \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).\n\nAs \"In Dreams\" was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace [[Duane Eddy]] on a tour of the UK in top billing with the [[the Beatles|Beatles]]. When he arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, \"What's a Beatle, anyway?\" to which [[John Lennon]] replied, after tapping his shoulder, \"I am\".<ref>Amburn, p. 115.</ref> On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison sang through 14 encores.<ref name=\"clayson109-113\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 109\u2013113.</ref> Finally, when the audience began chanting \"We want Roy!\" again, Lennon and McCartney physically held Orbison back.<ref>Amburn, p. 117.</ref> Starr later said, \"In [[Glasgow]], we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything.\"<ref name=\"clayson109-113\"/> Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work.<ref>Lennon, John; McCartney, Paul; Harrison, George; Starr, Ringo (2002). ''The Beatles Anthology. Chronicle''. p. 94</ref> Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.\n\nTouring in 1963 took a toll on Orbison's personal life. His wife Claudette had an affair with the contractor who built their home in [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]]. Friends and relatives attributed the breakdown of the marriage to her youth and her inability to withstand being alone and bored. When Orbison toured Britain again in the fall of 1963, she joined him.<ref>Amburn, pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> He was immensely popular wherever he went, finishing the tour in Ireland and Canada. Almost immediately, he toured Australia and New Zealand with [[the Beach Boys]] and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him.<ref>Amburn, p. 125.</ref> He travelled to Australia again, this time with [[the Rolling Stones]]. [[Mick Jagger]] later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, \"a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.\"<ref name=\"amburn134\">Amburn, p. 134.</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=Roy Orbison - Oh, Pretty Woman.ogg\n|title=\"Oh, Pretty Woman\" (1964)\n|description=The opening guitar riff of \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was a direct influence on \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" by the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]].<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 128 and Lehman, p. 169.</ref>\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nOrbison also began collaborating with [[Bill Dees]], whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote \"[[It's Over (Roy Orbison song)|It's Over]]\", a number-one hit in the UK and a song that would be one of his signature pieces for the rest of his career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, \"A pretty woman never needs any money\".<ref>Amburn, p. 127.</ref> Just 40 minutes later, \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a [[Bob Hope]] movie, the epithet ''mercy'' Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as ''Billboard'' magazine noted, \"In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the ''only'' American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\">Amburn, p. 128.</ref>\n\n==1965\u201369: Career decline and tragedies==\n[[File:Roy Orbison 1967.png|thumb|Orbison in 1967]]\nClaudette and he divorced in November 1964 over her infidelities, but reconciled 10 months later. His contract with Monument was expiring in June 1965.

Orbison was a film enthusiast and, when not touring, writing or recording, dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nRose also became Orbison's producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose's takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison's work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison's best work could only be achieved with RCA Nashville's A-Team.<ref name=\"Zak, p. 33.\"/> Orbison's first collection at MGM, an album titled ''There Is Only One Roy Orbison'', sold fewer than 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"escott\"/> With the onset of the [[British Invasion]] in 1964\u201365, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison's generation were driven from the charts.<ref>Lehman, p. 14</ref>\n\nWhile on tour again in the UK in 1966,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=131}} Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to England to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=129}}\n\nOrbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot.<ref>Amburn, p. 126.</ref>\n\nOrbison and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles; she had grown up around them, but he claimed Elvis Presley had introduced him to motorcycles.<ref>Amburn, p. 54.</ref> Tragedy struck on June 6, 1966, however, when Orbison and Claudette were riding home from [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. She struck the door of a pickup truck which had pulled out in front of her on South Water Avenue in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]], and died instantly.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 139.</ref>\n\nA grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with [[Bill Dees]] to write music for ''[[The Fastest Guitar Alive]]'', a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy.<ref>Lehman, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> Orbison's character was a spy who stole, and had to protect and deliver, a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the [[American Civil War]], and was outfitted with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line, \"I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time\", with\u2014according to biographer Colin Escott\u2014\"zero conviction\".<ref name=\"escott\"/> Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box office flop. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Amburn, pp. 151\u2013153.</ref>\n\nHe recorded an album dedicated to the songs of [[Don Gibson]] and another of [[Hank Williams]] covers, but both sold poorly. During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[the Doors]], Orbison felt lost and directionless, later saying: \"[I] didn't hear a lot I could relate to so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you're still there and you bloom again.\"<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 152.</ref>\n\nDuring a tour of England and playing [[Birmingham]] on Saturday, September 14, 1968,{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=144}} he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 161\u201363.</ref> The property was sold to [[Johnny Cash]], who demolished the building and planted an orchard on it. On March 25, 1969, Orbison married German teenager [[Barbara Orbison|Barbara Jakobs]], whom he had met several weeks before his sons' deaths.<ref>Amburn, p. 163.</ref> Wesley (born 1965), his youngest son with Claudette, was raised by Orbison's parents.

Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the 1960s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his 1970s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records.<ref>Amburn, p. 170.</ref> Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: \"Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 2.</ref> His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of \"[[Love Hurts]]\", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], again by [[Hard Rock music|hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and by [[blues]] adept [[Jim Capaldi]]. [[Sonny James]] sent \"Only the Lonely\" to No. 1 on the country music charts.<ref>Amburn, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref> [[Bruce Springsteen]] ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and [[Glen Campbell]] had a minor hit with a remake of \"Dream Baby\".\n\nA compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], who started as [[Linda Ronstadt|Linda Ronstadt's]] backup band. Ronstadt herself covered \"[[Blue Bayou]]\" in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career.<ref>Amburn, p. 178.</ref> He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded \"[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]\" with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.\n\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|Orbison with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis for a televised 1977 Christmas special]]\n\nIn late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to overwinter in [[Hawaii]]. While there, he checked into a hospital where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed [[coronary arteries]]. On January 18, 1978, Orbison underwent a triple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary bypass]]. He had suffered from [[Peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcers]] since as early as 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 3, 183\u2013184.</ref> He felt revitalized following the triple bypass, but he continued to smoke, and his weight fluctuated for the remainder of his life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1980, [[Don McLean]] charted with \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} and his version unexpectedly went to the top of the charts at first in the Netherlands, afterward hitting No. 5 in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was No. 1 in the UK for three weeks, and also topped the Irish Charts.<ref>Amburn, p. 182.</ref> Although he was all but forgotten in the US, Orbison reached the most unlikely places for a rock and roll legend, like [[Bulgaria]] for example in 1982.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017}} He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964; he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of [[Sofia]].<ref>Amburn, p. 183.</ref> In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris had won a [[Grammy Award]] for their duet \"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\" (from the comedy film ''[[Roadie (1980 film)|Roadie]]'', in which Orbison also had a cameo role) and things were picking up.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}} It was his first such award, and he felt hopeful in making a full return to popular music.<ref>Clayson, Alan, p. 192.</ref> However, it would be several more years until this came to fruition. In the meantime, [[Van Halen]] released a hard-rock cover of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" on their 1982 album ''[[Diver Down]]'', again further exposing a younger generation to Orbison's legacy.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=183}}\n\n=== Career revival ===\n\n[[File:Orbison1987.jpg|thumb|left|Orbison performing in New York in 1987]]\n\nOrbison originally declined [[David Lynch]]'s request to allow the use of \"In Dreams\" for the film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986).<ref>Amburn, p. 191.</ref> Lynch used it anyway (although his first choice was \"Crying\"{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=199}}); the song served as one of several obsessions of a psychopathic character named [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]] (played by  [[Dennis Hopper]]). It was lip-synched by an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] drug dealer played by [[Dean Stockwell]], after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere.<ref name=\"Amburn, p. 193\">Amburn, p. 193.</ref> Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, \"I was mortified because they were talking about the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal&nbsp;... I thought, 'What in the world&nbsp;...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie\u2014how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/>\n\nBy 1987, Orbison's career was fully revived. He released an album of his re-recorded hits, titled ''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]''. \"Life Fades Away\", a song he co-wrote with his friend [[Glenn Danzig]] and recorded, was featured in the film ''[[Less Than Zero (film)|Less Than Zero]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |title=Glenn Danzig and Roy Orbison |publisher=RoyOrbison.com |accessdate=July 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219224630/http://www.royorbison.com/glenn-danzig-and-roy-orbison/ |archivedate=February 19, 2015 |df= }}</ref> He and [[k.d. lang]] performed a duet of \"Crying\" for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Hiding Out]]'' (1987); the pair received a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] after Orbison's death.<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/roy-orbison |title=GRAMMY Award Results for Roy Orbison |website=Recording Academy GRAMMY Awards |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and was initiated into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album ''[[Born to Run]]'': \"I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector\u2014but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison.\"<ref name=\"clayson202-203\">Clayson, Alan, pp. 202\u2013203.</ref> In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt \"validated\" by the honor.<ref name=\"clayson202-203\"/> A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove nightclub]] in Los Angeles. They were joined by [[Jackson Browne]], [[T Bone Burnett]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jennifer Warnes]], [[James Burton]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.james-burton.net/biography/ |title=Biography |website=The Official James Burton Website |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> and [[k.d. lang]]. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: \"Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 207.</ref> The concert was filmed in one take and aired on [[Cinemax]] under the title ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.<ref>Amburn, p. 205.</ref>\n\n===Traveling Wilburys and ''Mystery Girl''===\n\nIt was also in 1988 that Orbison began collaborating seriously with [[Electric Light Orchestra]] bandleader [[Jeff Lynne]] on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison's ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'' album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on Harrison's new single.{{sfnp|Riesco, Orbison et al.|2017|p=211}} They subsequently contacted [[Bob Dylan]], who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to [[Tom Petty]]'s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour.<ref>Amburn, p. 218.</ref> By that evening, the group had written \"[[Handle with Care (song)|Handle with Care]]\", which led to the concept of recording an entire album.

They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself \"Lefty Wilbury\" after Lefty Frizzell.<ref>Clayson, Alan, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref> Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group's foundation in honor: \"Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder.

Around this time, Orbison confided in [[Johnny Cash]] that he was having chest pains. He went to Europe, was presented with an award there, and played a show in [[Antwerp]], where footage for the video for \"You Got It\" was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule.

The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\"<ref name=\"amburn97\">Amburn, p. 97.</ref><ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|first2=Stephen L.|last2=Betts|date=October 5, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> and \"the Big O\".<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/>\n\nRoys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison's sons to administer their father's catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018 release of ''Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra'' album as well as a fall 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called ''In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/10/roy-orbison-with-royal-philharmonic-unchained-melodies-releases-1116-includes-duet-with-country-musi.html|title=Roy Orbison with Royal Philharmonic \"Unchained Melodies\" Releases 11/16, Includes Duet With Country Music Sensation Cam|website=Music News Net}}</ref>\n\n===Songwriting===\n====Structures====\n\nMusic critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions \"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\".<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 20\">Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, \"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\".<ref name=\"watrous\">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). \"Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold\". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name=\"nswhof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way....So the structure sometimes has the chorus at the end of the song, and sometimes there is no chorus, it just goes...But that's always after the fact\u2014as I'm writing, it all sounds natural and in sequence to me.\" | Roy Orbison}}\n\n[[Elton John]]'s songwriting partner and main lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] wrote that Orbison's songs always made \"radical left turns\", and [[k.d. lang]] declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of \"Running Scared\" eventually depends on the final note, one word.<ref>Lehman, p. 52.</ref> Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"<ref name=\"amburn128\"/>\n\n====Themes====\n\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]]. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy\u2014try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\".<ref name=\"watrous\"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a postmodern nerve\".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\n===Voice quality===\n{{Quote box\n | width = 30%\n | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time.

[[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard \"Crying\" for the first time, \"That was it.

When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation.\"<ref>Amburn, p. 184.</ref> Bassist [[Jerry Scheff]], who backed Orbison in his ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night|A Black and White Night]]'' concert, wrote about him, \"Roy Orbison was like an opera singer.

During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age.

Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, \"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.'

Her parents departed from Acre shortly after her birth, traveling to Sicily and Spain<ref>Green 1850, p. 319</ref> before leaving Joan with Eleanor's mother, [[Joan, Countess of Ponthieu]], in France.<ref>Parsons (1995), p.39</ref> Joan lived for several years in France where she spent her time being educated by a bishop and \"being thoroughly spoiled by an indulgent grandmother.\"<ref name=\"Parsons 1995, p.40\">Parsons (1995), p.40</ref> Joan was free to play among the \"vine clad hills and sunny vales\"<ref>Green (1850), p 319</ref> surrounding her grandmother's home, although she required \"judicious surveillance.\"<ref>Green (1850), p.320</ref>\n\nAs Joan was growing up with her grandmother, her father was back in England, already arranging marriages for his daughter. He hoped to gain both political power and more wealth with his daughter's marriage, so he conducted the arrangement in a very \"business-like style\".<ref>Green (1850), p.321</ref> He finally found a man suitable to marry Joan (aged 5 at the time), Hartman, son of King [[Rudolph I of Germany]]. Edward then brought her home from France for the first time to meet him.<ref>Green (1850), p321.</ref> As she had spent her entire life away from Edward and Eleanor, when she returned she \"stood in no awe of her parents\"<ref name=\"Parsons 1995, p.40\"/> and had a fairly distanced relationship with them.\n\nUnfortunately for King Edward, his daughter's suitor died before he was able to meet or marry Joan. The news reported that Hartman had fallen through a patch of shallow ice while \"amusing himself in skating\" while a letter sent to the King himself stated that Hartman had set out on a boat to visit his father amidst a terrible fog and the boat had smashed into a rock, drowning him.<ref>Green (1850), p.323</ref>\n\n==First marriage==\nEdward arranged a second marriage almost immediately after the death of Hartman.<ref>Oxford, p. 626.</ref> Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who was almost thirty years older than Joan and newly divorced, was his first choice.<ref>Green (1850), p.327</ref> The earl resigned his lands to Edward upon agreeing to get them back when he married Joan, as well as agreed on a dower of two thousand silver marks.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.328\">Green (1850), p.328</ref> By the time all of these negotiations were finished, Joan was twelve years old.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.328\"/> Gilbert de Clare became very enamored with Joan, and even though she had to marry him regardless of how she felt, he still tried to woo her.<ref>Green (1850), p329.</ref> He bought her expensive gifts and clothing to try to win favor with her.<ref>Green 1850, p329</ref> The couple were married on 30 April 1290 at Westminster Abbey, and had four children together.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\">Oxford, p. 626</ref> They were:\n\n# [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford]]\n# [[Eleanor de Clare]]\n# [[Margaret de Clare]]\n# [[Elizabeth de Clare]]\n\nJoan's first husband, Gilbert de Clare died on 7 December 1295.<ref name=\"Acre, Countess p. 626\">\"Joan or Joanna of Acre, Countess.\" Oxford, p. 626</ref>\n\n==Secret second marriage==\nJoan had been a widow for only a little over a year when she caught the eye of [[Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer|Ralph de Monthermer]], a squire in Joan's father's household.<ref>Green (1850), p.342</ref> Joan fell in love and convinced her father to have Monthermer knighted. It was unheard of in European royalty for a noble lady to even converse with a man who had not won or acquired importance in the household. However, Joan secretly married Ralph in January 1297.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.343\">Green (1850), p.343</ref> Joan's father was already planning another marriage for Joan to [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]],<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.343\"/> to occur on 16 March 1297. Being already married, unbeknownst to her father, Joan was in a dangerous predicament.\n\nJoan sent her four young children to their grandfather, in hopes that their sweetness would win Edward's favor, but her plan did not work.<ref>Green (1850) p.345</ref> The king soon discovered his daughter's intentions, but not yet aware that she had already committed to them,<ref name=\"Acre, Countess p. 626\"/> he seized Joan's lands and continued to arrange her marriage to Amadeus of Savoy.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> Soon after the seizure of her lands, Joan told her father that she had married Ralph. The king was enraged and retaliated by immediately imprisoning Monthermer at [[Bristol Castle]].<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> The people of the land had differing opinions on Joan's predicament. It has been argued that the noblemen who were most upset were those who wanted her hand in marriage.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.3\">Higginbotham (2009), p.3</ref>\n\nWith regard to the matter, Joan famously said, \"It is not considered ignominious, nor disgraceful, for a great earl to take a poor and mean woman to wife; neither, on the other hand, is it worthy of blame, or too difficult a thing for a countess to promote to honor a gallant youth.\"<ref>Green (1850), p. 347</ref> Coming at the time of a pregnancy which may have been obvious, Joan's statement seemed to soften Edward's attitude towards the situation.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.3\"/> Her first child by Monthermer was born in October 1297; by the summer of 1297, when the marriage was revealed to the king, Joan's condition would certainly have been apparent, helping to convince Edward that he had no choice but to recognize his daughter's second marriage. Edward I eventually relented, for the sake of his daughter, and released Monthermer from imprisonment in August 1297.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> Monthermer paid homage on 2 August, was granted the titles of [[Earl of Gloucester]] and [[Earl of Hertford]], and rose in the King's favour during Joan's lifetime.<ref name=\"Oxford, p.627\">Oxford, p.627</ref>\n\nMonthermer and Joan had four children:\n\n# [[Mary de Monthermer]], born October 1297. In 1306 her grandfather King Edward I arranged for her to marry [[Duncan Macduff, 8th Earl of Fife]].\n# Joan de Monthermer, born 1299, became a nun at [[Amesbury]].\n# [[Thomas de Monthermer, 2nd Baron Monthermer]], born 1301.\n# Edward de Monthermer, born 1304 and died 1339.\n\n== Relationship with family ==\nJoan of Acre was the seventh of Edward I and Eleanor's fourteen children. Most of her elder siblings died before the age of seven, and many of her younger siblings died before adulthood.<ref>Prestwich (1988), p.51</ref> Those who survived to adulthood were Joan, her younger brother, Edward of [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]] (later [[Edward II]]), and four of her sisters: [[Eleanor of England (1269-1298)|Eleanor]], [[Margaret of England (1275\u20131333)|Margaret]], [[Mary of Woodstock|Mary]], and [[Elizabeth of Rhuddlan|Elizabeth]].<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.52\">Prestwich (1988), p.52</ref>\n\nJoan, like her siblings, was raised outside her parents' household. She lived with her grandmother in Ponthieu for four years, and was then entrusted to the same caregivers who looked after her siblings.<ref>Higginbotham (2009), p.1</ref> Edward I did not have a close relationship with most of his children while they were growing up, yet \"he seemed fonder of his daughters than his sons.\"<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.52\"/>\n\nHowever, Joan of Acre's independent nature caused numerous conflicts with her father. Her father disapproved of her leaving court after her marriage to the Earl of Gloucester, and in turn \"seized seven robes that had been made for her\".<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\">Higginbotham (2009), p.2</ref> He also strongly disapproved of her second marriage to Ralph de Monthermer, a squire in her household, even to the point of attempting to force her to marry someone else.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\"/><ref>Prestwich (1988), p.54</ref> While Edward ultimately developed a cordial relationship with Monthermer, even granting him two earldoms,<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\"/> there appears to have been a notable difference in Edward's treatment of Joan as compared to the treatment of the rest of her siblings. For instance, her father famously paid messengers substantially when they brought news of the birth of grandchildren, but did not do this upon the birth of Joan's daughter.<ref>Prestwich (1988), p.55</ref>\n\nJoan retained a fairly tight bond with her siblings. She and Monthermer both maintained a close relationship with her brother, Edward, which was maintained through letters. After Edward became estranged from his father and lost his royal seal, \"Joan offered to lend him her seal\".<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.53\">Prestwich (1988), p.53</ref>\n\n==Death==\nJoan died on 23 April 1307, at the manor of Clare in Suffolk.<ref name=\"Oxford, p.627\"/> The cause of her death remains unclear, though one popular theory is that she died during childbirth, a common cause of death at the time. While Joan's age in 1307 (about 35) and the chronology of her earlier pregnancies with Ralph de Monthermer suggest that this could well be the case, historians have not confirmed the cause of her death.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\">Higginbotham (2009), p.4</ref>\n\nLess than four months after her death, Joan's father died. Joan's widower, Ralph de Monthermer, lost the title of Earl of Gloucester soon after the deaths of his wife and father-in-law. The earldom of Gloucester was given to Joan's son from her first marriage, Gilbert, who was its rightful holder. Monthermer continued to hold a nominal earldom in Scotland, which had been conferred on him by Edward I, until his death.\n\nJoan's burial place has been the cause of some interest and debate. She is interred in the Augustinian priory at Clare, which had been founded by her first husband's ancestors and where many of them were also buried. Allegedly, in 1357, Joan's daughter, Elizabeth De Burgh, claimed to have \"inspected her mother's body and found the corpse to be intact\",<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\"/> which in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church is an indication of sanctity. This claim was only recorded in a fifteenth-century chronicle, however, and its details are uncertain, especially the statement that her corpse was in such a state of preservation that \"when her [[Breasts|paps]] [breasts] were pressed with hands, they rose up again.\" Some sources further claim that miracles took place at Joan's tomb,<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\"/> but no cause for her [[beatification]] or [[canonization]] has ever been introduced.\n\n==Joan in fiction==\nJoan of Acre makes an appearance in Virginia Henley's historical romance ''Infamous''. In the book, Joan, known as Joanna, is described as a promiscuous young princess, vain, shallow and spoiled. In the novel she is only given one daughter, when she historically had eight children. There is no evidence that supports this picture of Joan.<ref>Higginbotham (2009) p.4</ref>\n\nIn ''The Love Knot'' by Vanessa Alexander, Joan of Acre is an important character. The author portrays a completely different view of the princess from the one in Henley's novel. ''The Love Knot'' tells the story of the love affair between Ralph de Monthermer and Joan of Acre through the discovery of a series of letters the two had written to each other.<ref>Higginbotham, (2009) p.5</ref>\n\nBetween historians and novelists, Joan has appeared in various texts as either an independent and spirited woman or a spoiled brat. In ''Lives of the Princesses of England'' by Mary Anne Everett Green, Joan is portrayed as a \"giddy princess\" and neglectful mother.<ref>Green (1850), p. 342</ref> Many have agreed to this characterization; however, some authors think there is little evidence to support the assumption that Joan of Acre was a neglectful or uncaring mother.<ref>Higginbotham (2009), p.5</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Joan of Acre<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|2010|p=viii}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=532\u2013536}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|p=574}}; {{harvnb|O'Callaghan|1975|p=681}}; {{harvnb|Durand|Cl\u00e9mencet|Dantine|1818|p=435}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2004}}; {{harvnb|Parsons|2004}}</ref>\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

He hoped to gain both political power and more wealth with his daughter's marriage, so he conducted the arrangement in a very \"business-like style\".<ref>Green (1850), p.321</ref> He finally found a man suitable to marry Joan (aged 5 at the time), Hartman, son of King [[Rudolph I of Germany]]. Edward then brought her home from France for the first time to meet him.<ref>Green (1850), p321.</ref> As she had spent her entire life away from Edward and Eleanor, when she returned she \"stood in no awe of her parents\"<ref name=\"Parsons 1995, p.40\"/> and had a fairly distanced relationship with them.\n\nUnfortunately for King Edward, his daughter's suitor died before he was able to meet or marry Joan. The news reported that Hartman had fallen through a patch of shallow ice while \"amusing himself in skating\" while a letter sent to the King himself stated that Hartman had set out on a boat to visit his father amidst a terrible fog and the boat had smashed into a rock, drowning him.<ref>Green (1850), p.323</ref>\n\n==First marriage==\nEdward arranged a second marriage almost immediately after the death of Hartman.<ref>Oxford, p. 626.</ref> Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who was almost thirty years older than Joan and newly divorced, was his first choice.<ref>Green (1850), p.327</ref> The earl resigned his lands to Edward upon agreeing to get them back when he married Joan, as well as agreed on a dower of two thousand silver marks.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.328\">Green (1850), p.328</ref> By the time all of these negotiations were finished, Joan was twelve years old.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.328\"/> Gilbert de Clare became very enamored with Joan, and even though she had to marry him regardless of how she felt, he still tried to woo her.<ref>Green (1850), p329.</ref> He bought her expensive gifts and clothing to try to win favor with her.<ref>Green 1850, p329</ref> The couple were married on 30 April 1290 at Westminster Abbey, and had four children together.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\">Oxford, p. 626</ref> They were:\n\n#[[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford]]\n#[[Eleanor de Clare]]\n#[[Margaret de Clare]]\n#[[Elizabeth de Clare]]\n\nJoan's first husband, Gilbert de Clare died on 7 December 1295.<ref name=\"Acre, Countess p. 626\">\"Joan or Joanna of Acre, Countess.\" Oxford, p. 626</ref>\n\n==Secret second marriage==\nJoan had been a widow for only a little over a year when she caught the eye of [[Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer|Ralph de Monthermer]], a squire in Joan's father's household.<ref>Green (1850), p.342</ref> Joan fell in love and convinced her father to have Monthermer knighted. It was unheard of in European royalty for a noble lady to even converse with a man who had not won or acquired importance in the household. However, Joan secretly married Ralph in January 1297.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.343\">Green (1850), p.343</ref> Joan's father was already planning another marriage for Joan to [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]],<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.343\"/> to occur on 16 March 1297. Being already married, unbeknownst to her father, Joan was in a dangerous predicament.\n\nJoan sent her four young children to their grandfather, in hopes that their sweetness would win Edward's favor, but her plan did not work.<ref>Green (1850) p.345</ref> The king soon discovered his daughter's intentions, but not yet aware that she had already committed to them,<ref name=\"Acre, Countess p. 626\"/> he seized Joan's lands and continued to arrange her marriage to Amadeus of Savoy.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> Soon after the seizure of her lands, Joan told her father that she had married Ralph. The king was enraged and retaliated by immediately imprisoning Monthermer at [[Bristol Castle]].<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> The people of the land had differing opinions on Joan's predicament. It has been argued that the noblemen who were most upset were those who wanted her hand in marriage.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.3\">Higginbotham (2009), p.3</ref>\n\nWith regard to the matter, Joan famously said, \"It is not considered ignominious, nor disgraceful, for a great earl to take a poor and mean woman to wife; neither, on the other hand, is it worthy of blame, or too difficult a thing for a countess to promote to honor a gallant youth.\"<ref>Green (1850), p. 347</ref> Coming at the time of a pregnancy which may have been obvious, Joan's statement seemed to soften Edward's attitude towards the situation.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.3\"/> Her first child by Monthermer was born in October 1297; by the summer of 1297, when the marriage was revealed to the king, Joan's condition would certainly have been apparent, helping to convince Edward that he had no choice but to recognize his daughter's second marriage. Edward I eventually relented, for the sake of his daughter, and released Monthermer from imprisonment in August 1297.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> Monthermer paid homage on 2 August, was granted the titles of [[Earl of Gloucester]] and [[Earl of Hertford]], and rose in the King's favour during Joan's lifetime.<ref name=\"Oxford, p.627\">Oxford, p.627</ref>\n\nMonthermer and Joan had four children:\n\n# [[Mary de Monthermer]], born October 1297. In 1306 her grandfather King Edward I arranged for her to marry [[Duncan Macduff, 8th Earl of Fife]].\n# Joan de Monthermer, born 1299, became a nun at [[Amesbury]].\n# [[Thomas de Monthermer, 2nd Baron Monthermer]], born 1301.\n# Edward de Monthermer, born 1304 and died 1339.\n\n== Relationship with family ==\nJoan of Acre was the seventh of Edward I and Eleanor's fourteen children. Most of her elder siblings died before the age of seven, and many of her younger siblings died before adulthood.<ref>Prestwich (1988), p.51</ref> Those who survived to adulthood were Joan, her younger brother, Edward of [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]] (later [[Edward II]]), and four of her sisters: [[Eleanor of England (1269-1298)|Eleanor]], [[Margaret of England (1275\u20131333)|Margaret]], [[Mary of Woodstock|Mary]], and [[Elizabeth of Rhuddlan|Elizabeth]].<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.52\">Prestwich (1988), p.52</ref>\n\nJoan, like her siblings, was raised outside her parents' household. She lived with her grandmother in Ponthieu for four years, and was then entrusted to the same caregivers who looked after her siblings.<ref>Higginbotham (2009), p.1</ref> Edward I did not have a close relationship with most of his children while they were growing up, yet \"he seemed fonder of his daughters than his sons.\"<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.52\"/>\n\nHowever, Joan of Acre's independent nature caused numerous conflicts with her father. Her father disapproved of her leaving court after her marriage to the Earl of Gloucester, and in turn \"seized seven robes that had been made for her\".<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\">Higginbotham (2009), p.2</ref> He also strongly disapproved of her second marriage to Ralph de Monthermer, a squire in her household, even to the point of attempting to force her to marry someone else.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\"/><ref>Prestwich (1988), p.54</ref> While Edward ultimately developed a cordial relationship with Monthermer, even granting him two earldoms,<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\"/> there appears to have been a notable difference in Edward's treatment of Joan as compared to the treatment of the rest of her siblings. For instance, her father famously paid messengers substantially when they brought news of the birth of grandchildren, but did not do this upon the birth of Joan's daughter.<ref>Prestwich (1988), p.55</ref>\n\nJoan retained a fairly tight bond with her siblings. She and Monthermer both maintained a close relationship with her brother, Edward, which was maintained through letters. After Edward became estranged from his father and lost his royal seal, \"Joan offered to lend him her seal\".<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.53\">Prestwich (1988), p.53</ref>\n\n==Death==\nJoan died on 23 April 1307, at the manor of Clare in Suffolk.<ref name=\"Oxford, p.627\"/> The cause of her death remains unclear, though one popular theory is that she died during childbirth, a common cause of death at the time. While Joan's age in 1307 (about 35) and the chronology of her earlier pregnancies with Ralph de Monthermer suggest that this could well be the case, historians have not confirmed the cause of her death.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\">Higginbotham (2009), p.4</ref>\n\nLess than four months after her death, Joan's father died. Joan's widower, Ralph de Monthermer, lost the title of Earl of Gloucester soon after the deaths of his wife and father-in-law. The earldom of Gloucester was given to Joan's son from her first marriage, Gilbert, who was its rightful holder. Monthermer continued to hold a nominal earldom in Scotland, which had been conferred on him by Edward I, until his death.\n\nJoan's burial place has been the cause of some interest and debate. She is interred in the Augustinian priory at Clare, which had been founded by her first husband's ancestors and where many of them were also buried. Allegedly, in 1357, Joan's daughter, Elizabeth De Burgh, claimed to have \"inspected her mother's body and found the corpse to be intact\",<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\"/> which in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church is an indication of sanctity. This claim was only recorded in a fifteenth-century chronicle, however, and its details are uncertain, especially the statement that her corpse was in such a state of preservation that \"when her [[Breasts|paps]] [breasts] were pressed with hands, they rose up again.\" Some sources further claim that miracles took place at Joan's tomb,<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\"/> but no cause for her [[beatification]] or [[canonization]] has ever been introduced.\n\n==Joan in fiction==\nJoan of Acre makes an appearance in Virginia Henley's historical romance ''Infamous''. In the book, Joan, known as Joanna, is described as a promiscuous young princess, vain, shallow and spoiled. In the novel she is only given one daughter, when she historically had eight children. There is no evidence that supports this picture of Joan.<ref>Higginbotham (2009) p.4</ref>\n\nIn ''The Love Knot'' by Vanessa Alexander, Joan of Acre is an important character. The author portrays a completely different view of the princess from the one in Henley's novel. ''The Love Knot'' tells the story of the love affair between Ralph de Monthermer and Joan of Acre through the discovery of a series of letters the two had written to each other.<ref>Higginbotham, (2009) p.5</ref>\n\nBetween historians and novelists, Joan has appeared in various texts as either an independent and spirited woman or a spoiled brat. In ''Lives of the Princesses of England'' by Mary Anne Everett Green, Joan is portrayed as a \"giddy princess\" and neglectful mother.<ref>Green (1850), p. 342</ref> Many have agreed to this characterization; however, some authors think there is little evidence to support the assumption that Joan of Acre was a neglectful or uncaring mother.<ref>Higginbotham (2009), p.5</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Joan of Acre<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|2010|p=viii}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=532\u2013536}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|p=574}}; {{harvnb|O'Callaghan|1975|p=681}}; {{harvnb|Durand|Cl\u00e9mencet|Dantine|1818|p=435}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2004}}; {{harvnb|Parsons|2004}}</ref>\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.
