This team was created from the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)]]. One of these 10 players was Rachid Mekhloufi. Rachid, \"abandoned the French team preparing for the World Cup Finals in Sweden and instantly became an Algerian national symbol.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Alegi, Peter.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794698908|title=African Soccerscapes : How a Continent Changed the World's Game|date=2010|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-89680-472-2|location=Athens|oclc=794698908}}</ref> By the summer, more and more France-based Algerians came to join the original ten who fled. Rachid and his fellow teammates wanted to show the French people the serious war that was going on in Algeria. Many of them did not realize the extent of the war going on, and when ten high-caliber players lef, the French citizens had to wonder and figure out the exact reason why-especially when a few of the footballers were preparing for the World Cup Finals. At the same time, both Rachid and his teammates gave a sense of nationalism to the Citizens of Algeria during their efforts in the War. Mekhloufi (and many others) sacrificed their careers by playing in less competitive environments with lesser demanding training regimes. Mekhloufi is quoted saying \"I had lost the taste for effort, the necessary fight\" when asked about playing political football<ref name=\":0\" /> . The France-based footballers were a source of nationhood for Algerians, especially in times such as Algeria's 2-0 victory over West Germany in Algiers on January 1, 1964 where Mekhloufi and [[Mustapha Zitouni]] starred.\n\nAfter the disbanding of the FLN in 1962, Mekhloufi returned to play in France. Later on Mekhloufi would come back to manage and coach the Algeria National Football team.\n<br />\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/historique.php?id=MEKHLOUFI%20Rachid Profile]\n*{{Cite web |url=http://www.panthere-verte.com/asse-joueur-353-rachid-mekhloufi.html |title=Profile |access-date=2007-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042006/http://www.panthere-verte.com/asse-joueur-353-rachid-mekhloufi.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}\n*[http://www.anciensverts.com/lettre.php?lettre=m Short bio]\n*[http://www.afrik.com/article7733.html Another bio]\n*{{Cite web |url=http://www.pari-et-gagne.com/joueur/rachid_mekhloufi.html |title=Rachid Mekhloufi at pari-et-gagne.com |access-date=2011-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208225508/http://www.pari-et-gagne.com/joueur/rachid_mekhloufi.html |archive-date=2012-02-08 |url-status=bot: unknown }}\n*{{FootballDatabase.eu|37274}}\n\n{{SC Bastia managers}}\n{{Algeria Squad 1982 World Cup}}\n{{Algeria national football team managers}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mekhloufi, Rachid}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French footballers]]\n[[Category:France international footballers]]\n[[Category:Algerian footballers]]\n[[Category:Algeria international footballers]]\n[[Category:Algerian expatriate footballers]]\n[[Category:Dual internationalists (football)]]\n[[Category:Association football midfielders]]\n[[Category:Ligue 1 players]]\n[[Category:AS Saint-\u00c9tienne players]]\n[[Category:Servette FC players]]\n[[Category:SC Bastia players]]\n[[Category:French people of Algerian descent]]\n[[Category:Algerian football managers]]\n[[Category:SC Bastia managers]]\n[[Category:1982 FIFA World Cup managers]]\n[[Category:Footballers from S\u00e9tif]]\n[[Category:Algeria national football team managers]]\n[[Category:Algerian expatriate sportspeople in Tunisia]]\n[[Category:USM S\u00e9tif players]]\n[[Category:Algerian expatriate sportspeople in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Algerian expatriate sportspeople in France]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in France]]\n[[Category:FLN football team players]]\n", "text_old": "{{BLP sources|date=August 2012}}\n{{Infobox football biography\n| name= Rachid Mekhloufi\n| image = Rachid Mekhloufi (cropped).jpg\n| fullname = Rachid Mekhloufi\n| height = 1.68 m\n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1936|8|12}}\n| birth_place = [[S\u00e9tif]], [[French Algeria]]\n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| position = [[Striker (football)|Striker]]\n| youthyears1 = 19??\u20131954\n| youthclubs1 = [[USM S\u00e9tif]]\n| years1 = 1954\u20131958\n| years2 = 1961\u20131962\n| years3 = 1962\u20131968\n| years4 = 1968\u20131970\n| clubs1 = [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]\n| clubs2 = [[Servette FC]]\n| clubs3 = [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]\n| clubs4 = [[SC Bastia|Bastia]]\n| caps1 = 102\n| caps2 = 19\t\n| caps3 = 192\n| caps4 = 67\n| goals1 = 59\n| goals2 = 13\n| goals3 = 78\n| goals4 = 20\n| nationalyears1 = 1956\u20131957\n| nationalyears2 = 1958\u20131962\n| nationalyears3 = 1963\u20131969 <ref>http://dzfootball.free.fr/EN/Joueurs/fiche/Mekhloufi-Rachid.html</ref>\n| nationalteam1 = [[France national football team|France]]\n| nationalteam2 = [[FLN football team|FLN]]\n| nationalteam3 = [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]\n| nationalcaps1 = 4\n| nationalcaps2 = 40\n| nationalcaps3 = 10\n| nationalgoals1 = 0\n| nationalgoals2 = \n| nationalgoals3 = 5\n| manageryears1 = 1969\u20131970\n| manageryears2 = 1971\u20131972\n| manageryears3 = 1975\u20131979\n| manageryears4 = 1982\n| managerclubs1 = [[SC Bastia|Bastia]]\n| managerclubs2 = [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]\n| managerclubs3 = [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]\n| managerclubs4 = [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]]\n}}\n\n'''Rachid Mekhloufi''' ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f \u0645\u062e\u0644\u0648\u0641\u064a}}; born 12 August 1936 in [[S\u00e9tif]], [[French Algeria]]) is a [[France|French]]-[[Algeria]]n former [[football (soccer)|football]] [[striker (football)|striker]].

This team was created from the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)]]. One of these 10 players was Rachid Mekhloufi. Rachid, \"abandoned the French team preparing for the World Cup Finals in Sweden and instantly became an Algerian national symbol.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Alegi, Peter.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/794698908|title=African Soccerscapes : How a Continent Changed the World's Game|date=2010|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-89680-472-2|location=Athens|oclc=794698908}}</ref> By the summer, more and more France-based Algerians came to join the original ten who fled. Rachid and his fellow teammates wanted to show the French people the serious war that was going on in Algeria. Many of them did not realize the extent of the war going on, and when ten high-caliber players lef, the French citizens had to wonder and figure out the exact reason why-especially when a few of the footballers were preparing for the World Cup Finals. At the same time, both Rachid and his teammates gave a sense of nationalism to the Citizens of Algeria during their efforts in the War. Mekhloufi (and many others) sacrificed their careers by playing in less competitive environments with lesser demanding training regimes. Mekhloufi is quoted saying \"I had lost the taste for effort, the necessary fight\" when asked about playing political football<ref name=\":0\" /> . The France-based footballers were a source of nationhood for Algerians, especially in times such as Algeria's 2-0 victory over West Germany in Algiers on January 1, 1964 where Mekhloufi and [[Mustapha Zitouni]] starred.\n\nAfter the disbanding of the FLN in 1962, Mekhloufi returned to play in France. Later on Mekhloufi would come back to manage and coach the Algeria National Football team.\n<br />\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.fff.fr/servfff/historique/historique.php?id=MEKHLOUFI%20Rachid Profile]\n*{{Cite web |url=http://www.panthere-verte.com/asse-joueur-353-rachid-mekhloufi.html |title=Profile |access-date=2007-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042006/http://www.panthere-verte.com/asse-joueur-353-rachid-mekhloufi.html |archive-date=2007-09-28 |url-status=dead }}\n*[http://www.anciensverts.com/lettre.php?lettre=m Short bio]\n*[http://www.afrik.com/article7733.html Another bio]\n*{{Cite web |url=http://www.pari-et-gagne.com/joueur/rachid_mekhloufi.html |title=Rachid Mekhloufi at pari-et-gagne.com |access-date=2011-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208225508/http://www.pari-et-gagne.com/joueur/rachid_mekhloufi.html |archive-date=2012-02-08 |url-status=bot: unknown }}\n*{{FootballDatabase.eu|37274}}\n\n{{SC Bastia managers}}\n{{Algeria Squad 1982 World Cup}}\n{{Algeria national football team managers}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mekhloufi, Rachid}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French footballers]]\n[[Category:France international footballers]]\n[[Category:Algerian footballers]]\n[[Category:Algeria international footballers]]\n[[Category:Algerian expatriate footballers]]\n[[Category:Dual internationalists (football)]]\n[[Category:Association football midfielders]]\n[[Category:Ligue 1 players]]\n[[Category:AS Saint-\u00c9tienne players]]\n[[Category:Servette FC players]]\n[[Category:SC Bastia players]]\n[[Category:French people of Algerian descent]]\n[[Category:Algerian football managers]]\n[[Category:SC Bastia managers]]\n[[Category:1982 FIFA World Cup managers]]\n[[Category:Footballers from S\u00e9tif]]\n[[Category:Algeria national football team managers]]\n[[Category:Algerian expatriate sportspeople in Tunisia]]\n[[Category:USM S\u00e9tif players]]\n[[Category:Algerian expatriate sportspeople in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Algerian expatriate sportspeople in France]]\n[[Category:Expatriate footballers in France]]\n[[Category:FLN football team players]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachid_Mekhloufi"}

The band has released 17 studio albums, 6 of which have been certified gold. As of 2019, the band consists of lead vocalist [[Michael Tait]] (formerly of [[DC Talk]]), drummer and percussionist Duncan Phillips, keyboardist and bassist Jeff Frankenstein, and guitarist Jody Davis. In addition to performing music, the band has appeared in the films ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]],'' ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', and ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]''.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nThe band was formed in [[Mooloolaba]], Queensland, Australia in 1985<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribdem.com/features/christian-bands-to-rock-war-memorial-in-big-church-night/article_94aa0fdc-d69c-11e7-aa12-672f9a34a19a.html|title=Christian bands to rock War Memorial in Big Church Night Out|first=KELLY URBAN|last=KURBAN@TRIBDEM.COM|website=The Tribune-Democrat|accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> by two young men: [[Peter Furler]] and his school mate George Perdikis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2015/01/21/i-co-founded-one-of-the-most-popular-christian-rock-bands-ever-and-im-now-an-atheist/|title=I Co-Founded One of the Most Popular Christian Rock Bands Ever\u2026 and I'm Now An Atheist|work=Friendly Atheist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/newsboys-co-founder-im-now-an-atheist-richard-dawkins-had-an-influence-on-my-spiritual-journey.html|title=Newsboys Co-Founder: I'm Now an Atheist, Richard Dawkins' Had an Influence on My Spiritual Journey|website=The Christian Post|accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> Furler and Perdikis practised in a garage in on the Sunshine Coast, well known for being a \"surfer's paradise\". Two other teens were added soon after: Furler's best friend, John James, and bassist Sean Taylor. The band's original name was ''The News''. They changed it to The Newsboys to avoid conflict with the US-based band ''[[Huey Lewis and the News]]''. The band came to the United States in late 1987 after getting signed with Refuge Communications and released the album ''Read All About It'' in 1988 in the United States.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nAfter signing with Star Song Communications, they released two more albums in 1990 and 1991: ''[[Hell Is for Wimps]]'' and ''[[Boys Will Be Boyz]]'', with its first self-titled video. None of the band's first three albums garnered much attention, and the band's line-up changed with every release.\n\nIt wasn't until their 1992 album, ''[[Not Ashamed]]'' (containing a cover of the [[DeGarmo & Key]] song \"Boycott Hell\"), that the band gained notice in the Christian music scene with its second self-titled video that followed a year later. [[Steve Taylor]], a singer-songwriter and producer, began a partnership with the band, producing the band's record and writing most of the lyrics for their songs. Furler remained the band's primary songwriter and beginning with this album began sharing lead vocal duties with James and continued to do so until James' departure.\n\nIn 1994, amidst continued line-up changes (which included the addition of mainstays Jody Davis and Duncan Phillips), the band released ''[[Going Public (Newsboys album)|Going Public]]'', their fifth album and first real success. The record proved to be a watershed for the group, winning a 1995 [[Dove Award]] for \"Rock Album of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 1995 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020023036/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> It also produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Spirit Thing\", \"Real Good Thing\", \"Truth and Consequences\", and, most notably, \"[[Shine (Newsboys song)|Shine]]\". \"Shine\" won the 1995 Dove for \"Rock Recorded Song of the Year\". In 2006, [[CCM Magazine]] listed \"Shine\" in the top 10 in its ranking of the 100 Greatest Songs in Christian music.\n\nThe 1996 follow-up album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (Newsboys album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'' was recorded with an expanded line up with new additions bassist [[Phil Joel]] and keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein. The album produced three more pop No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Reality\", \"Let It Go\", and the title track, two rock No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Cup O' Tea\" and \"Breathe\", as well as fan favourite and concert staple \"Breakfast\". This album also won the group's third Dove, this time for \"Recorded Music Packaging of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 1997 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022843/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> This album spawned the Newsboys' first movie, ''[[Down Under the Big Top]]'' (1996), which was based on the song \"Reality\".\n\nIn late 1997, James announced he would be leaving the band to start a preaching ministry. In 2007, he revealed the actual reason was due to a drug and alcohol addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/print.php?Article_ID=25790 |title=John James: The Newsboys Ex-lead Singer Speaks About His Fall And Restoration |publisher=Crossrhythms.co.uk |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref> With his departure, Furler moved from drums to vocals and auditions were held for the now-vacant drum position. Eventually, Duncan Phillips, who had previously played keyboards and percussion for the band moved over to the drum kit. From 1998 to 2003, the band's line-up of Furler, bassist [[Phil Joel]], guitarist Jody Davis, keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein, and Phillips stayed constant.\n\nThe first post-James record, ''[[Step Up to the Microphone]]'', sold well and produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Entertaining Angels\", \"WooHoo\", \"Believe\", and the title track. It also spawned the Newsboys' live video, \"Live One Night In Pennsylvania\" a year later. \"Entertaining Angels\" won the 1999 Dove for \"Short Form Music Video of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 1999 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022952/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe band returned in 1999 with ''[[Love Liberty Disco]]'', the band's only album to significantly deviate from their pop rock sound. Instead, this particular album featured more of a disco sound. Still, it produced several hits, including the No.&nbsp;1 hits \"Beautiful Sound\" and \"Good Stuff\", as well as the title track. The LLD tour was significantly more popular than the album. This tour featured an inflatable arena, called the Air Dome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/newsboys/features/newsboys-love-libery-disco-tour-the-stats/ |title=Newsboys' Love Libery Disco Tour: The Stats |publisher=Today's Christian Music |accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Peter Furler|Furler]] co-founded [[Inpop Records]] with Wes Campbell as an independent contemporary Christian music record label.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:Newsboys at the 2001 National Lutheran Youth Gathering.jpg|thumb|Newsboys at the 2001 National Lutheran Youth Gathering, with Phil Joel in the foreground]]\nIn 2000, Newsboys headlined the annual, travelling [[Contemporary Christian Music|CCM]] concert, Festival Con Dios, with [[Audio Adrenaline]] and [[The O.C.

The band has released 17 studio albums, 6 of which have been certified gold. As of 2019, the band consists of lead vocalist [[Michael Tait]] (formerly of [[DC Talk]]), drummer and percussionist Duncan Phillips, keyboardist and bassist Jeff Frankenstein, and guitarist Jody Davis. In addition to performing music, the band has appeared in the films ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]],'' ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', and ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]''.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nThe band was formed in [[Mooloolaba]], Queensland, Australia in 1985<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribdem.com/features/christian-bands-to-rock-war-memorial-in-big-church-night/article_94aa0fdc-d69c-11e7-aa12-672f9a34a19a.html|title=Christian bands to rock War Memorial in Big Church Night Out|first=KELLY URBAN|last=KURBAN@TRIBDEM.COM|website=The Tribune-Democrat|accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> by two young men: [[Peter Furler]] and his school mate George Perdikis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2015/01/21/i-co-founded-one-of-the-most-popular-christian-rock-bands-ever-and-im-now-an-atheist/|title=I Co-Founded One of the Most Popular Christian Rock Bands Ever\u2026 and I'm Now An Atheist|work=Friendly Atheist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/newsboys-co-founder-im-now-an-atheist-richard-dawkins-had-an-influence-on-my-spiritual-journey.html|title=Newsboys Co-Founder: I'm Now an Atheist, Richard Dawkins' Had an Influence on My Spiritual Journey|website=The Christian Post|accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> Furler and Perdikis practised in a garage in on the Sunshine Coast, well known for being a \"surfer's paradise\". Two other teens were added soon after: Furler's best friend, John James, and bassist Sean Taylor. The band's original name was ''The News''. They changed it to The Newsboys to avoid conflict with the US-based band ''[[Huey Lewis and the News]]''. The band came to the United States in late 1987 after getting signed with Refuge Communications and released the album ''Read All About It'' in 1988 in the United States.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nAfter signing with Star Song Communications, they released two more albums in 1990 and 1991: ''[[Hell Is for Wimps]]'' and ''[[Boys Will Be Boyz]]'', with its first self-titled video. None of the band's first three albums garnered much attention, and the band's line-up changed with every release.\n\nIt wasn't until their 1992 album, ''[[Not Ashamed]]'' (containing a cover of the [[DeGarmo & Key]] song \"Boycott Hell\"), that the band gained notice in the Christian music scene with its second self-titled video that followed a year later. [[Steve Taylor]], a singer-songwriter and producer, began a partnership with the band, producing the band's record and writing most of the lyrics for their songs. Furler remained the band's primary songwriter and beginning with this album began sharing lead vocal duties with James and continued to do so until James' departure.\n\nIn 1994, amidst continued line-up changes (which included the addition of mainstays Jody Davis and Duncan Phillips), the band released ''[[Going Public (Newsboys album)|Going Public]]'', their fifth album and first real success. The record proved to be a watershed for the group, winning a 1995 [[Dove Award]] for \"Rock Album of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 1995 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020023036/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> It also produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Spirit Thing\", \"Real Good Thing\", \"Truth and Consequences\", and, most notably, \"[[Shine (Newsboys song)|Shine]]\". \"Shine\" won the 1995 Dove for \"Rock Recorded Song of the Year\". In 2006, [[CCM Magazine]] listed \"Shine\" in the top 10 in its ranking of the 100 Greatest Songs in Christian music.\n\nThe 1996 follow-up album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (Newsboys album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'' was recorded with an expanded line up with new additions bassist [[Phil Joel]] and keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein. The album produced three more pop No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Reality\", \"Let It Go\", and the title track, two rock No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Cup O' Tea\" and \"Breathe\", as well as fan favourite and concert staple \"Breakfast\". This album also won the group's third Dove, this time for \"Recorded Music Packaging of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 1997 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022843/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> This album spawned the Newsboys' first movie, ''[[Down Under the Big Top]]'' (1996), which was based on the song \"Reality\".\n\nIn late 1997, James announced he would be leaving the band to start a preaching ministry. In 2007, he revealed the actual reason was due to a drug and alcohol addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/print.php?Article_ID=25790 |title=John James: The Newsboys Ex-lead Singer Speaks About His Fall And Restoration |publisher=Crossrhythms.co.uk |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref> With his departure, Furler moved from drums to vocals and auditions were held for the now-vacant drum position. Eventually, Duncan Phillips, who had previously played keyboards and percussion for the band moved over to the drum kit. From 1998 to 2003, the band's line-up of Furler, bassist [[Phil Joel]], guitarist Jody Davis, keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein, and Phillips stayed constant.\n\nThe first post-James record, ''[[Step Up to the Microphone]]'', sold well and produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Entertaining Angels\", \"WooHoo\", \"Believe\", and the title track. It also spawned the Newsboys' live video, \"Live One Night In Pennsylvania\" a year later. \"Entertaining Angels\" won the 1999 Dove for \"Short Form Music Video of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 1999 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022952/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe band returned in 1999 with ''[[Love Liberty Disco]]'', the band's only album to significantly deviate from their pop rock sound. Instead, this particular album featured more of a disco sound. Still, it produced several hits, including the No.&nbsp;1 hits \"Beautiful Sound\" and \"Good Stuff\", as well as the title track. The LLD tour was significantly more popular than the album. This tour featured an inflatable arena, called the Air Dome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/newsboys/features/newsboys-love-libery-disco-tour-the-stats/ |title=Newsboys' Love Libery Disco Tour: The Stats |publisher=Today's Christian Music |accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Peter Furler|Furler]] co-founded [[Inpop Records]] with Wes Campbell as an independent contemporary Christian music record label.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:Newsboys at the 2001 National Lutheran Youth Gathering.jpg|thumb|Newsboys at the 2001 National Lutheran Youth Gathering, with Phil Joel in the foreground]]\nIn 2000, Newsboys headlined the annual, travelling [[Contemporary Christian Music|CCM]] concert, Festival Con Dios, with [[Audio Adrenaline]] and [[The O.C. Supertones]]. That same year, Newsboys released a greatest hits compilation, ''[[Shine: The Hits]]'', which did not include any songs from the ''Love Liberty Disco'' album, but included four new songs, two of which (\"Joy\" and \"Who?\") went to No.&nbsp;1. After this album, the band did not release any new material until the 2002 release of ''[[Thrive (Newsboys album)|Thrive]]'', a record that produced two No.&nbsp;1 singles: \"Million Pieces (Kissin' Your Cares Goodbye)\" and the praise and worship-driven \"It Is You\", which proved to be the biggest hit of their career up to that point also with its video, ''Thrive: From The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame''. Also in 2002, The Newsboys recorded the track \"In the Belly of the Whale\" for the end credits of the 2002 movie ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]''.\n\nAfter the success of \"It Is You\", the Newsboys then followed with two praise and worship albums: ''[[Adoration: The Worship Album]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Devotion (Newsboys album)|Devotion]]'' in 2004. Late in 2003, Davis departed and was replaced by [[Bryan Olesen]] on guitar. In 2005, The Newsboys co-authored a book of devotions with Jim Laffoon entitled ''Our Daily Blog'' which was published by Inspiro and released on 1 November.<ref>{{cite book|title=Our Daily Blog: Devotions by Pastor Jim Laffoon: Books: Jim Laffoon, Newsboys |date= |id={{ASIN|0310811694|country=uk}} }}</ref> They also recorded their Creation 2005 set for a live DVD to be released with their upcoming album.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 2006, Oleson left the band to focus on his own band [[VOTA|Casting Pearls]] and was replaced by [[Paul Colman]], formerly of [[Paul Colman Trio]].\n\nMore radio hits came in 2006 with a live version of \"I Am Free\" (originally written by Jon Egan of the [[Desperation Band]]), and \"Wherever We Go\". On 31 October 2006, The Newsboys released a pop/rock record entitled ''[[Go (Newsboys album)|GO]]''.

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed. Composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] insisted his credit be removed when, like the film itself, his score was heavily edited by the studio.\n\nEven in the released version, ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' is often regarded as among [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], a distinction it shares with Welles' first film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/momentsindx.html |title=100 Greatest Films |publisher=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Tim|last=Dirks|url=http://www.filmsite.org/magn.html |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) review |website=[[Filmsite.org]] |accessdate=May 20, 2009}}</ref> The film was nominated for four [[15th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and it was added to the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1991.\n\n==Plot==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = The-Magnificent-Ambersons-1.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores Costello]], [[Don Dillaway]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], and [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]]\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-7.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Joseph Cotten, [[Anne Baxter]], and [[Tim Holt]]\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-2.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = Dolores Costello, Agnes Moorehead, Anne Baxter, Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n<!-- Image 4 -->\n| image4    =The-Magnificent-Ambersons-5.jpg\n| alt4      =\n| caption4  = Richard Bennett, Agnes Moorehead, Tim Holt, and Ray Collins\n}}\n[[File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|upright=1.0|[[:File:The Magnificent Ambersons theatrical trailer (1942).webm|''The Magnificent Ambersons'' trailer]]]]\n\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe Ambersons are by far the wealthiest family in the midwestern city of [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], at the beginning of the 20th century. Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles's directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

It's a tremendous preparation for the boardinghouse ... and the terrible walk of George Minafer when he gets his comeuppance. And without that, there wasn't any plot.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles' directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

It's a tremendous preparation for the boardinghouse ... and the terrible walk of George Minafer when he gets his comeuppance. And without that, there wasn't any plot.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

As he speaks each technical credit, a machine is shown performing that function.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> Welles reads his own credit \u2014 \"My name is Orson Welles\" \u2014 over top of an image of a microphone which then recedes into the distance.<ref>The footage of the microphone is taken from the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] in which Welles similarly narrated the key acting credits for the film.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-magnificent-ambersons/ |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)  |publisher=[[Art of the Title]] |accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n\"I got a lot of hell because of that,\" Welles later said of his verbal sign-off. \"People think it's egotistic. The truth is, I was just speaking to a public who knew me from [[The Mercury Theatre on the Air|the radio]] in a way they were used to hearing on our shows.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical.

It has also been introduced to [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Nicaragua]], growing at {{convert|1200|-|3000|m|ft}} altitude.\n\nThe scientific name ''lusitanica'' (of [[Portugal]]) refers to its very early cultivation there, with plants imported from Mexico to the monastery at [[Bu\u00e7aco]], near [[Coimbra]] in Portugal in about 1634; these trees were already over 130 years old when the species was botanically described by [[Philip Miller|Miller]] in 1768.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Description==\n''Cupressus lusitanica'' is an [[evergreen]] [[conifer]] tree with a conic to ovoid-conic crown, growing to 40 m tall. The foliage grows in dense sprays, dark green to somewhat yellow-green in colour. The leaves are scale-like, 2\u20135&nbsp;mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. The seed [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose to oblong, 10\u201320&nbsp;mm long, with four to 10 scales, green at first, maturing brown or grey-brown about 25 months after pollination.\n\nThe cones may either open at maturity to release the seeds, or remain closed for several years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a [[wildfire]], allowing the [[seed]]s to colonise the bare ground exposed by the fire. The male cones are 3\u20134 mm long, and release pollen in late Winter / Early Spring (February\u2013March in the northern hemisphere). In most of its natural environment the rainfall occurs with more quantity in summer.\n\n===Varieties===\nThere are two [[variety (biology)|varieties]], treated as distinct species by some botanists:\n* '''''Cupressus lusitanica'' var. ''lusitanica''''' (syn. ''C. lindleyi'') - '''Mexican cypress''' - Foliage in three-dimensional sprays, with small shoots in two planes. Occurs in lower rainfall areas. ([[Least concern]] species)\n* '''''Cupressus lusitanica'' var. ''benthamii''''' (syn. ''C. benthamii'') - '''Bentham's cypress''' -  Foliage in flattened sprays, with small shoots all in one plane. Occurs in higher rainfall areas. ([[Near Threatened]] species)\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nFast-growing and drought tolerant, but only slightly frost tolerant, ''Cupressus lusitanica'' has been introduced from Mexico's provenances to different parts of the world. It is widely cultivated, both as an [[ornamental tree]] and for [[timber]] production, in warm, temperate and subtropical regions around the world. Trees have not been selected for cultivation from northern Mexico populations, which have a heavy drought endurance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Felger |first1=Richard S. |last2=Johnson |first2=Matthew B. |last3=Wilson |first3=Michael F. |date=2001 |title=The trees of Sonora, Mexico |place=New York<!--sic --> |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-512891-5}}</ref>\n\n===Locations===\nIts cultivation and subsequent [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalisation]] in parts of southern [[Asia]] has caused a degree of confusion with native ''Cupressus'' species in that region; plants sold by nurseries under the names of Asian species such as ''[[Cupressus torulosa]]'' often prove to be this species.\nIt has been planted widely for commercial production: at high altitudes in [[Colombia]] (3300 m), [[Bolivia]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[South Africa]], and near sea level throughout [[New Zealand]]. In [[Colombia]] trees are planted to form [[windbreak]] hedges and for preventing soil erosion on slopes. It has been planted by [[Tanzania]]n mountain farmers for soil preserving and commercial use  since 1990s.<ref>UEDA Gen, ''The Regional System of the Mountain People: Place, Household, and the Communal in Rural Tanzania'' (Japanese language), Tohoku University Press, 2011, Sendai, Japan, pp.348 - 351.
