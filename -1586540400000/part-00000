Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].  She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Phoenix, [[Calvin Charles Gallery]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and \"The Gallery\" in [[Cabo

Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].  She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Phoenix, [[Calvin Charles Gallery]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and \"The Gallery\" in [[Cabo

According to Sigma Lambda Gamma's national constitution, they believe that a multicultural experience during the college years enhances each member's ability to function in a pluralistic society.  They do not discriminate on the basis of age, race, national origin, religious preference, sexual orientation or disability. Many chapters even possess transgender and nonbinary members. As a result, Sigma Lambda Gamma has a diverse membership and encourage their members to celebrate the diverse backgrounds of all the members of the sorority,<ref name=\"About \u2013 \"/> and currently boasts over 110 nationalities.<ref name=\"SLG Today\"/>\n\nChapters are categorized into 11 regions.

According to Sigma Lambda Gamma's national constitution, they believe that a multicultural experience during the college years enhances each member\u2019s ability to function in a pluralistic society.  They do not discriminate on the basis of age, race, national origin, religious preference, sexual orientation or disability. Many chapters even possess transgender and nonbinary members.

Contested at 160 laps on the 2.5 mile (4.023 km) speedway, it was the 20th race of the [[1999 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] season. [[Dale Jarrett]] of [[Robert Yates Racing]] won the race.\n\n==Background==\nThe '''Indianapolis Motor Speedway''', located in [[Speedway, Indiana]], (an [[enclave]] suburb of [[Indianapolis]]) in the United States, is the home of the [[Indianapolis 500]] and the [[Brickyard 400]]. It is located on the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, approximately {{convert|6|mi|km|0|spell=in}} west of [[Downtown Indianapolis]]. It is a four-turn rectangular-oval track that is {{convert|2.5|mi|3}} long. The track's turns are [[Banked turn|banked]] at 9 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, has no banking. The back stretch, opposite of the front, also has a zero degree banking. The racetrack has seats for more than 250,000 spectators.

A caution comes out with 17 laps to go, allowing the leaders to pit, foiling Labonte's chances to steal the win. As the leaders pitted, in an unexpected move, [[Dale Jarrett]] took on only two tires. [[Jeff Burton]] saw this and pulled away after taking only two tires. His pit crew, however, had already tried to loosen the lug nuts on the left side.

Contested at 160 laps on the 2.5 mile (4.023 km) speedway, it was the 20th race of the [[1999 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] season. [[Dale Jarrett]] of [[Robert Yates Racing]] won the race.\n\n==Background==\nThe '''Indianapolis Motor Speedway''', located in [[Speedway, Indiana]], (an [[enclave]] suburb of [[Indianapolis]]) in the United States, is the home of the [[Indianapolis 500]] and the [[Brickyard 400]]. It is located on the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, approximately {{convert|6|mi|km|0|spell=in}} west of [[Downtown Indianapolis]]. It is a four-turn rectangular-oval track that is {{convert|2.5|mi|3}} long. The track's turns are [[Banked turn|banked]] at 9 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, has no banking. The back stretch, opposite of the front, also has a zero degree banking. The racetrack has seats for more than 250,000 spectators. [[Jeff Gordon]] was the race's defending champion.<ref>{{cite news|last=Berres|first=Mike|title=Brickyard: Same, but different|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19990805&id=sg4iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MqYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5312,2983165&hl=en|work=[[Reading Eagle]]|location=[[Reading, Pennsylvania]]|date=August 5, 1999|accessdate=March 17, 2016|page=C4}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nLate in the race, [[Dale Jarrett]] leads, but fourth-place [[Bobby Labonte]] is the only car in the top five that can go the distance without pitting for fuel. A caution comes out with 17 laps to go, allowing the leaders to pit, foiling Labonte's chances to steal the win. As the leaders pitted, in an unexpected move, [[Dale Jarrett]] took on only two tires. [[Jeff Burton]] saw this and pulled away after taking only two tires. His pit crew, however, had already tried to loosen the lug nuts on the left side. Jarrett led the rest of the way, becomes the second two-time winner, and erases his heartbreak from 1998.\n\n==Top 10 results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

The series takes place in a fictional universe that exists as a parallel world where vast numbers of humans as well as species known as sentenoids and demonoids fight using weapons, magic and evil artifacts known as Dark Bring (Shadow Stone in the anime's English dub). One of the most primary users of the artifact known as Dark Bring is an evil terrorist organization known as Demon Card (Shadow Guard in the anime's English dub) which plans to use it to take over the world and bring it into darkness.\n\nThe main character Haru Glory, is chosen by the holy artifact known as Rave to wield the Ten Powers and go on a quest with the strange dog like creature known as Plue to find the other four remaining Rave stones and put an end to the usage of Dark Bring and bring peace to the world. In his travel, fate brings him to ally himself with a girl that lost her memories and believes she is named Elie and is unaware that she has a strong involvement with the Rave stones. Together on their quest, they gain allies known as the Rave Warriors which consist of the thief that can manipulate silver known as Hamrio Mugika, a cartographer which is the strange blue creature known as Griffon Katou, Let Dahaka and Julia who are both martial artists and members of a species from the mystic realm known as the Dragon Race, Ruby, a rich penguin-like sentenoid, and Belnika, a kind sorceress.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and design==\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\nWhen making the series Mashima wants to make justice prevail but also make readers understand the villains' reasons to fight the main character in order to make them more complex characters.<ref name=\"anninter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2008-08-17/hiro-mashima|title=Interview: Hiro Mashima|author=Santos, Carlo|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=August 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Protagonists==\nThe main characters are known as the ''Rave Warriors''.\n\n===Haru Glory===\n{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Seki]]|[[Yuri Lowenthal]]<ref name=\"ep 1 credits\">{{cite episode | series=Rave Master | serieslink=Rave Master | time=Closing credits, English language cast}}</ref>}}\n\n{{Nihongo|Haru Glory|\u30cf\u30eb\u30fb\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc|Haru Gur\u014dr\u012b}} is the main protagonist of the series and the current Rave Master, never giving up in a fight and willing to protect others in spite of the circumstances. Born on Garage Island, Haru was left in the care of his older sister after their mother died some time after their father left to find the Rave Stones. By chance, Haru fished Plue out of the ocean and met the previous Rave Master Shiba, who realizes the youth to be his successor. After realizing the threat that the Demon Card organization pose to the world, Haru promises Shiba that he will find the Rave Stone and stop the Demon Card's evil with Plue by his side. Along the way, he is joined by allies, each having their own goals, yet they were bound together thanks to him and helping each other along the way. He is very friendly and has a lot of energy. He is very protective of [[Elie (Rave)|Elie]], and does anything he can to ensure her safety. Haru also shows to develop a romantic interest in Elie progressively throughout the series, as it also becomes apparent in later chapters that among Haru's greatest motivations to keep fighting onward is in fact for Elie. At the end of the [[manga]], they marry and then had a son.\n\nAs the Rave Master, Haru carries a special sword called the ''Ten Commandments'' or TCM, (or the ''[[Ten Powers]]'' in the English dub) that can change from its ''Eisenmeteor'' form to nine other forms once the Rave Stones are embedded into it. During the finale, it was found that Haru cannot use the last sword because the sword was originally forged for Shiba. This encourages Musica to forge Haru his own sword, where it becomes the tenth sword called ''Ravelt'', and it later becomes the default form. His old sword was destroyed by Galein Musica to test the new sword.\n\n===Elie===\n{{Nihongo|Elie|\u30a8\u30ea\u30fc|Er\u012b}} is a mysterious girl with amnesia, who uses tonfa-blasters as her main weapon of choice. After being saved by Haru in Georco, she travels with him in order to regain her memory. A lively, bubbly girl, she has a hot temper and an undying love for casinos, often procuring funds for the group through this method. It is later revealed that Elie harnesses the power of Etherion, an extremely destructive magic that transcends space and time. Etherion was also used by  {{Nihongo|Resha Valentine|\u30ea\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30f3|R\u012bsha Barentain}}, an acclaimed dancer from 50 years prior who gave her life in order to create the Rave stones, and whom Elie is identical to. After traveling to the past, Elie discovers that she is in fact Resha Valentine, and had actually faked her death by encasing herself in magic to later awaken in the future. Following this revelation, Elie recovers Resha\u2019s old staff and equips it in battle, which grants her the ability to summon and destroy Endless. Over the course of the story, Elie starts to develop romantic feelings for Haru, just as Haru does for her; this led to them getting married and the birth of their son at the end of the series. In the [[anime]], she is voiced by [[Ayako Kawasumi]] in Japanese and [[Michelle Ruff]] in English.<ref name=\"ep 1 credits\"/> Elie was ranked as #20 in a survey conducted by Newtype Japan for Favorite Anime Heroine in 2002.<ref>Newtype USA, Vol 2 - Issue 4. April 2003.</ref>\n\n===Plue===\n{{voiced by|[[Yukiji]] (Rave), [[Saori Goto]] (Fairy Tail)|[[Mona Marshall]]<ref name=\"ep 1 credits\"/> (Rave), Majken Bullard (Fairy Tail, Season 1), [[Monica Rial]] (Fairy Tail, Season 2)}}\n\nDespite his strange appearance, resembling a shivering snowman with a carrot nose despite being called a dog, {{Nihongo|Plue|\u30d7\u30eb\u30fc|Pur\u016b}} is the Rave Bearer and is able to sense the presence of the other Rave Stones. Plue's nose also has the ability to destroy Dark Bring. Plue is quite fond of sweets, especially lollipops, yet hates pudding. He also likes wine, and spiders. He has the ability to use the Rave of Combat, which powers himself and Haru up. It is a running gag in the manga that no one is entirely sure what Plue is or even whether he is male. Most people think of him as a dinosaur, while Elie refers to him as a bug. Haru first names him \"Sabutaro\" which Let prefers to call him.\n\nIn the ''[[Fairy Tail]]'' series, Plue is revised as a {{Nihongo4|[[Canis Minor|Nikora]]|\u30cb\u30b3\u30e9|Nikora}} celestial spirit who serves as a pet for [[Lucy Heartfilia]] but prefers to be summoned on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. In chapter 71 of ''[[Fairy Tail]]'', [[Happy (manga character)|Happy]] pulls a prank on Lucy by speaking as if he were Plue. He says he is a servant of a great hero with a sacred stone, referring to Haru. Plue has appeared in other works. In chapter 22 of ''[[Air Gear]]'', Ikki pretends to be Plue, even growing the nose. In ''[[Pastel (manga)|Pastel]]'', Mugi gives Yuu a Plue doll.<ref>\n{{cite book\n   | first= Toshihiko |last=Kobayashi\n   | authorlink = Toshihiko Kobayashi\n   | date = February 2003\n   | isbn = 4-06-363206-7\n   | script-title=ja:\u3071\u3059\u3066\u308b (3)\n   | language = Japanese\n   }}  and {{cite book\n   | date = June 2006\n   | isbn = 0-345-48689-7\n   | title = Back to School\n   | chapter = Miracle 15: Women...\n   }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n   | first= Toshihiko |last=Kobayashi\n   | authorlink = Toshihiko Kobayashi\n   | date = July 2003\n   | isbn = 4-06-363264-4\n   | script-title=ja:\u3071\u3059\u3066\u308b (5)\n   |trans-title=Pastel (5)\n   | publisher = [[Kodansha]]\n   | language = Japanese\n   }}  and {{cite book\n   | date = December 2006\n   | isbn = 978-0-345-49324-8\n   | title = Smooch!\n   | chapter = Miracle 39: Happy Birthday to Yuu!\n   | publisher = [[Del Rey Manga]]\n   }}</ref>\n\n===Hamrio Musica===\n{{Nihongo|Hamrio Musica|\u30cf\u30e0\u30ea\u30aa\u30fb\u30e0\u30b8\u30ab|Hamurio Mujika|Hedara Musica in the anime's English dub}} is the leader of a band of thieves named Silver-Rhythm. Being a \"Silver-Claimer\", he can manipulate silver into any form and weapon he wants it to be, making him a weapon master. He uses the silver skull around his neck to manipulate silver to a weapon of his choice. The silver skull is fused with Reina's bracelet after she dies and there he gains the weapon \"Silver Ray\". He is Haru's good and strongest friend. He later forges Haru the holy sword \"Ravelt\", derived from \"Rave\" and \"Welt\", the German word for world.\n\nWhen he was young, Musica's family was wiped out by Lance the \"Beast Sword\" of Demon Card with a sword forged by his grandfather, Galein Musica. He was then taken in by Rize, a silver-claimer, who raised him and taught him the ways of silver-claiming. On Rize's deathbed, he asked Musica to find Silver Ray and destroy it, to which Musica agreed. Musica later discovered that the Oni Fortress River Saly was in fact the Silver Ray in disguise. After a battle with the oni leader Ogre, he managed to destroy the Silver Ray with the help of Reina. The weapon was then reborn as an artifact, which Reina called \"The Ocean-Rending spear, Silver Ray\". Musica now carries both the Silver Ray and Reina's silver, as they have fused with his own. In the anime, he is voiced by [[Showtaro Morikubo]] in Japanese and [[Doug Erholtz]] in English\n\n===Griff===\n{{Nihongo|Griffon Kato|\u30b0\u30ea\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3 \u52a0\u85e4|Gurifon Kat\u014d}}, more commonly called {{Nihongo|Griff|\u30b0\u30ea\u30d5|Gurifu}} for short, is a strange small blue creature who mostly praises Plue and calls him 'Master Plue'. Griff has limited shape-shifting abilities, such as inflating portions of his body and elongating his limbs. He is also a voyeuristic character and can be often seen spying on Elie. He is the [[Cartography|cartographer]] of the group. He has a strange horse-like creature named {{Nihongo|Tanchimo|\u30bf\u30f3\u30c1\u30e2}} which he rides and is always seen constantly moving its head side to side in a rapid form.\n\nA Griff-like character and a female Griff-like character can be seen in ''Fairy Tail'' Chapter 1, page 20 and Chapter 102, page 02. In the anime, he is voiced by [[Katsuya Shiga]] in Japanese and [[Tom Kenny]] in English.\n\n===Let Dahaka===\n{{Nihongo|Let Dahaka|\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c0\u30cf\u30fc\u30ab|Retto Dah\u0101ka}} is a member of the Dragon Race, a race of dragon people who reside in the Mystic Realm. When Let was first introduced, he was an evil warrior who worked for Demon Card as a guardian for King. He only wanted to fight until Haru defeated him and showed him the path of justice. His initial appearance in the story is of a human with a lizard like face. In the fight against Jegan, he performs Dragon trial and takes the appearance of a human. Soon after, he joined Haru in hope of bringing peace to the world. He uses Dragon Roar of the Gods to defeat Jegan, which consumes one's life in return for the power. He manages to defeat Jegan and turn Julia back to normal using a potion given by Alice. He is saved by Julia who kisses him with the potion in her mouth. In chapter 281, he is revealed to be the king of the Dragon Race, {{Nihongo|Jaava Let Dahaka|\u30b8\u30e3\u30f4\u30a1\u30fb\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c0\u30cf\u30fc\u30ab|Java Retto Dah\u0101ka}}. During the fight against the Demon Card member Uta, Let turns into this form in order to kill him, but he dies in the process. He is revived by the Memories of the Star at the end. In the anime, he is voiced by [[Takehiro Murozono]] in Japanese and [[Doug Stone (voice actor)|Doug Stone]] in English.\n\n===Ruby===\n{{Nihongo|Ruby|\u30eb\u30d3\u30fc|Rub\u012b}} is a pink penguin sentinoid who owns a massive floating casino. Ruby likes to use his wealth to buy rare treasures. When he learns Doryu is using his cash for evil ends, he is almost killed by Doryu, but Haru saves him, and he decides to join his side. He is the only person to know who would be the third Rave Master if Haru dies. Ruby also has a tendency to blab out plans that the Rave Warriors have decided on during battle, making them entirely useless. He recently learned how to use \"Wind\" magic from the bell given to him by his father, {{Nihongo|Pawl|\u30d1\u30fc\u30eb|P\u0101ru|\"Pearl\"}}. The bell was actually named \"the Holy Bell\" and it was a weapon used by Dalmatian of the Knights of the Blue Sky. It can turn into a magic sword, and use \"Magic Reflection\", \"Twister\", and \"Air Ball\" (from the videogame). In Chapter 75 the characters of Fairy Tail go to casino owned by Ruby. In the anime, he is voiced by [[Yukiji]] in Japanese and [[Bob Glouberman]] in English.\n\n===Julia===\n{{Nihongo|Julia|\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea\u30a2|Juria}} is Let's girlfriend and fellow member of the Dragon Race. Having failed to pass the dragon trial, Julia was transformed into a dragon and tamed by Jegan of the Oracion Seis. She is saved by Let and turned back to normal using a potion given by Alice. Acting as a sisterly figure to the Rave Warriors, Julia is shown to be rowdy, violent, and somewhat of an exhibitionist. Her appearance gradually changes since her debut after Let saved her, from having a short hair to long wavy hair. She is voiced by [[Kyoko Namikawa]] in Japanese.\n\n===Belnika===\n{{Nihongo|Belnika|\u30d9\u30eb\u30cb\u30ab|Berunika}} is a kind girl with a shy personality. She was experimented on in an attempt to instill the power of Etherion within her. Having initially aligned herself with Blue Guardian, she was manipulated by Hardner into believing his plan would eliminate Endless. After discovering Hardner's true intentions, Belnika joins the Rave Warriors. However, it is later revealed that she never attained the power of Etherion, although she does possess a vast amount of magical power. She has the power to heal and also to negate any magic around her. She heals Haru's arm which was in a bad condition due to the effects of Sacrifar. Belnika is intensely loyal to Haru, who she seems to harbor feelings for, although she does not disrupt his relationship with Elie. She later dies from over use of magic during the fight against the Demon Card member, Jiero. She eventually comes back to life due to the Memories of the Star.\n\n==Supporting Characters==\n===Kingdom of Symphonia===\n====Shiba Roses====\n{{Nihongo|Shiba Roses|\u30b7\u30d0\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30bc\u30b9|Shiba R\u014dzesu}} is the first Rave Master. He acknowledged Haru as the second Rave Master when Rave chose Haru and tasked Haru with the responsibility of bringing peace to the world by gathering all the Raves. In his battle to against Haru in his final test to prove if he is a worthy Rave Master, Shiba was given an elixir so he could revert to his younger self to when he was the Rave Master himself. Only being able to sustain his younger body for 15 minutes, Shiba fought knowing that if he drank the elixir, he would die. Shiba, however, died happy in Elie's arms having recognized her as Resha, his \"lost\" and only love. In the battle, Shiba said that he has devoted himself for the world for over 50 years which much to Haru amazement who has only become the Rave Master for 2 years. In his time as Rave Master, he is known as the ''Sword Saint'' for his mastery of the sword. He is the original wielder and true master of the TCM, hence he could use all ten swords, including the self-harming ninth sword without succumbing to it and original tenth sword ''Star Raver'', while Haru could not even master the ninth and needed a new sword as his tenth sword.\n\nShiba is voiced by [[Tomomicho Nishimura]] in the anime, with [[Kouichi Toochika]] portraying a younger Shiba. [[Alan Shearman]] voices Shiba in the English dub, while [[Steven Blum]] portrays his younger self.\n\n====Galein Musica====\n{{Nihongo|Galein Musica|\u30ac\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30e0\u30b8\u30ab|Garein Mujika|\"Garein Musica\" in English dub}} is Hamrio Musica's grandfather and the blacksmith who created the TCM during Symphonia\u2019s wars.

He is later tortured to death due to the curse placed on him by Shakuma.\n\n====Knights of the Blue Sky====\nThe {{Nihongo|Knights of the Blue Sky|\u84bc\u5929\u56db\u6226\u58eb|S\u014dten Yosenshi}} are the four strongest fighters of Symphonia that assisted Shiba during the war and died. Later they became the Guardians of the Rave stones. {{Nihongo|Deerhound|\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30cf\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9|Diahaundo}} is a huge brute of a warrior who seems to laugh at everything and uses a giant battle axe. After his death he transformed into a bear, guarding the Rave of Knowledge and the graveyard of the warriors who fought for Symphonia. {{Nihongo|Clea Maltese|\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fb\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30fc\u30ba|Kurea Maruch\u012bsu}} is a dark-skinned female warrior who uses two giant knives.

After death he borrowed the body of a walrus and became the guardian of the Rave of Destiny. He was also the original owner of the sword Holy Bell which is owned by Ruby in the present. {{Nihongo|Alpine Spaniel|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d1\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30b9\u30d1\u30cb\u30a8\u30eb|Arupain Supanieru}} is the leader of the Knights of the Blue Sky and the only one of the four who survived the war and Overdrive. He was the one that kept the other knights' souls in the borrowed bodies of animals. He guards the Rave of Truth and was the steward for Haru's final test to be the true Rave Master. He is also the most charismatic and strongest of the four and his weapon of choice is a spear. All four of the knights surnames seems to be inspired by dog breeds.\n\n===Mildian===\nThe citizens of {{Nihongo|Mildian|\u30df\u30eb\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30f3|Mirudian}} are sorcerers tasked with the protection of time.\n\n====Sieg Hart====\n{{Nihongo|Sieg Hart|\u30b8\u30fc\u30af\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8|J\u012bku Haruto}} is a 27-year-old elemental master and most powerful sorcerer from Mildian. Obsessed with upholding the time stream, he initially infiltrated Demon Card with the intention of eliminating King, and later attempts to kill Elie in order to erase the threat of Etherion. However, he later realizes that Elie\u2019s power can save the world, and aligns himself with the Rave Warriors in order to protect her. After he, Haru, and Elie are sent back 50 years in time, Sieg remains in the past in order to return the two to the present. He dies guarding Resha Valentine\u2019s grave, with Haru and Elie identifying his skeleton five decades later. Sieg Hart is voiced by [[Masami Kikuchi]] in the anime, and by Crispin Freeman in the English dub.\n\nIn Mashima's later work, ''[[Fairy Tail]]'', Sieg Hart's character design was reused as the character [[List of Fairy Tail characters#Jellal Fernandez|Jellal Fernandez]], who was first introduced under the alias of Siegrain being a reference to Sieg Hart.\n\n====Miltz====\n{{Nihongo|Miltz|\u30df\u30eb\u30c4|Mirutsu}} is the village head of Mildian, with power considered second only to Sieg Hart. Widely respected by the citizens of Mildian, Miltz initially ran the village as a dictatorship, strictly punishing those who disobeyed the laws of time. He aligned himself with Haja of the Oracion Seis in order to obtain Star Memory, turning the village against Sieg as a result of his failure to eliminate Elie. However, after learning of Haja\u2019s loyalty to Demon Card, Miltz assists Sieg in the battle against him, later reforming Mildian values at Niebel\u2019s urging.\n\n====Niebel====\n{{Nihongo|Niebel|\u30cb\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb|N\u012bberu}} is a young mage from the village of Mildian who idolizes Sieg Hart. He is first introduced as an adolescent sorcerer specializing in illusion magic, and has stated that he was not born in Mildian. Prior to his debut, Niebel had protested Miltz\u2019s morally questionable actions, and as a result was a wanted fugitive until the years leading up to Sieg\u2019s return. He is later reaccepted into the village after the battle with Haja. It is stated by Sieg that Niebel has the potential to surpass his abilities. This theoretical power is shown during the battle against Jiero, when he uses a spell that gives him unlimited magical power, but rapidly ages him. This stalls Jiero long enough for Julia to kill her, but results in his death from old age. He is later revived by the Memories in the Star.\n\n===Garage Island===\n====Gale Glory====\n{{Nihongo|Gale Symphonia Glory VI|\u30b2\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30b7\u30f3\u30d5\u30a9\u30cb\u30a2\u30fb\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u516d\u4e16|Geiru Shinfonia Gur\u014dr\u012b Rokusei}} is the father of Haru and Cattleya. He is related to the first king of Symphonia, Gale Symphonia Glory I, who was his great-grandfather. Gale had an enchanted sword called the Azure Sky Blade. It is also called the Sapphire Symphonia Sword. Gale was a former Shadow Guard or Demon Card leader. King (Gale Raregroove) was his best friend, but King obtained a shadow stone and went out of control. Glory quit Demon Card and became an Imperial. Unfortunately, King became angry with him, believing he was responsible for the death of his family, and killed Sakura, Gale's wife and Queen of Symphonia. He also slashed Gale's face and sealed a Shadow Stone inside of the newly created scar. Gale resolved to take revenge on King, and so as not to endanger the lives of his children, he never returned home. He reunites with Haru in the Tower of Din and helps him defeat King. Gale died after he protected Haru from falling rocks.\n\n====Cattleya Glory====\n{{Nihongo|Cattleya Glory|\u30ab\u30c8\u30ec\u30a2\u30fb\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc|Katorea Gur\u014dr\u012b}} is Haru's older sister, and the self-proclaimed \"Queen of \"[[Karaoke]]\".

After Haru\u2019s return, she welcomes him and Elie home and attends their wedding. In the anime she is voiced by [[Satsuki Yukino]] in Japanese.\n\n====Branch====\n{{Nihongo|Branch|\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c1|Buranchi}} is Cattleya's ex-boyfriend who was abusive and beat her. He encountered Haru while preparing to enter a local dance competition with Nagisa (who was under the name of Mika). He is later turned into a cyborg by the Blue Guardians.

He fought and lost to Haru Glory twice in the beginning of the series, and after his second defeat, he reforms and becomes an ally of Haru and his friends.  He holds the utmost respect for Gale Glory.  He uses the high six star Dark Bring ''Ballett\u00e4nzer Zeffrea'', which allows him to cause an explosion within a spherical targeting grid that manifests over a chosen point in space; it is later destroyed by Lucia.  He also wields two swords: the ghost sword ''Entenka'' (which spews forth flames by cutting the wind), and the divine sword ''Heavenly Blossom'', which is claimed to be a weapon of the gods.

She teams up with the Rave Warriors for a short time to help stop the Onigami Forces and Doryu Ghost Squad who were terrorizing her people. She's voiced by [[Ry\u014dka Yuzuki]] in some video games.\n\n===Alice===\n{{Nihongo|Alice|\u30a2\u30ea\u30b9|Arisu}} the elixir maker is a medicine man met by Haru's gang during the journey to Southernberg island. He says \"munya\" a lot. Although simple-minded in appearance, usually wearing a bunny eared hat and a loincloth, he is over five hundred years old and 'wields' a giant syringe, containing various fluids, of which switched the souls of Haru, Elie, Musica and Plue around, causing confusion. Alice later cured Elie's broken arm. Due to his age, he has potions with almost unbelievable effects such as enlarging a random part of a person (he used this as a gag), curing almost any wound and restoring a person to his/her true form. He also has a potion for restoring youth, in exchange for a portion of the drinker's remaining days. He was also a former classmate of Mummy of the Doryu Ghost Squad who he domineered over.\n\n===Saga Pendragon===\n{{Nihongo|Saga Pendragon|\u30b5\u30ac\u30fb\u30da\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3|Saga Pendoragon}} is a prophet of Acapella Island, belonging to Nakajima's race.

He was Gale Glory's adoptive father.\n\n===Feber===\n{{Nihongo|Feber|\u30d5\u30a7\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb|F\u0113beru}} is probably the weakest enemy ever mentioned by his name. He was the first Demon Card soldier Haru fought. He badly injured Shiba with a bazooka in Volume 1, but Haru punched him with the Rave and defeated him. Shuda later gave him the Dark Bring \"Full Metal\", which enabled him to turn his skin into metal. He went after Haru again, and was again defeated with the Explosion form of Ten Powers Sword.

In the manga, he is defeated the first Rave stone, but in the anime; it is the Ten Powers's first form. In the anime, it is hinted that Shuda had him killed after his defeat.\n\n===Go and Rosa===\n{{Nihongo|Go|\u30b4\u30a6|G\u014d}} and {{Nihongo|Rosa|\u30ed\u30fc\u30b6|R\u014dza}} are a couple who are involved in the film industry and former Demon Card members.

He was also responsible for killing off Musica's family.\n\n===Lazenby===\n{{Nihongo|Lazenby|\u30ec\u30a4\u30bc\u30f3\u30d3\u30fc|Reizenb\u012b}} the White Flame was formerly a misdirected member of Imperial Guardians for Deep Snow.

They later leave Demon Card and appear with many of the other Rave Warriors allies to help them get to Star Memory.\n\n===Rize===\n{{Nihongo|Rize|\u30ea\u30bc}} is the man who taught Hamrio Musica Sliver-claiming. He was originally going to steal the Silver Ray because it was too dangerous to fall in the wrong hands but failed as someone already stole it before him. On his way back, he found and took Musica in after the rest of family was slaughtered by Lance. Before he died from natural causes, Rize had Musica promise to destroy Silver Ray should he ever find it.\n\n===Roppen===\n{{Nihongo|Roppen|\u30ed\u30c3\u30da\u30f3}} is a former Symphonian soldier who was under the command of Alpine.

He believes to be the identical twin to Plue because of it despite resembling Griff more. He accompanies the Rave warriors while they fight the Onigami Forces and Doryu and decides to stay with the mermaids after Doryu's defeat.\n\n==Antagonists==\n===Demon Card===\n====Gale Raregroove====\n{{Nihongo|Gale Raregroove|\u30b2\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30ec\u30a2\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Geiru Reagur\u014dbu}}, primarily referred to as {{Nihongo|King|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Kingu}}, is the initial ruler of Demon Card and a descendant to the former Raregroove kingdom. He founded Demon Card with Gale but after Gale left from their conflicting bloodlines, King became the sole leader of Demon Card, and soon fell under the influence of Dark Bring, whose power he used to strengthen the organization which later after 10 years, the organization became a force for evil that terrorized the world with the power of Dark Bring. Years later King is reported to the empire by Gale which causes his intentions misread and  instead the empire commences a slaughter upon the forces of Demon Card, killing King's wife Emilia and presumably his son Lucia. King himself was taken into custody by the Empire but later broke out with the power of Dark Bring. In the present, Haru and Gale Glory fight King at the Tower of Din where the battle ends with King dying and Gale Glory dying in the aftermath of the fight. King is extremely strong and is often used as a reference to show the relative strength of other villains. Although he uses 5 dark bring, which is considered an extraordinary feat, he does not use any Sinclaire like the other main villains of the series. The fact he can still match them in combat is a testament to his strength. King's sword Decalogus is a dark bring which is the evil counterpart of the TCM. His Dark Bring, Black Zenith fires a huge black sphere that disintegrates anything that it touches. The Dark Bring, Gate which can open doors between worlds. King used this to summon his warriors, the 5 Palace Guardians, from the Mystic realm. Monster Prison is one of the \"reverse\" Dark Brings feared for their unchecked power, which seals the bearer's body and soul within it for all eternity, transforming them into a beast with just bestial instincts; in this form, he is immune to pain and can fire energy beams from the mouth. The last Dark Bring he possess is Warp Road which has the power of teleportation which King used to extract the Dark Bring End of Earth from within Gale and teleport it to the distant Demon Card HQ, which was annihilated in the subsequent Overdrive. In the anime he is voiced by [[Tessh\u014d Genda]] in Japanese.\n\n====Lucia Raregroove====\n{{Nihongo|Lucia Raregroove|\u30eb\u30b7\u30a2\u30fb\u30ec\u30a2\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Rushia Reagur\u014dbu}} is the primary antagonist of the series. He is the son of King and was the heir to the throne of Demon Card and also the Raregroove Kingdom. During the Empire's infamous raid of Demon Card headquarters 10 years prior to the series present, Lucia was presumably killed in the slaughter along with his mother, Emilia. When he was seen to still be alive, he was imprisoned within the 66th basement of the maximum security desert prison Mega Unit where he became an infamous legend known among the Empire as the Blonde Demon, a boy whose power was so great and terrifying, he was a threat to the entire world. Sometime after the death of his father during the battle at the Tower of Din, he became powerful enough to violently break out of his imprisonment within Mega Unit. Much like Gale Glory and King were destined to oppose each other, Lucia is every bit the antithesis to the second Rave Master Haru Glory, as the self-proclaimed Dark Bring Master. Initially, he possessed Sinclair, the first piece of [[Dark Bring#Endless|Endless]] (The mother of all Dark Brings), that was the main piece which has the power of creating  a warped dimensional space that has enough pressure to annihilate anything. After having over 10 years of influence over him, Sinclair managed to bestow upon Lucia a high amount of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, endurance and durability as well as giving him knowledge. He also wields his father's former sword, [[Ten Powers#Decalogue Sword and Neo Decalogue|Decalogue]] which has the same abilities as Haru's TCM. Although it was later destroyed by Haru and he received an enhanced version of it called ''Neo Decalogue'' where 10 dark brings were used to enhanced all 10 swords. In the anime he is voiced by [[Souichiro Hoshi]] in Japanese and Armando Valdes-Kennedy in English.\n\n====Shakuma====\n{{Nihongo|Shakuma|\u30b7\u30e3\u30af\u30de}} was the master of Haja, and he is said to be the most powerful mage on the entire planet. He was recruited by Lucia to kidnap Elie and make her Lucia's bride. His secret identity is {{Nihongo|Shakuma Raregroove|\u30b7\u30e3\u30af\u30de\u30fb\u30ec\u30a2\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Shakuma Reagur\u014dbu}}, the King of Raregroove, which makes him the father of King and grandfather of Lucia (a fact unbeknownst to Lucia). He was also the one who murdered the King of Symphonia, Haru's grandfather, in the past. He possessed high magical prowess, easily destroying a city with a high-level spell, killing all of its inhabitants (including the newly reformed [[Jegan]]) in search of Ogre's piece of the Sinclaire. While undoubtedly powerful, he was still defeated by the power of Elie's Etherion. Before his death, he laughs as he believes his grandson will rule all of time, then he melts into a puddle. He had a solemn serious personality until after Elie hit him, when he reverted to a sadistic, disgusting old man.\n\n====Oracion Six====\nThe {{Nihongo|Oracion Six|{{ruby|\u516d\u7948\u5c06\u8ecd|\u30aa\u30e9\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3\u30bb\u30a4\u30b9}}|Orashion Seisu|lit. \"Oraci\u00f3n Seis\"}} are the six most powerful warriors and leaders in Demon Card. Shuda was originally one of the Oracion Six but after his defeat by Haru, he was replaced by Deep Snow. Quite possibly the Oracion Six' defining attribute, this set of special Dark Brings are considered to be the most powerful in the world, second only perhaps to the five pieces of the mother of all Dark Brings, Sinclair (which caused the Overdrive 50 years ago). The Six Star Dark Brings enable each member of the Oracion Six to bend a force of nature to their will. In [[Fairy Tail]], the same concept was used to describe a dark guild comprises six powerful mages.\n\n=====Haja=====\n{{Nihongo|Haja|\u30cf\u30b8\u30e3}} is the de facto leader of the Oracion Six and one of its most powerful members (second only to Berial, according to the author). He is one of the top mages in the world, second only perhaps to his master Shakuma (the world's greatest mage). His overwhelming might is primarily attributed to his ability to generate limitless quantities of mana, which gained him the title of \"Haja the Infinite\"; while this was seemingly a natural ability at first, it was later revealed to be derived from a Dark Bring implanted within him. Like the archmage Sieghart, he hails from the town of Mildian, the city of time. He was initially depicted as being one of Demon Card's most loyal members, but later events would later reveal him to be a highly devious and ambitious individual, who plotted to have the most powerful forces for both good AND evil eliminated and coveted ultimate power to achieve control over the entire world and all of time. To that end, he returned to his hometown of Mildian to acquire the great power that dwelled beneath it, super magic ''Cronus'', but was opposed and inevitably killed by Sieg, who was aided by the people of Mildian. It was revealed afterwards that Haja carried within him the essence of the Demon Card scientist Igor Kilkila, who was released after Haja was killed (Igor was subsequently defeated and imprisoned by Sieg and the people of Mildian).\n\n=====Reina=====\n{{Nihongo|Reina|\u30ec\u30a4\u30ca}} is a Silver Claimer, like Musica. She became a member of Demon Card and the Oracion Six to avenge the injustice done to her deceased father, as well as to find the silver ship Silver Ray (her father's greatest work), whose theft her father was unjustly accused of. She has an issue with Musica, as his mentor Rize is who Reina believes to be the true culprit behind the theft of the Silver Ray, and hence is privy to its location. She uses the Six Star Dark Bring White Kiss, which she uses to create silver out of thin air, which she then manipulates to create silver weapons. In the battle against Ogre she teams up with Musica to defeat him. In this battle they use the Silver Bonds to defeat Ogre. She liked Musica and told him how she felt before destroying the Silver Ray. At the last moment, Reina pushed Musica off the Silver Ray and used Silver Bonds, causing an explosion in the sky. She died but her silver combined with Musica's and her soul slipped inside Musica's silver ray spear, which fell out of the heavens.\n\n=====Jegan=====\n{{Nihongo|Jegan|\u30b8\u30a7\u30ac\u30f3}} is a member of the Dragon Race in the Demon World, and the younger brother of Empire's Western General Jade. He is involved in a bitter feud with his former friend Let, because of Jegan's destruction of their home village and the massacre of their kind, in particular Julia, Let's girlfriend. In reality, however, Jegan faked Julia's death, and she became a full dragon who serves as his mindless companion and steed, after she purposely failed her dragon trial to spite him. He uses the \"tree\" Six Star Dark Bring Yggdrasil, which can absorb energy and manipulate plant life.\n\nAfter his final battle and defeat at the hands of Let, Jegan realized that Julia still chose Let over him. Jegan would wash up in the beach of Wrist Dome, the Roofed City. He was found and then cared for by a girl named Janna, but a desperate Jegan (feeling he has nothing more to live for) is determined to die. However, a conversation with his brother Jade, the Empire's Western General, caused him to rethink his decision and instead begin anew. Unfortunately, this was not to last, as the city is soon bombarded by meteors from space, courtesy of Shakuma (the world's mightiest sorcerer) and his apprentice Haja, who were out to retrieve the Sinclaire piece Last Physics (which also washed up into the city) and to eliminate Jegan for his failure and weakness. Jegan dies trying in vain to save Janna from the meteor shower, much to his brother Jade's grief and outrage.\n\n=====Berial=====\n{{Nihongo|Berial|\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb|Beriaru}} is an archduke in the Demon World. A four-eyed demonic bat named Boi Boi often sits on his shoulder. He was the one who proposed to the Great Demon Lord Megido of the Lava and his peers for them to ally with Demon Card, as part of the organization's ambitious Project: Dark Rendezvous. He uses the Six Star Dark Bring G-Earth, which allows him to manipulate the ground. He appears again after The Blue Guardians are defeated and sends an army of monsters to kill Haru and his friends after Haru had retrieved the final RAVE. Haru kills him with a single hit. This is surprising because the author's notes define him as the strongest.\n\n=====Iulius=====\n{{Nihongo|Iulius|\u30e6\u30ea\u30a6\u30b9|Yuriusu}} is an extremely vain individual, obsessed with beauty. He is arguably the weakest member of the Oracion Six, but can be considered dangerous in certain instances, particularly if his own beauty is threatened. Like Shuda, he was a villain in the beginning, but he was reformed (to a certain extent) and became an ally of Haru Glory and his friends. He loves dancing and (his own) beauty to the point that he's willing to betray Demon Card for them.\n\n=====Deep Snow=====\n{{Nihongo|Deep Snow|\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc|D\u012bpu Sun\u014d}} is the Northern General of the Empire, but is in reality a double-agent working for Demon Card. He returned to the organization when Lucia became its new ruler, and was chosen as Shuda's replacement within the Oracion Six. He uses the \"flow\" Six Star Dark Bring Zero Stream, which allows him to control all that flows (water, wind, blood, etc.), and has also the Dark Bring Type 56 implanted within him when he was an infant, allowing him to tap into his latent power and enhance his physical abilities. He engages in an intense duel with Shuda but loses; however, Shuda lets him live and reveals that King had acted out of compassion for him, treating him like a son just as Snow had looked up to him like a father. His fate after the battle remains unknown.\n\n====Imperial Guardians====\nThe {{Nihongo|Imperial Guardians|\u7687\u5e1d\u8b77\u885b\u90e8\u968a|K\u014dtei Goei Butai}} are a set of four individuals that have served the late Imperial Headquarters. After the Imperial Headquarters was completely wiped out by Demon Card, these four imperial guardians joined Demon Card truly under Deep Snow because they had nothing better to do.\n{{Nihongo|Dalton|\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30f3|Daruton}} the Chrysalis also known to be the weakest of the four is an insect like creature that has a body completely covered with armor.

When it comes to appearance, Moore is seen wearing a hat that possesses many outer eyes and an overall clownish like garb. Golden-eye {{Nihongo|Brosnan|\u30d6\u30ed\u30b9\u30ca\u30f3|Burosunan}} who is easily seen as the largest of the four is a large monster like human that is seen wearing a giant suit of knight armor over his body and long golden hair who wields a great sword. Lazenby the White Flame was initially one of them and misdirected by Demon Card as well but after being knocked out ends up assisting the Rave Warriors for a while as a comedic ally.\n\nEach of the Guardians is named after an actor who has portrayed [[James Bond#Films|James Bond]] on screen: [[Timothy Dalton]], [[Roger Moore]] (who starred in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''), [[Pierce Brosnan]] (who starred in ''[[GoldenEye]]''), and [[George Lazenby]].\n\n====Four Demon Gods====\nThe four lords of the Demon World, the {{Nihongo|Four Demon Gods|\u56db\u5929\u9b54\u738b|Shitenma\u014d}} were all recruited by Lucia for Demon Card's DR (Dark Rendezvous) plan. In a way, these four are the incarnation of the original demon guard of King, both of which were used to delay the heroes. {{Nihongo|Megido|\u30e1\u30ae\u30c9}} is a massive humanoid lion, he was the first to join Lucia during the Dark Rendezvous recruiting process due to his desire to gain more power. He drives a flying coach, and breathes massive blasts of fire capable of damaging even Endless.

While human in appearance, her body is made of ice, allowing her to regenerate herself, and she controls magic and despair which somewhat fuels. She is killed by the combined effort of Julia, Belinka, and Niebel. This however results in the deaths of Niebel and Belinka, who are later revived by the Memory of the Star. {{Nihongo|Uta|\u30a6\u30bf}} also called \"Uta the Eternal\", is a Demon War God used to defend Lucia as he prepared the second Overdrive. He was a human-like demon who possessed inhuman strength, wielding a hundred-foot longsword with incredible ease. He has a second form where 2 horns grow from his head, giving him increased combat abilities. He is killed by Let turning into his true Dragon King form, killing himself in the process before the Memory of the Star revives him as well. {{Nihongo|Asura|\u30a2\u30b9\u30e9}} also known as Asura of Darkness, while normally small and implike, it is merely to conceal his true form which is a gargantuan [[Satan]]ic demon with a countless amount of Dark Bring embedded into its body. He has the ability to use any Dark Bring in the world and also can combine Dark Bring to produce effects. He is killed by the combined efforts of Plue and Haru.\n\n===Endless===\n{{Nihongo|Endless|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9|Endoresu}}, also known as the King of Memories of the Star, is a monstrous entity born as the result of the alternate timeline, in which history was reconstructed to ensure the survival of mankind. Endless gains power through the accumulation of negative emotions, making its growth virtually unstoppable. Its infinite power is capable of eradicating dimensions. However, it can be destroyed by the power of Etherion, and summoned by the staff of Resha Valentine or assembling of the five Sinclaires. Endless is later revealed to be a dark bring itself, or the true origin of all dark brings, with its real appearance being a black orb made from the five Mother Dark Brings. Endless is used by Lucia Raregroove in an attempt to restore the original timeline, but is ultimately destroyed by Elie\u2019s Etherion.\n\n===Five Palace Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Five Palace Guardians|\u738b\u5bae\u5b88\u4e94\u795e|\u014cky\u014dmori Gokami}} are five warriors from other dimensions are brought together by one of King's Dark Brings, the Gate.

He also has a power that is not connected to his Dark Bring, the ability to seal his opponents in the landscape of their memories. {{Nihongo|Rionette|\u30ea\u30aa\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8|Rionetto}} who is considered the most sadistic of the group, can teleport himself from where he's standing to wherever the opponent's shadow is with his Dark Bring is Shadow Doll. Also, when he stands on that shadow, the opponent cannot move. He is really tall, has a really long neck, and can only speak in rhyme. {{Nihongo|Racas|\u30e9\u30ab\u30b9|Rakasu}} is a yellow demonoid who has hair in the shape of a horseshoe and carries two maracas. He cannot help dancing and his Dark Bring, Rhythm Counter, allows him to reflect an attack back that is a few times stronger. He can also read people's minds and is constantly seeking the approval of Ltiangle. {{Nihongo|Ron Glace|\u30ed\u30f3\u30fb\u30b0\u30e9\u30c3\u30bb|Ron Gurasse}} is a huge, unintelligent suit of armor that speaks with bad grammar and is actually the weakest member of the Palace Guardians. He carries a huge spear which he uses as a medium for his Dark Bring, Spikes. Whenever his spear plows into the ground, metal spikes come out of the ground. Let Dahaka was initially the second most powerful of the Palace Guardians, but after his defeat from Haru later changes his ways and becomes a central ally and good friend to the Rave Warriors.\n\nLike several villains leading up to them, all of their names are something in real life if you add \"ma\" to the beginning of the name, a play on the fact that they are all Majin (\"Ma\" meaning demon and \"jin\" denoting a person. Translated as \"demonoid\" in the English manga). All their names origins are maltiangle (Ltiangle), [[marionette]] (Rionette), [[maracas]] (Racas), [[Marron glac\u00e9]] (Ron Glace), and [[mallet]] (Let).

They are led by Captain Hardner and travel in the giant flying ship ''Albatross'' and therefore, they have no permanent base.

Her Dark Bring allows her to change into Light granting her possibly light speed.\n\nAmong the Blue Guardians are their elite force known as {{Nihongo|Six Guard|{{ruby|\u516d\u3064\u306e\u76fe|\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30fb\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9}}|Sikkusu G\u0101do}} that is said to match Demon Card's Oracion Six. {{Nihongo|Lukan|\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3|Rukan|\"Requin\"}}, the leader of the Six Guard has short, dark hair with a symbol tattooed onto his head has some alligator-looking animal skin over his head and a long cape.

Her Dark Bring allows her to wear anything as an armor, including wind which grants her increased speed and agility, bullets, Julia's fire breath, electricity, and metal (which she considers her strongest form and only uses on people she hates). {{Nihongo|Reevil|\u30ea\u30a8\u30fc\u30f4\u30eb|Ri\u0113vuru|\"Li\u00e8vre\"}}, the largest member is perverted and looks like a large mustachioed bunny with a wrestling outfit.

His Mother DB ''Anastasia'' allows him to \"restore\" anything, including his missing arm, ruined buildings that had long since been leveled, the atmosphere after Haru tried a smoke screen, and all his opponents old wounds which they have ever suffered and is usually fatal (although it appears he has to touch the subject). He also carries a sword with a blunted tip since he prefers to slash off heads instead of stabbing people, thus earning the nickname \"Executioner\".<br>He aims to merge with Endless, to forget the incident of which killed all of his comrades, wife, and unborn child, which made him and his best friend the only survivors. Unknown to him, his unborn child was alive and raised up by his best friend. Hardner also tried all means to torture his daughter to reveal the hideout of which hid an ancient staff deep underground. Realizing what he had done to his own flesh and blood, Hardner broke down in defeat as Haru spares him, only to be stabbed in the back by Lucia to retrieve the mother DB piece in volume 28.

Mummy also turned the defeated Musica into a powerful lycanthropic creature and sent the beast against the Rave warriors, but Haru returned Musica to his normal state. Mummy also possessed a reversal dark bring, Bone Knight (a dark bring that throws away the wielder's soul to transform them, similar to King's Monster Prison). {{Nihongo|Cookie|\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc|Kukk\u012b}} was a mass murderer executed by the Empire fifteen years ago because of his crimes but was brought back as a zombie by Doryu's use of [[Necromancy]].

He holds one of the five mother DB, ''Vampire'', which gives him complete control over the forces of gravity and repulsion which lets him, at the most extreme, pull physical matter into darkness (which he did to Musica). He first fought Haru in Volume 15, and he nearly killed Haru with the Twilight sword. The second time they fought in Volume 17, Haru seemed to have gained some new strength (he might have gotten stronger as a result to losing the first match), and he destroyed the Twilight sword and the Jet Black sword. Haru also received some help from his friends, but it ended up being a one on one fight between Haru and Doryu. Haru was able to overcome the pain of his earlier injuries, destroyed Doryu's most powerful spell (which would have killed Haru and all of his friends), broke through the Vampire's power of repulsion, and he killed Doryu with the Million Suns.

The series takes place in a fictional universe that exists as a parallel world where vast numbers of humans as well as species known as sentenoids and demonoids fight using weapons, magic and evil artifacts known as Dark Bring (Shadow Stone in the anime's English dub). One of the most primary users of the artifact known as Dark Bring is an evil terrorist organization known as Demon Card (Shadow Guard in the anime's English dub) which plans to use it to take over the world and bring it into darkness.\n\nThe main character Haru Glory, is chosen by the holy artifact known as Rave to wield the Ten Powers and go on a quest with the strange dog like creature known as Plue to find the other four remaining Rave stones and put an end to the usage of Dark Bring and bring peace to the world. In his travel, fate brings him to ally himself with a girl that lost her memories and believes she is named Elie and is unaware that she has a strong involvement with the Rave stones. Together on their quest, they gain allies known as the Rave Warriors which consist of the thief that can manipulate silver known as Hamrio Mugika, a cartographer which is the strange blue creature known as Griffon Katou, Let Dahaka and Julia who are both martial artists and members of a species from the mystic realm known as the Dragon Race, Ruby, a rich penguin-like sentenoid, and Belnika, a kind sorceress.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Creation and design==\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\nWhen making the series Mashima wants to make justice prevail but also make readers understand the villains' reasons to fight the main character in order to make them more complex characters.<ref name=\"anninter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2008-08-17/hiro-mashima|title=Interview: Hiro Mashima|author=Santos, Carlo|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=August 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Protagonists==\nThe main characters are known as the ''Rave Warriors''.\n\n===Haru Glory===\n{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Seki]]|[[Yuri Lowenthal]]<ref name=\"ep 1 credits\">{{cite episode | series=Rave Master | serieslink=Rave Master | time=Closing credits, English language cast}}</ref>}}\n\n{{Nihongo|Haru Glory|\u30cf\u30eb\u30fb\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc|Haru Gur\u014dr\u012b}} is the main protagonist of the series and the current Rave Master, never giving up in a fight and willing to protect others in spite of the circumstances. Born on Garage Island, Haru was left in the care of his older sister after their mother died some time after their father left to find the Rave Stones. By chance, Haru fished Plue out of the ocean and met the previous Rave Master Shiba, who realizes the youth to be his successor. After realizing the threat that the Demon Card organization pose to the world, Haru promises Shiba that he will find the Rave Stone and stop the Demon Card's evil with Plue by his side. Along the way, he is joined by allies, each having their own goals, yet they were bound together thanks to him and helping each other along the way. He is very friendly and has a lot of energy. He is very protective of [[Elie (Rave)|Elie]], and does anything he can to ensure her safety. Haru also shows to develop a romantic interest in Elie progressively throughout the series, as it also becomes apparent in later chapters that among Haru's greatest motivations to keep fighting onward is in fact for Elie. At the end of the [[manga]], they marry and then had a son.\n\nAs the Rave Master, Haru carries a special sword called the ''Ten Commandments'' or TCM, (or the ''[[Ten Powers]]'' in the English dub) that can change from its ''Eisenmeteor'' form to nine other forms once the Rave Stones are embedded into it. During the finale, it was found that Haru cannot use the last sword because the sword was originally forged for Shiba. This encourages Musica to forge Haru his own sword, where it becomes the tenth sword called ''Ravelt'', and it later becomes the default form. His old sword was destroyed by Galein Musica to test the new sword.\n\n===Elie===\n{{Nihongo|Elie|\u30a8\u30ea\u30fc|Er\u012b}} is a mysterious girl with amnesia, who uses tonfa-blasters as her main weapon of choice. After being saved by Haru in Georco, she travels with him in order to regain her memory. A lively, bubbly girl, she has a hot temper and an undying love for casinos, often procuring funds for the group through this method. It is later revealed that Elie harnesses the power of Etherion, an extremely destructive magic that transcends space and time. Etherion was also used by  {{Nihongo|Resha Valentine|\u30ea\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30f3|R\u012bsha Barentain}}, an acclaimed dancer from 50 years prior who gave her life in order to create the Rave stones, and whom Elie is identical to. After traveling to the past, Elie discovers that she is in fact Resha Valentine, and had actually faked her death by encasing herself in magic to later awaken in the future. Following this revelation, Elie recovers Resha\u2019s old staff and equips it in battle, which grants her the ability to summon and destroy Endless. Over the course of the story, Elie starts to develop romantic feelings for Haru, just as Haru does for her; this led to them getting married and the birth of their son at the end of the series. In the [[anime]], she is voiced by [[Ayako Kawasumi]] in Japanese and [[Michelle Ruff]] in English.<ref name=\"ep 1 credits\"/> Elie was ranked as #20 in a survey conducted by Newtype Japan for Favorite Anime Heroine in 2002.<ref>Newtype USA, Vol 2 - Issue 4. April 2003.</ref>\n\n===Plue===\n{{voiced by|[[Yukiji]] (Rave), [[Saori Goto]] (Fairy Tail)|[[Mona Marshall]]<ref name=\"ep 1 credits\"/> (Rave), Majken Bullard (Fairy Tail, Season 1), [[Monica Rial]] (Fairy Tail, Season 2)}}\n\nDespite his strange appearance, resembling a shivering snowman with a carrot nose despite being called a dog, {{Nihongo|Plue|\u30d7\u30eb\u30fc|Pur\u016b}} is the Rave Bearer and is able to sense the presence of the other Rave Stones. Plue's nose also has the ability to destroy Dark Bring. Plue is quite fond of sweets, especially lollipops, yet hates pudding. He also likes wine, and spiders. He has the ability to use the Rave of Combat, which powers himself and Haru up. It is a running gag in the manga that no one is entirely sure what Plue is or even whether he is male. Most people think of him as a dinosaur, while Elie refers to him as a bug. Haru first names him \"Sabutaro\" which Let prefers to call him.\n\nIn the ''[[Fairy Tail]]'' series, Plue is revised as a {{Nihongo4|[[Canis Minor|Nikora]]|\u30cb\u30b3\u30e9|Nikora}} celestial spirit who serves as a pet for [[Lucy Heartfilia]] but prefers to be summoned on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

From there, Jeid is not seen until just before the last battle is begun, right before the story ends.\n\n===Jellybone===\n{{Nihongo|Jellybone|\u30b8\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30f3|Jer\u012b B\u014dn}} is a doctor who was the only person close to Belnika prior to meeting the Rave Warriors and looked after her during her Etherion experiments. After Hardner revealed his evil intentions to Belnika, he was used as a hostage to get Belnika to cooperate with his plans.\n\n===Jiggle Butt Gang===\n{{Nihongo|Jiggle Butt Gang|\u30b1\u30c4\u30d7\u30ea\u56e3|Ketsupuri-dan|\"Big Butt Bandits\" in English dub}} are three hopeless robbers who have absolutely no talent in robbing, they have extremely big booties which they jiggle when excited. Their leader, named {{Nihongo|Wonderful Gocch|\u30ef\u30f3\u30c0\u30d5\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30c3\u30c1|Wandafuru Gotchi}}, has an affinity with Plue. In [[Fairy Tail]] the anime series the Jiggle Butt Gang make appearances in the filler \"Key of the Starry Sky arc\". They also make a cameo appearance in Episode 37 of the anime series GetBackers without their trademark skintight suits and big butts as they wore Hawaiian collared suits and they are chasing Natsumi as a retrieval expert before they are later subdued by Kazuki Fuchouin with his strings to save Natsumi.\n\n===Lance===\n{{Nihongo|Lance|\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9|Ransu}} is Commander of the 17th unit of Demon Card soldiers, he wields the Beast Sword, forged by Galein Musica. It allows him to create illusions at his will. His DB allows him to make his illusions real. Somewhat of a psychopath, he captured Elie and injured Hamrio Musica in volume 2, and was defeated by Haru in Volume 3. He was also responsible for killing off Musica's family.\n\n===Lazenby===\n{{Nihongo|Lazenby|\u30ec\u30a4\u30bc\u30f3\u30d3\u30fc|Reizenb\u012b}} the White Flame was formerly a misdirected member of Imperial Guardians for Deep Snow. He wears a superhero mask and an accessory that makes him appear to have four arms and resembles the bulkiness of your average superhero. He supports justice to his highest extent capable. When it comes to abilities, he can perform many white flame techniques and special punch moves. After being defeated by Shuda, he finds out that he was misguided by Demon Card to think the Rave Master is evil and becomes a comic ally to the Rave Warriors.\n\n===Levin Glory===\n{{Nihongo|Levin Glory|\u30ec\u30d3\u30f3\u30fb\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc|Rebin Gur\u014dr\u012b}} is the future son of Haru and Elie who looks a lot like them, he is featured in the Rave 0077 mini chapters of the manga. He is constantly left home alone and is seen doing most of his ridiculous antics with his babysitter Nakajima.\n\n===Nakajima===\nVoiced by: [[Kousuke Okano]] (English dub: [[Randall Montgomery]])<br>\n{{Nihongo|Nakajima|\u30ca\u30ab\u30b8\u30de}} is a strange lifeform that lives stuck to the outside wall of Cattleya and Haru's house. He looks like a flower, but claims that the petal-looking things ringing his round face are feathers. His favorite (and perhaps only) hobby is \"golling\".\n\n===Range and Sopra===\n{{Nihongo|Range|\u30e9\u30f3\u30b8\u30e5|Ranju}} and {{Nihongo|Sopra|\u30bd\u30d7\u30e9|Sopura}} are two female members of Demon Card and are part of Reina's unit to help fight against the Onigami Forces. They later leave Demon Card and appear with many of the other Rave Warriors allies to help them get to Star Memory.\n\n===Rize===\n{{Nihongo|Rize|\u30ea\u30bc}} is the man who taught Hamrio Musica Sliver-claiming. He was originally going to steal the Silver Ray because it was too dangerous to fall in the wrong hands but failed as someone already stole it before him. On his way back, he found and took Musica in after the rest of family was slaughtered by Lance. Before he died from natural causes, Rize had Musica promise to destroy Silver Ray should he ever find it.\n\n===Roppen===\n{{Nihongo|Roppen|\u30ed\u30c3\u30da\u30f3}} is a former Symphonian soldier who was under the command of Alpine. He wore leopard print armor. In the present his spirit lives in a leopard form and stays with Alpine at the shrine of the Rave of Truth.\n\n===Sakura Glory===\n{{Nihongo|Sakura Glory|\u30b5\u30af\u30e9\u30fb\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc|Sakura Gur\u014dr\u012b}} is the wife of Gale Glory and mother of Haru and Cattleya. After Gale departed from Garage Island to put an end to Demon Card, Sakura pursued him for one year before encountering him in a confrontation with King.

He seems to be a member of the same race as Griff but has a horn on his head that is identical to Plue's nose. He believes to be the identical twin to Plue because of it despite resembling Griff more. He accompanies the Rave warriors while they fight the Onigami Forces and Doryu and decides to stay with the mermaids after Doryu's defeat.\n\n==Antagonists==\n===Demon Card===\n====Gale Raregroove====\n{{Nihongo|Gale Raregroove|\u30b2\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30ec\u30a2\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Geiru Reagur\u014dbu}}, primarily referred to as {{Nihongo|King|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Kingu}}, is the initial ruler of Demon Card and a descendant to the former Raregroove kingdom. He founded Demon Card with Gale but after Gale left from their conflicting bloodlines, King became the sole leader of Demon Card, and soon fell under the influence of Dark Bring, whose power he used to strengthen the organization which later after 10 years, the organization became a force for evil that terrorized the world with the power of Dark Bring. Years later King is reported to the empire by Gale which causes his intentions misread and  instead the empire commences a slaughter upon the forces of Demon Card, killing King's wife Emilia and presumably his son Lucia. King himself was taken into custody by the Empire but later broke out with the power of Dark Bring. In the present, Haru and Gale Glory fight King at the Tower of Din where the battle ends with King dying and Gale Glory dying in the aftermath of the fight. King is extremely strong and is often used as a reference to show the relative strength of other villains. Although he uses 5 dark bring, which is considered an extraordinary feat, he does not use any Sinclaire like the other main villains of the series. The fact he can still match them in combat is a testament to his strength. King's sword Decalogus is a dark bring which is the evil counterpart of the TCM. His Dark Bring, Black Zenith fires a huge black sphere that disintegrates anything that it touches. The Dark Bring, Gate which can open doors between worlds. King used this to summon his warriors, the 5 Palace Guardians, from the Mystic realm. Monster Prison is one of the \"reverse\" Dark Brings feared for their unchecked power, which seals the bearer's body and soul within it for all eternity, transforming them into a beast with just bestial instincts; in this form, he is immune to pain and can fire energy beams from the mouth. The last Dark Bring he possess is Warp Road which has the power of teleportation which King used to extract the Dark Bring End of Earth from within Gale and teleport it to the distant Demon Card HQ, which was annihilated in the subsequent Overdrive. In the anime he is voiced by [[Tessh\u014d Genda]] in Japanese.\n\n====Lucia Raregroove====\n{{Nihongo|Lucia Raregroove|\u30eb\u30b7\u30a2\u30fb\u30ec\u30a2\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Rushia Reagur\u014dbu}} is the primary antagonist of the series. He is the son of King and was the heir to the throne of Demon Card and also the Raregroove Kingdom. During the Empire's infamous raid of Demon Card headquarters 10 years prior to the series present, Lucia was presumably killed in the slaughter along with his mother, Emilia. When he was seen to still be alive, he was imprisoned within the 66th basement of the maximum security desert prison Mega Unit where he became an infamous legend known among the Empire as the Blonde Demon, a boy whose power was so great and terrifying, he was a threat to the entire world. Sometime after the death of his father during the battle at the Tower of Din, he became powerful enough to violently break out of his imprisonment within Mega Unit. Much like Gale Glory and King were destined to oppose each other, Lucia is every bit the antithesis to the second Rave Master Haru Glory, as the self-proclaimed Dark Bring Master. Initially, he possessed Sinclair, the first piece of [[Dark Bring#Endless|Endless]] (The mother of all Dark Brings), that was the main piece which has the power of creating  a warped dimensional space that has enough pressure to annihilate anything. After having over 10 years of influence over him, Sinclair managed to bestow upon Lucia a high amount of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, endurance and durability as well as giving him knowledge. He also wields his father's former sword, [[Ten Powers#Decalogue Sword and Neo Decalogue|Decalogue]] which has the same abilities as Haru's TCM. Although it was later destroyed by Haru and he received an enhanced version of it called ''Neo Decalogue'' where 10 dark brings were used to enhanced all 10 swords. In the anime he is voiced by [[Souichiro Hoshi]] in Japanese and Armando Valdes-Kennedy in English.\n\n====Shakuma====\n{{Nihongo|Shakuma|\u30b7\u30e3\u30af\u30de}} was the master of Haja, and he is said to be the most powerful mage on the entire planet. He was recruited by Lucia to kidnap Elie and make her Lucia's bride. His secret identity is {{Nihongo|Shakuma Raregroove|\u30b7\u30e3\u30af\u30de\u30fb\u30ec\u30a2\u30b0\u30ed\u30fc\u30d6|Shakuma Reagur\u014dbu}}, the King of Raregroove, which makes him the father of King and grandfather of Lucia (a fact unbeknownst to Lucia). He was also the one who murdered the King of Symphonia, Haru's grandfather, in the past. He possessed high magical prowess, easily destroying a city with a high-level spell, killing all of its inhabitants (including the newly reformed [[Jegan]]) in search of Ogre's piece of the Sinclaire. While undoubtedly powerful, he was still defeated by the power of Elie's Etherion. Before his death, he laughs as he believes his grandson will rule all of time, then he melts into a puddle. He had a solemn serious personality until after Elie hit him, when he reverted to a sadistic, disgusting old man.\n\n====Oracion Six====\nThe {{Nihongo|Oracion Six|{{ruby|\u516d\u7948\u5c06\u8ecd|\u30aa\u30e9\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3\u30bb\u30a4\u30b9}}|Orashion Seisu|lit. \"Oraci\u00f3n Seis\"}} are the six most powerful warriors and leaders in Demon Card. Shuda was originally one of the Oracion Six but after his defeat by Haru, he was replaced by Deep Snow. Quite possibly the Oracion Six' defining attribute, this set of special Dark Brings are considered to be the most powerful in the world, second only perhaps to the five pieces of the mother of all Dark Brings, Sinclair (which caused the Overdrive 50 years ago). The Six Star Dark Brings enable each member of the Oracion Six to bend a force of nature to their will. In [[Fairy Tail]], the same concept was used to describe a dark guild comprises six powerful mages.\n\n=====Haja=====\n{{Nihongo|Haja|\u30cf\u30b8\u30e3}} is the de facto leader of the Oracion Six and one of its most powerful members (second only to Berial, according to the author). He is one of the top mages in the world, second only perhaps to his master Shakuma (the world's greatest mage). His overwhelming might is primarily attributed to his ability to generate limitless quantities of mana, which gained him the title of \"Haja the Infinite\"; while this was seemingly a natural ability at first, it was later revealed to be derived from a Dark Bring implanted within him. Like the archmage Sieghart, he hails from the town of Mildian, the city of time. He was initially depicted as being one of Demon Card's most loyal members, but later events would later reveal him to be a highly devious and ambitious individual, who plotted to have the most powerful forces for both good AND evil eliminated and coveted ultimate power to achieve control over the entire world and all of time. To that end, he returned to his hometown of Mildian to acquire the great power that dwelled beneath it, super magic ''Cronus'', but was opposed and inevitably killed by Sieg, who was aided by the people of Mildian. It was revealed afterwards that Haja carried within him the essence of the Demon Card scientist Igor Kilkila, who was released after Haja was killed (Igor was subsequently defeated and imprisoned by Sieg and the people of Mildian).\n\n=====Reina=====\n{{Nihongo|Reina|\u30ec\u30a4\u30ca}} is a Silver Claimer, like Musica. She became a member of Demon Card and the Oracion Six to avenge the injustice done to her deceased father, as well as to find the silver ship Silver Ray (her father's greatest work), whose theft her father was unjustly accused of. She has an issue with Musica, as his mentor Rize is who Reina believes to be the true culprit behind the theft of the Silver Ray, and hence is privy to its location. She uses the Six Star Dark Bring White Kiss, which she uses to create silver out of thin air, which she then manipulates to create silver weapons. In the battle against Ogre she teams up with Musica to defeat him. In this battle they use the Silver Bonds to defeat Ogre. She liked Musica and told him how she felt before destroying the Silver Ray. At the last moment, Reina pushed Musica off the Silver Ray and used Silver Bonds, causing an explosion in the sky. She died but her silver combined with Musica's and her soul slipped inside Musica's silver ray spear, which fell out of the heavens.\n\n=====Jegan=====\n{{Nihongo|Jegan|\u30b8\u30a7\u30ac\u30f3}} is a member of the Dragon Race in the Demon World, and the younger brother of Empire's Western General Jade. He is involved in a bitter feud with his former friend Let, because of Jegan's destruction of their home village and the massacre of their kind, in particular Julia, Let's girlfriend. In reality, however, Jegan faked Julia's death, and she became a full dragon who serves as his mindless companion and steed, after she purposely failed her dragon trial to spite him. He uses the \"tree\" Six Star Dark Bring Yggdrasil, which can absorb energy and manipulate plant life.\n\nAfter his final battle and defeat at the hands of Let, Jegan realized that Julia still chose Let over him. Jegan would wash up in the beach of Wrist Dome, the Roofed City. He was found and then cared for by a girl named Janna, but a desperate Jegan (feeling he has nothing more to live for) is determined to die. However, a conversation with his brother Jade, the Empire's Western General, caused him to rethink his decision and instead begin anew. Unfortunately, this was not to last, as the city is soon bombarded by meteors from space, courtesy of Shakuma (the world's mightiest sorcerer) and his apprentice Haja, who were out to retrieve the Sinclaire piece Last Physics (which also washed up into the city) and to eliminate Jegan for his failure and weakness. Jegan dies trying in vain to save Janna from the meteor shower, much to his brother Jade's grief and outrage.\n\n=====Berial=====\n{{Nihongo|Berial|\u30d9\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb|Beriaru}} is an archduke in the Demon World. A four-eyed demonic bat named Boi Boi often sits on his shoulder. He was the one who proposed to the Great Demon Lord Megido of the Lava and his peers for them to ally with Demon Card, as part of the organization's ambitious Project: Dark Rendezvous. He uses the Six Star Dark Bring G-Earth, which allows him to manipulate the ground. He appears again after The Blue Guardians are defeated and sends an army of monsters to kill Haru and his friends after Haru had retrieved the final RAVE. Haru kills him with a single hit. This is surprising because the author's notes define him as the strongest.\n\n=====Iulius=====\n{{Nihongo|Iulius|\u30e6\u30ea\u30a6\u30b9|Yuriusu}} is an extremely vain individual, obsessed with beauty. He is arguably the weakest member of the Oracion Six, but can be considered dangerous in certain instances, particularly if his own beauty is threatened. Like Shuda, he was a villain in the beginning, but he was reformed (to a certain extent) and became an ally of Haru Glory and his friends. He loves dancing and (his own) beauty to the point that he's willing to betray Demon Card for them.\n\n=====Deep Snow=====\n{{Nihongo|Deep Snow|\u30c7\u30a3\u30fc\u30d7\u30b9\u30ce\u30fc|D\u012bpu Sun\u014d}} is the Northern General of the Empire, but is in reality a double-agent working for Demon Card. He returned to the organization when Lucia became its new ruler, and was chosen as Shuda's replacement within the Oracion Six. He uses the \"flow\" Six Star Dark Bring Zero Stream, which allows him to control all that flows (water, wind, blood, etc.), and has also the Dark Bring Type 56 implanted within him when he was an infant, allowing him to tap into his latent power and enhance his physical abilities. He engages in an intense duel with Shuda but loses; however, Shuda lets him live and reveals that King had acted out of compassion for him, treating him like a son just as Snow had looked up to him like a father. His fate after the battle remains unknown.\n\n====Imperial Guardians====\nThe {{Nihongo|Imperial Guardians|\u7687\u5e1d\u8b77\u885b\u90e8\u968a|K\u014dtei Goei Butai}} are a set of four individuals that have served the late Imperial Headquarters. After the Imperial Headquarters was completely wiped out by Demon Card, these four imperial guardians joined Demon Card truly under Deep Snow because they had nothing better to do.\n{{Nihongo|Dalton|\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30f3|Daruton}} the Chrysalis also known to be the weakest of the four is an insect like creature that has a body completely covered with armor. Dalton is usually seen flying due to his wings, and specializes in forming varied traps via his spider web like techniques. {{Nihongo|Moore|\u30e0\u30fc\u30a2|M\u016ba}} the Full Moon is a human who possesses extraordinary abilities with the chakram, which is the reason for his title. When it comes to appearance, Moore is seen wearing a hat that possesses many outer eyes and an overall clownish like garb. Golden-eye {{Nihongo|Brosnan|\u30d6\u30ed\u30b9\u30ca\u30f3|Burosunan}} who is easily seen as the largest of the four is a large monster like human that is seen wearing a giant suit of knight armor over his body and long golden hair who wields a great sword. Lazenby the White Flame was initially one of them and misdirected by Demon Card as well but after being knocked out ends up assisting the Rave Warriors for a while as a comedic ally.\n\nEach of the Guardians is named after an actor who has portrayed [[James Bond#Films|James Bond]] on screen: [[Timothy Dalton]], [[Roger Moore]] (who starred in ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]''), [[Pierce Brosnan]] (who starred in ''[[GoldenEye]]''), and [[George Lazenby]].\n\n====Four Demon Gods====\nThe four lords of the Demon World, the {{Nihongo|Four Demon Gods|\u56db\u5929\u9b54\u738b|Shitenma\u014d}} were all recruited by Lucia for Demon Card's DR (Dark Rendezvous) plan. In a way, these four are the incarnation of the original demon guard of King, both of which were used to delay the heroes. {{Nihongo|Megido|\u30e1\u30ae\u30c9}} is a massive humanoid lion, he was the first to join Lucia during the Dark Rendezvous recruiting process due to his desire to gain more power. He drives a flying coach, and breathes massive blasts of fire capable of damaging even Endless. He kills himself after being mortally wounded by Shuda, thinking that he'll take Shuda with him. {{Nihongo|Jiero|\u30b8\u30a7\u30ed|Jero}} also known as Jiero of Despair is a Demon Goddess resembling a scantily-clad woman, and also said to be the former queen of the makai world. While human in appearance, her body is made of ice, allowing her to regenerate herself, and she controls magic and despair which somewhat fuels. She is killed by the combined effort of Julia, Belinka, and Niebel. This however results in the deaths of Niebel and Belinka, who are later revived by the Memory of the Star. {{Nihongo|Uta|\u30a6\u30bf}} also called \"Uta the Eternal\", is a Demon War God used to defend Lucia as he prepared the second Overdrive. He was a human-like demon who possessed inhuman strength, wielding a hundred-foot longsword with incredible ease. He has a second form where 2 horns grow from his head, giving him increased combat abilities. He is killed by Let turning into his true Dragon King form, killing himself in the process before the Memory of the Star revives him as well. {{Nihongo|Asura|\u30a2\u30b9\u30e9}} also known as Asura of Darkness, while normally small and implike, it is merely to conceal his true form which is a gargantuan [[Satan]]ic demon with a countless amount of Dark Bring embedded into its body. He has the ability to use any Dark Bring in the world and also can combine Dark Bring to produce effects. He is killed by the combined efforts of Plue and Haru.\n\n===Endless===\n{{Nihongo|Endless|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30ec\u30b9|Endoresu}}, also known as the King of Memories of the Star, is a monstrous entity born as the result of the alternate timeline, in which history was reconstructed to ensure the survival of mankind. Endless gains power theough the accumulation of negative emotions, making its growth virtually unstoppable. Its infinite power is capable of eradicating dimensions. However, it can be destroyed by the power of Etherion, and summoned by the staff of Resha Valentine or assembling of the five Sinclaires. Endless is later revealed to be a dark bring itself, or the true origin of all dark brings, with its real appearance being a black orb made from the five Mother Dark Brings. Endless is used by Lucia Raregroove in an attempt to restore the original timeline, but is ultimately destroyed by Elie\u2019s Etherion.\n\n===Five Palace Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Five Palace Guardians|\u738b\u5bae\u5b88\u4e94\u795e|\u014cky\u014dmori Gokami}} are five warriors from other dimensions are brought together by one of King's Dark Brings, the Gate. The guard the Tower of Din as well as being non-humans of unparalleled strength. The leader and most powerful of the guardians is {{Nihongo|Ltiangle|\u30eb\u30c1\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb|Ruchianguru}} with his Dark Bring, Transparent which allows him to turn objects as well as himself invisible. He also has a power that is not connected to his Dark Bring, the ability to seal his opponents in the landscape of their memories. {{Nihongo|Rionette|\u30ea\u30aa\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8|Rionetto}} who is considered the most sadistic of the group, can teleport himself from where he's standing to wherever the opponent's shadow is with his Dark Bring is Shadow Doll. Also, when he stands on that shadow, the opponent cannot move. He is really tall, has a really long neck, and can only speak in rhyme. {{Nihongo|Racas|\u30e9\u30ab\u30b9|Rakasu}} is a yellow demonoid who has hair in the shape of a horseshoe and carries two maracas. He cannot help dancing and his Dark Bring, Rhythm Counter, allows him to reflect an attack back that is a few times stronger. He can also read people's minds and is constantly seeking the approval of Ltiangle. {{Nihongo|Ron Glace|\u30ed\u30f3\u30fb\u30b0\u30e9\u30c3\u30bb|Ron Gurasse}} is a huge, unintelligent suit of armor that speaks with bad grammar and is actually the weakest member of the Palace Guardians. He carries a huge spear which he uses as a medium for his Dark Bring, Spikes. Whenever his spear plows into the ground, metal spikes come out of the ground. Let Dahaka was initially the second most powerful of the Palace Guardians, but after his defeat from Haru later changes his ways and becomes a central ally and good friend to the Rave Warriors.\n\nLike several villains leading up to them, all of their names are something in real life if you add \"ma\" to the beginning of the name, a play on the fact that they are all Majin (\"Ma\" meaning demon and \"jin\" denoting a person. Translated as \"demonoid\" in the English manga). All their names origins are maltiangle (Ltiangle), [[marionette]] (Rionette), [[maracas]] (Racas), [[Marron glac\u00e9]] (Ron Glace), and [[mallet]] (Let). According to the author, Ltiangle was he was the hardest character to draw in the entire series due to his detailed armor and tower shaped head.\n\n===Blue Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Blue Guardians|\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30f3\u30ba|Bur\u016b G\u0101dianzu}} are an organization of [[sky pirates]] who are just as powerful as Demon Card and even forms an alliance with them.  They are led by Captain Hardner and travel in the giant flying ship ''Albatross'' and therefore, they have no permanent base. The first mate, {{Nihongo|Lunar|\u30eb\u30ca\u30fc\u30eb|Ren\u0101ru|\"Renard\"}} who is exceptionally loyal to Hardner has dark skin and wields an enormous axe. Her Dark Bring allows her to change into Light granting her possibly light speed.\n\nAmong the Blue Guardians are their elite force known as {{Nihongo|Six Guard|{{ruby|\u516d\u3064\u306e\u76fe|\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30fb\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9}}|Sikkusu G\u0101do}} that is said to match Demon Card's Oracion Six. {{Nihongo|Lukan|\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3|Rukan|\"Requin\"}}, the leader of the Six Guard has short, dark hair with a symbol tattooed onto his head has some alligator-looking animal skin over his head and a long cape. His Dark Bring allows him to change into acid and burn enemies who come into contact with him, granting him virtual immunity to physical attacks and also wields a scythe shaped like an anchor for armed combat. {{Nihongo|Koala|\u30b3\u30a2\u30e9|Koara}} is a small [[koala]] looking guy with extremely long sleeves who says \"yes\" at the end of all of his sentences and is also a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]]. He has his Dark Bring hanging around his neck which allows him to create and modify machinery. He has many machine types such that if one gets destroyed it rebuilds into a stronger one. {{Nihongo|Giraffe|\u30b8\u30e9\u30d5|Jirafu|\"Girafe\"}}, bears a slight resemblance to Elvis and has a similar haircut and wears giraffe-patterned pants while he also says things like \"lame-o\" and \"daddy-o\" like a jazz poet. His Dark Bring allows him to twist any object that he touches, no matter how hard. {{Nihongo|Leopard|\u30ec\u30aa\u30d1\u30fc\u30eb|Reop\u0101ru|\"L\u00e9opard\"}}, the only female member in the Six Guard, bears a slight resemblance to a leopard. Her Dark Bring allows her to wear anything as an armor, including wind which grants her increased speed and agility, bullets, Julia's fire breath, electricity, and metal (which she considers her strongest form and only uses on people she hates). {{Nihongo|Reevil|\u30ea\u30a8\u30fc\u30f4\u30eb|Ri\u0113vuru|\"Li\u00e8vre\"}}, the largest member is perverted and looks like a large mustachioed bunny with a wrestling outfit. His Dark Bring allows him to blow things away, but it also tears things apart and is incredibly smelly. {{Nihongo|Sean Vivera|\u30b7\u30a2\u30f3\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30f4\u30a7\u30e9\u30f3|Shian Viveran|\"Chien Viverrin\"}}, the first Blue Guardian to be introduced, and a rather fat member who totes a giant club and has bags under his eyes and wears something that resembles a leaf on his head. His Dark Bring allows him to put people to sleep, leaving them at the mercy of his attacks. He can also put himself to sleep to awaken a fighting technique that makes him even stronger.\n\n====Captain Hardner====\n{{Nihongo|Captain Hardner|\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30ca\u30fc|H\u0101don\u0101}} is the leader of the Blue Guardians. He was recruited by Iulius for Demon Card's DR (Dark Rendezvous) plan. His Mother DB ''Anastasia'' allows him to \"restore\" anything, including his missing arm, ruined buildings that had long since been leveled, the atmosphere after Haru tried a smoke screen, and all his opponents old wounds which they have ever suffered and is usually fatal (although it appears he has to touch the subject). He also carries a sword with a blunted tip since he prefers to slash off heads instead of stabbing people, thus earning the nickname \"Executioner\".<br>He aims to merge with Endless, to forget the incident of which killed all of his comrades, wife, and unborn child, which made him and his best friend the only survivors. Unknown to him, his unborn child was alive and raised up by his best friend. Hardner also tried all means to torture his daughter to reveal the hideout of which hid an ancient staff deep underground. Realizing what he had done to his own flesh and blood, Hardner broke down in defeat as Haru spares him, only to be stabbed in the back by Lucia to retrieve the mother DB piece in volume 28. It is later revealed he survived the attack.\n\n===Doryu Ghost Squad===\nThe {{Nihongo|Doryu Ghost Squad|\u30c9\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u5e7d\u6483\u56e3|Dory\u016b Y\u016bgekidan|\"Doryu Raid Squad\" in English dub}}, is a criminal organization led by Pumpkin Doryu consisting of Halloween themed monsters. When Demon Card briefly disbanded after King's defeat, they were one of the several smaller groups that emerged in attempt to take the top spot in the criminal underworld. They become Haru's new nemesis while on his way to Symphonia and later after allying with the Onigami Forces, battle the Rave Warriors at Southernberg. {{Nihongo|Franken Billy|\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b1\u30f3\u30fb\u30d3\u30ea\u30fc|Furanken Bir\u012b}}, a Frankenstein-esque member, wields a dark bring, called Giant which allows him to enlarge his arms at will. {{Nihongo|Lilith|\u30ea\u30ea\u30b9|Ririsu}} is a presumably young woman with a slight resemblance to Medusa and uses the Dark Bring North Wind which enables her to manipulate and become physically one with the wind. It also allows her to breathe in and move freely through large bodies of water. She is exceptionally glib with her tongue and does not hesitate to lie to get her way and Ruby remarked that she always bullied him. {{Nihongo|Mummy|\u30de\u30df\u30fc|Mam\u012b}} is a corrupt scientist with an affinity for [[Werewolf|werewolves]] as he created a breed of bipedal wolves with three eyes and [[machine gun]]s imbued into their right arms. Mummy also turned the defeated Musica into a powerful lycanthropic creature and sent the beast against the Rave warriors, but Haru returned Musica to his normal state. Mummy also possessed a reversal dark bring, Bone Knight (a dark bring that throws away the wielder's soul to transform them, similar to King's Monster Prison). {{Nihongo|Cookie|\u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc|Kukk\u012b}} was a mass murderer executed by the Empire fifteen years ago because of his crimes but was brought back as a zombie by Doryu's use of [[Necromancy]]. His dark bring, All Crush, allowed him to automatically destroy anything that he touches or what touches him. {{Nihongo|Orochi|\u30aa\u30ed\u30c1}} was the most powerful member of the Doryu Ghost Squad but was killed very quickly by Jegan's Dark Bring, Yggdrassil.\n\n====Pumpkin Doryu====\n{{Nihongo|Pumpkin Doryu|\u30d1\u30f3\u30d7\u30ad\u30f3\u30fb\u30c9\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc|Panpukin Dory\u016b}} is the founder of the Doryu Ghost Squad and holder of its top position. He holds one of the five mother DB, ''Vampire'', which gives him complete control over the forces of gravity and repulsion which lets him, at the most extreme, pull physical matter into darkness (which he did to Musica). He first fought Haru in Volume 15, and he nearly killed Haru with the Twilight sword. The second time they fought in Volume 17, Haru seemed to have gained some new strength (he might have gotten stronger as a result to losing the first match), and he destroyed the Twilight sword and the Jet Black sword. Haru also received some help from his friends, but it ended up being a one on one fight between Haru and Doryu. Haru was able to overcome the pain of his earlier injuries, destroyed Doryu's most powerful spell (which would have killed Haru and all of his friends), broke through the Vampire's power of repulsion, and he killed Doryu with the Million Suns. After this point, Haru was stronger than Doryu. Haru almost killed himself after he used all his power to defeat Doryu, but he was saved by Dalmatian in Volume 18. He's voiced by [[Koji Ishii]] in some video games.\n\n===Onigami===\n{{Nihongo|Onigami|\u9b3c\u795e}} is made up of a large amount of onis (similar to demonoids, but more humanlike) led by Ogre, they sided with the Doryu Ghost Attack Squad to pose a threat to the newly reformed Demon Card. Their leader {{Nihongo|Ogre|\u30aa\u30a6\u30ac|\u014cga}} is a brutish oni with a notable lust for women. He possesses the ''Last Physics'' one of the mother DB which grants him immunity to physical attacks and most magic which operates in the physical dimension. Ogre is also a \"Gold-Claimer\" which is a more advanced technique then the silver claiming done by Musica and Reina. It was revealed that he was the one whole stole the Silver Ray. Ogre is voiced by [[Dai Matsumoto|Hiroshi Matsumoto]] in some video games. {{Nihongo|Gobu|\u30b4\u30d6}} is Ogre's right hand Onigami ally and the chief of maintenance and technology. He uses the Sky High dark bring which grants him telekinetic control to any surrounding weapons. {{Nihongo|Gok|\u30b4\u30c3\u30b3|Gokko}} is the Onigami Gunnery Chief who has the \"Through the Wall\" dark bring which allows him to transport through walls. {{Nihongo|Yanma|\u30e4\u30f3\u30de}}, the Onigami Chief Engineer who uses the all-seeing Double Vista dark bring which are in the form of glasses and can see through anything. {{Nihongo|Gawara|\u30ac\u30ef\u30e9}} is the leader over the Onigami Raiding Party who uses the Stone Roses dark bring which turns anything it touches into stone. Initially they had Unicorn Watanabe a cook who is the same species as Griffon Kato, but he joined forces with the Rave Warriors.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hiro Mashima}}\n\n[[Category:Rave Master|Characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Rave Master]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1999|Rave Master]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rave_Master_characters"}

It is led by founder and executive director Jim Giunta headquartered in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] and built to help the promotion of [[collegiate wrestling]].\n\nMany teams were formerly [[NCAA]] programs displaced by Title IX legislation and/or are preparing to join the NCAA, [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], or [[NJCAA]]. Teams in transition to a higher division not eligible for the NCAA postseason also compete in the NCWA. Notable wrestling programs to have started or competed in the NCWA and are now in other associations include: [[California Baptist Lancers|California Baptist]], [[McKendree Bearcats|McKendree]], [[Notre Dame College]], and [[SIU Edwardsville Cougars|Southern Illinois Edwardsville]].\n\n== History ==\nA post-secondary athletic association built to help the promotion of collegiate wrestling, the NCWA was founded in 1997 as a 501c3 non-profit by the current executive director, Jim Giunta, after resigning as executive director of the Texas Interscholastic Wrestling Association (TIWA). At its founding the association had 13 member teams, but today the NCWA is composed of over 150 wrestling teams and clubs from across the United States and Canada. Many of these programs were formerly NCAA scholarship programs which were affected by Title IX legislation, which has resulted in many colleges being forced to give up their wrestling programs in the name of gender equality. The variety of institutions competing in the NCWA is wide and unrestricted as junior colleges, trade schools and post-secondary prep institutions compete in the same national championship as four-year colleges and universities.\n\n=== NCWA Growth ===\n<ref>http://ncwaalumni.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/5/4/12543370/2013_ncwa_media_guide.pdf</ref>\n{{col begin}}\n{{col 3}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is evident with advances such as the GoGreco Program, instant replay and challenges in matches, and the Collegiate Cup championship format.\n* Talented high school student-athletes who were passed over by NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA schools have a chance to compete at an NCWA program.\n* Talented high school student-athletes who transferred out of an NCAA/NAIA/NJCAA school have a second chance to wrestle in college.\n* Some U.S. states do not have NCAA, NAIA, and/or NJCAA teams with wrestling, but do have at least one NCWA wrestling program, which can make it easier for high school athletes to decide where they want to wrestle in college in terms of financial costs. \n* The NCWA allows student-athletes four total seasons of eligibility with no time frame to complete them unlike the NCAA, who requires student-athletes to complete four seasons of eligibility in five years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school, and the NJCAA, requires student-athletes to complete two seasons of eligibility in three years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school.\n\n=== Similarities with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA ===\n* Collegiate weight classes are used (125, 133, 141, 149, 157, 165, 174, 184, 197, 285&nbsp;lbs).\n* All meets and tournaments use NCAA rules and procedures.\n* All conferences host a Conference Championships tournament with a specific allotment of automatic qualifiers based on placement finish in the Conference Championships.\n* Like the NAIA, a school can enter two wrestlers in the same weight class at the Conference and National Championships (if they both qualify for the latter); one is deemed the scorer and the other the non-scorer (no advancement, match, or placement points are awarded to this wrestler).\n* Like the NAIA, the NCWA allows a student-athlete four total seasons of eligibility regardless of time frame. The NCAA require students to complete their four seasons of eligibility in five years starting from the student's first year of competition (barring a sixth-year grant for hardship). Athletes previously competing for an NCAA, NJCAA, or CCCAA program that transfer to the NCWA will still have the remaining number of eligible seasons without the previous time frame. \n* Like the WCWA, schools traditionally competing in the NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, or CCCAA can all compete against one another.\n\n=== Differences with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA ===\nAs mentioned before, the NCWA allows many types of funding to its wrestling programs that might not be allowed by the NCAA. This can allow the wrestling team to grow at its own rate.\n\n==== 235 lb weight class ====\nThe NCWA is the only association with collegiate wrestling to offer an 11th weight class: 235&nbsp;lbs. There are a number of benefits from this: \n* This weight class bridges the weight gap between the 197&nbsp;lb and 285&nbsp;lb weight classes, the biggest weight disparity among any two weight classes. \n* College wrestlers who wrestled in the 195 or 220&nbsp;lb weight classes in high school might find this easier to compete in than having to wrestle at 197&nbsp;lbs or 285&nbsp;lbs. \n* Schools who have two or more prominent athletes in the 197 and/or 285&nbsp;lb weight classes can now give their athletes another chance to succeed individually and earn team points.\n* Another weight class leads to higher team scores at tournaments.\n* The 11th weight class can often be used as a tiebreaker as the first criterion of \"Number of Matches Won\" in dual meet settings.\n\n==== Collegiate Cup Championship Series ====\nStarting in the 2013\u20132014 season, the National Championships in March and the Collegiate Cup Duals (previously known as the National Dual Meet Championship) directly related to each other in a team's point total. A team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals transferred to additional points being awarded at the National Championships.\n\nThe '''National Wrestling Coaches Association''' (or '''\"NWCA\"''') have a National Duals tournament for NCAA Division I, Division II, Division III, NAIA, NJCAA, and NCWA teams, but all do not tie into their respective National Championships point totals. Penn State University (NCAA D-I) won four straight National Championships from 2011 to 2014 \u2013 without ever competing in the NCAA D-I entry of the National Duals. The NCWA's National Championship Series is the first of any of the college divisions to have a true champion that is indicative of both its team's as well as its individuals' success.\n\n==== GoGreco Program ====\nStarting in 2016, the NCWA launched the GoGreco Program with USA Wrestling.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/college-gogreco-season-announced</ref> While USA Wrestling's Freestyle and Greco-Roman season and procedures are separate from the wrestling teams and individuals that participate in them, the NCWA owns and operates the GoGreco Program within their domain and directly controls and promotes another wrestling opportunity. This is the first collegiate-level Greco-Roman wrestling national championship. The inaugural championships will take place on June 3, 2017 in Dallas, Texas on the campus of [[Richland College]].\n\nThe first tournament, the Texas GoGreco Championships, took place on Saturday, May 6, 2017 at Richland College. The [[University of North Texas]] won the tournament with six of seven wrestlers winning in the finals. Richland College and [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] finished second and third, respectively.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/texas-colleges-prepare-for-gogreco-nationals</ref>\n\n==== Women's Folkstyle Wrestling ====\nWhereas the WCWA has athletes compete in freestyle, the NCWA has its women's division compete in collegiate folkstyle wrestling. There are a number of teams that compete in both the WCWA and NCWA to give their athletes more competitive opportunity.\n\n== National Events ==\nThe NCWA sponsors nine types national events:\n# '''''[http://www.nationalduals.org/champions-challenge.html The Champions Challenge]'''''\n# '''''[http://nationalduals.org The NCWA National Duals]'''''\n# '''''Regional Duals Championship'''''\n# '''''Conference Championships'''''\n# '''''[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/recruit-me-high-school-wrestling-combine-tickets-31942923143?aff=eac2# Recruit Me High School Wrestling Combine]'''''\n# '''''[http://www.ncwanationals.org/ National Collegiate Wrestling Championships]'''''\n# '''''The Women's Collegiate Wrestling Championships'''''\n# '''''[https://ncwa.net/gogreco GoGreco National Championships]'''''\n# '''''The Vision Forum'''''\n\n=== Champions Challenge ===\nFrom 2010\u20132011, the Champions Challenge was formed by the NAIA and NCWA to bring more highlight matches to the wrestling community by pitting NAIA All-Stars against NCWA All-Stars at each weight class in a dual meet (except for 235&nbsp;lbs since the NAIA does not recognize that weight class in competition). The All-Stars were usually the highest returning All-American at each weight class barring injury; the coaching staffs were one or two coaches for each school represented in the dual. The NCAA Division II is slated to join in the next event.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Champions Challenge series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Dual Meet\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Series Record<br>(Streak)\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2010\n|[[Orlando, Florida]]<br>(University of Central Florida)\n|NAIA<sup>(1/2)</sup> \n|39\n|NCWA\n|3\n|NAIA 1-0 (1-0)\n|-\n|2011\n|Orlando, Florida<br>(University of Central Florida)\n|NAIA<sup>(2/2)</sup>\n|23\n|NCWA\n|15\n|NAIA 2-0 (2-0)\n|-\n|}\n\n=== National Dual Meet Championship ===\nIn 2008, the NCWA approved the National Dual Meet Championship where the top teams in the country would compete against one another to crown a true team champion starting in 2009. No other association had an official dual-based team champion at the time and that is still the case except in the NCWA. The current structure has 24 teams competing in a bracketed format down to 24 places.\n\nIn its thirteenth season, the NCWA hosted its first National Dual Meet Championship. Whereas the National Championships focuses more on individual success and teams can depend on one or a few exceptional wrestlers, the National Duals highlights teams with solid line-ups and good wrestlers at each weight class. It is common for teams that win or place highly in the National Duals to do so at the National Championships later. The National Duals usually take place in late January before the National Championships.\n\nStarting in the 2013\u20132014 season, two changes took place: 1) the National Dual Meet Championship was now renamed as the Collegiate Cup Duals and 2) a team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals would earn it a certain amount of team points at the National Championships and aid them in winning it. Two major reasons for this change were to 1) encourage more teams to want to wrestle in the Collegiate Cup Duals and, 2) while still recognizing up to two different champions at the two different tournaments, one team could be determined as the best true overall team and individual wrestling champion that year.\n\nDuring the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA ruled that the National Dual Meet Championship will be held on the eastern side of the United States during even-numbered years and on the western side of the United States during odd-numbered years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|NCWA National Dual Meet Championships series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Finals match\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2009\n|[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]]<br>(Middle Tennessee State University)\n|Grand Valley<sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.nationalduals.org/college.html</ref><ref>http://multibriefs.com/briefs/ncwa/NCWA020309.php</ref>\n|33\n|Central Florida<br>\n|18\n|Inaugural event.\n|-\n|2010\n|[[Shelbyville, Tennessee]]<br>(Middle Tennessee State University and [[University of Georgia]])\n|Marion Military<sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.nationalduals.org/college.html</ref>\n|27\n|Apprentice<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|[[Dalton, Georgia]]<br>([[Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center]])\n|California Baptist <sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=918</ref><ref>https://cbulancers.com/news/2011/1/30/SWEET_GEORGIA_CHAMPS.aspx</ref>\n|42\n|Central Florida<br>\n|4\n|First team to win event while in transition to another association.\n|-\n|2012\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Liberty <sup>(1/5)</sup> <ref>http://themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&page=showarticle&ArticleID=24627</ref><ref>http://daltondailycitizen.com/sports/x1296872934/Something-gained-Flames-win-title-at-NCWA-National-Duals</ref>\n|25\n|Lindenwood<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Lindenwood <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=1217</ref><ref>http://www.lindenwoodlions.com/news/2013/1/19/WREST_0119130858.aspx</ref>\n|30\n|Liberty <br>\n|19\n|First time the event was a rematch of the previous year's finals.\n|-\n|2014\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Grand Canyon<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://news.theopenmat.com/college-wrestling-news/grand-canyon-edges-shorter-to-claim-ncwa-collegiate-cup-dual-championship/33909</ref>\n|23\n|Shorter<br>\n|19\n|First time the event became the Collegiate Cup Duals and team points were a factor for the overall Collegiate Cup championship.<br> \n|-\n|2015\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Liberty <sup>(2/5)</sup><ref>http://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID=960&TeamID=</ref>\n|37\n|Apprentice<br>\n|9\n|First team to win event more than once.\n|-\n|2016\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Central Florida <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2016/ucf-wins-first-national-duals-title-defeats-grand-valley-state</ref>\n|32\n|Grand Valley State<br>\n|18\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|[[Lynchburg, Virginia]]<br>(Liberty University)\n|Emmanuel <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Wrestling/Features/2017/January/28/Emmanuel-wins-NCWA-Duals-title</ref>\n|33\n|Liberty<br>\n|13\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Lynchburg, Virginia<br>(Liberty University)\n|Liberty <sup>(3/5)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/liberty-tops-emmanuel-30-15-for-duals-title-gvsu-3rd</ref>\n|30\n|Emmanuel<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Mesquite, Nevada]]<br>([[CasaBlanca Resort|CasaBlanca Resort Event Center]])\n|Liberty <sup>(4/5)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/a8e864a1-d3fb-429b-aacc-fa439d69b150</ref>\n|28\n|Apprentice<br>\n|18\n|First school to win back-to-back titles\n|-\n|2020\n|Lynchburg, Virginia<br>(Liberty University)\n|Men's: Liberty <sup>(5/5)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69</ref><ref>https://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID=3222&TeamID=</ref><br>Women's: Schreiner <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69</ref>\n|43<br>48\n|Men's: Apprentice<br>Women's: Liberty\n|13<br>6\n|First ever Women's National Dual Meet Championship\n|-\n|}\n\n==== 6:12 Project ====\nThe 6:12 Project is a community outreach program created by the NCWA for its wrestlers, coaches, officials, volunteers, and staff to help the city hosting the NCWA National Duals. NCWA wrestling programs serve food to those in need and hold canned and non-perishable food drives. They later donate those goods, as well as clothes (especially jackets), to one of the city's organizations.\n\nThe name \"6:12 Project\" comes from the Biblical quote Ephesians chapter 6, verse 12 from the New Testament:\n:\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against power, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\"\n  \nThe first 6:12 Project took place at the 2012 National Duals in Dalton, Georgia and repeated for the 2013 and 2014 events which were also held in Dalton. It is scheduled to continue at the 2015 Collegiate Cup Duals in Dalton again.\n\n=== NCWA Regional Duals Championship ===\nInitially created as the Western Regional Duals, this event was created in order to give teams in the western and central part of North America the opportunity to compete in a national dual meet event like the National Dual Meet Championship.\n\nHistorically, the National Dual Meet Championship has been hosted on the eastern side of the United States in Georgia, Tennessee, or Virginia. When the Collegiate Cup was passed in 2013, questions and concerns were raised as to whether teams closer to the physical location of the National Dual Meet Championship would have an unfair competitive advantage in terms of championship points calculated for the Collegiate Cup series.\n\nAt the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA passed a resolution stating that in even-numbered years the National Duals would take place on the eastern side and the Regional Duals on the western side; in odd-numbered years, the National Duals would take place at a western location and the Regional Duals an eastern location.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Regional Duals Championship series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Finals match\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2017\n|[[St. George, Utah]]<br>([[Dixie State University]])\n|[[Grays Harbor College|Grays Harbor]] <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/2017-ncwa-western-regional-dual-championship-results</ref>\n|33\n|[[Brigham Young University|Brigham Young]]<br>\n|23\n|Inaugural event.\n|-\n|2018\n|[[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]]<br>([[Western High School (Las Vegas)|Western High School]])\n|Brigham Young<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/byu-beats-colorado-state-for-first-regional-duals-title</ref>\n|38\n|<br>[[Colorado State University|Colorado State]]\n|10\n|First time a team appeared in consecutive finals matches\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Akron, Ohio]]<br>([[Springfield High School (Akron, Ohio)|Springfield High School]])\n|[[Mott Community College|Mott]]<sup>(1/1)</sup>\n|38\n|[[East Carolina University|East Carolina]]<br>\n|18\n|First Regional Dual Championship to take place in the East\n|-\n|2020\n|[[Surprise, Arizona]]<br>([[Ottawa University|Ottawa University Surprise]])\n|[[University of Nevada, Las Vegas|Nevada - Las Vegas]]<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/367c40a8-7f5b-03e6-e3c5-aad907449b04</ref>\n|39\n|[[Wayne State University|Wayne State]]<br>\n|24\n|Round-robin format was used\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Conference Championships ===\nFollowing the inaugural season, the NCWA approved a five-conference format where wrestlers would compete for advancement into the National Championships as well as seeding if they qualified. The number of conferences has fluctuated throughout the years including reaching a record high of 9 and currently set at 8. Additionally, some conferences have been re-named over the years. These conferences are geographically-based and are similar to the National Championships tournament where Division I and II programs wrestle in one bracket, but differ in that team scores are kept as one tournament (unlike the National Championships having a Division I team score and Division II team score). \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|1998 Conference Champions\n|-\n!

Most athletes are high school student-athletes which is the primary focus, however students at a post-secondary institution without a wrestling program may also attend. The event also allows students to ask questions about collegiate competition to college coaches.\n\n=== Men's Collegiate Wrestling Championships ===\nThe first major event the NCWA hosted took place in 1998 was the inaugural National Championships with 26 teams in one division in the 10 then-standard weight classes. Since then, the event has grown to include approximately 340 qualifiers among 150+ teams within the 11 NCWA weight classes where two champions are crowned (Division I and Division II).\n\nHere, individuals are recognized for their outstanding individual achievement. They can earn team points (unless they are the non-scorer on their team) by advancing through the tournament, scoring bonus points in matches, and placing in the top 8. Teams accumulate points from all of their scoring wrestlers. The National Championships have traditionally been held in the middle of March. Division I and Division II teams compete in one bracketed tournament where the overall team points are separated at the end between the two.\n\nIn 1998, the NCWA approved an eleventh weight class, the 235&nbsp;lb weight class.\n\nIn 2007, the NCWA approved All-American status for wrestlers placing in top 8. Previously, only the top 6 wrestlers in each weight class were named All-Americans.\n\nIn 2010, the NCWA approved a two-division classification system - the Division I level composed of established teams meeting specific criteria and the Division II tier where up-start teams as well as teams aiming to join Division I would compete.\n\nSince the 2013\u20132014 season when the Collegiate Cup championship series was passed, teams' National Championships points are added with their National Dual Meet Championship finish points to determine the overall team champion.\n\nIn 2020, multiple teams and individual wrestlers withdrew from the tournament before or during the tournament due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|2020 coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n{|

Championships ===\nThe first Women's Collegiate Wrestling Championships took place at the 2008 National Championships. The NCWA sponsored this event under their new banner organization, the National Collegiate Women's Wrestling Association ('''NCWWA'''). The weight classes have been designed to closely resemble most female athletes' natural weight ranges as well as let programs that also compete in women's collegiate freestyle to acclimate to folkstyle competition. To date, the NCWA is still the only collegiate association in the United States to officially recognize women's collegiate wrestling. Whereas before matches were done using freestyle rules, as was the norm with associations like the WCWA, the NCWWA uses collegiate/folkstyle rules like in the NCWA, NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA.\n\nNo team score was recorded at the inaugural 2008 tournament, but since then team score has been kept. Bo Icalia and Josh White are tied for head coaches to have won the most titles; Icalia won the 2010 and 2011 titles as head coach of [[Yakima Valley Community College]] and the 2012 and 2013 titles as head coach of [[Southwestern Oregon Community College]].

With the National Dual Meet Championship, the team that wins the Collegiate Cup will earn 24 team points. The runner-up will receive 23, third-place 22, and so forth until the 23rd-place team receives 2 points. All other teams that participated, but did not place in the top 23 will receive 1 point. Those points will be carried over to the individual-based National Championships where teams will continue to score points based on their individual athletes' performances.\n\nThe winner of the Collegiate Cup will have accrued the most total points between both events and be presented with the College Cup as the overall NCWA National Champions. Grand Canyon University was the first champion of the new format in 2014.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Championship Year !! Champion School !!

Men's Division I programs are athletic department funded or have met the NCWA's D-I criteria. Many of the Division I programs also offer athletic scholarships.  Men's Division II teams are broken into categories; Emerging Programs, that are developing into Division I teams, and Clubs that operate on campuses where there are established NCAA/NCAA/NJCAA Teams; few Division II schools are of the latter circumstance. Schools whose wrestling teams are competing in the NCWA during their school's transitional period are placed into Division I. Women's programs are any collegiate/post-seconday scholastic programs who also compete in the collegiate folkstyle ruleset.

It is led by founder and executive director Jim Giunta headquartered in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] and built to help the promotion of [[collegiate wrestling]].\n\nMany teams were formerly [[NCAA]] programs displaced by Title IX legislation and/or are preparing to join the NCAA, [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], or [[NJCAA]]. Teams in transition to a higher division not eligible for the NCAA postseason also compete in the NCWA. Notable wrestling programs to have started or competed in the NCWA and are now in other associations include: [[California Baptist Lancers|California Baptist]], [[McKendree Bearcats|McKendree]], [[Notre Dame College]], and [[SIU Edwardsville Cougars|Southern Illinois Edwardsville]].\n\n== History ==\nA post-secondary athletic association built to help the promotion of collegiate wrestling, the NCWA was founded in 1997 as a 501c3 non-profit by the current executive director, Jim Giunta, after resigning as executive director of the Texas Interscholastic Wrestling Association (TIWA). At its founding the association had 13 member teams, but today the NCWA is composed of over 150 wrestling teams and clubs from across the United States and Canada. Many of these programs were formerly NCAA scholarship programs which were affected by Title IX legislation, which has resulted in many colleges being forced to give up their wrestling programs in the name of gender equality. The variety of institutions competing in the NCWA is wide and unrestricted as junior colleges, trade schools and post-secondary prep institutions compete in the same national championship as four-year colleges and universities.\n\n=== NCWA Growth ===\n<ref>http://ncwaalumni.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/5/4/12543370/2013_ncwa_media_guide.pdf</ref>\n{{col begin}}\n{{col 3}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is evident with advances such as the GoGreco Program, instant replay and challenges in matches, and the Collegiate Cup championship format.\n* Talented high school student-athletes who were passed over by NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA schools have a chance to compete at an NCWA program.\n* Talented high school student-athletes who transferred out of an NCAA/NAIA/NJCAA school have a second chance to wrestle in college.\n* Some U.S. states do not have NCAA, NAIA, and/or NJCAA teams with wrestling, but do have at least one NCWA wrestling program, which can make it easier for high school athletes to decide where they want to wrestle in college in terms of financial costs. \n* The NCWA allows student-athletes four total seasons of eligibility with no time frame to complete them unlike the NCAA, who requires student-athletes to complete four seasons of eligibility in five years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school, and the NJCAA, requires student-athletes to complete two seasons of eligibility in three years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school.\n\n=== Similarities with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA ===\n* Collegiate weight classes are used (125, 133, 141, 149, 157, 165, 174, 184, 197, 285&nbsp;lbs).\n* All meets and tournaments use NCAA rules and procedures.\n* All conferences host a Conference Championships tournament with a specific allotment of automatic qualifiers based on placement finish in the Conference Championships.\n* Like the NAIA, a school can enter two wrestlers in the same weight class at the Conference and National Championships (if they both qualify for the latter); one is deemed the scorer and the other the non-scorer (no advancement, match, or placement points are awarded to this wrestler).\n* Like the NAIA, the NCWA allows a student-athlete four total seasons of eligibility regardless of time frame. The NCAA require students to complete their four seasons of eligibility in five years starting from the student's first year of competition (barring a sixth-year grant for hardship). Athletes previously competing for an NCAA, NJCAA, or CCCAA program that transfer to the NCWA will still have the remaining number of eligible seasons without the previous time frame. \n* Like the WCWA, schools traditionally competing in the NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, or CCCAA can all compete against one another.\n\n=== Differences with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA ===\nAs mentioned before, the NCWA allows many types of funding to its wrestling programs that might not be allowed by the NCAA. This can allow the wrestling team to grow at its own rate.\n\n==== 235 lb weight class ====\nThe NCWA is the only association with collegiate wrestling to offer an 11th weight class: 235&nbsp;lbs. There are a number of benefits from this: \n* This weight class bridges the weight gap between the 197&nbsp;lb and 285&nbsp;lb weight classes, the biggest weight disparity among any two weight classes. \n* College wrestlers who wrestled in the 195 or 220&nbsp;lb weight classes in high school might find this easier to compete in than having to wrestle at 197&nbsp;lbs or 285&nbsp;lbs. \n* Schools who have two or more prominent athletes in the 197 and/or 285&nbsp;lb weight classes can now give their athletes another chance to succeed individually and earn team points.\n* Another weight class leads to higher team scores at tournaments.\n* The 11th weight class can often be used as a tiebreaker as the first criterion of \"Number of Matches Won\" in dual meet settings.\n\n==== Collegiate Cup Championship Series ====\nStarting in the 2013\u20132014 season, the National Championships in March and the Collegiate Cup Duals (previously known as the National Dual Meet Championship) directly related to each other in a team's point total. A team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals transferred to additional points being awarded at the National Championships.\n\nThe '''National Wrestling Coaches Association''' (or '''\"NWCA\"''') have a National Duals tournament for NCAA Division I, Division II, Division III, NAIA, NJCAA, and NCWA teams, but all do not tie into their respective National Championships point totals. Penn State University (NCAA D-I) won four straight National Championships from 2011 to 2014 \u2013 without ever competing in the NCAA D-I entry of the National Duals. The NCWA's National Championship Series is the first of any of the college divisions to have a true champion that is indicative of both its team's as well as its individuals' success.\n\n==== GoGreco Program ====\nStarting in 2016, the NCWA launched the GoGreco Program with USA Wrestling.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/college-gogreco-season-announced</ref> While USA Wrestling's Freestyle and Greco-Roman season and procedures are separate from the wrestling teams and individuals that participate in them, the NCWA owns and operates the GoGreco Program within their domain and directly controls and promotes another wrestling opportunity. This is the first collegiate-level Greco-Roman wrestling national championship. The inaugural championships will take place on June 3, 2017 in Dallas, Texas on the campus of [[Richland College]].\n\nThe first tournament, the Texas GoGreco Championships, took place on Saturday, May 6, 2017 at Richland College. The [[University of North Texas]] won the tournament with six of seven wrestlers winning in the finals. Richland College and [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] finished second and third, respectively.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/texas-colleges-prepare-for-gogreco-nationals</ref>\n\n==== Women's Folkstyle Wrestling ====\nWhereas the WCWA has athletes compete in freestyle, the NCWA has its women's division compete in collegiate folkstyle wrestling. There are a number of teams that compete in both the WCWA and NCWA to give their athletes more competitive opportunity.\n\n== National Events ==\nThe NCWA sponsors nine types national events:\n# '''''[http://www.nationalduals.org/champions-challenge.html The Champions Challenge]'''''\n# '''''[http://nationalduals.org The NCWA National Duals]'''''\n# '''''Regional Duals Championship'''''\n# '''''Conference Championships'''''\n# '''''[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/recruit-me-high-school-wrestling-combine-tickets-31942923143?aff=eac2# Recruit Me High School Wrestling Combine]'''''\n# '''''[http://www.ncwanationals.org/ National Collegiate Wrestling Championships]'''''\n# '''''The Women's Collegiate Wrestling Championships'''''\n# '''''[https://ncwa.net/gogreco GoGreco National Championships]'''''\n# '''''The Vision Forum'''''\n\n=== Champions Challenge ===\nFrom 2010\u20132011, the Champions Challenge was formed by the NAIA and NCWA to bring more highlight matches to the wrestling community by pitting NAIA All-Stars against NCWA All-Stars at each weight class in a dual meet (except for 235&nbsp;lbs since the NAIA does not recognize that weight class in competition). The All-Stars were usually the highest returning All-American at each weight class barring injury; the coaching staffs were one or two coaches for each school represented in the dual. The NCAA Division II is slated to join in the next event.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Champions Challenge series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Dual Meet\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Series Record<br>(Streak)\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2010\n|[[Orlando, Florida]]<br>(University of Central Florida)\n|NAIA<sup>(1/2)</sup> \n|39\n|NCWA\n|3\n|NAIA 1-0 (1-0)\n|-\n|2011\n|Orlando, Florida<br>(University of Central Florida)\n|NAIA<sup>(2/2)</sup>\n|23\n|NCWA\n|15\n|NAIA 2-0 (2-0)\n|-\n|}\n\n=== National Dual Meet Championship ===\nIn 2008, the NCWA approved the National Dual Meet Championship where the top teams in the country would compete against one another to crown a true team champion starting in 2009. No other association had an official dual-based team champion at the time and that is still the case except in the NCWA. The current structure has 24 teams competing in a bracketed format down to 24 places.\n\nIn its thirteenth season, the NCWA hosted its first National Dual Meet Championship. Whereas the National Championships focuses more on individual success and teams can depend on one or a few exceptional wrestlers, the National Duals highlights teams with solid line-ups and good wrestlers at each weight class. It is common for teams that win or place highly in the National Duals to do so at the National Championships later. The National Duals usually take place in late January before the National Championships.\n\nStarting in the 2013\u20132014 season, two changes took place: 1) the National Dual Meet Championship was now renamed as the Collegiate Cup Duals and 2) a team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals would earn it a certain amount of team points at the National Championships and aid them in winning it. Two major reasons for this change were to 1) encourage more teams to want to wrestle in the Collegiate Cup Duals and, 2) while still recognizing up to two different champions at the two different tournaments, one team could be determined as the best true overall team and individual wrestling champion that year.\n\nDuring the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA ruled that the National Dual Meet Championship will be held on the eastern side of the United States during even-numbered years and on the western side of the United States during odd-numbered years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|NCWA National Dual Meet Championships series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Finals match\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2009\n|[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]]<br>(Middle Tennessee State University)\n|Grand Valley<sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.nationalduals.org/college.html</ref><ref>http://multibriefs.com/briefs/ncwa/NCWA020309.php</ref>\n|33\n|Central Florida<br>\n|18\n|Inaugural event.\n|-\n|2010\n|[[Shelbyville, Tennessee]]<br>(Middle Tennessee State University and [[University of Georgia]])\n|Marion Military<sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.nationalduals.org/college.html</ref>\n|27\n|Apprentice<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|[[Dalton, Georgia]]<br>([[Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center]])\n|California Baptist <sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=918</ref><ref>https://cbulancers.com/news/2011/1/30/SWEET_GEORGIA_CHAMPS.aspx</ref>\n|42\n|Central Florida<br>\n|4\n|First team to win event while in transition to another association.\n|-\n|2012\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Liberty <sup>(1/5)</sup> <ref>http://themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&page=showarticle&ArticleID=24627</ref><ref>http://daltondailycitizen.com/sports/x1296872934/Something-gained-Flames-win-title-at-NCWA-National-Duals</ref>\n|25\n|Lindenwood<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Lindenwood <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=1217</ref><ref>http://www.lindenwoodlions.com/news/2013/1/19/WREST_0119130858.aspx</ref>\n|30\n|Liberty <br>\n|19\n|First time the event was a rematch of the previous year's finals.\n|-\n|2014\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Grand Canyon<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://news.theopenmat.com/college-wrestling-news/grand-canyon-edges-shorter-to-claim-ncwa-collegiate-cup-dual-championship/33909</ref>\n|23\n|Shorter<br>\n|19\n|First time the event became the Collegiate Cup Duals and team points were a factor for the overall Collegiate Cup championship.<br> \n|-\n|2015\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Liberty <sup>(2/5)</sup><ref>http://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID=960&TeamID=</ref>\n|37\n|Apprentice<br>\n|9\n|First team to win event more than once.\n|-\n|2016\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Central Florida <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2016/ucf-wins-first-national-duals-title-defeats-grand-valley-state</ref>\n|32\n|Grand Valley State<br>\n|18\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|[[Lynchburg, Virginia]]<br>(Liberty University)\n|Emmanuel <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Wrestling/Features/2017/January/28/Emmanuel-wins-NCWA-Duals-title</ref>\n|33\n|Liberty<br>\n|13\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Lynchburg, Virginia<br>(Liberty University)\n|Liberty <sup>(3/5)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/liberty-tops-emmanuel-30-15-for-duals-title-gvsu-3rd</ref>\n|30\n|Emmanuel<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Mesquite, Nevada]]<br>([[CasaBlanca Resort|CasaBlanca Resort Event Center]])\n|Liberty <sup>(4/5)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/a8e864a1-d3fb-429b-aacc-fa439d69b150</ref>\n|28\n|Apprentice<br>\n|18\n|First school to win back-to-back titles\n|-\n|2020\n|Lynchburg, Virginia<br>(Liberty University)\n|Men's: Liberty <sup>(5/5)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69</ref><ref>https://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID=3222&TeamID=</ref><br>Women's: Schreiner <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69</ref>\n|43<br>48\n|Men's: Apprentice<br>Women's: Liberty\n|13<br>6\n|First ever Women's National Dual Meet Championship\n|-\n|}\n\n==== 6:12 Project ====\nThe 6:12 Project is a community outreach program created by the NCWA for its wrestlers, coaches, officials, volunteers, and staff to help the city hosting the NCWA National Duals. NCWA wrestling programs serve food to those in need and hold canned and non-perishable food drives. They later donate those goods, as well as clothes (especially jackets), to one of the city's organizations.\n\nThe name \"6:12 Project\" comes from the Biblical quote Ephesians chapter 6, verse 12 from the New Testament:\n:\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against power, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\"\n  \nThe first 6:12 Project took place at the 2012 National Duals in Dalton, Georgia and repeated for the 2013 and 2014 events which were also held in Dalton. It is scheduled to continue at the 2015 Collegiate Cup Duals in Dalton again.\n\n=== NCWA Regional Duals Championship ===\nInitially created as the Western Regional Duals, this event was created in order to give teams in the western and central part of North America the opportunity to compete in a national dual meet event like the National Dual Meet Championship.\n\nHistorically, the National Dual Meet Championship has been hosted on the eastern side of the United States in Georgia, Tennessee, or Virginia. When the Collegiate Cup was passed in 2013, questions and concerns were raised as to whether teams closer to the physical location of the National Dual Meet Championship would have an unfair competitive advantage in terms of championship points calculated for the Collegiate Cup series.\n\nAt the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA passed a resolution stating that in even-numbered years the National Duals would take place on the eastern side and the Regional Duals on the western side; in odd-numbered years, the National Duals would take place at a western location and the Regional Duals an eastern location.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Regional Duals Championship series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Finals match\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2017\n|[[St. George, Utah]]<br>([[Dixie State University]])\n|[[Grays Harbor College|Grays Harbor]] <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/2017-ncwa-western-regional-dual-championship-results</ref>\n|33\n|[[Brigham Young University|Brigham Young]]<br>\n|23\n|Inaugural event.\n|-\n|2018\n|[[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]]<br>([[Western High School (Las Vegas)|Western High School]])\n|Brigham Young<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/byu-beats-colorado-state-for-first-regional-duals-title</ref>\n|38\n|<br>[[Colorado State University|Colorado State]]\n|10\n|First time a team appeared in consecutive finals matches\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Akron, Ohio]]<br>([[Springfield High School (Akron, Ohio)|Springfield High School]])\n|[[Mott Community College|Mott]]<sup>(1/1)</sup>\n|38\n|[[East Carolina University|East Carolina]]<br>\n|18\n|First Regional Dual Championship to take place in the East\n|-\n|2020\n|[[Surprise, Arizona]]<br>([[Ottawa University|Ottawa University Surprise]])\n|[[University of Nevada, Las Vegas|Nevada - Las Vegas]]<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/367c40a8-7f5b-03e6-e3c5-aad907449b04</ref>\n|39\n|[[Wayne State University|Wayne State]]<br>\n|24\n|Round-robin format was used\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Conference Championships ===\nFollowing the inaugural season, the NCWA approved a five-conference format where wrestlers would compete for advancement into the National Championships as well as seeding if they qualified. The number of conferences has fluctuated throughout the years including reaching a record high of 9 and currently set at 8. Additionally, some conferences have been re-named over the years. These conferences are geographically-based and are similar to the National Championships tournament where Division I and II programs wrestle in one bracket, but differ in that team scores are kept as one tournament (unlike the National Championships having a Division I team score and Division II team score). \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|1998 Conference Champions\n|-\n!

Most athletes are high school student-athletes which is the primary focus, however students at a post-secondary institution without a wrestling program may also attend. The event also allows students to ask questions about collegiate competition to college coaches.\n\n=== Men's Collegiate Wrestling Championships ===\nThe first major event the NCWA hosted took place in 1998 was the inaugural National Championships with 26 teams in one division in the 10 then-standard weight classes. Since then, the event has grown to include approximately 340 qualifiers among 150+ teams within the 11 NCWA weight classes where two champions are crowned (Division I and Division II).\n\nHere, individuals are recognized for their outstanding individual achievement. They can earn team points (unless they are the non-scorer on their team) by advancing through the tournament, scoring bonus points in matches, and placing in the top 8. Teams accumulate points from all of their scoring wrestlers. The National Championships have traditionally been held in the middle of March. Division I and Division II teams compete in one bracketed tournament where the overall team points are separated at the end between the two.\n\nIn 1998, the NCWA approved an eleventh weight class, the 235&nbsp;lb weight class.\n\nIn 2007, the NCWA approved All-American status for wrestlers placing in top 8. Previously, only the top 6 wrestlers in each weight class were named All-Americans.\n\nIn 2010, the NCWA approved a two-division classification system - the Division I level composed of established teams meeting specific criteria and the Division II tier where up-start teams as well as teams aiming to join Division I would compete.\n\nSince the 2013\u20132014 season when the Collegiate Cup championship series was passed, teams' National Championships points are added with their National Dual Meet Championship finish points to determine the overall team champion.\n\nIn 2020, multiple teams and individual wrestlers withdrew from the tournament before or during the tournament due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|2020 coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n{|

Championships ===\nThe first Women's Collegiate Wrestling Championships took place at the 2008 National Championships. The NCWA sponsored this event under their new banner organization, the National Collegiate Women's Wrestling Association ('''NCWWA'''). The weight classes have been designed to closely resemble most female athletes' natural weight ranges as well as let programs that also compete in women's collegiate freestyle to acclimate to folkstyle competition. To date, the NCWA is still the only collegiate association in the United States to officially recognize women's collegiate wrestling. Whereas before matches were done using freestyle rules, as was the norm with associations like the WCWA, the NCWWA uses collegiate/folkstyle rules like in the NCWA, NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA.\n\nNo team score was recorded at the inaugural 2008 tournament, but since then team score has been kept. Bo Icalia and Josh White are tied for head coaches to have won the most titles; Icalia won the 2010 and 2011 titles as head coach of [[Yakima Valley Community College]] and the 2012 and 2013 titles as head coach of [[Southwestern Oregon Community College]].

With the National Dual Meet Championship, the team that wins the Collegiate Cup will earn 24 team points. The runner-up will receive 23, third-place 22, and so forth until the 23rd-place team receives 2 points. All other teams that participated, but did not place in the top 23 will receive 1 point. Those points will be carried over to the individual-based National Championships where teams will continue to score points based on their individual athletes' performances.\n\nThe winner of the Collegiate Cup will have accrued the most total points between both events and be presented with the College Cup as the overall NCWA National Champions. Grand Canyon University was the first champion of the new format in 2014.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Championship Year !! Champion School !!

Men's Division I programs are athletic department funded or have met the NCWA's D-I criteria. Many of the Division I programs also offer athletic scholarships.  Men's Division II teams are broken into categories; Emerging Programs, that are developing into Division I teams, and Clubs that operate on campuses where there are established NCAA/NCAA/NJCAA Teams; few Division II schools are of the latter circumstance. Schools whose wrestling teams are competing in the NCWA during their school's transitional period are placed into Division I. Women's programs are any collegiate/post-seconday scholastic programs who also compete in the collegiate folkstyle ruleset.

{"title_page": "31 BC Judea earthquake", "text_new": "The '''31 BC Judea earthquake''' is mentioned in catalogues of historical earthquakes. It affected the [[Herodian Kingdom of Judea]] in the [[Holy Land]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\n==Josephus' narrative==\nThe main source on the earthquake is a passage in ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' by [[Josephus]]. It dates the earthquake to the time of the [[Battle of Actium]] (31 BC) between the forces of [[Augustus|Octavius Caesar]] and [[Mark Antony]]. It also dates the earthquake to the 7th [[regnal year]] of [[Herod the Great]] (reigned 37-4 BC). According to Josephus, the earthquake brought destruction to Judea's cattle. He estimates that about 10,000 men perished due to [[debris]] from falling houses.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThe army of Judea reportedly suffered no harm, as they \"lodged in the field\" at the time of the earthquake. Arabians hostile to the Jews heard reports of the earthquake, and exaggerated the tale further to the point of reporting that Judea had fallen and that its men \"were utterly destroyed\". A number of Jewish ambassadors were slain by the Arabians, who believed that Judea could no longer oppose their army.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nJosephus himself gives a similar account of the earthquake in ''[[The Jewish War]]'', but there he claims that 30,000 people were casualties of the earthquake.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nJosephus does not mention any destroyed or damaged localities. He claims that the army was spared the disaster by being out in the open, but the cattle were destroyed. But in Judea, the herds were either left in the open field, or kept in \"primitive pens\". The army's survival may be explained by its distance from the earthquake's epicentre.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> Josephus connects the earthquake narrative to an Arab invasion from the east. According to his narrative, the Arab forces did not experience the earthquake first-hand and suffered no casualties. This suggests that the Arab army was also at a great enough distance from the epicentre to be unaffected.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nJosephus' narrative does not identify the exact locations of the two opposing armies. But the earthquake narrative in the ''Antiquities'' follows the narrative of Herod's victory at Dion and Herod's defeat at Kanatha. Following these two battles, the Judean forces had retreated to the either the mountains of [[Galilee]] or the mountains of [[Samaria]]. From there the Judan forces waged a successful [[guerrilla warfare]] campaign against their Arab opponents.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> Kannatha was located about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Tiberias]]. There are two possible locations of Dion. One locatioon is halfway between Kanatha and Tiberias, the other location is in the modern country of [[Jordan]], about {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Pella, Jordan]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThe \"Judea\" of Josephus' account may be equated with the relatively small area of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], rather than the larger realm Herod had inherited from the [[Hasmonean dynasty]]. According to both Josephus and [[Pliny the Elder]], the Judea known to the Romans had expanded to include Galilee, Samaria, [[Perea]], [[Edom|Idumea]], and [[Golan]]. Josephus uses the term Judea in both a narrow and a wider sense.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nIt is unclear from the narrative whether the earthquake affected the [[Negev]] and [[Arabah]], sparsely populated areas where even a major impact might have escaped the notice of contemporaries.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nIn 30 BC, a year later, the victorious Augustus advanced across [[Roman Syria]] and the region of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to reach the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] in Egypt. Neither Josephus, nor other ancient sources mention Augustus encountering the devastation left by a major earthquake. Herod offered a \"lavish reception\" to Augustus, and provided supplies to the [[Roman army]] both in their journey towards Egypt, and in their return journey from Egypt. Which suggests that Judea was far from devastated by this earthquake.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\n==John Malalas' narrative==\nAmong Roman and Byzantine historians, the only one to mention this earthquake was [[John Malalas]] (6th century). In his narrative, the earthquake affected the city of \"Salamine\" in Palestine. He dates the earthquake to the reign of Augustus, and reports that Augustus rebuilt the city. Augustus reportedly renamed the city to \"Diospolis\".<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThe location of the city in the narrative is unclear. There were two cities called \"Diospolis\" in ancient Palestine. One was Dion (either the one in Golan or the one in Jordan), which was renamed following the conquest [[Pompey]] in 64/63 BC. The other Diospolis was the modern city of [[Lod]], which received its Roman name by order of [[Septimius Severus]] in 199 AD. Malalas may have used a latter-day source for the name. However, neither city is called \"Salamin\" in ancient sources, and neithe had known connections to Augustus.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nMalalas may have confused the name of the city, giving a Greek name to various locations of the [[Levant]] called \"Salem\" or \"Salam\". An example is [[Dayr Abu Salama]], where remnants of Greek inscriptions have been located. Another example is Tell Shalem/Salumnia, where a Roman military settlement has been located.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> It is considered improbable that Malalas made a geographic error and described more distant locations as cities in Palestine. [[Salamiyah]] was located about {{convert|250|km|abbr=on}} away from Dion-Golan. The Diopolis to the north of Laodicea was located about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} away. [[Salamis, Cyprus]] was destroyed by an earthquake during the reign of [[Constantius Chlorus]] (reigned 293-306), but it is considered unlikely that Malalas confused Cyprus with Palestine.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nAnother account by Malalas may suggest that the earthquake affected locations outside of Palestine. He reports that [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] visited [[Antioch]] c. 15 BC. Agrippa found that collapse rubble from old earthquakes had accumulated in the city's [[hippodrome]], and ordered their removal.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> Pompey had orchestrated repairs in Antioch following the [[64 BC Syria earthquake]]. The rubble which Agrippa found indicates that either Pompey's repairs were incomplete, or Antioch had suffered a second earthquake at some point between 64 and 15 BC.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> A connection between the 31 BC earthquake and the damages in Antioch is possible, though not supported by primary sources.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThere are only three known earthquakes in the late 1st century BC. The 31 BC earthquake in Palestine, a 27 BC earthquake in [[Phrygia]], and a 17 BC earthquake in [[Cyprus]]. None of them is known to have affected Antioch.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\n==Other primary sources==\nDescriptions of this earthquake may have influenced earthquake accounts in [[Biblical apocrypha]] and [[pseudepigrapha]]. Earthquake narratives in [[2 Esdras#4 Ezra|4 Ezra]], [[2 Baruch]], and the Book of Shem have all been suggested to describe the earthquake. But they do not give explicit descriptions, and they lack \"distinct historic clues\".<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> It is likely that these books used earthquakes as a [[metaphor]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThe [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] also contains an earthquake narrative which has been connected to the 31 BC earthquake. The narrative reports that [[Jonathan ben Uzziel]] used the prophets [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]] as sources for a [[targum]]. But this resulted in a great earthquake as [[divine punishment]]. A mysterious voice asked who dared to reveal such secrets to manking.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nJonathan was an actual historical figure, who lived in the 1st to 2nd centuries AD. Haggai and Zechariah's works contain explicit references to earthuakes. Malachi's works contain veiled references to earthquakes. But the narrative in Megilla may not actually describe a historical earthquake. It is a [[cautionary tale]] about the dangers caused by the disclosure of holy texts to non-Jews.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThe Book of Shem contains a prediction about a severe earthquake which would affect Galilee, when the year stars in [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]. This gives an astrological reference to an earthquake taking place between September 24 and October 23. While it has been suggested that the txt is describing the 31 BC earthquake, this seems far-fetched.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThe [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] also contain several references to earthquakes. Scholars have identified 16 explicit references to earthquakes, 6 literary allusions to earthquakes, and 5 instructions about constructing building foundations which will survive an earthquake. While some modern scholars have suggested a connection between these texts and the 31 BC earthquake, the texts never indicate any dated earthquake event. The writers of the scrolls may have simply recorded information about earthquakes in their [[collective memory]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> This not enough evidence to suggest that the writers had traumatic experiences in an earthquake.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nArchaeologists have located possible signs of earthquake damage at [[Qumran]]. These include an earthquake fault across one of the ritual baths, the fallen ceiling of a pantry, damage to the main tower, and collapse of rooms in the southeastern part of the site. It has been suggested that Qumran was abandoned following an earthquake, and there have been correlations with the 31 BC earthuake as described by Josephus.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nHowever, the same damage may be attributed to human-caused damage to Qumran. Various theories suggest that Qumran may have been attacked by [[Aristobulus II]] or [[Hyrcanus II]] between 67 and 63 BC, attacked by [[Aulus Gabinius]] in 57 BC, attacked by the [[Parthian Empire]] in 40/39 BC, and attacked by [[Antigonus II Mattathias]] between 40 and 37 BC.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nArchaeologists have searched for damage caused by the 31 BC earthquake at [[Masada]] and [[Jericho]], at Agappias (identified with [[Anthedon (Palestine)|Anthedon]], at [[Ashkelon]], at [[Antipatris]], and at [[Tiberias]]. It has been assumed that some of the intense building activities of Herod the Great may have ben motivated by a need for post-earthquake repairs. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nSo far, much of the search for archaeological evidence for this earthquake has been fruitless. The search in Tiberias may have been misguided, as the city was not even built at the time of the earthquake. The city was constructed by [[Herod Antipas]] in 18 AD, and namer after then-reigning Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] (reigned 14-37 AD). <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> \n\nThe lack of archaeological evidence suggests that this was a relatively modest earthquake in the range of 6-6.5 [[moment magnitude scale]], and not a \"major catastrophe\". <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite LSA |last=Karcz |first=Iaakov |year=2004 |title=Implications of some early Jewish sources for estimates of earthquake hazard in the Holy Land |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.393.3596&rep=rep1&type=pdf |journal=[[Annals of Geophysics]] |volume=47 |pages=759\u2013792 |accessdate=2020-04-02}}\n\n[[Category:31 BC]]\n[[Category:1st-century BC earthquakes]]\n[[Category:1st century BC in Judea]]\n", "text_old": "The '''31 BC Judea earthquake''' is mentioned in catalogues of historical earthquakes.

There were two cities called \"Diospolis\" in ancient Palestine. One was Dion (either the one in Golan or the one in Jordan), which was renamed following the conquest [[Pompey]] in 64/63 BC. The other Diospolis was the modern city of [[Lod]], which received its Roman name by order of [[Septimius Severus]] in 199 AD. Malalas may have used a latter-day source for the name. However, neither city is called \"Salamin\" in ancient sources, and neithe had known connections to Augustus.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nMalalas may have confused the name of the city, giving a Greek name to various locations of the [[Levant]] called \"Salem\" or \"Salam\". An example is [[Dayr Abu Salama]], where remnants of Greek inscriptions have been located. Another example is Tell Shalem/Salumnia, where a Roman military settlement has been located.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> It is considered improbable that Malalas made a geographic error and described more distant locations as cities in Palestine. [[Salamiyah]] was located about {{convert|250|km|abbr=on}} away from Dion-Golan. The Diopolis to the north of Laodicea was located about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} away. [[Salamis, Cyprus]] was destroyed by an earthquake during the reign of [[Constantius Chlorus]] (reigned 293-306), but it is considered unlikely that Malalas confused Cyprus with Palestine.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nAnother account by Malalas may suggest that the earthquake affected locations outside of Palestine. He reports that [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] visited [[Antioch]] c. 15 BC. Agrippa found that collapse rubble from old earthquakes had accumulated in the city's [[hippodrome]], and ordered their removal.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> Pompey had orchestrated repairs in Antioch following the [[64 BC Syria earthquake]]. The rubble which Agrippa found indicates that either Pompey's repairs were incomplete, or Antioch had suffered a second earthquake at some point between 64 and 15 BC.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> A connection between the 31 BC earthquake and the damages in Antioch is possible, though not supported by primary sources.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThere are only three known earthquakes in the late 1st century BC. The 31 BC earthquake in Palestine, a 27 BC earthquake in [[Phrygia]], and a 17 BC earthquake in [[Cyprus]]. None of them is known to have affected Antioch.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\n==Other primary sources==\nDescriptions of this earthquake may have influenced earthquake accounts in [[Biblical apocrypha]] and [[pseudepigrapha]]. Earthquake narratives in [[2 Esdras#4 Ezra|4 Ezra]], [[2 Baruch]], and the Book of Shem have all been suggested to describe the earthquake. But they do not give explicit descriptions, and they lack \"distinct historic clues\".<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> It is likely that these books used earthquakes as a [[metaphor]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThe [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] also contains an earthquake narrative which has been connected to the 31 BC earthquake. The narrative reports that [[Jonathan ben Uzziel]] used the prophets [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]] as sources for a [[targum]]. But this resulted in a great earthquake as [[divine punishment]]. A mysterious voice asked who dared to reveal such secrets to manking.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nJonathan was an actual historical figure, who lived in the 1st to 2nd centuries AD. Haggai and Zechariah's works contain explicit references to earthuakes. Malachi's works contain veiled references to earthquakes. But the narrative in Megilla may not actually describe a historical earthquake. It is a [[cautionary tale]] about the dangers caused by the disclosure of holy texts to non-Jews.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThe Book of Shem contains a prediction about a severe earthquake which would affect Galilee, when the year stars in [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]. This gives an astrological reference to an earthquake taking place between September 24 and October 23. While it has been suggested that the txt is describing the 31 BC earthquake, this seems far-fetched.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nThe [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] also contain several references to earthquakes. Scholars have identified 16 explicit references to earthquakes, 6 literary allusions to earthquakes, and 5 instructions about constructing building foundations which will survive an earthquake. While some modern scholars have suggested a connection between these texts and the 31 BC earthquake, the texts never indicate any dated earthquake event. The writers of the scrolls may have simply recorded information about earthquakes in their [[collective memory]].<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> This not enough evidence to suggest that the writers had traumatic experiences in an earthquake.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nArchaeologists have located possible signs of earthquake damage at [[Qumran]]. These include an earthquake fault across one of the ritual baths, the fallen ceiling of a pantry, damage to the main tower, and collapse of rooms in the southeastern part of the site. It has been suggested that Qumran was abandoned following an earthquake, and there have been correlations with the 31 BC earthuake as described by Josephus.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nHowever, the same damage may be attributed to human-caused damage to Qumran. Various theories suggest that Qumran may have been attacked by [[Aristobulus II]] or [[Hyrcanus II]] between 67 and 63 BC, attacked by [[Aulus Gabinius]] in 57 BC, attacked by the [[Parthian Empire]] in 40/39 BC, and attacked by [[Antigonus II Mattathias]] between 40 and 37 BC.<ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nArchaeologists have searched for damage caused by the 31 BC earthquake at [[Masada]] and [[Jericho]], at Agappias (identified with [[Anthedon (Palestine)|Anthedon]], at [[Ashkelon]], at [[Antipatris]], and at [[Tiberias]]. It has been assumed that some of the intense building activities of Herod the Great may have ben motivated by a need for post-earthquake repairs. <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\nSo far, much of the search for archaeological evidence for this earthquake has been fruitless. The search in Tiberias may have been misguided, as the city was not even built at the time of the earthquake. The city was constructed by [[Herod Antipas]] in 18 AD, and namer after then-reigning Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] (reigned 14-37 AD). <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref> \n\nThe lack of archaeological evidence suggests that this was a relatively modest earthquake in the range of 6-6.5 [[moment magnitude scale]], and not a \"major catastrophe\". <ref name=\"Karcz\">Karcz, 2004, p. 774-778</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite LSA |last=Karcz |first=Iaakov |year=2004 |title=Implications of some early Jewish sources for estimates of earthquake hazard in the Holy Land |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.393.3596&rep=rep1&type=pdf |journal=[[Annals of Geophysics]] |volume=47 |pages=759\u2013792 |accessdate=2020-04-02}}\n\n[[Category:31 BC]]\n[[Category:1st-century BC earthquakes]]\n[[Category:1st century BC in Judea]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31_BC_Judea_earthquake"}

The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, there were 687 applications with portfolios to the undergraduate BSc Architecture program with only 51 spaces, giving an overall applications to enrolments ratio of 7.42%.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.13 Section 2.0: Academic Programs, Teaching and Learning | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> With the exception of the new Bioengineering degree at McGill, for Quebec [[CEGEP]] students, admissions to the School of Architecture represent the highest average [[R score]] of students accepted into the Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.39 Section 2.7.1 Admissions | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> however in contrast to the high average R score, the lowest score admitted can sometimes be closer to the engineering average due to the importance of the portfolio in the admissions process.\n\nThe School of Architecture has one of the highest percentages of female representation at McGill, with an overall ratio of female-to-male students of approximately 2:1. As of fall&nbsp;2019, there were 119 female and 44 male undergraduate students, and 54 female and 36 male graduate students enrolled at the School. In some studios, the ratio can be as high as 8:1, such as is the case for the undergraduate class of 2021.<ref name=Enrollment />\n\n==Lecture series==\nEach year, the School of Architecture presents public lectures, exhibitions and symposia showcasing leading architects and important figures in the field. These lectures are organized by various individuals and organizations affiliated with the School. Lecture Series include lunchtime \"Brown Bag\" lectures organized by the McGill Architecture Students' Association, evening lectures sponsored by local Montreal firms such as Provencher Roy & [[NEUF Architect(e)s]],<ref name=LectureSeries /> and most notably, the annual [[David Azrieli|David J.
