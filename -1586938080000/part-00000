It is west of the foothills of the [[Atlas Mountains]]. Marrakesh is {{convert|580|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Tangier, {{convert|327|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the Moroccan capital of Rabat, {{convert|239|km|abbr=on}} south of Casablanca, and {{convert|246|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Agadir]].\n\nThe region has been inhabited by [[Berber people|Berber]] farmers since [[Neolithic]] times. The city was founded in 1062, by [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], a chieftain and cousin of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] king, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], as the imperial capital of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid Empire]]. The city was one of Morocco's four [[Imperial cities of Morocco|imperial cities]]. In the 12th century, the Almoravids built many [[madrasa]]s (Quranic schools) and mosques in Marrakesh that bear [[Andalusia]]n influences. The red walls of the city, built by [[Ali ibn Yusuf]] in 1122\u20131123, and various buildings constructed in red sandstone during this period, have given the city the nickname of the \"Red City\" or \"[[Ochre City]]\". Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural, religious, and trading center for the [[Maghreb]] and sub-Saharan Africa. [[Jemaa el-Fnaa]] is the busiest square in Africa.\n\nAfter a period of decline, the city was surpassed by [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], but in the early 16th century, Marrakesh again became the capital of the kingdom. The city regained its preeminence under wealthy [[Saadian dynasty|Saadian]] sultans [[Abu Abdallah al-Qaim]] and [[Ahmad al-Mansur]], who embellished the city with sumptuous palaces such as the [[El Badi Palace]] (1578) and restored many ruined monuments. Beginning in the 17th century, the city became popular among [[sufism|Sufi]] pilgrims for Morocco's seven patron saints, who are entombed here. In 1912 the French Protectorate in Morocco was established and [[T'hami El Glaoui]] became Pasha of Marrakesh and held this position nearly throughout the protectorate until the role was dissolved upon the independence of Morocco and the reestablishment of the monarchy in 1956. In 2009, Marrakesh mayor [[Fatima Zahra Mansouri]] became the second woman to be elected mayor in Morocco.\n\nMarrakesh comprises an old fortified city packed with vendors and their stalls. This [[medina quarter]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/331|title=Medina of Marrakesh|accessdate=26 January 2018|publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]}}</ref> Today it is one of the busiest cities in [[Africa]] and serves as a major economic center and tourist destination. [[Tourism]] is strongly advocated by the reigning Moroccan monarch, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]], with the goal of doubling the number of tourists visiting Morocco to 20&nbsp;million by 2020. Despite the economic recession, real estate and hotel development in Marrakesh have grown dramatically in the 21st century. Marrakesh is particularly popular with the French, and numerous French celebrities own property in the city. Marrakesh has the largest traditional market (''[[souk]]'') in Morocco, with some 18 ''souks'' selling wares ranging from traditional [[Berber carpet]]s to modern consumer electronics. Crafts employ a significant percentage of the population, who primarily sell their products to tourists.\n\nMarrakesh is served by [[Menara International Airport|M\u00e9nara International Airport]] and by [[Marrakesh railway station]] which connects the city to [[Casablanca]] and northern Morocco. Marrakesh has several universities and schools, including [[Cadi Ayyad University]]. A number of Moroccan football clubs are here, including [[Najm de Marrakech]], [[KAC Marrakech]], [[Mouloudia de Marrakech]] and [[Chez Ali Club de Marrakech]]. The [[Marrakesh Street Circuit]] hosts the [[World Touring Car Championship]], [[Auto GP]] and [[FIA Formula Two Championship (2009\u20132012)|FIA Formula Two Championship]] races.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe exact meaning of the name is debated.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=948}} One possible origin of the name Marrakesh is from the [[Berber language|Berber]] (Amazigh) words ''amur (n) akush'' (\u2d30\u2d4e\u2d53\u2d54 \u2d4f \u2d30\u2d3d\u2d53\u2d5b), which means \"Land of God\".{{sfn|Nanjira|2010|p=208}} According to historian Susan Searight, however, the town's name was first documented in an 11th-century manuscript in the [[Qarawiyyin]] library in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], where its meaning was given as \"country of the sons of Kush\".{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=378}} The word ''mur'' {{sfn|Egginton|Pitz|2010|p=11}} is used now in Berber mostly in the feminine form ''tamurt''. The same word \"mur\" appears in [[Mauretania]], the North African kingdom from antiquity, although the link remains controversial as this name possibly originates from \u03bc\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ''mavros'', the [[ancient Greek]] word for black.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=948}} The common English spelling is \"Marrakesh\",{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=588}}{{sfn|Cornell|1998|p=15}} although \"Marrakech\" (the [[French language|French]] spelling) is also widely used.{{sfn|Nanjira|2010|p=208}} The name is spelt ''M\u1e5b\u1e5bakc'' in the [[Berber Latin alphabet]], ''Marraquexe'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Marraquech'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]],{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=588}}{{sfn|Cornell|1998|p=15}} and \"Mer-raksh\" in [[Moroccan Arabic]].{{sfn|Egginton|Pitz|2010|p=11}}\n\nFrom medieval times until around the beginning of the 20th century, the entire country of Morocco was known as the \"Kingdom of Marrakesh\", as the kingdom's [[History of Morocco|historic]] capital city was often Marrakesh.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=593}}{{sfn|Gottreich|2007|p=10}} The name for Morocco is still \"Marrakesh\" to this day in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0634) as well as many other South Asian languages.

The square attracted dwellers from the surrounding desert and mountains to trade here, and stalls were raised in the square from early in its history. The square attracted tradesmen, snake charmers (\"wild, dark, frenzied men with long disheveled hair falling over their naked shoulders\"), dancing boys of the [[Chleuh]] Atlas tribe, and musicians playing [[Bagpipes|pipes]], [[tambourine]]s and [[African drum]]s.{{sfn|Barrows|2004|pp=76\u201378}} Richard Hamilton said that Jemaa el-Fnaa once \"reeked of Berber particularism, of backward-looking, ill-educated countrymen, rather than the reformist, pan-Arab internationalism and command economy that were the imagined future.\"{{sfn|Hamilton|2011|p=13}} Today the square attracts people from a diversity of social and ethnic backgrounds and tourists from all around the world.

Paul Sullivan cites the ''souks'' as the principal shopping attraction in the city: \"A honeycomb of intricately connected alleyways, this fundamental section of the old city is a micro-medina in itself, comprising a dizzying number of stalls and shops that range from itsy kiosks no bigger than an elf's wardrobe to scruffy store-fronts that morph into glittering [[Aladdin's Cave]]s once you're inside.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=148}} Historically the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist but with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns.{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=148}} [[Haggling]] is still a very important part of trade in the souks.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=51}}\n\nOne of the largest ''souks'' is [[Souk Semmarine]], which sells everything from brightly coloured bejewelled sandals and slippers and leather pouffes to jewellery and kaftans.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=50}} [[Souk Ableuh]] contains stalls which specialize in [[lemon]]s, [[Chili pepper|chili]]s, [[caper]]s, [[Pickling|pickle]]s, green, red, and black [[olive]]s, and mint, a common ingredient of Moroccan cuisine and tea. Similarly, [[Souk Kchacha]] specializes in dried fruit and nuts, including [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]], [[figs]], [[walnut]]s, [[cashew]]s and [[apricot]]s.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=49}} Rahba Qedima contains stalls selling hand-woven baskets, natural [[perfume]]s, knitted hats, scarves, tee shirts, Ramadan tea, [[ginseng]], and [[alligator]] and [[iguana]] skins.

The walls are made of a distinct orange-red clay and chalk, giving the city its nickname as the \"red city\"; they stand up to {{convert|19|ft}} high and have 20 gates and 200 towers along them.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=43}} [[Bab Agnaou]] was built in the 12th century during the Almohad dynasty. The [[Berber languages|Berber]] name Agnaou, like [[Gnaoua]], refers to people of Sub-Saharan African origin (cf. Akal-n-iguinawen \u2013 land of the black). The gate was called Bab al Kohl (the word ''kohl'' also meaning \"black\") or Bab al Qsar (palace gate) in some historical sources. The corner-pieces are embellished with floral decorations. This ornamentation is framed by three panels marked with an inscription from the [[Quran]] in [[Maghrebi script]] using foliated [[Kufic]] letters, which were also used in [[Al-Andalus]]. Bab Agnaou was renovated and its opening reduced in size during the rule of sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]]. [[Bab Aghmat]] is east of the Jewish and Muslim cemeteries, and is near the tomb of [[Ali ibn Yusuf]].{{sfn|Gottreich|2007|p=117}} [[Bab Berrima]] with its solid towers stands near the Badi Palace.{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=402}} [[Bab er Robb]] (meaning \"Lord's gate\") is a southern exit from the city, near Bab Agnaou.

They were built around 1130 by the Almohad ruler [[Abd al-Mu'min]]. The name ''menara'' derives from the [[pavilion]] with its small green pyramid roof (''menzeh''). The pavilion was built during the 16th century [[Saadi dynasty]] and renovated in 1869 by sultan [[Abderrahmane of Morocco]], who used to stay here in summertime.{{sfn|Febvre|1988|p=1401}}\n[[File:Medina walls of Marrakech (Dec. 2009).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Medina walls of Marrakesh]]\nThe pavilion and a nearby [[Basin (maritime)|artificial lake]] are surrounded by [[orchard]]s and [[olive grove]]s. The lake was created to [[Irrigation|irrigate]] the surrounding gardens and orchards using a sophisticated system of underground channels called a ''[[qanat]]''. The basin is supplied with water through an old [[hydraulic system]] which conveys water from the mountains approximately {{convert|30|km}} away from Marrakesh.

The main palaces are [[El Badi Palace]], the [[Royal Palace (Marrakesh)|Royal Palace]] and [[Bahia Palace]]. ''[[Moroccan riad|Riad]]s'' (Moroccan mansions) are common in Marrakesh. Based on the design of the Roman villa, they are characterized by an open central garden courtyard surrounded by high walls. This construction provided the occupants with privacy and lowered the temperature within the building.{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=104}} Buildings of note inside the Medina are Riad Argana, Riad Obry, Riad Enija, Riad el Mezouar, Riad Frans Ankone, Dar Moussaine, Riad Lotus, Riad Elixir, Riad les Bougainvilliers, Riad Dar Foundouk, Dar Marzotto, Dar Darma, and Riad Pinco Pallino.

fourth largest city in the [[Morocco|Kingdom of Morocco]].<ref name=citydefn/> It is the capital of the mid-southwestern region of [[Marrakesh-Safi]]. It is west of the foothills of the [[Atlas Mountains]]. Marrakesh is {{convert|580|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Tangier, {{convert|327|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the Moroccan capital of Rabat, {{convert|239|km|abbr=on}} south of Casablanca, and {{convert|246|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Agadir]].\n\nThe region has been inhabited by [[Berber people|Berber]] farmers since [[Neolithic]] times. The city was founded in 1062, by [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], a chieftain and cousin of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] king, [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], as the imperial capital of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid Empire]]. The city was one of Morocco's four [[Imperial cities of Morocco|imperial cities]]. In the 12th century, the Almoravids built many [[madrasa]]s (Quranic schools) and mosques in Marrakesh that bear [[Andalusia]]n influences. The red walls of the city, built by [[Ali ibn Yusuf]] in 1122\u20131123, and various buildings constructed in red sandstone during this period, have given the city the nickname of the \"Red City\" or \"Ochre City\". Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural, religious, and trading center for the [[Maghreb]] and sub-Saharan Africa. [[Jemaa el-Fnaa]] is the busiest square in Africa.\n\nAfter a period of decline, the city was surpassed by [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], but in the early 16th century, Marrakesh again became the capital of the kingdom. The city regained its preeminence under wealthy [[Saadian dynasty|Saadian]] sultans [[Abu Abdallah al-Qaim]] and [[Ahmad al-Mansur]], who embellished the city with sumptuous palaces such as the [[El Badi Palace]] (1578) and restored many ruined monuments. Beginning in the 17th century, the city became popular among [[sufism|Sufi]] pilgrims for Morocco's seven patron saints, who are entombed here. In 1912 the French Protectorate in Morocco was established and [[T'hami El Glaoui]] became Pasha of Marrakesh and held this position nearly throughout the protectorate until the role was dissolved upon the independence of Morocco and the reestablishment of the monarchy in 1956. In 2009, Marrakesh mayor [[Fatima Zahra Mansouri]] became the second woman to be elected mayor in Morocco.\n\nMarrakesh comprises an old fortified city packed with vendors and their stalls. This [[medina quarter]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/331|title=Medina of Marrakesh|accessdate=26 January 2018|publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]}}</ref> Today it is one of the busiest cities in Africa and serves as a major economic center and tourist destination. Tourism is strongly advocated by the reigning Moroccan monarch, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]], with the goal of doubling the number of tourists visiting Morocco to 20&nbsp;million by 2020. Despite the economic recession, real estate and hotel development in Marrakesh have grown dramatically in the 21st century. Marrakesh is particularly popular with the French, and numerous French celebrities own property in the city. Marrakesh has the largest traditional market (''[[souk]]'') in Morocco, with some 18 ''souks'' selling wares ranging from traditional [[Berber carpet]]s to modern consumer electronics. Crafts employ a significant percentage of the population, who primarily sell their products to tourists.\n\nMarrakesh is served by [[Menara International Airport|M\u00e9nara International Airport]] and by [[Marrakesh railway station]] which connects the city to [[Casablanca]] and northern Morocco. Marrakesh has several universities and schools, including [[Cadi Ayyad University]]. A number of Moroccan football clubs are here, including [[Najm de Marrakech]], [[KAC Marrakech]], [[Mouloudia de Marrakech]] and [[Chez Ali Club de Marrakech]]. The [[Marrakesh Street Circuit]] hosts the [[World Touring Car Championship]], [[Auto GP]] and [[FIA Formula Two Championship (2009\u20132012)|FIA Formula Two Championship]] races.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe exact meaning of the name is debated.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=948}} One possible origin of the name Marrakesh is from the [[Berber language|Berber]] (Amazigh) words ''amur (n) akush'' (\u2d30\u2d4e\u2d53\u2d54 \u2d4f \u2d30\u2d3d\u2d53\u2d5b), which means \"Land of God\".{{sfn|Nanjira|2010|p=208}} According to historian Susan Searight, however, the town's name was first documented in an 11th-century manuscript in the [[Qarawiyyin]] library in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]], where its meaning was given as \"country of the sons of Kush\".{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=378}} The word ''mur'' {{sfn|Egginton|Pitz|2010|p=11}} is used now in Berber mostly in the feminine form ''tamurt''. The same word \"mur\" appears in [[Mauretania]], the North African kingdom from antiquity, although the link remains controversial as this name possibly originates from \u03bc\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 ''mavros'', the [[ancient Greek]] word for black.{{sfn|Shillington|2005|p=948}} The common English spelling is \"Marrakesh\",{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=588}}{{sfn|Cornell|1998|p=15}} although \"Marrakech\" (the [[French language|French]] spelling) is also widely used.{{sfn|Nanjira|2010|p=208}} The name is spelt ''M\u1e5b\u1e5bakc'' in the [[Berber Latin alphabet]], ''Marraquexe'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Marraquech'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]],{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=588}}{{sfn|Cornell|1998|p=15}} and \"Mer-raksh\" in [[Moroccan Arabic]].{{sfn|Egginton|Pitz|2010|p=11}}\n\nFrom medieval times until around the beginning of the 20th century, the entire country of Morocco was known as the \"Kingdom of Marrakesh\", as the kingdom's [[History of Morocco|historic]] capital city was often Marrakesh.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=593}}{{sfn|Gottreich|2007|p=10}} The name for Morocco is still \"Marrakesh\" to this day in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]] (\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0634) as well as many other South Asian languages. Various European names for Morocco (Marruecos, Marrocos, Maroc, Marokko, etc.) are directly derived from the Berber word ''Murakush''. Conversely, the city itself was in earlier times simply called ''Marocco City'' (or similar) by travelers from abroad. The name of the city and the country diverged after the [[Treaty of Fez]] divided Morocco into a [[French protectorate in Morocco]] and [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], but the old interchangeable usage lasted widely until about the interregnum of [[Mohammed Ben Aarafa]] (1953\u20131955).<ref name=\"IbpUSA2006\">{{cite book|author1=International Business Publications |title=Morocco Country Study Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GjrAeMS1dIC&pg=PA23|accessdate=29 June 2013|date=1 April 2006|publisher=International Business Publications|isbn=978-0-7397-1514-7|page=23}}</ref> The latter episode set in motion the country's return to independence, when Morocco officially became ''al-Mamlaka al-Ma\u0121ribiyya'' (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629) (\"The Maghreb Kingdom\"), its name no longer referring to the city of Marrakesh. Marrakesh is known by a variety of nicknames, including the \"Red City\", the \"Ochre City\" and \"the Daughter of the Desert\", and has been the focus of poetic analogies such as one comparing the city to \"a drum that beats an [[Africa]]n identity into the complex soul of Morocco.\"{{sfn|Rogerson|Lavington|2004|p=xi}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Marrakesh|Timeline of Marrakesh}}\nThe Marrakesh area was inhabited by Berber farmers from [[Neolithic]] times, and numerous stone implements have been unearthed in the area.{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=378}} Marrakesh was founded in 1062 (454 in the [[Hijri year|Hijri calendar]]) by [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], chieftain and second cousin of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] king [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] (c. 1061\u20131106).{{Sfn|Messier|2010|p=180}}{{sfn|Naylor|2009|p=90}}{{sfn|Gerteiny|1967|p=28}} Under the berber dynasty of the Almoravids, pious and learned warriors from the desert, numerous mosques and [[madrasa]]s (Quranic schools) were built, developing the community into a trading centre for the [[Maghreb]] and sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name=\"International2005\">{{cite book|title=The Rotarian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DjMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=July 2005|publisher=Rotary International|page=14|issn=0035-838X}}</ref> Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural and religious centre, supplanting [[Aghmat]], which had long been the capital of [[Haouz]].

He preached against the Almoravids and influenced a revolt which succeeded in bringing about the fall of nearby [[Aghmat]], but stopped short of bringing down Marrakesh following an unsuccessful siege in 1130.{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=378}} The [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], [[Masmuda|Masmouda]] tribesmen from the [[High Atlas]] mountains who practiced orthodox Islam, took the city in 1147 under leader [[Abd al-Mu'min]].{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=378}} After a long siege and the killing of some 7,000 people, the last of the Almoravids were exterminated apart from those who sought exile in the [[Balearic Islands]].

After two successive exiles to [[Corsica]] and [[Madagascar]], Mohammed Ben Youssef was allowed to return to Morocco in November 1955, bringing an end to the despotic rule of Glaoui over Marrakesh and the surrounding region.

The square attracted dwellers from the surrounding desert and mountains to trade here, and stalls were raised in the square from early in its history. The square attracted tradesmen, snake charmers (\"wild, dark, frenzied men with long disheveled hair falling over their naked shoulders\"), dancing boys of the [[Chleuh]] Atlas tribe, and musicians playing [[Bagpipes|pipes]], [[tambourine]]s and [[African drum]]s.{{sfn|Barrows|2004|pp=76\u201378}} Richard Hamilton said that Jemaa el-Fnaa once \"reeked of Berber particularism, of backward-looking, ill-educated countrymen, rather than the reformist, pan-Arab internationalism and command economy that were the imagined future.\"{{sfn|Hamilton|2011|p=13}} Today the square attracts people from a diversity of social and ethnic backgrounds and tourists from all around the world.

Paul Sullivan cites the ''souks'' as the principal shopping attraction in the city: \"A honeycomb of intricately connected alleyways, this fundamental section of the old city is a micro-medina in itself, comprising a dizzying number of stalls and shops that range from itsy kiosks no bigger than an elf's wardrobe to scruffy store-fronts that morph into glittering [[Aladdin's Cave]]s once you're inside.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=148}} Historically the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist but with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns.{{sfn|Sullivan|2006|p=148}} [[Haggling]] is still a very important part of trade in the souks.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=51}}\n\nOne of the largest ''souks'' is [[Souk Semmarine]], which sells everything from brightly coloured bejewelled sandals and slippers and leather pouffes to jewellery and kaftans.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=50}} [[Souk Ableuh]] contains stalls which specialize in [[lemon]]s, [[Chili pepper|chili]]s, [[caper]]s, [[Pickling|pickle]]s, green, red, and black [[olive]]s, and mint, a common ingredient of Moroccan cuisine and tea. Similarly, [[Souk Kchacha]] specializes in dried fruit and nuts, including [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]], [[figs]], [[walnut]]s, [[cashew]]s and [[apricot]]s.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=49}} Rahba Qedima contains stalls selling hand-woven baskets, natural [[perfume]]s, knitted hats, scarves, tee shirts, Ramadan tea, [[ginseng]], and [[alligator]] and [[iguana]] skins.

The walls are made of a distinct orange-red clay and chalk, giving the city its nickname as the \"red city\"; they stand up to {{convert|19|ft}} high and have 20 gates and 200 towers along them.{{sfn|Christiani|2009|p=43}} [[Bab Agnaou]] was built in the 12th century during the Almohad dynasty. The [[Berber languages|Berber]] name Agnaou, like [[Gnaoua]], refers to people of Sub-Saharan African origin (cf. Akal-n-iguinawen \u2013 land of the black). The gate was called Bab al Kohl (the word ''kohl'' also meaning \"black\") or Bab al Qsar (palace gate) in some historical sources. The corner-pieces are embellished with floral decorations. This ornamentation is framed by three panels marked with an inscription from the [[Quran]] in [[Maghrebi script]] using foliated [[Kufic]] letters, which were also used in [[Al-Andalus]]. Bab Agnaou was renovated and its opening reduced in size during the rule of sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]]. [[Bab Aghmat]] is east of the Jewish and Muslim cemeteries, and is near the tomb of [[Ali ibn Yusuf]].{{sfn|Gottreich|2007|p=117}} [[Bab Berrima]] with its solid towers stands near the Badi Palace.{{sfn|Searight|1999|p=402}} [[Bab er Robb]] (meaning \"Lord's gate\") is a southern exit from the city, near Bab Agnaou.

They were built around 1130 by the Almohad ruler [[Abd al-Mu'min]]. The name ''menara'' derives from the [[pavilion]] with its small green pyramid roof (''menzeh''). The pavilion was built during the 16th century [[Saadi dynasty]] and renovated in 1869 by sultan [[Abderrahmane of Morocco]], who used to stay here in summertime.{{sfn|Febvre|1988|p=1401}}\n[[File:Medina walls of Marrakech (Dec. 2009).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Medina walls of Marrakesh]]\nThe pavilion and a nearby [[Basin (maritime)|artificial lake]] are surrounded by [[orchard]]s and [[olive grove]]s. The lake was created to [[Irrigation|irrigate]] the surrounding gardens and orchards using a sophisticated system of underground channels called a ''[[qanat]]''. The basin is supplied with water through an old [[hydraulic system]] which conveys water from the mountains approximately {{convert|30|km}} away from Marrakesh.

The main palaces are [[El Badi Palace]], the [[Royal Palace (Marrakesh)|Royal Palace]] and [[Bahia Palace]]. ''[[Moroccan riad|Riad]]s'' (Moroccan mansions) are common in Marrakesh. Based on the design of the Roman villa, they are characterized by an open central garden courtyard surrounded by high walls. This construction provided the occupants with privacy and lowered the temperature within the building.{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=104}} Buildings of note inside the Medina are Riad Argana, Riad Obry, Riad Enija, Riad el Mezouar, Riad Frans Ankone, Dar Moussaine, Riad Lotus, Riad Elixir, Riad les Bougainvilliers, Riad Dar Foundouk, Dar Marzotto, Dar Darma, and Riad Pinco Pallino.

As the technology of computers and internet sharing developed, a variety of those genres started to fuse in order to see new styles emerging. Terms like \"contemporary\", \"nu\", \"revival\", \"alternative\", and \"post\" are added to various genres titles in order to differentiate them from past styles, [[nu-disco]] and [[post-punk revival]] as notable examples.\n\nIn this decade, [[grime (music)|grime]] was a genre invented in the UK, while [[Chillwave]] became popular in the United States.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/culture-review-of-the-noughties | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=High points of the noughties | date=December 27, 2009 | access-date=February 9, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210120907/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/culture-review-of-the-noughties | archive-date=February 10, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe continued development of studio recording software and electronic elements was observed, through this decade. One such example is the usage of [[pitch correction]] software, such as [[auto-tune]] that appeared in the late 1990s. Another great impact to this decade was the ongoing development of the [[internet]] and user-friendly [[media player (application software)|media player]]<nowiki/>s, such as [[iTunes]], and music and video sharing websites such as Napster and [[YouTube]], respectively.\n\nThe popularity of [[teen pop]] carried over from the 1990s with acts such as [[*NSYNC]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Christina Aguilera]] dominating the charts in the earlier years of the decade.\n\n[[Contemporary R&B]] was one of the most popular genres of the decade (especially in the early and mid 2000s), with artists like [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], and [[Rihanna]].

The number one selling crunk artist as well as paving the way to its popularity was [[Lil Jon]] who shot to fame in 2003, with his group [[The Eastside Boyz]]. Then snap music became a staple for the remainder of the decade in hip hop with artists such as, [[Dem Franchize Boys]], [[D4L]], [[Yung Joc]], [[Soulja Boy]], [[Unk]], [[Jibbs]], [[Da Backwudz]], [[Purple Ribbon All-Stars]], [[V.I.C.]], [[GS Boyz]], the [[Fast Life Yungstaz]], [[New Boyz]] and [[Cali Swag District]], to name a few. These artists have all contributed to starting some dance craze accompanied to one of their songs, with the most popular being Soulja's \"Crank Dat\" move, which gained popularity throughout 2007 and 2008. By the end of the decade this sound began to decline in popularity as well as the dance-crazes that came along with them, as pioneer hip hop artists and hip hop purists such as [[Ice-T]] and [[Nas]] denouncing the crunk and snap craze, with Nas's 2006 song \"Hip Hop Is Dead\" brought dislike to the new path hip hop was directing.\n\nBy early 2000, the [[Hyphy]] movement became popular in Northern California, specifically the Bay Area. Bay Area artists like [[Mac Dre]], [[Keak Da Sneak]], [[E-40]], [[The Pack (group)|The Pack]], and [[Too Short]] were prominent Hyphy rappers. Hyphy culture included the use of party drugs like ecstasy, slang terms like \u201cGo dumb\u201d and \u201cyadadamean\u201d, [[Ghost Riding]], and Sideshows.\n\nBy mid-2008 the sound began to fade as indie rap and alternative began to come in with artists such as [[Kid Cudi]] and [[The Cool Kids]], who fused hip hop with electro and hipster influences. This trend continued on into the early 2010s. [[Alternative hip hop]], almost unknown in the mainstream, except for a few crossover acts, evolved throughout the decade with the help of artists such as [[Mos Def]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[The Roots]], [[MF Doom]], [[Aesop Rock]], and [[Common (rapper)|Common]], who achieved unheard-of success for their field. Throughout the 2000s, Alternative Hip hop continued its philosophical, positive, and complex lyrical subject matter, while denouncing materialism, fashion, and money. This subgenre also includes spoken word and a branch of slam poetry. The subgenre could be said to be related to both the old school hip-hop culture of the 1980s and 1990s, and the [[indie rock]] and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] subcultures.\n\nBy 1999, more 2000s styled glam started coming in, along with [[dirty South (music)|dirty south]] and [[crunk]], with artists such as [[Mannie Fresh]], [[Cam'ron]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Ludacris]], [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Ying Yang Twins]], [[Neptunes]], [[Timbaland]] and [[Jay-Z]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/nov/26/notes-noughties-hip-hop | work=The Guardian | location=UK | title=Simon Reynolds's Notes on the noughties: When will hip-hop hurry up and die? | date=November 26, 2009 | accessdate=August 25, 2011 | first1=Simon | last1=Reynolds | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411211603/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/nov/26/notes-noughties-hip-hop | archive-date=April 11, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Auto-Tune]] became popular by mid-2007, with R&B artist [[T-Pain]] starting the craze.

[[Green Day]] kick-started the 2000s with the release of their sixth studio album ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' in 2000 to lukewarm{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} success. The following year, [[Blink-182]] released their fourth studio album ''[[Take Off Your Pants And Jacket]]'' in 2001 which went on to sell 14 million copies worldwide. It was a commercial and critical success, debuting at number one{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] within its first week of release and securing the status of the pop punk trio as one of biggest bands of the genre. Also in that year, [[Canadians|Canadian]] band Sum 41 released their debut album ''[[All Killer No Filler]]'', which went platinum in the United States. The second-wave bands dominated the pop punk genre in the early years with bands like [[Good Charlotte]], [[New Found Glory]], [[Simple Plan]] and [[Sum 41]] receiving platinum status and gaining large fan bases worldwide{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. In 2002, [[Avril Lavigne]] became popular in the [[pop punk]] scene thanks to her pop punk-based sound, and was arguably the most prominent artist to take this new direction in pop music, with hits such as \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\" and \"[[Sk8er Boi]]\". In 2003, [[Blink-182]] released their untitled album ''[[blink-182 (album)|blink-182]]'', which demonstrated a darker and more mature tone{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} than previous albums. This was mainly due to the side-project [[Box Car Racer]]. Even so, the album was yet another commercial and critical success. It was to be their last album released before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2005. The band would reunite four years later. After their 1994 breakthrough, [[Green Day]]'s fame was fading{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, mainly due to rising popularity of other bands like [[Good Charlotte]] and [[Sum 41]]. Realizing this, they retreated to the studio and produced their seventh studio album ''[[American Idiot]]'' released in 2004. It saw a significant sales boost, selling 14 million copies worldwide and awarding the band 3 Grammy awards{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. [[Fall Out Boy]]'s ''[[From Under The Cork Tree]]'' gained commercial success in 2005 and put the band on the pop punk map. [[Fall Out Boy]]\u2019s follow up album [[Infinity On High]] went number 1 on the billboard 200 in 2007{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. The last successful pop punk album of the decade{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} was [[Green Day]]'s eighth studio album ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'' released in 2009 which achieved their best chart performance to date by reaching number one on the album charts of various countries as well as winning a Grammy{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, including the [[United States]] [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the [[European Top 100 Albums]], and the [[United Kingdom Albums Chart]].\n\n==== Post-grunge ====\n[[File:Chad Kroeger.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Nickelback]] has sold over 50 million albums and was one of the biggest [[post-grunge]] bands of the decade.]]\n[[Post-grunge]] continued to be popular in the 2000s, with the genre reaching its peak in the early years of the decade.

In 2002, heavy metal saw a new subgenre called [[deathcore]]{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, which would gain moderate success from 2005 to present day.\n\n==== Hard rock/Heavy metal ====\n[[AC/DC]] released ''[[Stiff Upper Lip]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]'' in 2008{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. [[Guns N' Roses]] released the long-awaited ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' in 2008 after over a decade of work by [[Axl Rose]]. [[Metallica]] released two albums in the 2000s, ''[[St. Anger]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Death Magnetic]]'' in 2008{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. [[Aerosmith]] released the platinum-selling ''[[Just Push Play]]'' in 2001 followed by the blues-infused ''[[Honkin' on Bobo]]'' in 2004; the band also toured every year of the decade except 2008{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. [[Bon Jovi]] released five albums during the decade: ''[[Crush (Bon Jovi album)|Crush]]'' (2000), ''[[Bounce (Bon Jovi album)|Bounce]]'' (2002), ''[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi album)|Have a Nice Day]]'' (2005), ''[[Lost Highway (Bon Jovi album)|Lost Highway]]'' (2007), and ''[[The Circle (Bon Jovi album)|The Circle]]'' (2009){{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. ''Crush'' fared best{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, going double platinum, and spawning the hit \"[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]\", while ''Have a Nice Day'' and ''Lost Highway'' also launched Top 40 singles{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, went platinum, and saw the band mix hard rock with country. Bon Jovi's [[Lost Highway Tour]] was the highest-grossing tour of 2008{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}.\n\n==== Emo ====\n[[Emo]] broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of [[Jimmy Eat World]]'s ''[[Bleed American]]''.

Spears' \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!...I Did It Again]]\" and Aguilera's \"[[Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)]]\" became huge hits in the year 2000. By 2001 and 2002, however, the teen-pop trend faded due to [[modern R&B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] influenced music that later dominated throughout the middle of the decade. Spears' 2001 album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' and Aguilera's 2002 album ''[[Stripped (Christina Aguilera album)|Stripped]]'' are examples of teen pop artists transitioning from teen pop to more grown-up, modern R&B influenced records.\n\n[[Boy bands]] maintained their popularity during the beginning of the decade, but their popularity also faded, with the exception of [[Backstreet Boys]], who continued their popularity post-2005, (after a short hiatus between 2002 and 2004). As the typical \"boy band\" sound was no longer mainstream, they began to transition to more of an adult contemporary, soft-rock and ballad styles of music for the remainder of the decade. By 2003, records by boy bands were very sparse on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and some members of boy bands left to pursue other projects and solo endeavors, such as [[Jesse McCartney]] from [[Dream Street]], [[Nick Lachey]] from [[98 Degrees]],  and most successfully [[Justin Timberlake]] from [['N Sync]], whose foray into [[Blue-eyed soul]] R&B/Pop spawned a successful solo career. A new strain of boy bands, such as [[V Factory]], Varsity Fanclub, [[Click Five]], [[NLT (band)|NLT]], and the [[Jonas Brothers]], emerged at the end of the decade, but this new generation of boy bands did not reach the glamor and success of those of the 1990s and early 2000s. Girl groups maintained a steady popularity through the 2000s, with groups such as [[Destiny's Child]] (which disbanded in 2005) setting the fuel for the most successful girl group of the decade, the [[Pussycat Dolls]] (2003\u201310). Other girl groups included [[Danity Kane]] (2005\u201309), [[Dream]] (2000-03), and [[Sugababes]].\n\n[[Pop rock]] artist [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] released her debut album ''[[Can't Take Me Home]]'' in 2000, including \"[[Get the Party Started]]\", and later, her ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'' album in which features \"[[Stupid Girls]]\" and [[Who Knew Pink|\"Who Knew\"]].

She was highly successful in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, South Africa and South America, but had only minor success in her native United States. She is one of the fastest and biggest-selling artists of the new millennium.\n\nIn 2001, triple-threat entertainer [[Jennifer Lopez]] debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart with her [[J.Lo]] album and in addition her film, ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'', opened at number one at the box office at the same time making her the first actress and singer in history to have both a film and an album at number one in the same week.\n\nArtists such as [[Janet Jackson]], [[Anastacia]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Mariah Carey]], and [[Nelly Furtado]] experienced revived success. [[Justin Timberlake]] shot to stardom with his debut solo album, ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' (2002). In 2005, [[Cher]] ended her 3-year-long \"[[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour|Farewell Tour]]\" which became the highest grossing female and solo tour at that time. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] enjoyed success throughout the decade. Her albums ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]'' (2000) and ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005) are among the best-selling of the decade. Both were universally acclaimed by critics. The first was also nominated for five [[Grammy Award]]s while the second won one. Madonna also had four highly successful tours in the 2000s. [[The Re-Invention Tour]] which grossed $125 million in just 56 shows making it the highest grossing of 2004, [[The Confessions Tour]] went on to gross over $190 million in 60 shows becoming the highest-grossing tour by a female ever. Her final tour in 2008/09 was [[Sticky and Sweet Tour]] which become the highest grossing female tour and the [[Highest grossing tours|highest grossing solo tour]] of all-time making $408 million in 85 shows.\n\n[[Justin Timberlake]] released his sophomore studio album ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'' in 2006, producing the chart-topping singles \"[[SexyBack]]\", \"[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]\", and \"[[What Goes Around... Comes Around]]\", and winning four [[Grammy Award]]s for the record.\n\n[[Fergie (singer)]] released her first solo album in 2006 called ''[[The Dutchess]]''. The album produced five top five singles in the United States, including three number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100, ''[[London Bridge]]'', ''[[Big Girls Don't Cry (Fergie song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]'', and ''[[Glamorous (Fergie song)|Glamorous]]'' , as well as the number two single ''[[Fergalicious]]'' and the number five single ''[[Clumsy (Fergie song)|Clumsy]]''. All five of the aforementioned singles have sold over two million digital downloads each in the United States, thus setting a new record in the digital era for the most multi-platinum singles from one album.''[[The Dutchess]]'' sold over six million copies worldwide becoming one of the most successful albums of the era.\n\nWhile predominantly focusing on R&B music during this time, Beyonc\u00e9 also ventured into a pop sound with her third studio album [[I Am... Sasha Fierce]] in 2008, producing the top-ten singles \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It) (#1), \"If I Were a Boy (#3), \"Halo\" (#5), and \"Sweet Dreams\" (#10). The album and its accompanying songs went on to win five [[Grammy Award]]s, helping Beyonc\u00e9 set a record for the most Grammy Awards won by a female artist in one night.\n\n[[Lady Gaga]] took the latter part of the decade by storm and revived the electronic influence of pop music that had not been prominent since 2000. Her debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), reached number-one in [[Canada]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] and topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'' [[Top Electronic Albums]] chart. Its first two singles, \"[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]\" and \"[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]\", became international number-one hits, topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in the United States as well as other countries. The album later earned a total of six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and won awards for [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Electronic/Dance Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]]. By the fourth quarter of 2009 she had released her second studio album ''[[The Fame Monster]]'', with the global chart-topping lead single \"[[Bad Romance]]\".\n\nIn 2001 [[Michael Jackson]], one of [[popular music]]'s most successful artists of all-times, released his final studio album ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'', though it did not receive a lot of exposure compared to previous releases.

''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', July 8, 2009.</ref>\n[[File:Tisdale-Grabeel.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Ashley Tisdale]] and [[Lucas Grabeel]] are members of the ''[[High School Musical]]'', [[Disney]]'s musical and soundtracks most successful of the 2000s.]]\nChildren's music rose significantly in sales, especially with Disney (''[[The Cheetah Girls (film)|The Cheetah Girls]]'', ''[[High School Musical]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'', and [[The Jonas Brothers]] among others). All The Cheetah Girls, High School Musical and Hannah Montana albums were among the best-sellers of 2006 and 2007 and reached the number 1 position, left many artists produced by [[Disney]] in the 2000s, [[The Cheetah Girls (band)|The Cheetah Girls]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Demi Lovato]], Jonas Brothers, [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]], the best-selling artists of the decade.\n\nThe musical style of the 1980s influenced pop music to some extent in the later stages of the decade, especially around late 2009, as seen in [[Rihanna]]'s hit \"[[SOS (Rihanna song)|SOS]]\" (a sampling of [[Soft Cell]]'s \"[[Tainted Love]]\"), [[Lumidee]]'s \"[[She's Like The Wind]]\" and [[Flo Rida]]'s \"[[Right Round]]\", a reworking of the [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]] hit \"[[You Spin Me Right Round]]\". Other hits include [[Aaron Carter]]'s cover of [[Bow Wow Wow]]'s \"[[I Want Candy]]\", and [[Britney Spears]]' covers of \"[[My Prerogative]]\" and \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\". Pop rock groups such as [[Metro Station (band)|Metro Station]], [[The Veronicas]], and [[Owl City]] also displayed 1980s influences. [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]]'s hit \"[[Sweet Dreams (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles song)|Sweet Dreams]]\" was not a direct sampling of a 1980s pop hit but Anne Hagerty of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine was quoted as saying, \"this track will fit right on a [[Michael Jackson]] or Madonna instrumental.\" [[Alien Ant Farm]] successfully covered [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Smooth Criminal]]\", and [[Fall Out Boy]] came out with their own cover of \"[[Beat It]]\", later on. [[Bowling for Soup]] also had a hit with \"[[1985 (song)|1985]]\", a nostalgic ode to the 1980s.\n\n1980s pop star [[Cyndi Lauper]] released several albums, experimenting with different styles, like [[adult contemporary]], pop, [[pop rock]], [[electronic music]] and [[blues]]. These were critically acclaimed and received several nominations for [[Grammy Award]], and Lauper saw significant sales throughout the decade.\n\n=== Adult contemporary ===\n[[File:Norah Jones at Bright Eyes 2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Norah Jones]], May 29, 2007]]\n[[File:Alicia Keys, Lisboa 08 a.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Alicia Keys]] was the best selling female R&B performer of the 2000s.]]\nThe radio format called [[Adult contemporary]] music (primarily \"[[soft rock]]\" or \"lite-rock\"), began to somewhat decrease in popularity starting in the late 1990s (due to the increasing popularity of Top 40 music) into January 2000 until September 11, 2001. After 9/11, popularity for Adult Contemporary Music (as well as Contemporary Christian Music crossovers) increased trifold during the grieving process, when the 25\u201344 Conservative Female Demographic favoured listening to songs with appropriate, positive and uplifting lyrics containing love and hope. Upon the eventual return to normalcy after 9/11, the popularity of Adult Contemporary music held steady until about 2003, when Billboard began to change their chart formats. This led to Adult Contemporary stations to program their music \"not-as-soft\" or \"cheesy\" as they used to and ended up substituting the words \"soft-rock\" with \"lite-rock\", which has a more modern-edged connotation. Yet, AC stations remained careful to not cross the Adult Top 40 format line. Because of all these changes, AC Stations slowly increased in popularity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn the late 2000s, artists like [[Coldplay]], [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]], [[The Fray]], and [[Gavin Rossdale]] were finding more success crossing over onto the Adult Contemporary charts.\n\nOn the female side, artists like [[Sara Bareilles]], [[Colbie Caillat]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Alicia Keys]], and [[Leona Lewis]] continued to find crossover success on the Adult Contemporary charts as well. AC veterans such as [[Celine Dion]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Phil Collins]], [[The Eagles]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Alanis Morissette]] and [[Sheryl Crow]] continued to release music only on the Adult Contemporary formats. There are three songs which experienced longevity atop the chart, \"[[Love Song (Sara Bareilles song)|Love Song]]\" by Sara Bareilles, \"[[Bubbly]]\" by Colbie Caillat, and \"[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]\" from Kelly Clarkson spent a longevity 20 weeks atop the chart.\n\n[[Alicia Keys]] is considered the most successful R&B singer of the decade with 30 million records sold worldwide. Keys scored hits in the US charts with seven songs on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and four songs on the ''[[Billboard 100]]''. She shares a record with Britney Spears, being the only two female singers to have their first four albums debuting in first place in the chart Billboard Hot 200. [[Beyonc\u00e9]] would become the third female singer to accomplish this feat in 2011.<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{cite news| url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/469462/beyonces-4-headed-for-no-1-with-perhaps-300000| title=Beyonce's '4' Headed for No. 1 with Perhaps 300,000| date=June 29, 2011| accessdate=September 18, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729000954/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/469462/beyonces-4-headed-for-no-1-with-perhaps-300000| archive-date=July 29, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Norah Jones]] is considered{{Who|date=August 2010}} the greatest Jazz singer of the decade with 37 million records worldwide.

Blige]], [[Craig David]] and [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], whose careers began in the 1990s and continued in the dawn of the new millennium.

[[Jimmy Fortune]] struck out on his own as a solo artist with the help of [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] and continues to record music and tour today.\n\nOne of the most successful new artists of the decade was [[Carrie Underwood]]. In 2005, the [[Checotah, Oklahoma]] native became the first ''[[American Idol]]'' winner to record primarily country music, instead of pop, [[rapping|rap]] or [[rhythm and blues]]. By the end of the decade, Underwood had amassed eight No. 1 songs on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, along with numerous awards from the [[Country Music Association]], [[Academy of Country Music]] and others.\n[[File:CroppedCarrieUnderwoodAtTheWorldArena.jpg|140px|[[American Idol]] winner [[Carrie Underwood]] makes huge hits in country music charts.|thumb|left]]\n[[Country pop]], a subgenre which has its roots in the [[Nashville Sound]] of the late 1950s-early 1960s, continued to flourish in popularity. The most prominent act was [[Shania Twain]], with her album ''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'', released in 2002, Other top performers in the genre included [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Lonestar]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Rascal Flatts]]. In the middle of the decade, an informal group of singers and songwriters called the [[MuzikMafia]] formed to promote their mesh of honky-tonk and [[outlaw country|outlaw]] brand of country music; the most prominent members were [[Big Kenny|\"Big\" Kenny Alphin]] and [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]] (of the duo [[Big & Rich]]) and [[Gretchen Wilson]], who enjoyed success in the middle part of the decade.\n\nMany non-country artists enjoyed success in the country music during the 2000s. The most successful of these artists has been former [[Hootie & the Blowfish]] lead singer [[Darius Rucker]], who had three No. 1 hits in 2008\u201309: \"[[Don't Think I Don't Think About It]]\", \"[[It Won't Be Like This for Long]]\" and \"[[Alright (Darius Rucker song)|Alright]].\" [[The Eagles]], a California-based country-rock group, had their first major success on the Hot Country Songs chart in more than 30 years in 2007\u201308 with the songs \"[[How Long (J. D. Souther song)|How Long]]\" and \"[[Busy Being Fabulous]].\" Pop-rock singers [[Michelle Branch]] and [[Jessica Harp]] forced [[The Wreckers]] and had two top 10 hits, including the No. 1 hit \"[[Leave the Pieces]].\" Other non-country artists who had success in the genre were [[Kid Rock]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Miley Cyrus]].\n[[File:TobyKeithApr10.jpg|140px|thumb|right| [[Toby Keith]] in April 2010]]\nIn the late 2000s, teenager [[Taylor Swift]] became the first country artist to enjoy widespread mainstream popularity since the 1980s, when artists including [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]] and [[Kenny Rogers]] regularly recorded music that appealed to both country and pop audiences. Two of Swift's songs \u2013 \"[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]\" and \"[[You Belong With Me]]\" \u2013 both reached the top 5 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (and No. 1 on several of the Hot 100s component charts) after topping the Hot Country Songs chart. At the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], Swift became the first country artist to win a VMA award when she won in the Female Best Video category for \"You Belong With Me\".\n\nNot everyone celebrated the success of artists such as Underwood and Swift, reflecting the continued discontent and debate over what constituted \"real\" country music, a debate that had been on and off since the 1970s. Despite the fact that country music songs had long been crossing over to pop radio (and charting since the start of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|charts]] in 1940), some critics continued to state opinions that the pop-oriented sound was little more than repackaged pop music. In 2009, legendary country music artist [[George Jones]] proclaimed that \"they've (the new artists) stolen our identity. ... They had to use something that was established already, and that's traditional country music. So what they need to do really, I think, is find their own title, because they're definitely not traditional country music.\"<ref>\"George Jones: New country needs new name; 'They've stolen our identity,' Hall of Famer says of genre's new crop of stars\", [[Associated Press]], November 2, 2009.

Rogers, Parton and [[Willie Nelson]], all artists who had No. 1 country hits as far back as the early 1970s, all had No. 1 songs during the 2000s decade \u2013 either as soloists (Rogers), as part of one-time duo pairings (Nelson) or as featured background vocalists (Parton). McEntire's success came with two albums hitting No. 1 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart (''[[Reba Duets]]'' and ''[[Keep On Loving You (album)|Keep On Loving You]]'' ), and at the end of the decade had her biggest hit of her career (\"[[Consider Me Gone]]\"). In addition, veteran songwriters such as [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]] and [[Bobby Braddock]] also enjoyed continued success with newly written songs. Late in the decade, newcomers such as [[Jamey Johnson]] and [[Miranda Lambert]] were widely hailed for their songwriting and performance talents.\n\nThe legendary group [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] retired from touring in 2004 after nearly a quarter century of mainstream success, primarily during the 1980s and 1990s. Its band members \u2013 cousins Randy Owen, Teddy Gentry and Jeff Cook; and drummer Mark Herndon \u2013 remained active performers and recorded a successful series of albums containing gospel and traditional old-time songs.\n\nMany legendary country music figures died during the decade. Some of the more prominent names included [[Pee Wee King]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[June Carter Cash]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Buck Owens]], [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Vern Gosdin]] and [[Hank Locklin]].\n\n=== Electronic music ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\nIn Europe, [[Trance music]] was popular in the early 2000s, but this style diminished as the decade wore on. [[Hard House]] became the next big craze after trance in 2001, with a certain amount of cross-over between the two genres (in some cases creating [[Hard Trance]] tracks). As a kind of backlash, ambient, [[Chillout]] music achieved mainstream popularity in the early 2000s, with a successful market of chillout compilations and the genre even making it into television commercials and soundtracks.\n\n[[Disco house]] and [[funky house]], popular in the late 1990s, continued to be successful through to the mid-2000s before the sound of [[electro house]] developed in late 2006. The electro sound began to merge with other genres such as [[Hip Hop]] as the decade drew to a close.\n\nFrom 2007, [[dance music]] started gaining popularity in North America with [[dance-pop]] hits by artists such as the pop singer [[Rihanna]]'s song \"[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]\" and \"[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]\". Hilary Duff in her album Dignity has changed her style from pop rock to the more contemporary electropop, to go with the current trends. In 2008 and 2009, [[electropop]] and [[Nu-disco]] increased in popularity in North America, replacing hip-hop and R&B as the dominant genres of music. Artists like [[Britney Spears]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], and [[Lady Gaga]] brought this style to great popularity towards the end of 2008 with their hits such as Britney's \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", Beyonce's [[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]] and Gaga's ''[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]''. Furthermore, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s singles such as \"[[Hung Up]]\" (#1 in 45 countries) and \"[[4 Minutes (Madonna song)|4 Minutes]]\" (#1 in 32 countries) become huge dance hits. (See [[#R&B/Hip-hop/Urban Pop|hip hop, urban pop and R&B]] above for more information.)\n\nPop duo [[Aly & A.J.]] explored electropop and 1980s new wave influences in their second album \"[[Insomniatic]]\". In addition, some of the most successful [[Electronica]] American artists and DJs in the 1990s, such as [[Moby]] and [[The Crystal Method]], also continued their success during the 2000s.\n\n=== Jazz ===\n[[File:Diana krall.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Diana Krall]], 2007]]\nIn the 2000s, [[straight-ahead jazz]] continued to appeal to a core group of listeners. Well-established jazz musicians, such as [[Dave Brubeck]], Wynton Marsalis, [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Wayne Shorter]] and [[Jessica Williams (musician)|Jessica Williams]], continue to perform and record. In the 2000s, a number of young musicians emerged, including the pianist [[Jason Moran (musician)|Jason Moran]], vibraphonist [[Stefon Harris]], trumpeter [[Roy Hargrove]], and bassist [[Christian McBride]].\n\nIn addition, a number of new vocalists have achieved popularity with a mix of traditional jazz and pop/rock forms, such as [[Diana Krall]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Kurt Elling]], and [[Jamie Cullum]]. Norah Jones and Diana Krall, due to their massive international success during the 2000s are considered the first and second most successful female jazz singers of the decade, respectively. Diana Krall has topped the Music Billboards multiple times in the year 2000. The week of April 15, 2000, Krall's album \"When I Look in Your Eyes\" reached number one, followed by Al Jarreau's \"Tomorrow Today\" and Kenny G's \"Classics in the Key of G.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/jazz-albums |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220212029/http://www.billboard.com/charts/jazz-albums |archive-date=February 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Norah Jones was named the top jazz artist of the 2000\u20132009 decade by Billboard.<ref>[[Norah Jones]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} Jones had many albums come out in the 2000s decade, including Jazz and Adult Contemporary.

He has also had several No. 1 singles, \"[[Get Busy]]\", \"[[Temperature (song)|Temperature]]\" and \"[[Baby Boy (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles song)|Baby Boy]]\" (a duet with [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]]).\n\n====Reggaeton====\n[[Reggaeton]] gained mainstream exposure and massive popularity in North America during the mid-2000s. Reggaeton blends [[British West Indies|West-Indian]] music influences of [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] with those of Latin America, such as [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]], [[plena]], [[salsa music|salsa]], [[Merengue music|merengue]], [[latin pop]], [[cumbia]] and [[bachata (music)|bachata]] as well as that of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[contemporary R&B]], and [[electronica]]. The influence of this genre has spread to the wider Latino communities in the United States, as well as the Latin American audience. [[Shakira]] has sold more than 100 million copies in the 21st century.\n\n=== Christian music ===\nChristian music continued to gain popularity after the success in the 1990s with acts such as [[Jars of Clay]] and [[Audio Adrenaline]]. [[Relient K]]'s work in the pop punk/pop rock scene earned them three albums certified gold\u2014''[[The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek]]'', ''[[Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do]]'', and ''[[MMHMM]]''\u2014and a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination. Skillet recorded two Grammy-nominated albums\u2014''[[Collide (Skillet album)|Collide]]'' and ''[[Comatose (album)|Comatose]]''\u2014and achieved Platinum-selling status with ''[[Awake (Skillet album)|Awake]]'', and Gold with ''Comatose''.\n\n=== Billboard Artist of the Decade ===\nOn December 11, 2009, Billboard Magazine named Rapper [[Eminem]] as the best Artist of the Decade for the 2000s. He joins the list with Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Elton John, Michael Jackson, and Mariah Carey, who have also been awarded this honor in their respective decades.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{See also|Music of the United Kingdom (2000s)}}\n\n=== Rock ===\n[[File:Coldplay-3.jpg|thumb|290px|right|[[Coldplay]] is considered to be the most successful British rock act of the decade.]]\n[[File:Franz-ferdinand-live-2006-tag.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] in concert in 2006]]\nFollowing after the success of [[Radiohead]] and [[The Verve]] in the 1990s, [[Post-Britpop]] act [[Coldplay]] saw major success in European album charts during the decade. British [[Indie rock]] and [[indie pop]] returned to popularity in the mid-late 2000s with artists such as [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Belle and Sebastian]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[The Libertines]], [[Editors (band)|Editors]], [[Lily Allen]], [[Kate Nash]], [[Florence And The Machine]], and [[The Ting Tings]] achieving substantial chart success. Post punk bands such as [[Bloc Party]], [[Foals (band)|Foals]] and Editors also saw some popularity. Britpop act [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] also remained popular in the 2000s (decade), spawning four number one albums in the UK until the disbandment of the group in autumn 2009.\n\n[[U2]] continued their popularity into the 2000s, releasing three critically acclaimed albums, and were credited with influencing many prominent acts of the decade such as [[Coldplay]] and [[Muse (band)|Muse]].\n\nIn the early and mid-2000s, British [[Indie rock]] groups such as [[The Libertines]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Bloc Party]] and [[Kaiser Chiefs]] witnessed commercial and chart success not seen by guitar music since Britpop in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kayley-kravitz/post-punk-revival-_b_2003987.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Kayley | last=Kravitz | title=Revisiting the Post-Punk Revival | date=October 23, 2012 | access-date=April 10, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028095022/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kayley-kravitz/post-punk-revival-_b_2003987.html | archive-date=October 28, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> Regional indie rock scenes such as [[New Yorkshire]] also appeared at this point in the decade. [[Indie music]] itself increased in popularity due to the increased commercialization of alternative, and major labels begin marketing indie bands with mainstream appeal. American indie/rock band [[The Killers]] also became very popular in Britain with their singles \"[[Mr. Brightside]]\", \"[[When You Were Young]]\" and \"[[Smile Like You Mean It]]\".\n\n[[Radiohead]] enjoyed further success in the 2000s, moving away from their experimental sound of the ''Kid A''/''Amnesiac'' era to a more \"typical\" Alternative rock sound. [[Coldplay]] also enjoyed success with four number one albums and a US No. 1 single with \"[[Viva la Vida]]\", the first English band to do so since [[The Beatles]]. [[Muse (band)|Muse]] saw a similar level of commercial acclaim, with the rock trio releasing three chart-topping albums.\n\nThe late 2000s (entering into the early 2010s) saw the revival and influence of [[synthpop]] music, also known as '[[new urbanism|new urban]]' pop. Notable acts include [[Hot Chip]], [[Junior Boys]], [[Little Boots]] and [[La Roux]]. The late 2000s also saw acts such as Irish rock band [[The Script]] have international success.\n\nThe era also saw solo success for singer-songwriters, including [[David Gray (musician)|David Gray]], [[Dido (singer)|Dido]],<ref>M.

The [[Eurovision Song Contest]] also retained its important status within European music.\n\n1980s female pop stars [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Kylie Minogue]] enjoyed a large presence on the European music scene, both having numerous hits in the 2000s including \"[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]\", \"[[Hollywood (Madonna song)|Hollywood]]\", \"[[Hung Up]]\" and \"[[Celebration (Madonna song)|Celebration]]\" for Madonna and \"[[Spinning Around]]\", \"[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\", \"[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]\" and \"[[In My Arms (Kylie Minogue song)|In My Arms]]\" for Kylie.

Pop-rock music hits new highs in the 2000s with acts such as [[Man\u00e1]], [[Juanes]], and [[Julieta Venegas]] topping the charts in several countries.\n[[File:Shakira at Obama Inaugural (cropped).jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Shakira]] is considered the biggest Latin act of the decade.]]\n\n=== Reggaet\u00f3n ===\nIn 2002, New York-based group [[Aventura (band)|Aventura]] would reinvent bachata, thus making it a dominant Latin genre. By 2004, reggaeton would become a staple in music with acts such as [[Don Omar]], [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Ivy Queen]] and [[Wisin & Yandel]]. By mid-2000s Reggaet\u00f3n had replaced salsa, merengue and cumbia as the main dance genre in nightclubs for young people all over Latin America, reaching popularity in parts of Spain and Italy as well.

Beginning in 2004, this subgenre combining elements of merengue, rap, and reggaeton would be popularized by Dominican acts such as Omega, Silvio Mora, El Sujeto, and Tito Swing.\n\n== Asia ==\nWith the rapid development of [[Economy of Asia|Asian economies]] during the 1990s and 2000s, the independent [[Music of Asia|music industries of Asia]] have seen considerable growth. Asian countries like Japan and India have some of the largest music markets in the world. Supported by their own large markets, the music charts in Asia are largely dominated by local [[Asian people|Asian]] artists, with very few artists from the Western world managing to break those markets.\n\n[[J-pop]] and [[K-pop]] have become increasingly influenced by [[contemporary R&B]], [[hip hop music]] and [[Eurobeat]], and they have become popular all over the Far East region. Meanwhile, in the [[South Asia|Southern Asia]] region, the rising independent [[Indian pop]] scene, often characterized by its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of Indian and non-Indian sounds, has begun to increasingly compete with the popularity of [[Filmi|Bollywood ''filmi'' music]] in the region. In Southeast Asia, especially Singapore and Indonesia, straight-ahead jazz saw a revival in the second half of the decade.\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{See also|J-Pop}}\n\n[[J-Pop]] continues to be in the mainstream and stays as the most popular style of music in Japan. Japanese Pop's popularity continues to expand through Asia and the rest of the world, with various Japanese artists debuting in the US. J-Pop starts to enjoy a relatively big global online fan base. It continues to influence worldwide styles of music, as Japanese culture has continuously become more popular around the world. Japan also remains as the second most powerful music industry in the world, and the second largest music market, after the US. [[R&B]] is popular at the beginning of the era, with [[Hip-Hop]] also becoming more popular as time passes. At the end of the decade, Dance music and [[Techno]] become the most popular genres. Bubblegum pop remains popular during the entire decade.\n\n[[Ayumi Hamasaki]] becomes one of the most popular Japanese star of the 2000s, experiencing her biggest peak at this time, becoming known as \"[[List of honorific titles in popular music|The Empress of Japanese Pop]]\", and greatly influencing music, fashion and pop culture. [[Ken Hirai]] becomes the most popular male solo artist. 1990s divas like [[Namie Amuro]], [[Misia (singer)|Misia]], and [[Hikaru Utada]] also remain extremely popular during this era, with the former having a second popularity boom in 2008. Starlet [[Kumi Koda]] also becomes insanely popular in this era, thanks to her fresh dance style and provocative dance moves. Boy bands are the most popular musical format at the moment, with girl bands like [[Morning Musume]] (very popular in the past) experiencing a decline in popularity. While [[Johnny & Associates|Johnny]]'s boy bands, notably [[Arashi]], become very popular, other vocal groups like [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]] and [[Tohoshinki]] also gained popularity and pop/rock bands like [[Mr. Children]], [[Tokio (band)|Tokio]] and [[Glay]] remained popular. Duets also become popular, such as [[M-Flo]]. Like all countries, English pop music popularity expands at a very high rate with popular US artist receiving success such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Britney Spears]] who become the most popular and two of the most successful non-Japanese artists.\n\n=== India ===\n{{See also|Indian pop|Filmi}}\n\nThe [[Music of India|Indian music industry]] was previously dominated by the ''[[Filmi]]'' music of [[Bollywood]] for much of the late 20th century. The 2000s saw an increasing popularity of independent [[Indian pop]] music that could compete with [[Bollywood]] film music. Indian pop music began distinguishing itself from mainstream Bollywood music with its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of Indian and non-Indian sounds, which later had on influence on Bollywood music itself. Indian pop has itself been partly influenced by the [[Asian Underground]] scene emerging in the United Kingdom among [[British Asian]] artists such as [[Bally Sagoo]], [[Apache Indian]], [[Panjabi MC]], [[Raghav]] and the [[Rishi Rich Project]] (featuring [[Rishi Rich]], [[Jay Sean]] and [[Juggy D]]). India has one of the largest music markets in the world, though like other developing nations, suffers from high levels of piracy.\n\nIndian music has also had an increasing influence on popular music in the Western world. The music of South Asia has influenced Europe's pop mainstream as acts like [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Bananarama]], [[Erasure]], and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] all released singles or remixes featuring South Asian instrumentation. Indian music has also influenced mainstream American [[hip hop]], R&B and [[Urban contemporary|urban music]] in the 2000s, including artists/producers such as [[Timbaland]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Truth Hurts (singer)|Truth Hurts]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Britney Spears]].

As the technology of computers and internet sharing developed, a variety of those genres started to fuse in order to see new styles emerging. Terms like \"contemporary\", \"nu\", \"revival\", \"alternative\", and \"post\" are added to various genres titles in order to differentiate them from past styles, [[nu-disco]] and [[post-punk revival]] as notable examples.\n\nIn this decade, [[grime (music)|grime]] was a genre invented in the UK, while [[Chillwave]] became popular in the United States.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/culture-review-of-the-noughties | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=High points of the noughties | date=December 27, 2009 | access-date=February 9, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210120907/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/27/culture-review-of-the-noughties | archive-date=February 10, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe continued development of studio recording software and electronic elements was observed, through this decade. One such example is the usage of [[pitch correction]] software, such as [[auto-tune]] that appeared in the late 1990s. Another great impact to this decade was the ongoing development of the [[internet]] and user-friendly [[media player (application software)|media player]]<nowiki/>s, such as [[iTunes]], and music and video sharing websites such as Napster and [[YouTube]], respectively.\n\nThe popularity of [[teen pop]] carried over from the 1990s with acts such as [[*NSYNC]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Christina Aguilera]] dominating the charts in the earlier years of the decade.\n\n[[Contemporary R&B]] was one of the most popular genres of the decade (especially in the early and mid 2000s), with artists like [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], and [[Rihanna]]. In 2004, the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2004|Billboard Year-End Hot 100]] had 15 of its top 25 singles as Contemporary R&B.\n\nIn Britain, [[Britpop]], [[post punk revival]] and [[alternative rock]] were at the height of their popularity with acts such as [[Coldplay]], [[The Libertines]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Lynda Thomas]], [[Travis (band)|Travis]], [[Dido (singer)|Dido]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[The Hives]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], and [[Radiohead]], which still continued at the top of the major charts in the rest of the world since the 1990s.\n\n[[Hip hop music]] achieved mainstream status after the 1990s and the deaths of many prominent artists such as [[2Pac]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] Artists outside of New York and Los Angeles in cities like Atlanta, Houston, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Toronto and the Bay Area all achieved mainstream success.

In other parts of Asia, including India, [[Indian pop]] music, closely linked to [[Bollywood]] films and ''[[filmi]]'' music, was popular alongside Western pop music.\n\nIn Latin America, whilst R&B, hip hop and [[pop rock]] did have influence and success, Latin-based pop music remained highly popular.\n\n[[Reggaeton]] became a definitive genre in 2000s Latin music, as well as [[salsa music|salsa]] and [[merengue music|merengue]].

According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', two of Eminem's albums are among the top five highest-selling albums of the 2000s. After the release of his album ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]'', Eminem became the best selling rapper of all time and the top selling artist of the decade across all genres.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2009-12-08-musicdecade08_ST_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Edna | last=Gundersen | title=Decade's best: Eminem tops in sales; Beatles get No. '1' album | date=December 11, 2009 | access-date=August 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421144512/http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2009-12-08-musicdecade08_ST_N.htm | archive-date=April 21, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> \"Ringtone rap\", which is rap music that was made popular for ringtones, which includes more \"laid back\" and \"silly\" elements along with repetitive hooks, became very popular in the later part of the 2000s.\n\nIn late 2005, the [[Southern hip hop]] subgenre reached the peak of its popularity, especially its sub-subgenres of [[crunk]] and [[snap music]] (which started the dance craze movement in hip hop from 2005 to 2009). The number one selling crunk artist as well as paving the way to its popularity was [[Lil Jon]] who shot to fame in 2003, with his group [[The Eastside Boyz]]. Then snap music became a staple for the remainder of the decade in hip hop with artists such as, [[Dem Franchize Boys]], [[D4L]], [[Yung Joc]], [[Soulja Boy]], [[Unk]], [[Jibbs]], [[Da Backwudz]], [[Purple Ribbon All-Stars]], [[V.I.C.]], [[GS Boyz]], the [[Fast Life Yungstaz]], [[New Boyz]] and [[Cali Swag District]], to name a few. These artists have all contributed to starting some dance craze accompanied to one of their songs, with the most popular being Soulja's \"Crank Dat\" move, which gained popularity throughout 2007 and 2008. By the end of the decade this sound began to decline in popularity as well as the dance-crazes that came along with them, as pioneer hip hop artists and hip hop purists such as [[Ice-T]] and [[Nas]] denouncing the crunk and snap craze, with Nas's 2006 song \"Hip Hop Is Dead\" brought dislike to the new path hip hop was directing.\n\nBy early 2000, the [[Hyphy]] movement became popular in Northern California, specifically the Bay Area. Bay Area artists like [[Mac Dre]], [[Keak Da Sneak]], [[E-40]], [[The Pack (group)|The Pack]], and [[Too Short]] were prominent Hyphy rappers. Hyphy culture included the use of party drugs like ecstasy, slang terms like \u201cGo dumb\u201d and \u201cyadadamean\u201d, [[Ghost Riding]], and Sideshows.\n\nBy mid-2008 the sound began to fade as indie rap and alternative began to come in with artists such as [[Kid Cudi]] and [[The Cool Kids]], who fused hip hop with electro and hipster influences. This trend continued on into the early 2010s. [[Alternative hip hop]], almost unknown in the mainstream, except for a few crossover acts, evolved throughout the decade with the help of artists such as [[Mos Def]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[The Roots]], [[MF Doom]], [[Aesop Rock]], and [[Common (rapper)|Common]], who achieved unheard-of success for their field. Throughout the 2000s, Alternative Hip hop continued its philosophical, positive, and complex lyrical subject matter, while denouncing materialism, fashion, and money. This subgenre also includes spoken word and a branch of slam poetry. The subgenre could be said to be related to both the old school hip-hop culture of the 1980s and 1990s, and the [[indie rock]] and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] subcultures.\n\nBy 1999, more 2000s styled glam started coming in, along with [[dirty South (music)|dirty south]] and [[crunk]], with artists such as [[Mannie Fresh]], [[Cam'ron]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Ludacris]], [[Three 6 Mafia]], [[Ying Yang Twins]], [[Neptunes]], [[Timbaland]] and [[Jay-Z]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/nov/26/notes-noughties-hip-hop | work=The Guardian | location=UK | title=Simon Reynolds's Notes on the noughties: When will hip-hop hurry up and die? | date=November 26, 2009 | accessdate=August 25, 2011 | first1=Simon | last1=Reynolds | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411211603/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/nov/26/notes-noughties-hip-hop | archive-date=April 11, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Auto-Tune]] became popular by mid-2007, with R&B artist [[T-Pain]] starting the craze. Auto-Tune was popular in the earlier part of the decade as well (primarily in 2000 and 2001), but then only called \"synthesizer\" and it was used casually as just an effect than a major replacement of the standard human voice. Artists such as [[Daft Punk]], [[Eiffel 65]], [[*NSYNC]], [[98 Degrees]], [[Willa Ford]], and even [[Faith Hill]] have used Auto-Tune in their songs.

[[Green Day]] kick-started the 2000s with the release of their sixth studio album ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' in 2000 to lukewarm{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} success. The following year, [[Blink-182]] released their fourth studio album ''[[Take Off Your Pants And Jacket]]'' in 2001 which went on to sell 14 million copies worldwide. It was a commercial and critical success, debuting at number one{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] within its first week of release and securing the status of the pop punk trio as one of biggest bands of the genre. Also in that year, [[Canadians|Canadian]] band Sum 41 released their debut album ''[[All Killer No Filler]]'', which went platinum in the United States. The second-wave bands dominated the pop punk genre in the early years with bands like [[Good Charlotte]], [[New Found Glory]], [[Simple Plan]] and [[Sum 41]] receiving platinum status and gaining large fan bases worldwide{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. In 2002, [[Avril Lavigne]] became popular in the [[pop punk]] scene thanks to her pop punk-based sound, and was arguably the most prominent artist to take this new direction in pop music, with hits such as \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\" and \"[[Sk8er Boi]]\". In 2003, [[Blink-182]] released their untitled album ''[[blink-182 (album)|blink-182]]'', which demonstrated a darker and more mature tone{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} than previous albums. This was mainly due to the side-project [[Box Car Racer]]. Even so, the album was yet another commercial and critical success. It was to be their last album released before taking an indefinite hiatus in 2005. The band would reunite four years later. After their 1994 breakthrough, [[Green Day]]'s fame was fading{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, mainly due to rising popularity of other bands like [[Good Charlotte]] and [[Sum 41]]. Realizing this, they retreated to the studio and produced their seventh studio album ''[[American Idiot]]'' released in 2004. It saw a significant sales boost, selling 14 million copies worldwide and awarding the band 3 Grammy awards{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. [[Fall Out Boy]]'s ''[[From Under The Cork Tree]]'' gained commercial success in 2005 and put the band on the pop punk map. [[Fall Out Boy]]\u2019s follow up album [[Infinity On High]] went number 1 on the billboard 200 in 2007{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. The last successful pop punk album of the decade{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} was [[Green Day]]'s eighth studio album ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'' released in 2009 which achieved their best chart performance to date by reaching number one on the album charts of various countries as well as winning a Grammy{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, including the [[United States]] [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the [[European Top 100 Albums]], and the [[United Kingdom Albums Chart]].\n\n==== Post-grunge ====\n[[File:Chad Kroeger.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Nickelback]] has sold over 50 million albums and was one of the biggest [[post-grunge]] bands of the decade.]]\n[[Post-grunge]] continued to be popular in the 2000s, with the genre reaching its peak in the early years of the decade.

The popularity of nu metal music carried over from the late 1990s, where it was introduced by early work from bands such as [[Korn]], [[Deftones]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Coal Chamber]], into the early [[2000\u20132009|2000s]] with the similar genre, rap rock, bringing in a wave of monster-hit artists{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} such as [[System of a Down]], [[Evanescence]], [[Staind]], [[Papa Roach]], and [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]]. The success of Korn's third studio album, ''[[Follow the Leader (Korn album)|Follow The Leader]]'' and Limp Bizkit's [[Significant Other (Limp Bizkit)|Significant Other]] and [[Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (Limp Bizkit)|Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water)), brought nu metal to the mainstream{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. Limp Bizkit's Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water would sell over 1,050,000 in its first week - making it the highest selling rock record with first week sales ever. [[Linkin Park]]'s debut album ''[[Hybrid Theory]]'', released in [[2000 in music|2000]], sold over 24 million copies worldwide. In 2004, nu metal lost popularity{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. Since then, many bands have changed to other genres of music{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, such as [[post-grunge]] ([[Staind]]), [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] ([[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], [[Drowning Pool]]) and [[alternative rock]] ([[Linkin Park]], [[Papa Roach]]).\n\n==== Metalcore ====\nBy 2004, the up-and-coming genre [[metalcore]] was dominated by bands such as [[Killswitch Engage]], [[Underoath]], [[Bullet for My Valentine]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]], and most successfully [[Avenged Sevenfold]]{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, all of whom releasing successful albums. The rise of metalcore led to increased popularity and exposure of nearly every other subgenre of heavy metal{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} including [[death metal]], [[black metal]], and [[thrash metal|thrash]]. In 2002, heavy metal saw a new subgenre called [[deathcore]]{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, which would gain moderate success from 2005 to present day.\n\n==== Hard rock/Heavy metal ====\n[[AC/DC]] released ''[[Stiff Upper Lip]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]'' in 2008{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. [[Guns N' Roses]] released the long-awaited ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'' in 2008 after over a decade of work by [[Axl Rose]]. [[Metallica]] released two albums in the 2000s, ''[[St. Anger]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Death Magnetic]]'' in 2008{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}. [[Aerosmith]] released the platinum-selling ''[[Just Push Play]]'' in 2001 followed by the blues-infused ''[[Honkin' on Bobo]]'' in 2004; the band also toured every year of the decade except 2008{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}.

''Crush'' fared best{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, going double platinum, and spawning the hit \"[[It's My Life (Bon Jovi song)|It's My Life]]\", while ''Have a Nice Day'' and ''Lost Highway'' also launched Top 40 singles{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}, went platinum, and saw the band mix hard rock with country. Bon Jovi's [[Lost Highway Tour]] was the highest-grossing tour of 2008{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}.\n\n==== Emo ====\n[[Emo]] broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of [[Jimmy Eat World]]'s ''[[Bleed American]]''.

Spears' \"[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!...I Did It Again]]\" and Aguilera's \"[[Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)]]\" became huge hits in the year 2000. By 2001 and 2002, however, the teen-pop trend faded due to [[modern R&B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] influenced music that later dominated throughout the middle of the decade. Spears' 2001 album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' and Aguilera's 2002 album ''[[Stripped (Christina Aguilera album)|Stripped]]'' are examples of teen pop artists transitioning from teen pop to more grown-up, modern R&B influenced records.\n\n[[Boy bands]] maintained their popularity during the beginning of the decade, but their popularity also faded, with the exception of [[Backstreet Boys]], who continued their popularity post-2005, (after a short hiatus between 2002 and 2004). As the typical \"boy band\" sound was no longer mainstream, they began to transition to more of an adult contemporary, soft-rock and ballad styles of music for the remainder of the decade. By 2003, records by boy bands were very sparse on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and some members of boy bands left to pursue other projects and solo endeavors, such as [[Jesse McCartney]] from [[Dream Street]], [[Nick Lachey]] from [[98 Degrees]],  and most successfully [[Justin Timberlake]] from [['N Sync]], whose foray into [[Blue-eyed soul]] R&B/Pop spawned a successful solo career. A new strain of boy bands, such as [[V Factory]], Varsity Fanclub, [[Click Five]], [[NLT (band)|NLT]], and the [[Jonas Brothers]], emerged at the end of the decade, but this new generation of boy bands did not reach the glamor and success of those of the 1990s and early 2000s. Girl groups maintained a steady popularity through the 2000s, with groups such as [[Destiny's Child]] (which disbanded in 2005) setting the fuel for the most successful girl group of the decade, the [[Pussycat Dolls]] (2003\u201310). Other girl groups included [[Danity Kane]] (2005\u201309), [[Dream]] (2000-03), and [[Sugababes]].\n\n[[Pop rock]] artist [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] released her debut album ''[[Can't Take Me Home]]'' in 2000, including \"[[Get the Party Started]]\", and later, her ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'' album in which features \"[[Stupid Girls]]\" and [[Who Knew Pink|\"Who Knew\"]].

The album and its accompanying songs went on to win five [[Grammy Award]]s, helping Beyonc\u00e9 set a record for the most Grammy Awards won by a female artist in one night.\n\n[[Lady Gaga]] took the latter part of the decade by storm and revived the electronic influence of pop music that had not been prominent since 2000. Her debut album, ''[[The Fame]]'' (2008), reached number-one in [[Canada]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] and topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'' [[Top Electronic Albums]] chart. Its first two singles, \"[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]\" and \"[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]\", became international number-one hits, topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in the United States as well as other countries. The album later earned a total of six [[Grammy Award]] nominations and won awards for [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album|Best Electronic/Dance Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]].

All The Cheetah Girls, High School Musical and Hannah Montana albums were among the best-sellers of 2006 and 2007 and reached the number 1 position, left many artists produced by [[Disney]] in the 2000s, [[The Cheetah Girls (band)|The Cheetah Girls]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Demi Lovato]], Jonas Brothers, [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]], the best-selling artists of the decade.\n\nThe musical style of the 1980s influenced pop music to some extent in the later stages of the decade, especially around late 2009, as seen in [[Rihanna]]'s hit \"[[SOS (Rihanna song)|SOS]]\" (a sampling of [[Soft Cell]]'s \"[[Tainted Love]]\"), [[Lumidee]]'s \"[[She's Like The Wind]]\" and [[Flo Rida]]'s \"[[Right Round]]\", a reworking of the [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]] hit \"[[You Spin Me Right Round]]\". Other hits include [[Aaron Carter]]'s cover of [[Bow Wow Wow]]'s \"[[I Want Candy]]\", and [[Britney Spears]]' covers of \"[[My Prerogative]]\" and \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\". Pop rock groups such as [[Metro Station (band)|Metro Station]], [[The Veronicas]], and [[Owl City]] also displayed 1980s influences. [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]]'s hit \"[[Sweet Dreams (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles song)|Sweet Dreams]]\" was not a direct sampling of a 1980s pop hit but Anne Hagerty of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine was quoted as saying, \"this track will fit right on a [[Michael Jackson]] or Madonna instrumental.\" [[Alien Ant Farm]] successfully covered [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Smooth Criminal]]\", and [[Fall Out Boy]] came out with their own cover of \"[[Beat It]]\", later on. [[Bowling for Soup]] also had a hit with \"[[1985 (song)|1985]]\", a nostalgic ode to the 1980s.\n\n1980s pop star [[Cyndi Lauper]] released several albums, experimenting with different styles, like [[adult contemporary]], pop, [[pop rock]], [[electronic music]] and [[blues]].

After 9/11, popularity for Adult Contemporary Music (as well as Contemporary Christian Music crossovers) increased trifold during the grieving process, when the 25\u201344 Conservative Female Demographic favoured listening to songs with appropriate, positive and uplifting lyrics containing love and hope. Upon the eventual return to normalcy after 9/11, the popularity of Adult Contemporary music held steady until about 2003, when Billboard began to change their chart formats. This led to Adult Contemporary stations to program their music \"not-as-soft\" or \"cheesy\" as they used to and ended up substituting the words \"soft-rock\" with \"lite-rock\", which has a more modern-edged connotation. Yet, AC stations remained careful to not cross the Adult Top 40 format line. Because of all these changes, AC Stations slowly increased in popularity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn the late 2000s, artists like [[Coldplay]], [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]], [[The Fray]], and [[Gavin Rossdale]] were finding more success crossing over onto the Adult Contemporary charts.\n\nOn the female side, artists like [[Sara Bareilles]], [[Colbie Caillat]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Alicia Keys]], and [[Leona Lewis]] continued to find crossover success on the Adult Contemporary charts as well. AC veterans such as [[Celine Dion]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Phil Collins]], [[The Eagles]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Alanis Morissette]] and [[Sheryl Crow]] continued to release music only on the Adult Contemporary formats. There are three songs which experienced longevity atop the chart, \"[[Love Song (Sara Bareilles song)|Love Song]]\" by Sara Bareilles, \"[[Bubbly]]\" by Colbie Caillat, and \"[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]\" from Kelly Clarkson spent a longevity 20 weeks atop the chart.\n\n[[Alicia Keys]] is considered the most successful R&B singer of the decade with 30 million records sold worldwide. Keys scored hits in the US charts with seven songs on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and four songs on the ''[[Billboard 100]]''. She shares a record with Britney Spears, being the only two female singers to have their first four albums debuting in first place in the chart Billboard Hot 200.

In 2005, the [[Checotah, Oklahoma]] native became the first ''[[American Idol]]'' winner to record primarily country music, instead of pop, [[rapping|rap]] or [[rhythm and blues]]. By the end of the decade, Underwood had amassed eight No. 1 songs on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, along with numerous awards from the [[Country Music Association]], [[Academy of Country Music]] and others.\n[[File:CroppedCarrieUnderwoodAtTheWorldArena.jpg|140px|[[American Idol]] winner [[Carrie Underwood]] makes huge hits in country music charts.|thumb|left]]\n[[Country pop]], a subgenre which has its roots in the [[Nashville Sound]] of the late 1950s-early 1960s, continued to flourish in popularity. The most prominent act was [[Shania Twain]], with her album ''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'', released in 2002, Other top performers in the genre included [[Dixie Chicks]], [[Lonestar]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Rascal Flatts]]. In the middle of the decade, an informal group of singers and songwriters called the [[MuzikMafia]] formed to promote their mesh of honky-tonk and [[outlaw country|outlaw]] brand of country music; the most prominent members were [[Big Kenny|\"Big\" Kenny Alphin]] and [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]] (of the duo [[Big & Rich]]) and [[Gretchen Wilson]], who enjoyed success in the middle part of the decade.\n\nMany non-country artists enjoyed success in the country music during the 2000s. The most successful of these artists has been former [[Hootie & the Blowfish]] lead singer [[Darius Rucker]], who had three No. 1 hits in 2008\u201309: \"[[Don't Think I Don't Think About It]]\", \"[[It Won't Be Like This for Long]]\" and \"[[Alright (Darius Rucker song)|Alright]].\" [[The Eagles]], a California-based country-rock group, had their first major success on the Hot Country Songs chart in more than 30 years in 2007\u201308 with the songs \"[[How Long (J. D. Souther song)|How Long]]\" and \"[[Busy Being Fabulous]].\" Pop-rock singers [[Michelle Branch]] and [[Jessica Harp]] forced [[The Wreckers]] and had two top 10 hits, including the No. 1 hit \"[[Leave the Pieces]].\" Other non-country artists who had success in the genre were [[Kid Rock]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Miley Cyrus]].\n[[File:TobyKeithApr10.jpg|140px|thumb|right| [[Toby Keith]] in April 2010]]\nIn the late 2000s, teenager [[Taylor Swift]] became the first country artist to enjoy widespread mainstream popularity since the 1980s, when artists including [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]] and [[Kenny Rogers]] regularly recorded music that appealed to both country and pop audiences. Two of Swift's songs \u2013 \"[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]\" and \"[[You Belong With Me]]\" \u2013 both reached the top 5 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] (and No. 1 on several of the Hot 100s component charts) after topping the Hot Country Songs chart. At the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]], Swift became the first country artist to win a VMA award when she won in the Female Best Video category for \"You Belong With Me\".\n\nNot everyone celebrated the success of artists such as Underwood and Swift, reflecting the continued discontent and debate over what constituted \"real\" country music, a debate that had been on and off since the 1970s. Despite the fact that country music songs had long been crossing over to pop radio (and charting since the start of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|charts]] in 1940), some critics continued to state opinions that the pop-oriented sound was little more than repackaged pop music. In 2009, legendary country music artist [[George Jones]] proclaimed that \"they've (the new artists) stolen our identity. ... They had to use something that was established already, and that's traditional country music. So what they need to do really, I think, is find their own title, because they\u2019re definitely not traditional country music.\"<ref>\"George Jones: New country needs new name; 'They\u2019ve stolen our identity,' Hall of Famer says of genre's new crop of stars\", [[Associated Press]], November 2, 2009.

Rogers, Parton and [[Willie Nelson]], all artists who had No. 1 country hits as far back as the early 1970s, all had No. 1 songs during the 2000s decade \u2013 either as soloists (Rogers), as part of one-time duo pairings (Nelson) or as featured background vocalists (Parton). McEntire's success came with two albums hitting No. 1 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart (''[[Reba Duets]]'' and ''[[Keep On Loving You (album)|Keep On Loving You]]'' ), and at the end of the decade had her biggest hit of her career (\"[[Consider Me Gone]]\"). In addition, veteran songwriters such as [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]] and [[Bobby Braddock]] also enjoyed continued success with newly written songs. Late in the decade, newcomers such as [[Jamey Johnson]] and [[Miranda Lambert]] were widely hailed for their songwriting and performance talents.\n\nThe legendary group [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] retired from touring in 2004 after nearly a quarter century of mainstream success, primarily during the 1980s and 1990s. Its band members \u2013 cousins Randy Owen, Teddy Gentry and Jeff Cook; and drummer Mark Herndon \u2013 remained active performers and recorded a successful series of albums containing gospel and traditional old-time songs.\n\nMany legendary country music figures died during the decade. Some of the more prominent names included [[Pee Wee King]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[June Carter Cash]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Buck Owens]], [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Vern Gosdin]] and [[Hank Locklin]].\n\n=== Electronic music ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}\nIn Europe, [[Trance music]] was popular in the early 2000s, but this style diminished as the decade wore on. [[Hard House]] became the next big craze after trance in 2001, with a certain amount of cross-over between the two genres (in some cases creating [[Hard Trance]] tracks). As a kind of backlash, ambient, [[Chillout]] music achieved mainstream popularity in the early 2000s, with a successful market of chillout compilations and the genre even making it into television commercials and soundtracks.\n\n[[Disco house]] and [[funky house]], popular in the late 1990s, continued to be successful through to the mid-2000s before the sound of [[electro house]] developed in late 2006. The electro sound began to merge with other genres such as [[Hip Hop]] as the decade drew to a close.\n\nFrom 2007, [[dance music]] started gaining popularity in North America with [[dance-pop]] hits by artists such as the pop singer [[Rihanna]]'s song \"[[Don't Stop the Music (Rihanna song)|Don't Stop the Music]]\" and \"[[Disturbia (song)|Disturbia]]\". Hilary Duff in her album Dignity has changed her style from pop rock to the more contemporary electropop, to go with the current trends. In 2008 and 2009, [[electropop]] and [[Nu-disco]] increased in popularity in North America, replacing hip-hop and R&B as the dominant genres of music. Artists like [[Britney Spears]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], and [[Lady Gaga]] brought this style to great popularity towards the end of 2008 with their hits such as Britney's \"[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]\", Beyonce's [[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]] and Gaga's ''[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]''. Furthermore, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s singles such as \"[[Hung Up]]\" (#1 in 45 countries) and \"[[4 Minutes (Madonna song)|4 Minutes]]\" (#1 in 32 countries) become huge dance hits. (See [[#R&B/Hip-hop/Urban Pop|hip hop, urban pop and R&B]] above for more information.)\n\nPop duo [[Aly & A.J.]] explored electropop and 1980s new wave influences in their second album \"[[Insomniatic]]\". In addition, some of the most successful [[Electronica]] American artists and DJs in the 1990s, such as [[Moby]] and [[The Crystal Method]], also continued their success during the 2000s.\n\n=== Jazz ===\n[[File:Diana krall.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Diana Krall]], 2007]]\nIn the 2000s, [[straight-ahead jazz]] continued to appeal to a core group of listeners. Well-established jazz musicians, such as [[Dave Brubeck]], Wynton Marsalis, [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Wayne Shorter]] and [[Jessica Williams (musician)|Jessica Williams]], continue to perform and record. In the 2000s, a number of young musicians emerged, including the pianist [[Jason Moran (musician)|Jason Moran]], vibraphonist [[Stefon Harris]], trumpeter [[Roy Hargrove]], and bassist [[Christian McBride]].\n\nIn addition, a number of new vocalists have achieved popularity with a mix of traditional jazz and pop/rock forms, such as [[Diana Krall]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Kurt Elling]], and [[Jamie Cullum]]. Norah Jones and Diana Krall, due to their massive international success during the 2000s are considered the first and second most successful female jazz singers of the decade, respectively. Diana Krall has topped the Music Billboards multiple times in the year 2000. The week of April 15, 2000, Krall's album \"When I Look in Your Eyes\" reached number one, followed by Al Jarreau's \"Tomorrow Today\" and Kenny G's \"Classics in the Key of G.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/jazz-albums |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220212029/http://www.billboard.com/charts/jazz-albums |archive-date=February 20, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Norah Jones was named the top jazz artist of the 2000\u20132009 decade by Billboard.<ref>[[Norah Jones]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} Jones had many albums come out in the 2000s decade, including Jazz and Adult Contemporary.

He has also had several No. 1 singles, \"[[Get Busy]]\", \"[[Temperature (song)|Temperature]]\" and \"[[Baby Boy (Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles song)|Baby Boy]]\" (a duet with [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles|Beyonc\u00e9]]).\n\n====Reggaeton====\n[[Reggaeton]] gained mainstream exposure and massive popularity in North America during the mid-2000s. Reggaeton blends [[British West Indies|West-Indian]] music influences of [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] with those of Latin America, such as [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]], [[plena]], [[salsa music|salsa]], [[Merengue music|merengue]], [[latin pop]], [[cumbia]] and [[bachata (music)|bachata]] as well as that of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[contemporary R&B]], and [[electronica]]. The influence of this genre has spread to the wider Latino communities in the United States, as well as the Latin American audience. [[Shakira]] has sold more than 100 million copies in the 21st century.\n\n=== Christian music ===\nChristian music continued to gain popularity after the success in the 1990s with acts such as [[Jars of Clay]] and [[Audio Adrenaline]]. [[Relient K]]'s work in the pop punk/pop rock scene earned them three albums certified gold\u2014''[[The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek]]'', ''[[Two Lefts Don't Make a Right...but Three Do]]'', and ''[[MMHMM]]''\u2014and a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination. Skillet recorded two Grammy-nominated albums\u2014''[[Collide (Skillet album)|Collide]]'' and ''[[Comatose (album)|Comatose]]''\u2014and achieved Platinum-selling status with ''[[Awake (Skillet album)|Awake]]'', and Gold with ''Comatose''.\n\n=== Billboard Artist of the Decade ===\nOn December 11, 2009, Billboard Magazine named Rapper [[Eminem]] as the best Artist of the Decade for the 2000s. He joins the list with Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Elton John, Michael Jackson, and Mariah Carey, who have also been awarded this honor in their respective decades.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{See also|Music of the United Kingdom (2000s)}}\n\n=== Rock ===\n[[File:Coldplay-3.jpg|thumb|290px|right|[[Coldplay]] is considered to be the most successful British rock act of the decade.]]\n[[File:Franz-ferdinand-live-2006-tag.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] in concert in 2006]]\nFollowing after the success of [[Radiohead]] and [[The Verve]] in the 1990s, [[Post-Britpop]] act [[Coldplay]] saw major success in European album charts during the decade. British [[Indie rock]] and [[indie pop]] returned to popularity in the mid-late 2000s with artists such as [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Belle and Sebastian]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Keane (band)|Keane]], [[The Libertines]], [[Editors (band)|Editors]], [[Lily Allen]], [[Kate Nash]], [[Florence And The Machine]], and [[The Ting Tings]] achieving substantial chart success. Post punk bands such as [[Bloc Party]], [[Foals (band)|Foals]] and Editors also saw some popularity. Britpop act [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] also remained popular in the 2000s (decade), spawning four number one albums in the UK until the disbandment of the group in autumn 2009.\n\n[[U2]] continued their popularity into the 2000s, releasing three critically acclaimed albums, and were credited with influencing many prominent acts of the decade such as [[Coldplay]] and [[Muse (band)|Muse]].\n\nIn the early and mid-2000s, British [[Indie rock]] groups such as [[The Libertines]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Bloc Party]] and [[Kaiser Chiefs]] witnessed commercial and chart success not seen by guitar music since Britpop in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kayley-kravitz/post-punk-revival-_b_2003987.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Kayley | last=Kravitz | title=Revisiting the Post-Punk Revival | date=October 23, 2012 | access-date=April 10, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028095022/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kayley-kravitz/post-punk-revival-_b_2003987.html | archive-date=October 28, 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> Regional indie rock scenes such as [[New Yorkshire]] also appeared at this point in the decade. [[Indie music]] itself increased in popularity due to the increased commercialization of alternative, and major labels begin marketing indie bands with mainstream appeal. American indie/rock band [[The Killers]] also became very popular in Britain with their singles \"[[Mr. Brightside]]\", \"[[When You Were Young]]\" and \"[[Smile Like You Mean It]]\".\n\n[[Radiohead]] enjoyed further success in the 2000s, moving away from their experimental sound of the ''Kid A''/''Amnesiac'' era to a more \"typical\" Alternative rock sound. [[Coldplay]] also enjoyed success with four number one albums and a US No. 1 single with \"[[Viva la Vida]]\", the first English band to do so since [[The Beatles]]. [[Muse (band)|Muse]] saw a similar level of commercial acclaim, with the rock trio releasing three chart-topping albums.\n\nThe late 2000s (entering into the early 2010s) saw the revival and influence of [[synthpop]] music, also known as '[[new urbanism|new urban]]' pop. Notable acts include [[Hot Chip]], [[Junior Boys]], [[Little Boots]] and [[La Roux]]. The late 2000s also saw acts such as Irish rock band [[The Script]] have international success.\n\nThe era also saw solo success for singer-songwriters, including [[David Gray (musician)|David Gray]], [[Dido (singer)|Dido]],<ref>M.

Also, more established pop acts such as [[Pepe Aguilar]], [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Luis Fonsi]], and ex-OV7 member [[Kalimba Marichal|Kalimba]] would use pop rock in their repertoires. Pop-rock music hits new highs in the 2000s with acts such as [[Man\u00e1]], [[Juanes]], and [[Julieta Venegas]] topping the charts in several countries.\n[[File:Shakira at Obama Inaugural (cropped).jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Shakira]] is considered the biggest Latin act of the decade.]]\n\n=== Reggaet\u00f3n ===\nIn 2002, New York-based group [[Aventura (band)|Aventura]] would reinvent bachata, thus making it a dominant Latin genre. By 2004, reggaeton would become a staple in music with acts such as [[Don Omar]], [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Ivy Queen]] and [[Wisin & Yandel]]. By mid-2000s Reggaet\u00f3n had replaced salsa, merengue and cumbia as the main dance genre in nightclubs for young people all over Latin America, reaching popularity in parts of Spain and Italy as well. But by the end of 2007, this craze soon declined in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/music/where-are-they-now-reggaeton-superstar-updates?slide=4 |title=Reggaeton Performer Updates & Bios: Where Are They Now? |work=[[Latina magazine|Latina]] |publisher=Latina Media Ventures, LLC |author=Trivino, Jesus |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2013-04-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930141858/http://www.latina.com/entertainment/music/where-are-they-now-reggaeton-superstar-updates?slide=4 |archivedate=September 30, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=== Salsa and merengue ===\nAlthough salsa and merengue began to decline in popularity, merengue would have new life injected thanks to the subgenre known as, \"merengue de calle\" (or street merengue). Beginning in 2004, this subgenre combining elements of merengue, rap, and reggaeton would be popularized by Dominican acts such as Omega, Silvio Mora, El Sujeto, and Tito Swing.\n\n== Asia ==\nWith the rapid development of [[Economy of Asia|Asian economies]] during the 1990s and 2000s, the independent [[Music of Asia|music industries of Asia]] have seen considerable growth. Asian countries like Japan and India have some of the largest music markets in the world. Supported by their own large markets, the music charts in Asia are largely dominated by local [[Asian people|Asian]] artists, with very few artists from the Western world managing to break those markets.\n\n[[J-pop]] and [[K-pop]] have become increasingly influenced by [[contemporary R&B]], [[hip hop music]] and [[Eurobeat]], and they have become popular all over the Far East region. Meanwhile, in the [[South Asia|Southern Asia]] region, the rising independent [[Indian pop]] scene, often characterized by its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of Indian and non-Indian sounds, has begun to increasingly compete with the popularity of [[Filmi|Bollywood ''filmi'' music]] in the region. In Southeast Asia, especially Singapore and Indonesia, straight-ahead jazz saw a revival in the second half of the decade.\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{See also|J-Pop}}\n\n[[J-Pop]] continues to be in the mainstream and stays as the most popular style of music in Japan. Japanese Pop's popularity continues to expand through Asia and the rest of the world, with various Japanese artists debuting in the US. J-Pop starts to enjoy a relatively big global online fan base. It continues to influence worldwide styles of music, as Japanese culture has continuously become more popular around the world. Japan also remains as the second most powerful music industry in the world, and the second largest music market, after the US. [[R&B]] is popular at the beginning of the era, with [[Hip-Hop]] also becoming more popular as time passes. At the end of the decade, Dance music and [[Techno]] become the most popular genres. Bubblegum pop remains popular during the entire decade.\n\n[[Ayumi Hamasaki]] becomes one of the most popular Japanese star of the 2000s, experiencing her biggest peak at this time, becoming known as \"[[List of honorific titles in popular music|The Empress of Japanese Pop]]\", and greatly influencing music, fashion and pop culture. [[Ken Hirai]] becomes the most popular male solo artist. 1990s divas like [[Namie Amuro]], [[Misia (singer)|Misia]], and [[Hikaru Utada]] also remain extremely popular during this era, with the former having a second popularity boom in 2008. Starlet [[Kumi Koda]] also becomes insanely popular in this era, thanks to her fresh dance style and provocative dance moves. Boy bands are the most popular musical format at the moment, with girl bands like [[Morning Musume]] (very popular in the past) experiencing a decline in popularity. While [[Johnny & Associates|Johnny]]'s boy bands, notably [[Arashi]], become very popular, other vocal groups like [[Exile (Japanese band)|Exile]] and [[Tohoshinki]] also gained popularity and pop/rock bands like [[Mr. Children]], [[Tokio (band)|Tokio]] and [[Glay]] remained popular. Duets also become popular, such as [[M-Flo]]. Like all countries, English pop music popularity expands at a very high rate with popular US artist receiving success such as [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Britney Spears]] who become the most popular and two of the most successful non-Japanese artists.\n\n=== India ===\n{{See also|Indian pop|Filmi}}\n\nThe [[Music of India|Indian music industry]] was previously dominated by the ''[[Filmi]]'' music of [[Bollywood]] for much of the late 20th century. The 2000s saw an increasing popularity of independent [[Indian pop]] music that could compete with [[Bollywood]] film music. Indian pop music began distinguishing itself from mainstream Bollywood music with its [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of Indian and non-Indian sounds, which later had on influence on Bollywood music itself. Indian pop has itself been partly influenced by the [[Asian Underground]] scene emerging in the United Kingdom among [[British Asian]] artists such as [[Bally Sagoo]], [[Apache Indian]], [[Panjabi MC]], [[Raghav]] and the [[Rishi Rich Project]] (featuring [[Rishi Rich]], [[Jay Sean]] and [[Juggy D]]). India has one of the largest music markets in the world, though like other developing nations, suffers from high levels of piracy.\n\nIndian music has also had an increasing influence on popular music in the Western world. The music of South Asia has influenced Europe's pop mainstream as acts like [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Bananarama]], [[Erasure]], and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] all released singles or remixes featuring South Asian instrumentation. Indian music has also influenced mainstream American [[hip hop]], R&B and [[Urban contemporary|urban music]] in the 2000s, including artists/producers such as [[Timbaland]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[Truth Hurts (singer)|Truth Hurts]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Britney Spears]].

Bottom right: [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]] and Sarafina.]]\nThis page lists the characters appearing in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] ''[[The Lion King (franchise)|The Lion King]]'' franchise.\n\n==Introduced in ''The Lion King'' (1994)==\n===Simba===\n{{main|Simba}}\n\n[[Simba]] (voiced by [[Matthew Broderick]] as adult Simba in the films, [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] as a cub in ''[[The Lion King]]'', Matt Weinberg as a cub in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'', [[Cam Clarke]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa'', [[Rob Lowe]] in ''The Lion Guard'', [[Donald Glover]] in the 2019 film, [[JD McCrary]] as a cub in the 2019 film) is the son of Mufasa and Sarabi, Scar's nephew, Nala's mate, and Kiara and Kion's father. After defeating Scar, Simba takes Mufasa's place as King of Pride Rock before marrying Nala and having Kiara and Kion with her. His name means \"lion\" in Swahili which is his species.\n\nIn ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', Simba is an overprotective parent of Kiara, and obtains a great hatred of the Outsiders, a group of lions whom he exiled due to their loyalty to Scar, specifically Scar's protege Kovu, before learning to let go of his hate, and accepting Kovu as his son in law.\n\nIn ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', Simba fathers Kion, and initially refuses to accept Kion's decision to allow non-lion animals into the Lion Guard, but later accepts his proposal. Currently in the show, after a failed attempt on Simba's life, orchestrated by the spirit of Scar, Simba and Kion plot to defeat him once again and for all. As of Season 3, Scar's ghost has been defeated and his followers have become neutral under the rule of Jasiri, who becomes the new Outlands' leader. However, due to a facial wound caused by a snake bite during the battle, Kion journeys to find the Tree of Life, to get healed. Simba bids his son farewell on his trip. He later welcomes Kion home following his journey and accepts his love to Rani of the Night Pride.\n\n===Nala===\n{{main|Nala (The Lion King)}}\n\n[[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]] (voiced by [[Moira Kelly]] in the films, Niketa Calame as a cub in ''[[The Lion King]]'', [[Gabrielle Union]] in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', [[Beyonc\u00e9]] in the 2019 film, and [[Shahadi Wright Joseph]] as a cub in the 2019 film) is the daughter of Sarafina, the best friend and later mate of Simba; she is also Kiara and Kion's mother. Although she is a prominent character in ''The Lion King'', she makes minor appearances in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'', and ''The Lion Guard''.\n\nIn ''[[The Lion King]]'', she is portrayed as Simba's childhood friend. Her name means \"gift\" in Swahili. After helping Simba enter the elephant graveyard, she has to be rescued by Mufasa when the hyenas attack them. Several years later, Nala encounters Simba as a young adult and develops a romance with him. After returning to Pride Rock, she helps Simba defeat Scar and take his rightful place as King of Pride Rock. In ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', Nala is depicted as slightly older, calmer, and less overprotective of Kiara than her mate, Simba.\n\n===Timon and Pumbaa===\n{{main|Timon and Pumbaa}}\n\nTimon (voiced by [[Nathan Lane]] in the films and the TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'', [[Quinton Flynn]] in earlier episodes of the TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaaa]]'', [[Kevin Schon]] in both later episodes of the TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'' and ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', Bruce Lanoil in the video games, [[Billy Eichner]] in [[The Lion King (2019 film)|the 2019 film]]) and Pumbaa (voiced by [[Ernie Sabella]] in the films, TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'', and ''The Lion Guard'', Leslie Hedger in ''Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure'', [[Seth Rogen]] in the 2019 film) are a [[meerkat]] and [[common warthog]] duo; Timon being a wise-cracking, yet loyal friend, while Pumbaa is gluttonous, yet brave.\n\nWhen they first meet Simba in ''[[The Lion King]]'', they save an unconscious Simba from a flock of vultures. They take him in and bring him to their home in an oasis. Later, after Simba grows up and returns to the Pride Lands to battle Scar, they help Simba stop Scar's tyrannical reign and the two become Simba's royal advisors.\n\nAlthough they are supporting characters in the first two films, they are featured as the main characters in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' as well as in the TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]''.\n\nAs revealed in the TV series ''The Lion Guard'', they are the adoptive uncles of the honey badger Bunga and make their home at Hakuna Matata Falls.\n\nIn the live-action film, Timon and Pumbaa had different animals as their neighbors in the oasis like a flock of [[guineafowl]] (one of them is voiced by [[Amy Sedaris]]), a [[galago]] (voiced by [[Chance the Rapper]]), an [[elephant shrew]] (voiced by [[Josh McCrary]]), a [[topi]] (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) that has an awkward conversation with Simba, a [[bat-eared fox]], an [[aardvark]], a [[greater kudu]], some [[dik-dik]]s, and some [[Thomson's gazelle]]s.\n\n===Scar===\n{{main|Scar (The Lion King)}}\n\nScar (voiced by [[Jeremy Irons]] in ''The Lion King'', [[Jim Cummings]] in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and ''The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure'', James Horan in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', ''Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure'', and ''Sorcerers Of The Magic Kingdom'', [[David Oyelowo]] in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] in the 2019 film) is the main antagonist of ''The Lion King'' franchise. He is a black-maned lion who is Simba's paternal uncle and Mufasa's younger brother. His name means \"kovu\" in Swahili, similar to his adoptive son. In ''The Lion King'', by murdering Mufasa and exiling Simba, he becomes \"King of the Pride Lands\". However, years later, Simba returns to Pride Rock and overthrows Scar to become King of the Pride Lands. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas.\n\nIn ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' it is revealed that Scar's protege were exiled from Pride Rock by Simba in the wake of Scar's death, with Scar's most loyal follower, Zira, being the leader. Scar is mentioned several times by the characters, but makes two cameos. His first appearance is during Simba's nightmare, where he morphs into Kovu, and throws him into the stampede that killed Mufasa, in a similar manner to the first film. His second appearance is during Kovu's exile in which Kovu looks into his reflection and instead of his, he sees the image of his adoptive father. At the end of the film, Kovu marries Kiara, Simba's daughter and Scar's great niece, and becomes Simba's son-in-law and successor, so thus Scar's goal of Kovu becoming King would eventually come through following Simba's death or abdication to the throne, but not by avenging his death by murdering Simba.\n\n''The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar'' reveals that Scar was once the leader of the titular group and once possessed the Roar of the Elders. Scar lost the Roar after using it to destroy the other members of his Lion Guard, as the Roar is meant to be used for good and not evil. In season 2 of ''The Lion Guard'', Kion unknowingly summons Scar back as a fiery spirit in a volcano after using the Roar in anger when Janja the hyena provokes him. Scar then conspires with the animals in the Outlands to take over the Pride Lands and defeat the new Lion Guard and Simba, who were initially unaware that Scar had returned. Later in the season, Kion and the guard find out that Scar has returned, while they are in the Outlands getting volcanic ash needed to cure Simba from a scorpion sting. In the season 3 premiere ''Battle for the Pride Lands'', Scar continues to battle the Lion Guard, who are now adolescents. At the end of ''Battle for the Pride Lands'', Kion summons the Great Kings of the Past to rain upon Scar, thus destroying him once and for all.\n\nIn the live-action film, Scar told Zazu to get help to rescue Simba while he goes to help him. This was a cover-up so that Scar can kill Mufasa. When Mufasa is dead and Simba has fled, Scar takes over as the ruler of the Pride Lands while allowing the hyenas to work with the lions. This led to overhunting. When Sarabi refuses to become Scar's mate, Scar makes things worse by having the hyenas eat first and they don't leave much behind. By the second advancement, Scar struck down Sarabi when she mentioned Mufasa. Like the films, Scar fought Simba and tried to blame Mufasa's death on the hyenas. When Scar is thrown off of Pride Rock, he survived the fall and was confronted by the hyenas. Scar states to them that if they build an army, they'll retake the Pride Lands. Azizi and Kamari state that they heard the insult towards them. Scar claims that he was trying to fool Simba. Shenzi states to Scar that he was right about a hyena's belly never being full. Scar strikes at some of the attacking hyenas until they swarm over him and kill him.\n\n===Mufasa===\nMufasa (voiced by [[James Earl Jones]] in the films and [[Gary Anthony Williams]] in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'') is Scar's older brother, Sarabi's mate, Simba's father and Kiara and Kion's paternal grandfather who is introduced as the King of the Pride Lands. The name \"Mufasa\" has an unknown origin, previously attributed to a fictional language called Manazoto. Mufasa is depicted as a just, wise, and responsible leader, a gentle but firm father, and strong and fierce protector when sufficiently provoked. In ''The Lion King'', he teaches Simba on what a king is supposed to be, and how the king is responsible for protecting and maintaining the delicate balance of the ecosystem, and mediate problems between its creatures. However, Mufasa later dies after being thrown into a wildebeest stampede by Scar while rescuing Simba. He returns years later as a spirit in the clouds to encourage an older Simba return to the Pride Lands and reclaim his rightful throne.\n\nIn ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', he instructs Rafiki to bring Kiara, Simba's daughter, and Kovu, Scar's heir, together to reunite the two lion prides.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', Mufasa serves as a spirit guide to his grandson Kion when he needs advice, and sometimes appears on his own when he notices he is troubled by something. When Kion is a teenager, Kion fights against Scar's spirit and his army, winning, but gets bit by Ushari, who gave him a scar on his eye. As a result, during the journey to the Tree of Life, the adolescent lion stops communicating with his grandfather due to issues with his scar and personal concerns about turning evil like Scar, and Mufasa became worried that he forgot about him, just like Simba did years ago when he became adult. When they finally talk again, Mufasa reassures Kion that he would always be here for him no matter what, showing that regardless of his grandson's scar, he still loves him dearly. Alongside Askari and the previous queen of the Tree of Life, Janna, he proudly watches over Kion after his marriage with Rani.  Jones reprised his role in the pilot episode, but the character was voiced by Gary Anthony Williams in subsequent appearances.\n\n''Lion King'' Directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff have described Jones' voice as powerful and similar to the roar of a lion.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nJones reprises his role in the 2019 remake of the film directed by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Aaron|last=Couch|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lion-king-live-action-movie-casts-donald-glover-as-simba-977488|title='Lion King' Remake Casts Donald Glover as Simba, James Earl Jones as Mufasa|magazine=[[Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}</ref> According to Favreau, Jones' lines remain mostly the same from the original film.<ref name=\"youtube1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftRPVHyELXo&t=19s|title=What To Expect From The Characters In The Upcoming 'The Lion King' Adaptation - Entertainment Weekly|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]/[[YouTube]]|language=en|date=April 25, 2019|accessdate=April 29, 2019|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/26/the-lion-king-james-earl-jones-mufasa/|title=The Lion King director recalls James Earl Jones' 'powerful' return as Mufasa|first=Marc|last=Snetiker|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 26, 2019|accessdate=May 2, 2019}}</ref> [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], who plays [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] in the film, said that \"the comfort of [Jones reprising his role] is going to be very rewarding in taking [the audience] on this journey again.

Her name means \"[[mirage]]\" in Swahili. In ''[[The Lion King]]'', she serves as the Queen of Pride Rock. Years after Scar usurps the throne, Sarabi helps Simba fight against Scar and his hyenas. When Simba defeats Scar, Sarabi dies and Nala becomes Queen and Sarabi becomes the Queen Dowager. \n \nIn the live action film following Mufasa's death, Scar tries to get Sarabi to be his mate; however, she turns down his advances.\n\n===Sarafina===\nSarafina (voiced by Zoe Leader in ''[[The Lion King]]'' and [[Penny Johnson Jerald]] [[The Lion King (2019 film)|in the 2019 film]]) is a lioness who is Nala's mother. She is first seen sleeping inside Pride Rock with Nala and the rest of the pride. She later cleans Nala before the latter leaves to go to the Elephant Graveyard with Simba. She makes her final appearance mourning the loss of Mufasa and Simba, unaware that Simba is still alive.\n\nIn the live action film, Sarafina's role is still the same. When the hyenas arrived at Pride Rock following Mufasa's death, Sarafina told Nala to stay close to her.\n\n===Zazu===\nZazu is a [[red-billed hornbill]]<ref name=hornbill>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Wednesdays: Zazu's 'Cousin' - Abyssinian Ground Hornbill Chick - a New Addition at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2011/08/wildlife-wednesdays-zazus-cousin%E2%80%94abyssinian-ground-hornbill-chick-a-new-addition-at-disneys-animal-kingdom-lodge|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> and [[majordomo]] to Mufasa and later Simba. (He is voiced by [[Rowan Atkinson]] in ''The Lion King''; [[Jim Piddock]] in ''Timon and Pumbaa's Jungle Games'' and ''The Lion King Simba's Mighty Adventure''; [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa''; [[Edward Hibbert]] in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and ''The Lion King 1\u00bd''; [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''The Lion Guard''; and [[John Oliver]] in the 2019 film). After Mufasa's death, Zazu becomes a prisoner of Scar before Pumbaa breaks the bone cage releasing him when Simba returns to the Pride Lands. He eventually acts as a scout and advises Simba on royal protocol.\n\nIn ''Timon & Pumbaa'', it is revealed that Zazu is not only a lion king's majordomo, he is a jungle administrator. In the episode \"Zazu's Off-By-One Day\", he is shown to be responsible for counting the population of the animals.\n\nIn the musical, Zazu is a puppet controlled by an actor dressed in blue striped clothes and a bowler hat, much like a stereotypical butler. Zazu's blue feathers have been replaced with white and the puppet is partially constructed from parachute silk with a slinky contained in the neck for ease in movement.<ref name=puppets>{{cite web|title=What's behind those wild 'Lion King' masks?|url=http://www.adn.com/2009/09/04/924245/whats-behind-those-wild-lion-king.html|work=www.adn.com|publisher=Anchorage Daily News|accessdate=22 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414141239/http://www.adn.com/2009/09/04/924245/whats-behind-those-wild-lion-king.html|archive-date=14 April 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlso appearing in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|2019 remake]] of ''The Lion King'', Zazu plays the same role as in the original version, but this time, he is introduced to Timon and Pumbaa and helps out in the battle by pecking Kamari numerous times.\n\n===Rafiki===\nRafiki (voiced by [[Robert Guillaume]] in the animated films and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''; [[Khary Payton]] in ''[[The Lion Guard]]''; and [[John Kani]] in the 2019 film), whose name means \"friend\" in Swahili, is a [[mandrill]] with an unnaturally long tail. He lives in a [[baobab]] tree in the Pride Lands and performs [[Shamanism|shamanistic]] services for the lions of Pride Rock. He's also shown to be a great martial artist.\n\nIn ''The Lion King'', Rafiki is introduced in the opening scene when he travels to Pride Rock to perform newborn Simba's presentation ceremony. During the film, Rafiki sings a nonsense chant: \"Asante sana, squash banana, wewe nugu, mimi hapana.\" This is a Swahili playground rhyme which translates to \"Thank you very much (squash banana), you're a baboon and I'm not!\" Like \"hakuna matata\" (no worries), the chant was heard by the filmmakers on their research trip to Kenya. Rafiki travels to the jungle where Simba lives with Timon and Pumbaa, and teaches him lessons about learning from the past: \"Yes, the past can hurt but, the way I see it you can either run from  it, or learn from it\" and then whacks him with his stick. During the battle for Pride Rock, Rafiki saves Simba from Banzai by whacking him with his stick, while fighting many more hyenas. At the end of the film, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub.\n\nIn ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', Rafiki is more closely involved with the affairs and politics of the pride and is often seen with the lions. Mufasa's spirit persuades him to bring Simba's daughter Kiara and Zira's son Kovu together as a way of uniting the Outsiders with the pride. Rafiki tries to make them fall in love by singing to them about a place called \"Upendi\", which means \"love\" in Swahili. In the end, he blesses the union of Kovu and Kiara, and Kovu is welcomed into the pride. Rafiki appears briefly in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'', teaching Timon the philosophy of \"[[Hakuna Matata]]\", talking to Timon's mother about her son, and later convincing Timon to follow Simba to Pride Rock to confront Scar.\n\nIn the musical, the character of Rafiki was significantly modified. Because director [[Julie Taymor]] felt that the story lacked a strong female character, Rafiki was changed into a female mandrill and [[sangoma]]. She acts as narrator throughout the story, at one point speaking to the audience in a [[Click language#Languages with clicks|click language]] for comic effect. She sings the opening song \"[[Circle of Life]]\", a [[keening]] song called \"Rafiki Mourns\" following Mufasa's death, and a brief part in Nala's song \"Shadowland\", when she blesses Nala for her journey to find help. Instead of detecting Simba's scent on dust, Rafiki hears Simba's song \"Endless Night\" on the wind. Rafiki finds Simba and shows him that his father lives on in him through the song \"[[He Lives in You]]\". She is present during the battle, fighting a hyena, and adorns Simba with the king's mantle after his victory; the play ends with her at the presentation of Simba and Nala's newborn cub.\n\nRafiki serves as a supporting character in the ''Timon and Pumbaa'' TV series, as well as a main character of said series as he has his own segments called \"Rafiki Fables\", where his shamanism is expanded. In the episode \"Good Mousekeeping\", it is revealed that Rafiki can grant wishes and can even take some of the wishes back. In another episode \"Rafiki's Apprentice\", Rafiki's stick is revealed to have magical powers. He explains to his nephew Nefu (voiced by [[Dana Hill]]) that the gourds on his stick are powerful for his magic. \n\nRafiki serves as a recurring character in ''[[The Lion Guard]]''.\n\n===Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed===\nShenzi (voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] in the animated films; [[Tress MacNeille]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa'' and ''Kingdom Hearts II''; Jennifer Lewis in ''Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom''; and [[Florence Kasumba]] in the 2019 film), Banzai (voiced by [[Cheech Marin]] in the animated films, ''Kingdom Hearts II'', and ''Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom''; and [[Rob Paulsen]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa'') and Ed (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) are the three [[spotted hyena]]s who make up Scar's henchmen that reside in the Elephant Graveyard. After Scar promises them and the rest of their fellow hyenas that they will have food in return for them helping him get rid of his brother Mufasa and nephew Simba in order to become King of the Pride Lands, the three hyenas trigger the [[wildebeest]] [[stampede]] which kills Mufasa and then chase Simba out of the Pride Lands on Scar's orders. When Simba returns to Pride Rock, Shenzi and Banzai are defeated by Pumbaa. The three turn on Scar when the latter tries to blame them for Mufasa's death and the ruin of the Pride Lands, and lead the rest of the hyenas into eating him alive during a wildfire, where they are engulfed by the surrounding flames.\n\nShenzi, Banzai, and Ed serve as main characters and [[Antihero|antiheroes]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa.'' They are given their own segments titled \"The Laughing Hyenas\" where they wander around the Serengeti looking for food. At the end of the episode \"TV Dinner\", the hyenas replace television host Martin Pardon, which may indicate that they are living a new life as directors and stars of the wildlife documentary show ''Kingdom of the Creatures'', where they get fed during their new career. In later seasons, they made minor appearances trying to attack Timon and Pumbaa.\n\nIn ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', it was only mentioned by Nuka that the hyenas have left the Elephant Graveyard. However, in the original draft of ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed were going to return as Zira's henchmen, with Cheech Marin reprising his role as Banzai from the original film despite presumably Whoopi Goldberg and Jim Cummings were supposed to come back as Shenzi and Ed. Yet they were cut, presumably due to Scar's death being at the hands of the hyena trio.\n\nIn ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'', Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed act as the local predators who attack Timon's meerkat colony before their allegiance with Scar.\n\nShenzi (voiced by [[Florence Kasumba]]) appears in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|CGI remake]] complete with a different personality. She is portrayed as ruthless and cunning matriarch with no-nonsense attitude and air of authority. She is also shown to have a rivalry with Nala. Ed was renamed Azizi (now voiced by [[Eric Andre]]), and Banzai was renamed Kamari (voiced by [[Keegan-Michael Key]]). Nevertheless, these two play largely similar roles to the original film, except Azizi (Ed) is able to talk. Like the film, Shenzi, Azizi, and Kamari heard the insult that Scar used on them. When Scar is defeated and the hyena pack confronts him, Scar states that they can retake the Pride Lands if they build an army. Azizi annd Kamari state that they heard the insult he used on them. Scar claims that he was trying to fool Simba. Shenzi quotes \"You're right about one thing Scar, a hyena's belly is never full.\" The hyenas attack as Scar strikes at some of them before the hyenas swarm over Scar and kill him.\n\nIn the original draft of the film, the hyenas were [[African wild dog]]s, referred to as \"Cape dogs\" in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://concept.lionking.org/characters/capedogs.shtml|title=The Lion King Concept Art Archive|website=concept.lionking.org|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> Their species may have been changed to illustrate the strong rivalry and competition between lions and hyenas in real life, the competition being much stronger than between lions and other predators.\n\n===Gopher===\nGopher (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) is a [[gopher]] who works for Zazu as an informant. In the film, he is seen warning Zazu that the hyenas have invaded the Pride Lands.\n\nGopher appeared in two segments starring Zazu in ''Timon & Pumbaa''.\n\n==Introduced in ''Timon & Pumbaa'' (1995-1999)==\n\n===Quint===\nQuint (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) is a human who is Timon and Pumbaa's archenemy. He is a sneaky, muscular man with black hair, a pink nose, and a shaven face; he has varying roles. His wears different clothes in each episode because of the different jobs he has, but he is often seen wearing a hat. He also has different first names that show what his jobs are (in which they all happen to start with C).\n\nQuint is a con artist who tricks Timon into stealing a gold nugget Pumbaa found in the episode \"Yukon Con\", a criminal who stole a suitcase that has $1,290,000 in the episode \"How to Beat the High Costa Rica\", an evil clock inspector who wants to get revenge on a timekeeper in the episode \"Swiss Missed\", a French chef who wants to make Speedy the Snail an escargot in the episode \"French Fried\", etc. In the episode \"The Pain in Spain\", two Quints are seen together which may prove that there is more than one of him.\n\nIn some episodes, Quint appears to be a respectable man with an honest job, but he still seems to annoy Timon and Pumbaa. Notably in Season 2, Quint's face appears to be clean-shaven except in the episode \"Klondike Con\" when he becomes a gold thief. Also in the episode \"Escape From Newark\", his nose is the same color as his body for the first time.\n\n===Speedy the Snail===\nSpeedy (voiced by [[Corey Burton]] impersonating [[Bing Crosby]]) is a talking grayish/bluish snail with a shiny red shell and a yellow fedora. Timon and Pumbaa plan to eat him at first, but his ability to speak and sing and his bon viveur, good-humored attitude gets him to become friends with them. Timon gives him the name \"Speedy\", because he thinks that it would be a brilliant incongruity. Speedy always finds himself in danger, such as becoming a French gourmet snail and an earring out of his shell, and it's always up for Timon and Pumbaa to save him.\n\nIn the episode \"The Man from J.U.N.G.L.E.\", Speedy is revealed to be a superhero called Super Duper Hero X after Timon and Pumbaa were captured by his nemesis Chromosome Quint. Every episode featuring Speedy end with Timon and Pumbaa saying bye to Speedy when they return him home, a seagull capturing Speedy, and then Timon and Pumbaa trying to save him once again. Speedy also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the episode \"Washington Applesauce\".\n\n===Fred===\nFred (voiced by [[S. Scott Bullock]]) is a meerkat who is Timon's other best friend back at the meerkat colony. He is a practical joker, employing such gags as the hand buzzer, the squirting flower, and the whoopee cushion. He also loved Timon's hyena jokes. When Fred visits Timon and Pumbaa, he pulls more practical jokes on the duo, such as impersonating Timon's mother or impersonating a Billy Goat guard. Timon and Pumbaa, however, don't find Fred's jokes very funny and they often overpower him. Aside from pulling practical jokes, Fred enjoys doing all sorts of activities, such as playing Turtle Tennis and Fishing for Flamingos. He also mentions that he and Timon have always gone Bowling for Buzzards.\n\nAt the meerkat colony, Fred's duty was to guard the Duke Meerkat's castle, although on the day the Duke left the colony, he snuck away to get a snack and convinced Timon that it was now his chance to go on a date with Princess Tatiana. When the Duke banished Timon from the colony after a cobra kidnapped the princess, Fred's new duty was to guard the back gate, which indicates that he has been demoted for failing to protect the castle.\n\nFred appears in a total of four episodes: \"Tanzania Zany\", \"Mombasa-In-Law\", \"Once Upon a Timon\", and \"Mind Over Matterhorn\".\n\n===Boss Beaver===\nBoss Beaver (voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]) is an ill-tempered and cantankerous [[beaver]] with a white hard hat. His lifestyle is the exact opposite of Timon and Pumbaa's Hakuna Matata lifestyle: Boss Beaver likes to work while Timon and Pumbaa like to relax. He owns a lumber mill and an amusement park called \"Boss Beaver's Log Land\". Boss Beaver also has three mottos: \"Makuta Hamaka\", which means \"work real hard\", \"safety first\" and \"you break it, you buy it.\"\n\nBoss Beaver's favorite quote is \"I am Boss Beaver and the reason they call me Boss Beaver is that I am your boss and I am a beaver. Therefore, I am Boss Beaver.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Amusement Bark\", it is revealed that he has a mischievous son named Boy Beaver, who keeps breaking things at his amusement park and getting Timon blamed for it.\n\nBoss Beaver appears in a total of three episodes.\n\nHe also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the episode \"Washington Applesauce.\"\n\n===Irwin===\nIrwin (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) is a clumsy, accident-prone penguin with a green scarf and a brown hat. Timon and Pumbaa befriend him at a boat stop in Antarctica when they see that he has two extra tickets for the duo to get on the ship. When Irwin leaves his home with the duo, it is shown that he has obviously injured all of his penguin \"friends\", as they are all seen wearing bandages. Timon dislikes Irwin's clumsiness, and tries to get rid of him by tricking him into playing a game of Hide-and-Seek. Irwin accidentally causes the boat to sink and Timon and Pumbaa run into him on an island. Timon confronts the penguin and he tricks him into playing another game and Irwin accidentally causes the island to sink.\n\nIrwin meets Timon and Pumbaa again at a Hakuna Matata Megamall. Due to his clumsiness, Timon and Pumbaa try to avoid him by hiding in various stores. Irwin appears in two episodes of the TV series, \"Frantic Atlantic\" and \"Shopping Mauled\".\n\n===Toucan Dan===\nToucan Dan (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a dangerously clever criminal mastermind lying toucan who wears a red [[fez]]. He is a convincing liar and impersonator and would also do anything to get someone in trouble. In his debut episode \"I Don't Bolivia\", he keeps tricking Timon into freeing him from his cage. Later in the episode, while Timon impersonates Toucan Dan in order to not be in trouble with the police, Toucan Dan impersonates Timon and this makes Pumbaa have to decide which one is the real Timon.\n\nToucan Dan makes his second and final appearance in the episode \"Alcatraz Mataz\". In that episode, he frames Timon and Pumbaa for stealing a train car full of beak polish and the police throw them in jail. Angry at Toucan Dan, Timon and Pumbaa escape to catch the toucan and make him tell the truth.\n\n===Rabbit===\nRabbit (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) is a large and tall pink hare who appears to be very annoying, tiring. He made his debut in the episode \"Mojave Desserted\". In that episode, Timon and Pumbaa save his life when he was drowning in [[quicksand]] and he decides to repay the duo hand and foot. Annoyed by Rabbit, Timon and Pumbaa hatch a plan to put themselves in danger and have Rabbit save them and then leave them alone.\n\nRabbit makes his second and final appearance in the episode \"Africa-Dabra!,\" this time appearing as an unsympathetic and ruthless magician. After Timon pulls him out of a hat, he teams up with the meerkat to become part of his magic act, telling him that he has been looking for a partner for years. When he gets annoyed by Pumbaa ruining the magic acts, he breaks up Timon and Pumbaa's friendship. When Pumbaa finds out that Timon never truly said anything mean about him, he gets revenge on Rabbit by trapping him in a cage and later skinning him for his disguise.\n\n===Vulture Police===\nThe Vulture Police (voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]] and [[Brian Cummings]]) are recurring characters.\n\nThey make their first appearance in the episode \"The Law of the Jungle,\" where they arrest Timon for using the Forbidden Stick to scratch his back and take him to Judge Rhino, who gives a number of tests to see whether he's innocent or guilty.\n\nIn the episode \"Yosemite Remedy,\" Timon and Pumbaa go to the police after a criminal raccoon steals their suitcase full of valuables. When they handcuff the thief, he tells them that he didn't steal Timon and Pumbaa's suitcase, he found it. The police let him go, but later arrest him again when they find out that he really stole the duo's suitcase while catching him in the act.\n\nIn the episode \"Alcatraz Mataz\", the Vulture Police throw Timon and Pumbaa in jail after they were convinced by Toucan Dan that they stole the train car full of beak polish. After Timon and Pumbaa confront Toucan Dan, the police show up and realize that it was really Toucan Dan who stole the train car, so they arrest the toucan. However, they also throw Timon and Pumbaa back in jail since they escaped when they told them not to no matter if they were framed or not.\n\nThe Vulture Police make a brief appearance in the episode \"Wide Awake in Wonderland\".\n\n===Cheetata and Cheetato===\nCheetata (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) and Cheetato (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) are a pair of sophisticated twin [[cheetah]]s, reminiscent of Warner Bros' [[Goofy Gophers]], speaking in British accents and using similar phrases (\"Indubitably,\" \"How very kind of you\"). In order to tell them apart, not only do they have different voices, they also have different personalities: Cheetata appears to be more eager and aggressive while Cheetato seems more likely to think things through.\n\nThe cheetahs first appear in the episode \"Cooked Goose\", where they are annoyed by Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed getting in the way of their wildebeest hunt, so they try sending them on various wild goose chases. They also appear in \"Gabon with the Wind,\" where they are convinced by Timon that he is going to catch Pumbaa for them, when he is actually going to find his friend so that they can both run away to safety.\n\nIn the episode \"Boary Glory Days\", Timon and Pumbaa use Cheetata and Cheetato to play a game of Predator Tag. While the cheetahs are chasing Timon and Pumbaa, the duo outsmarts the brothers by having them jump over a mud pool and fall into it.\n\n===The Three Natives===\nThe Three Natives (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) are a trio of tribes who are really university students taking part in the \"Be a Native\" weekends. They have a leader (also voiced by Jeff Bennett) who is also a university student and who usually precedes what he says with \"Bungala, bungala.\" The natives first appear in \"Boara Boara\". This episode shows that they used to have a warthog king of the island, which is unknown what might've happened to him. Therefore, the natives might have not seen their king in a really long time. When Timon and Pumbaa visit the island, the natives mistake Pumbaa for their long-lost king and they make Timon his servant. Everything goes well until they make Pumbaa relight the fire and realize that he's an impostor when they see that he is unable to do so. After Timon and Pumbaa escape, the three natives shed their disguises upon getting tired of being hit by the leader's staff and return to the university. The leader orders them to return or else they'll lose their deposit.\n\nThe natives also appear in the episode \"New Guinea Pig,\" where Pumbaa decides to trade his tusks to them. After they fail to get the tusks, the three natives shed their disguises and return to the university.\n\nIn \"Beast of Eden\", the three natives are shown with their leader again where they steal a golden magic tooth that belongs to a beast and Timon and Pumbaa have to retrieve it from them.\n\nThey also make a brief appearance in the episode \"Mozam-Beaked\" when Timon and Pumbaa go to Bora Bora to throw a woodpecker into the volcano.\n\n===Mr. Bear===\nMr. Bear (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) is a grumpy, short-tempered, but nice grizzly bear, although he gets easily angered, such as when he is awoken from his nap or when someone gets his food order wrong. He also has a romantic interest in a beautiful supermodel named Leslie Lambeau (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]). He appears in seven episodes, from \"Slalom Problem\" to \"It Runs Good\". In the episode \"Jailhouse Shock,\" Mr. Bear becomes cell mates with Little Jimmy, who gets even with Timon and Pumbaa by taking advantage of him by convincing him that the duo hurt him so that he could beat them up. Mr. Bear starts to show compassion for Timon and Pumbaa in the episodes \"Ready, Aim, Fire\" and \"Stay Away from my Honey!\" In the former, he operated as Smolder the Bear (a parody of [[Smokey Bear]]) who dislikes fires and saves Timon and Pumbaa from being cooked on Quint's fire.\n\n===Tatiana===\nTatiana (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) is the daughter of the Duke Meerkat and the princess of the meerkat colony. She only appears in one episode but she's vital for Timon's past. After Timon leaves his sentry duty post to prepare for his date with Tatiana, a king cobra enters the colony and kidnaps the princess, which makes everyone believe she's dead and which causes Timon to get banished. After Timon and Pumbaa meet for the first time, they see that Tatiana is still alive and rescue her from a cobra. When Tatiana returns to the colony with Timon and Pumbaa, Timon is offered her hand in marriage. When the Duke makes him choose between Tatiana or Pumbaa, he chooses to be Bestest Best friends with Pumbaa as they leave the Meerkat colony. Although \"Once Upon a Timon\" was meant to be Tatiana's only appearance, there is a female meerkat who bears a striking resemblance to her in the episode \"Timon in Love\". The only difference is that Tatiana has blond hair while the other meerkat has red hair, and she's not wearing a tiara.\n\n===Sharla===\nSharla (voiced by [[Billy West]]) is a female warthog who is the leader of Pumbaa's former sounder as well as Pumbaa's former girlfriend. While she only appears in one episode, she is vital for Pumbaa's past. She and three other male warthogs of the sounder banished Pumbaa from the group due to his awful scent, which was appalling even by warthog standards.\n\nYears later, Sharla and the three warthogs carry around a big bag of bugs for the rainy season, but come across a flock of Guinea fowl, who are their natural enemies and nightmares. Due to the birds' abilities to remove their furs in just a few seconds, the warthogs refuge in a hut and make a distress call, which Pumbaa answers. When Pumbaa reunites with his sounder, he has Timon come up with ideas on how they can get rid of the Guinea fowl. However, none of Timon's ideas work, so Pumbaa suggests that he and Timon use the jeep so that they carry a fake bag of bugs (which have firecrackers inside) to distract the Guinea fowl while Sharla and the other warthogs leave the hut with the real bag of bugs.\n\nAlthough Sharla banished Pumbaa from the group, they still have romantic feelings for each other. When Pumbaa arrives at the hut, they tell each other that they have never forgotten one another. Sharla tells Pumbaa that he should stay with the group, but Pumbaa decides to continue living his Hakuna Matata lifestyle with Timon, which the female warthog understands.\n\n===Ned the Elephant===\nNed (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is a high and mighty African bush elephant who thinks he's wonderful at everything. He seems to enjoy teasing Timon and Pumbaa when they fail at proving their worth to him. In the episode \"Uganda be an Elephant\", Timon states that Ned is the most popular guy in the jungle and Pumbaa decides to turn himself into an elephant in order to be popular as well. Although Ned is selfish and sarcastic, he gets a change of heart after Pumbaa rescues him and his hippo henchmen from falling off a cliff.\n\nIn the episode \"Unlucky in Lesotho\", it is revealed that Ned has a Good Luck Club, which lost most of its members due to Ned bringing an unlucky jar into the club. Because he gets attacked by piranha upon falling into the river after a [[black panther]] cub crosses his path, Ned is never seen or heard from again after this episode, implying that he was devoured by the piranha.\n\n===Little Jimmy===\nLittle Jimmy (voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]) is a cute, yet dangerous bluebird. He is similar to Toucan Dan, with the fact that he is also a criminal mastermind and he can also be dishonest. He also has two voices: his fake cute, innocent voice to pass himself off as a hatchling and his criminal voice to show that he is truly an adult. Little Jimmy first appears in the episode \"Nest Best Thing,\" where he tricks Pumbaa into building a birdhouse for him, which is actually a hideout. The pigeon police show up and arrest Little Jimmy.\n\nIn the episode \"Jailhouse Shock,\" Little Jimmy is cell mates with Mr. Bear. In order to get revenge on Timon and Pumbaa for turning him in, he tricks Mr. Bear into thinking that Timon and Pumbaa hurt him so that he could hurt them back.\n\n==Introduced in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' (1998)==\n\n===Kiara===\nKiara (voiced by [[Neve Campbell]] as an adult; [[Michelle Horn]] as Kiara when she is a cub in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride''; and [[Eden Riegel]] in ''The Lion Guard'') is the daughter of [[Simba]] and [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]], and Kion's older sister. She has a cameo appearance in ''The Lion King'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} and is a major character in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and ''The Lion Guard''. Kiara is also a granddaughter of Mufasa and Sarabi, who are Simba's parents.\n\nKiara is portrayed as a feisty, playful, and adventurous princess whom her over-protective father Simba easily fears for her safety. As a cub, Kiara befriends Kovu when playing at the Outlands where they work together to escape a group of crocodiles. Unfortunately, their friendship is cut short as they are separated by their respective parents. As a young adult, Kiara is rescued by Kovu as part of Zira's plan to avenge Scar's death, but the two lions eventually fall in love. When Kovu is exiled from the Pride Lands following Zira's ambush on Simba, Kiara helps him return to the Pride Lands to stop the war and reunite the Pridelanders and Outsiders. Afterwards, she becomes Kovu's wife.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'' Kiara is seen being trained by her parents to be Queen and has a subtle sibling rivalry with Kion. Years later, she is engaged to Kovu where she assists him in explaining to Kion on what happened while he was away and what happened to Zira. Simba names her and Kovu as his successor as the ruler of the Pride Lands.\n\n===Kovu===\nKovu (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]] as an adult, as well as both a cub and an adult in ''The Lion Guard''; [[Ryan O'Donohue]] as Kovu when he is a cub) is the youngest child of Zira, the brother of Nuka and Vitani, and Scar's chosen heir. His name means \"scar\" in Swahili, similar to his adoptive father Scar. In his childhood, Kovu befriends Kiara, though this didn't last long as they are separated by their feuding parents. However, Kovu's newfound friendship with Kiara gives Zira the idea to use their friendship so that Kovu will have the opportunity to kill Simba. Since then, Zira trains Kovu to assassinate Simba and take his place as the king of Pride Rock. As young adult, Kovu rescues Kiara during a planned ambush and Simba reluctantly allows him to stay in the Pride Lands. While spending time with Kiara, Kovu begins to fall in love with her and thus, unable to bring himself to hurt Simba. However, after Simba is ambushed by the Outsiders and Nuka is killed, Simba mistakenly assumes Kovu to be behind the ambush and exiles him from the Pride Lands. While wandering around after being exiled, Kovu reunited with Kiara and she persuades him to unite both lion factions. Together with Kiara, they stops the war between two factions and convinced everyone except Zira to reconcile. Having proved himself, Simba pardons Kovu and allows him to become his eventual successor.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', Kovu appears with his family in their plot to take over Jasiri's territory. Kion learns from Kovu that Kiara knows him. Years later, Kion and the Lion Guard learn that Kovu and the rest of the Outsiders have rejoined Simba's pride following Zira's death. Simba names Kovu and Kiara as his successor as the ruler of the Pride Lands.\n\nKovu was originally going to be Scar's real son instead of adoptive, however this would make him and Kiara \"second cousins\" so Disney made him Scar's adoptive son.\n\n===Outsiders===\nThe Outsiders are a pride of offshoot lions that were loyal to Scar. After a failed takeover following Scar's death, Simba banished them to the Outlands. In ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', they tried to invade the territory that Jasiri's clan lives in. Kion was hesitant to use the Roar of the Elders because of what it did to Scar. After being told by the rest of the Lion Guard that Scar used the Roar for evil, Kion defeated the Outsiders with the Roar of the Elders which sent them flying to the Outlands' termite mound area which became their base of operations.\n\n====Zira====\nZira (voiced by [[Suzanne Pleshette]] in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and [[Nika Futterman]] in ''The Lion Guard''), meaning \"hate\" in Swahili, is the mother of Nuka, Kovu, and Vitani. She is Scar's most loyal follower, and plots to avenge Scar's death by forming the Outsiders. She takes advantage of Kovu's friendship with Simba's daughter Kiara, as part of her plan to assassinate Simba. When this plan failed due to Kovu's love for Kiara, Zira resorts to all-out war against Simba's pride. However, with Kiara and Kovu's help, Vitani and the other Outsiders decide to join Simba's pride and turn against Zira who persists in her revenge. Attempting to attack Simba, Zira is intercepted by Kiara and falls into a flash flood to her death, despite Kiara's failed attempt to rescue her.\n\nZira makes an appearance in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'' alongside Kovu, Nuka, Vitani, and the rest of her pride in the episode \"Lions of the Outlands\". She tries to convince Kion that using the Roar of the Elders against her and the other Outsiders would cause him to lose it just as Scar did, and to side with his fellow lions. However, Kion is eventually able to see through her deceptions and drives her and the others off with the Roar. Years later, her death was mentioned by Kiara and Kovu when the Lion Guard returned and met Vitani's incarnation of the Lion Guard.\n\nZira was also originally going to be the mate of Scar so that their son had a claim to rule the Pride. However, this idea was scratched due to an incest theme that would happen with Kiara and Kovu, so they make Zira the most loyal supporter of Scar.\n\n====Nuka====\nNuka (voiced by [[Andy Dick]]) is the eldest child of Zira and the older brother to Vitani and Kovu. His name means \"stink\" in Swahili. Jealous of Zira's apparent favouritism for Kovu, Nuka often attempts to gain his mother's approval. During the Outsiders' ambush, Nuka attempts to kill Simba to prove himself to his mother, but is crushed to death by the falling logs, though he finally gained the attention he longed for from his mother. Zira mourned her son's death and blamed Kovu for the incident.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', Nuka assisted his mother in a plot to take over Jasiri's territory.\n\n====Vitani====\nVitani (voiced by [[Jennifer Lien]] as an adult; [[Lacey Chabert]] as Vitani when she is a cub, as well as both a cub and an adult in ''The Lion Guard''; Crysta Macalush for her cub form's singing voice) is the middle child and only daughter of Zira. Although she has a prominent appearance in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', she makes a cameo appearance in ''The Lion Guard''. As a young adult, Vitani is Zira's strongest lieutenant, supporting and acting on her mother's violent plans. With Kovu and Kiara's help, Vitani and the Outsiders turn on Zira and join the Pridelanders to stop the fighting between the two prides. After Zira's death, Vitani and the other Outsiders are pardoned by Simba and rejoin his pride.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', Vitani assisted her mother in a plot to take over Jasiri's territory. Years later after she and her pride joined Simba's pride while Kion and his friends journeyed to the Tree of Life, Vitani formed her own Lion Guard in their absence where it was also mentioned what happened to Zira. As the future king's older sister, she believes that it is her responsibility to protect the Pride Lands. She proves herself worthy to become leader of the Lion Guard after she bravely challenges Kion despite not having the Roar of the Elders. Kion then bestows her the position and power of the leader of the Lion Guard. This allows Vitani to use the Roar of the Elders, and she and her Lion Guard are officially recognized as the new Lion Guard of the Pride Lands.\n\nHer name is a Swahili portmanteau of the words \"Vita\" (\"War\"), \"Ni\" (\"I Am\"), and \"Shetani\" (\"She-Demon\"); the portmanteau can be roughly translated to \"I Am War\" or \"Demon of War\".{{fact|date=July 2019}} \"Shetani\" itself ''was'' originally her name in early drafts of ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', but this was softened to \"Vitani\".\n\n==Introduced in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' (2004)==\n\n===Ma===\nMa (voiced by [[Julie Kavner]]) is Timon's mother. Generally encouraging and optimistic, she believes in Timon and convinces Uncle Max to give him a job as a sentry or look-out. After Timon fails in his duty, she remains convinced that he can still find a place in the colony, but when he insists that he has to go, Ma supports him.\n\nLater, she gets worried about Timon after speaking to Rafiki and searches for him. They finally reunite at Pride Rock and Ma helps in the battle against the hyenas by digging a long tunnel to trap them. After Simba becomes king with the death of Scar, Timon takes them and the entire meerkat colony to the jungle paradise which he and Pumbaa discovered. Ma is mentioned several times in ''Timon & Pumbaa'' and in ''The Lion Guard'' episode \"Beware the Zimwi\" by Timon, who claims that her cousin's friend knew an ox that was eaten by the Zimwi.\n\n===Uncle Max===\nUncle Max (voiced by [[Jerry Stiller]]) is a prominent member of the meerkat colony and relative of Timon and Ma. He has grey head-fur and a very large nose. Max is a pessimist by nature and very paranoid, believing that a meerkat's fate is to be \"food for other animals! Feared by nothing and eaten by all!\" Max reluctantly agrees to let Timon be a sentry for the colony and attempts to train him for the job, but is nearly eaten by the hyenas when they attack. He is glad to see Timon go but ends up going with Ma to find him. Max appears again towards the end of the film, where he and Ma encounter Timon and Pumbaa at Pride Rock, and helps Timon get rid of the hyenas by digging a tunnel. Max finally believes in Timon, and after Timon takes the meerkats to his jungle paradise, Max teaches the meerkats [[T'ai chi ch'uan|tai chi]].\n\n==Introduced in ''The Lion Guard'' (2015\u20132019)==\n\n===Kion===\nKion (voiced by [[Max Charles]]<ref name=\"ew.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/11/lion-king-spinoff-voice-cast-rob-lowe-gabrielle-union|title=Lion King spinoff voice cast includes Rob Lowe, Gabrielle Union, James Earl Jones, and more - EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}</ref>) is the son of Simba and Nala. Sometime after Kiara's first encounter with Kovu, Kion is born as the second born son of Simba. In the series prequel and pilot ''The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar'', Simba has Kion organize the titular guard along with Bunga, Beshte, Fuli, and Ono. As leader of the Lion Guard and second-born to the throne, Kion is gifted with a power called the Roar of the Elders which causes the great lion spirits of the Pride Lands past to roar with him.\n\nKion is surprisingly mature for his young age, unlike his older sister or his parents when they were cubs. He is also kindhearted and has a strong sense of responsibility, and does not want to end up like his great-uncle Scar, who used the Roar for evil and thus lost it forever. He also demonstrates a strong yet open sense of discernment, which warms him to scavengers like Jasiri the hyena and her clan. However, more cunning neighbors such as Zira of the Outsiders and Reirei's jackal pack have used his trusting spirit to exert their will, only to be soundly subdued when Kion's instincts come into play. Sometimes, when he has doubts, he communicates with the spirit of his wise grandfather Mufasa, who gives him advice when he needs his help.\n\nBy the end of the episode ''The Rise of Scar'', Kion travels to the Outlands to save Kiara, and unknowingly summons Scar after he uses the Roar in anger when Janja threatens his family. Later in the season, Kion and the Lion Guard find out that Scar has returned while they are in the Outlands getting volcanic ash needed to cure Simba from a scorpion sting. Upon returning to the Pride Lands, Kion acknowledges to his team that they have a tough fight ahead, but remains confident that they will be able to defeat Scar. By the end of the season 3 premiere ''Battle for the Pride Lands'', Kion manages to defeat Scar once and for all by summoning the Lions of the Past to destroy him with rain. However, in the process, Ushari, the venomous snake follower of Scar, attacks Kion, giving him a scar over his left eye and poisoning him. Kion and the Lion Guard then journey to find the Tree of Life to heal him. On the way to the tree, Kion often acts rude and aggressive and loses control of his Roar due to the venom inside his body. Because of his scar, Kion stopped talking to Mufasa out of shame because his scar makes him look like Scar. \n\nOnce reaching the Tree of Life, Kion meets the protectors of the Tree of Life, the Night Pride, who guides him during his recovery process. While Kion is recovering, Kion becomes closer to and develops romantic feeling for Rani, the leader of the Night Pride, and later the queen of the Tree of Life. Only after being encouraged by her, he finally decides to talk to his grandfather again after several months and tells him he was afraid of facing him due to his scar and his concerns about turning evil like Scar, but Mufasa is understanding, telling Kion that he could have talked to him anytime and reminds him that he would always be there for him. After he is healed from the poison, Kion becomes unsure that he can lead the guard as he can't control the Roar, but then realized that he was already a great leader even without the Roar. This realization allows him to completely master the Roar under Askari's guidance. Kion and his friends returns to the Pride Lands after hearing Zira is planning to attack his pride, but finds the two prides have merged and Zira's daughter Vitani has formed her own Lion Guard in their absence. Kion decides to pass on the role of the Lion Guard and the Roar of the Elders to Vitani and her lionesses, ending his and his friends' Lion Guard. Kion and his friends then return to the Tree of Life where Kion marries Rani, making him the king of the Tree of Life and its protector together with his friends.\n\n===Bunga===\nBunga (voiced by [[Joshua Rush]]) is a [[honey badger]], Kion's childhood best friend and the bravest member of the Lion Guard. He is also the adoptive nephew of Timon and Pumbaa. Bunga is shown to be very adventurous and he rarely acts serious or even sits still, as he is always on the move, working off boundless energy and enthusiasm, and makes even the most dire of situations into a fantastic time. Though this makes him a great friend and playmate, it lands him into trouble more often than not. According to Kiara, Bunga is \"brave, bordering on stupid,\" but a valued member of the Lion Guard nonetheless.\n\n===Fuli===\nFuli (voiced by [[Diamond White (singer)|Diamond White]])<ref name=\"ew.com\"/> is a [[cheetah]], one of Kion's friends and the fastest member of the Lion Guard, as well as its first female member. She is quite prideful in her running abilities and shows extreme delight for being able to outpace a pursuer of any species. Despite being friends with Kion, she is somewhat resentful of the lions for lording over the Pride Lands, was skeptical about Kion's Roar of the Elders, and hates water. Despite these negative traits, she was willing to join the Lion Guard with her friends to defend the Circle of Life when Janja and his clan invaded the Pride Lands. She is also the first female animal to ever serve in the Guard as mentioned in the season 2 special ''The Rise of Scar''.

Being one of the most popular animals of the Pridelands, Beshte is shown to be kind-hearted. His friendliness extends to everyone, as he acts like a big brother to the younger members of his herd, a friend to animals of all different species, and a protector of the Pride Lands at large. Beshte can also, however, be sensitive, being especially tactful when his friend Kion is unable to use the Roar of the Elders. For an animal so large and full of life, Beshte has an appropriately large heart and never fails to treat his friends with kindness.  \n\n===Ono===\nOno (voiced by [[Atticus Shaffer]])<ref name=\"ew.com\"/> is a [[cattle egret]], one of Kion's friends and the keenest of sight of the Lion Guard, as well as its only non-mammal member. He is one of the more easygoing members of the group, being friendly and group-oriented. He is used to spending time around other animals and is content to be part of the Lion Guard. Ono is also shown to be blunt, as he is able to lay out his feelings without sugar-coating. He is by far the most realistic member of the group, as he always thinks things through before jumping in.\n\nWhen it comes to his role on the Lion Guard, Ono is brave and has a knack for following the rules. He obeys Kion's orders without question and proves himself to be plucky and thrifty, considerably useful when it comes to scouting out a situation. His principles are clear in his willingness to fight with his full heart for the Circle of Life, and he is a valued member of the Lion Guard for his intelligence and ability to see things from afar. \n\nDuring the final confrontation against Scar, Ono saved Bunga from falling into volcano, consequently sucking too much smog that resulted with near loss of his vision. He gave up his position as the keenest of sight to Anga, but still remain as a member of the Lion Guard after Kion bestowed him the new title of the smartest. He joins the guard to find the Tree of Life in hope of curing his eyes.

She is a serious and no-nonsense bird, giving her the impression that she's cold and unfriendly. In reality, she is kind and caring, and her cold exterior is just her way of being calm. Like most birds, she admires Hadithi to the point she hardly able to contain her excitement whenever he is involved, making it one of rare occasions Anga loses her composure.\n\nIn season 3, she becomes a member of the Lion Guard following Ono's injuries during the battle for the Pride Lands, taking up his position as the team's keenest of sight. Anga's catchphrase is \"Anga lenga\", which means \"Aim for the skies\" in Swahili.\n\n===Zuri===\nZuri (voiced by [[Madison Pettis]]) meaning \"beautiful\" in Swahili, is a lioness cub and one of Kiara's friends. She appears to be vain about her appearance, as she constantly sharpens her claws on trees in order to keep them shiny. Unlike her friends, Zuri is delicate and timid. She shows considerable anxiety and fear in the face of simple circumstances and harbors deep disgust for grubs.\n\n===Tiifu===\nTiifu (voiced by [[Sarah Hyland]] in season 1 and ''The Rise of Scar''; Bailey Gambertoglio in season 2) is a lioness cub, and a friend of Kiara's. She is shown to be kind and patient, as seen when she comforts an overreacting Zuri.

Although her trust with the Lion Guard was strained after learning that they have unknowingly been followed by Makucha, Chuluun, & Ora, she reconciled with Kion and the Guard after they've worked together to fight the three predators off. Following the death of her grandmother, Rani becomes Queen of the Tree of Life. At the end of the series, she marries Kion. Her name means Queen in Hindi.

They have never been called \"teenagers\" in any official show materials or interviews--->\nJanja's clan is a small pack of male [[spotted hyena]]s that live in the Outlands. They are descendants of the hyenas from [[The Lion King|the original film]]. They are known to be the arch-enemies of The Lion Guard and serve as henchmen to Scar's spirit. However, as of Season 3 they have betrayed Scar, joined the Pride Landers, and helped Kion defeat Scar once and for all. Afterwards, Janja merges his clan with Jasiri's as they work to keep the Outlanders in line.\n\n* '''Janja''' (voiced by [[Andrew Kishino]]) is the cunning and aggressive leader of the hyenas in the Outlands, descended from the hyenas from the original film and one of the main antagonists. In \"The Hyena Resistance\", Jasiri saves Janja from falling into a steam vent, and tells him that he and his clan are welcome to join her clan's hyena resistance to defeat Scar. After some hesitation, Janja dismisses her offer, but his hesitation causes Scar's skinks to question his loyalty and leaves Jasiri hopeful that he will come around eventually. In the Season 3 opener ''Battle for the Pride Lands'' Janja reforms, and after the destruction of Scar, and the death of his minion Ushari, Janja nominates Jasiri to be in charge of the Outlands, foreshadowing some peace, as well as unifying both clans.\n\n* '''Cheezi''' (voiced by Vargus Mason) is one of Janja's right-hand henchmen.

Janja appointed him and Tano to become Cheezi and Chungu's replacement when Janja blamed them for the failure in their plan. However, Nne and Tano eventually ditched Janja as they're proven to be smarter than him and deemed their leader to be too stupid to carry out their plan, which was later foiled by the Lion Guard.\n\n* '''Tano''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is a sloping, but devious, and smart hyena. Janja appointed him and Nne to become Cheezi and Chungu's replacement when Janja blamed them for the failure in their plan.

When Jasiri learns from Kion that Scar has returned, she and her clan form a hyena resistance to aid the Lion Guard and help defeat Scar. After the season 3 episode ''Battle for the Pride Lands'' Jasiri and Janja's clan have unified as one and rule the Outlands with Jasiri in charge as they work to keep the Outlanders in line.\n\n* '''Jasiri''' (voiced by [[Maia Mitchell]]) is a friendly female spotted hyena who makes her first appearance in the episode \"Never Judge a Hyena By Its Spots.\" Unlike most of her species, she is open to making friends with lions. Bold and spunky, Jasiri is able to look past differences and focus on where different species have common ground. Unlike Janja and his clan, she dislikes selfishness and gluttony, and she respects the Circle of Life. In \"The Hyena Resistance\" when Jasiri learns from Kion that Scar has returned, she and her clan form a resistance to aid the Lion Guard and help defeat Scar. In Season 3, Jasiri accepts Janja and his clan as members of her cackle, and after the defeat and destruction of Scar, Jasiri becomes the leader of the Outlands.  \n\n* '''Madoa''' (voiced by Maisie Klompus) is a spotted hyena who is Jasiri's sister and is part of her clan.\n\n* '''Tunu''' (voiced by Crimson Hart) is a spotted hyena cub and brother of Wema who is part of Jasiri's clan.\n\n* '''Wema''' (voiced by Fiona Hart) is a spotted hyena cub and sister of Tunu who is part of Jasiri's clan.\n\n===Makini===\nMakini (voiced by [[Landry Bender]]) is a young mandrill who is Rafiki's new apprentice. She is free-spirited and loves to learn and look up to her mentor. However, she has trouble being calm and she is easy to deceive, which was the cause of Scar's resurrection. Despite this, Makini takes pride in herself and her position, and is friendly and welcoming to everyone she meets. She joins the Lion Guard on their journey to the Tree of Life, though she unintentionally reveals the Tree of Life's existence to Makucha.\n\n===Vitani's Lion Guard===\nVitani's Lion Guard are a group of lionesses who take the role of the Lion Guard during Kion & his Lion Guard's absence, due to their journey to the Tree of Life. Led by Kovu's sister Vitani who is the Fiercest member of her guard, her Lion Guard is the first Lion Guard to be led by a female lion, have all female members, and be led by the elder sibling instead of the younger (due to Kovu being the future king, despite being younger than Vitani, though Vitani is still a second born child). Once Kion and his Lion Guard returned, they and Vitani mistaken each other for enemies (with the former having received warning that Zira's pride is attacking the Pride Lands, unaware that the war was already over). However, after Kiara and Kovu stopped the fight, Kion and his allies are told what have happened, and Vitani realizes that it was Kion she was fighting, not recognizing him due to his scar. Although the initial battle was resolved, Vitani's guard and Kion's guard share a rivalry at first, but eventually become friends as time progressed.\n\nBesides Vitani, the rest of her Lion Guard consists of:\n\n* '''Shabaha''' (voiced by Fiona Riley) is the Bravest member of Vitani's Lion Guard, known for her level of insanity. Janja comments that her fighting style is similar to Bunga (much to the latter's liking); but whereas Bunga's bravery leaves him dimwitted, Shabaha's makes her slightly unhinged: she often laughs maniacally in the midst of a challenge. Her catchphrase is \"Bila hofu!\", which is Swahili for \"Without fear!\"\n\n* '''Kasi''' (voiced by Savannah Smith) is the Fastest member of Vitani's Lion Guard, noted to have Fuli's level of serenity. Though without the advantage of Fuli's cheetah speed, Kasi has more constant stamina (as she is a lion) and agility (in part due to her thin build). Her catchphrase is \"Haraka, haraka!\", which is Swahili for \"Hurry, hurry!\"\n\n* '''Imara''' (voiced by [[Rachel Crow]]) is the Strongest member of Vitani's Lion Guard, given her tenacity. With a stocky build, she proves nearly as strong as Beshte, as seen when she is able to slightly push back Beshte during their first encounter and when they are competing by pushing elephant-topped rocks. Her catchphrase is \"Misuli!\" (pronounced as \"Musuli!\"), which is Swahili for \"Muscles!\"\n\n* '''Tazama''' (voiced by [[Sophie Reynolds]]) is the Keenest of Sight in Vitani's Lion Guard, as well as a supportive team player. While not able to fly like Anga or Ono, Tazama is capable of seeing in darkness (something Anga and Ono cannot do) and has some level of Ono's tact (using his rules in the challenges against Anga). Her catchphrase is \"Hiyo kali!\", which is Swahili for \"That's terrific!\"\n\n===Reirei's pack===\nReirei's pack is a family of [[black-backed jackal]]s who first appeared in the episode \"The Kupatana Celebration\". They trick the Lion Guard into letting them into the Pride Lands so that they can devour all the animals. At Kupatana, the jackals attack the Pridelanders until they are defeated by the Lion Guard. Simba himself approaches the jackal pack and roars, sending them scurrying back into the Outlands. Reirei and Goigoi reappear in the episode \"Too Many Termites\", where they attempt to eat a pack of aardwolves, but are stopped by the Lion Guard. In Season 2, they become members of Scar's army. Following Scar's defeat, Reirei's pack had to accept Jasiri as the Outlands' leader.\n\n* '''Reirei''' (voiced by [[Ana Gasteyer]]) is a clever, scheming, and manipulative jackal who is the matriarch of her family pack.\n\n* '''Goigoi''' (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) is Reirei's mate who only thinks with his stomach and has the tendency to fall asleep.\n\n* '''Dogo''' (voiced by Jacob Guenther) is one of Reirei and Goigoi's sons who uses his innocent looks to his advantage to win the trust of others in order to take advantage of them. After Reirei and her pack joined Scar's army, Dogo and his siblings, including his sister Kijana, would not be seen again for a long time until the Season 3 opener ''Battle for the Pride Lands''.\n\n* '''Dogo's Siblings''' (voiced by Jacob Guenther and [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) are Reirei and Goigoi's sons and brothers of Dogo.

In ''The Rise of Scar'', Ushari finally gets fed up with the Lion Guard disturbing his peace and inadvertently finds out that Kion talks to Mufasa's spirit. With this knowledge he decides to join forces with Janja's clan and ends up helping them orchestrate the events that allow them to summon Scar's spirit so that he can guide them in defeating the Lion Guard. At the end of the Season 3 opener ''Battle for the Pride Lands'', Scar plots with Ushari to kill the Guard once and for all, as well as Janja, (after overhearing his hesitation on which sides to join). However, the plot fails, Janja betrays Scar, and a battle in the Outlands ensues. In a confrontation between Kion and Scar, Ushari attacks Kion, and gives him a scar on his left eye, similar to his great uncle's. Despite this, Kion manages to defeat and destroy Scar once and for all by summoning the Great Kings of the Past, who vanquish Scar with rainwater. Ushari, in disbelief and anger, makes one last attempt on Kion's life, but is thwarted by Bunga, and falls to his death in the lava below.\n\n===Aardvarks===\nThe following [[aardvark]]s appear in ''The Lion Guard'':\n\n* '''Muhangus''' (voiced by [[Khary Payton]]) is an aardvark and the leader of his shoal.\n\n* '''Muhanga''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]) is an aardvark who is Muhangus' mate.\n\n===Aardwolves===\nThe following [[Aardwolf|aardwolves]] appear in ''The Lion Guard'':\n\n* '''Mjomba''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) is a grumpy and impatient aardwolf who is the leader of the pack.

She also tends to add afterthoughts after she states her opinion on a subject.\n\n* '''Haya''' (voiced by [[Ogie Banks]]) is a nervous and shy aardwolf. He has dark gray fur with longer fur on his cheeks and black markings, and his inner ears are pink with a few hairs sprouting from them. His upper teeth protrude from his dark muzzle.

Upon defeat, Pua leaves the float.\n\n* '''Makuu''' (voiced by [[Blair Underwood]]) is a young, sleek, and well-built Nile crocodile who leads the crocodile float that lives in the Pride Lands after defeating the previous leader Pua in battle. He is shown to be boastful and loves to bask in the attention of others. Unlike his predecessor, Makuu initially has no respect for tradition or the Circle of Life, and certainly not for authority (except his own), seeing both Pua and Kion as weak and cowardly. He appears to only respond to strength and power, as he was awestruck by the Roar of the Elders and gave into Kion's second demand to leave Big Springs while trying to save face. In Season 2, Makuu has decided to become a better leader for his float, reforming from his trouble-making ways.\n\n* '''Kiburi''' (voiced by [[Common (rapper)|Common]]) is a former member of Makuu's float. Much like a less experienced Makuu, he saw no reason why the crocodiles should have regard for the other animals of the Pride Lands. After the crocodiles were accidentally awakened from dry season [[aestivation]] by the Lion Guard, Kiburi led most of the float in an effort to seize bodies of water. He later challenged Makuu to a mashindano, having made an alliance with Ushari and a plan to eliminate Simba. Upon being defeated, he and his three supporters were expelled from the Pride Lands, and became a part of Scar's growing collective in the Outlands. In some later episodes of Season 2 & the Season 3 opener, more crocodiles have been known to be part of Kiburi's float in the Outlands.

Much like her father, she is always game for a laugh. Even when Simba makes a mistake at her father's funeral, she is gracious and kind, and makes light of the situation by dwelling on the good. She is similarly gracious to Nala and Kiara when they are the only members of their family to attend the elephant concert.

Even in the face of adversity, such as Makuu's violent takeover of Big Springs, Basi maintains his temper and graciously offers the crocodile a chance to return once the fish have returned in plenty. Being so learned in the ways of the animals, Basi is knowledgeable and wise. Despite being an animal with a very different way of life, he understands the customs of the crocodiles and how this affects his pod's everyday life.

He debuts in the story ''A Tale of Two Brothers'', which served as a prequel to ''[[The Lion King]]''. The books were released before the film's production had finished, and thus, Alex Simmons (Kopa's creator) did not know that Simba and Nala would be given a cub at the end of the film.\n\nIn the 1995 commentary tract based on the film, Roger Allens and Rob Minkoff describe the cub at the end of the first film as \"Fluffy\"; therefore scrapping Kopa, and as a result, he is non-canon to the films.

His grandparents were killed during an attack by ants. He is the leader of the cape buffalo and he is aggressive, controlling, selfish, strong, and short-tempered. He is also somewhat reclusive and gruff, as he doesn't seem to understand that there is a balance between species and refuses to share the last remaining water-hole during a drought, which can affect the whole of the Pride Lands. It is due to him that Taka got his scar after which he renamed himself to Scar. If challenged or insulted he becomes very angry. However, he is mildly co-operative if not insulted or challenged. Taka tries to get Mufasa in trouble by telling him to talk with Boma to share the water-hole. Mufasa tries to reason with him to share the water-hole however he refuses. Scar then roars and tells him that he must obey or challenge Mufasa. He then chases after Mufasa who is rescued by Rafiki. Rafiki starts to grow tired while running but is picked up by Mufasa who then jumps across a ravine. Boma is unable to make the jumps and falls into it.

Flirtatious and gossipy, Zuzu is a very maternal bird who never passes up the chance for some juicy gossip, much like her son, Zazu. Her talkative nature and nosy habits often make her a bit of an annoyance to the other animals; however, Ahadi puts her personality to good use in order to get a better grip on the doings of his kingdom. Zuzu is also known for being loyal and brave, as she was willing to help Rafiki even though she did not fully understand the danger Mufasa was in. It is revealed that she retired and gave Zazu her place as the king's majordomo.\n\n===King Joe===\nKing Joe is a comic book character in The Lion King book \"A False Ancestor\" as he is a rogue stranger who lurks in the Pride Lands. He tricked Simba by saying that he was the great-great-great-grandfather of the current king, which is Mufasa. He later saves Simba from a river from nearly getting eaten by an alligator.

Bottom right: [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]] and Sarafina.]]\nThis page lists the characters appearing in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] ''[[The Lion King (franchise)|The Lion King]]'' franchise.\n\n==Introduced in ''The Lion King'' (1994)==\n===Simba===\n{{main|Simba}}\n\n[[Simba]] (voiced by [[Matthew Broderick]] as adult Simba in the films, [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] as a cub in ''[[The Lion King]]'', Matt Weinberg as a cub in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'', [[Cam Clarke]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa'', [[Rob Lowe]] in ''The Lion Guard'', [[Donald Glover]] in the 2019 film, [[JD McCrary]] as a cub in the 2019 film) is the son of Mufasa and Sarabi, Scar's nephew, Nala's mate, and Kiara and Kion's father. After defeating Scar, Simba takes Mufasa's place as King of Pride Rock before marrying Nala and having Kiara and Kion with her. His name means \"lion\" in Swahili which is his species.\n\nIn ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', Simba is an overprotective parent of Kiara, and obtains a great hatred of the Outsiders, a group of lions whom he exiled due to their loyalty to Scar, specifically Scar's protege Kovu, before learning to let go of his hate, and accepting Kovu as his son in law.\n\nIn ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', Simba fathers Kion, and initially refuses to accept Kion's decision to allow non-lion animals into the Lion Guard, but later accepts his proposal. Currently in the show, after a failed attempt on Simba's life, orchestrated by the spirit of Scar, Simba and Kion plot to defeat him once again and for all. As of Season 3, Scar's ghost has been defeated and his followers have become neutral under the rule of Jasiri, who becomes the new Outlands' leader. However, due to a facial wound caused by a snake bite during the battle, Kion journeys to find the Tree of Life, to get healed. Simba bids his son farewell on his trip. He later welcomes Kion home following his journey and accepts his love to Rani of the Night Pride.\n\n===Nala===\n{{main|Nala (The Lion King)}}\n\n[[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]] (voiced by [[Moira Kelly]] in the films, Niketa Calame as a cub in ''[[The Lion King]]'', [[Gabrielle Union]] in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', [[Beyonc\u00e9]] in the 2019 film, and [[Shahadi Wright Joseph]] as a cub in the 2019 film) is the daughter of Sarafina, the best friend and later mate of Simba; she is also Kiara and Kion's mother. Although she is a prominent character in ''The Lion King'', she makes minor appearances in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'', and ''The Lion Guard''.\n\nIn ''[[The Lion King]]'', she is portrayed as Simba's childhood friend. Her name means \"gift\" in Swahili. After helping Simba enter the elephant graveyard, she has to be rescued by Mufasa when the hyenas attack them. Several years later, Nala encounters Simba as a young adult and develops a romance with him. After returning to Pride Rock, she helps Simba defeat Scar and take his rightful place as King of Pride Rock. In ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', Nala is depicted as slightly older, calmer, and less overprotective of Kiara than her mate, Simba.\n\n===Timon and Pumbaa===\n{{main|Timon and Pumbaa}}\n\nTimon (voiced by [[Nathan Lane]] in the films and the TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'', [[Quinton Flynn]] in earlier episodes of the TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaaa]]'', [[Kevin Schon]] in both later episodes of the TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'' and ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', Bruce Lanoil in the video games, [[Billy Eichner]] in [[The Lion King (2019 film)|the 2019 film]]) and Pumbaa (voiced by [[Ernie Sabella]] in the films, TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'', and ''The Lion Guard'', Leslie Hedger in ''Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure'', [[Seth Rogen]] in the 2019 film) are a [[meerkat]] and [[common warthog]] duo; Timon being a wise-cracking, yet loyal friend, while Pumbaa is gluttonous, yet brave.\n\nWhen they first meet Simba in ''[[The Lion King]]'', they save an unconscious Simba from a flock of vultures. They take him in and bring him to their home in an oasis. Later, after Simba grows up and returns to the Pride Lands to battle Scar, they help Simba stop Scar's tyrannical reign and the two become Simba's royal advisors.\n\nAlthough they are supporting characters in the first two films, they are featured as the main characters in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' as well as in the TV series ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]''.\n\nAs revealed in the TV series ''The Lion Guard'', they are the adoptive uncles of the honey badger Bunga and make their home at Hakuna Matata Falls.\n\nIn the live-action film, Timon and Pumbaa had different animals as their neighbors in the oasis like a flock of [[guineafowl]] (one of them is voiced by [[Amy Sedaris]]), a [[galago]] (voiced by [[Chance the Rapper]]), an [[elephant shrew]] (voiced by [[Josh McCrary]]), a [[topi]] (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) that has an awkward conversation with Simba, a [[bat-eared fox]], an [[aardvark]], a [[greater kudu]], some [[dik-dik]]s, and some [[Thomson's gazelle]]s.\n\n===Scar===\n{{main|Scar (The Lion King)}}\n\nScar (voiced by [[Jeremy Irons]] in ''The Lion King'', [[Jim Cummings]] in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and ''The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure'', James Horan in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', ''Disney's Extreme Skate Adventure'', and ''Sorcerers Of The Magic Kingdom'', [[David Oyelowo]] in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] in the 2019 film) is the main antagonist of ''The Lion King'' franchise. He is a black-maned lion who is Simba's paternal uncle and Mufasa's younger brother. His name means \"kovu\" in Swahili, similar to his adoptive son. In ''The Lion King'', by murdering Mufasa and exiling Simba, he becomes \"King of the Pride Lands\". However, years later, Simba returns to Pride Rock and overthrows Scar to become King of the Pride Lands. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas.\n\nIn ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' it is revealed that Scar's protege were exiled from Pride Rock by Simba in the wake of Scar's death, with Scar's most loyal follower, Zira, being the leader. Scar is mentioned several times by the characters, but makes two cameos. His first appearance is during Simba's nightmare, where he morphs into Kovu, and throws him into the stampede that killed Mufasa, in a similar manner to the first film. His second appearance is during Kovu's exile in which Kovu looks into his reflection and instead of his, he sees the image of his adoptive father. At the end of the film, Kovu marries Kiara, Simba's daughter and Scar's great niece, and becomes Simba's son-in-law and successor, so thus Scar's goal of Kovu becoming King would eventually come through following Simba's death or abdication to the throne, but not by avenging his death by murdering Simba.\n\n''The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar'' reveals that Scar was once the leader of the titular group and once possessed the Roar of the Elders. Scar lost the Roar after using it to destroy the other members of his Lion Guard, as the Roar is meant to be used for good and not evil. In season 2 of ''The Lion Guard'', Kion unknowingly summons Scar back as a fiery spirit in a volcano after using the Roar in anger when Janja the hyena provokes him. Scar then conspires with the animals in the Outlands to take over the Pride Lands and defeat the new Lion Guard and Simba, who were initially unaware that Scar had returned. Later in the season, Kion and the guard find out that Scar has returned, while they are in the Outlands getting volcanic ash needed to cure Simba from a scorpion sting. In the season 3 premiere ''Battle for the Pride Lands'', Scar continues to battle the Lion Guard, who are now adolescents. At the end of ''Battle for the Pride Lands'', Kion summons the Great Kings of the Past to rain upon Scar, thus destroying him once and for all.\n\nIn the live-action film, Scar told Zazu to get help to rescue Simba while he goes to help him. This was a cover-up so that Scar can kill Mufasa. When Mufasa is dead and Simba has fled, Scar takes over as the ruler of the Pride Lands while allowing the hyenas to work with the lions. This led to overhunting. When Sarabi refuses to become Scar's mate, Scar makes things worse by having the hyenas eat first and they don't leave much behind. By the second advancement, Scar struck down Sarabi when she mentioned Mufasa. Like the films, Scar fought Simba and tried to blame Mufasa's death on the hyenas. When Scar is thrown off of Pride Rock, he survived the fall and was confronted by the hyenas. Scar states to them that if they build an army, they'll retake the Pride Lands. Azizi and Kamari state that they heard the insult towards them. Scar claims that he was trying to fool Simba. Shenzi states to Scar that he was right about a hyena's belly never being full. Scar strikes at some of the attacking hyenas until they swarm over him and kill him.\n\n===Mufasa===\nMufasa (voiced by [[James Earl Jones]] in the films and [[Gary Anthony Williams]] in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'') is Scar's older brother, Sarabi's mate, Simba's father and Kiara and Kion's paternal grandfather who is introduced as the King of the Pride Lands. The name \"Mufasa\" has an unknown origin, previously attributed to a fictional language called Manazoto. Mufasa is depicted as a just, wise, and responsible leader, a gentle but firm father, and strong and fierce protector when sufficiently provoked. In ''The Lion King'', he teaches Simba on what a king is supposed to be, and how the king is responsible for protecting and maintaining the delicate balance of the ecosystem, and mediate problems between its creatures. However, Mufasa later dies after being thrown into a wildebeest stampede by Scar while rescuing Simba. He returns years later as a spirit in the clouds to encourage an older Simba return to the Pride Lands and reclaim his rightful throne.\n\nIn ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', he instructs Rafiki to bring Kiara, Simba's daughter, and Kovu, Scar's heir, together to reunite the two lion prides.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', Mufasa serves as a spirit guide to his grandson Kion when he needs advice, and sometimes appears on his own when he notices he is troubled by something. When Kion is a teenager, Kion fights against Scar's spirit and his army, winning, but gets bit by Ushari, who gave him a scar on his eye. As a result, during the journey to the Tree of Life, the adolescent lion stops communicating with his grandfather due to issues with his scar and personal concerns about turning evil like Scar, and Mufasa became worried that he forgot about him, just like Simba did years ago when he became adult. When they finally talk again, Mufasa reassures Kion that he would always be here for him no matter what, showing that regardless of his grandson's scar, he still loves him dearly. Alongside Askari and the previous queen of the Tree of Life, Janna, he proudly watches over Kion after his marriage with Rani.  Jones reprised his role in the pilot episode, but the character was voiced by Gary Anthony Williams in subsequent appearances.\n\n''Lion King'' Directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff have described Jones' voice as powerful and similar to the roar of a lion.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nJones reprises his role in the 2019 remake of the film directed by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Aaron|last=Couch|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lion-king-live-action-movie-casts-donald-glover-as-simba-977488|title='Lion King' Remake Casts Donald Glover as Simba, James Earl Jones as Mufasa|magazine=[[Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}</ref> According to Favreau, Jones' lines remain mostly the same from the original film.<ref name=\"youtube1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftRPVHyELXo&t=19s|title=What To Expect From The Characters In The Upcoming 'The Lion King' Adaptation - Entertainment Weekly|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]/[[YouTube]]|language=en|date=April 25, 2019|accessdate=April 29, 2019|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/26/the-lion-king-james-earl-jones-mufasa/|title=The Lion King director recalls James Earl Jones' 'powerful' return as Mufasa|first=Marc|last=Snetiker|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 26, 2019|accessdate=May 2, 2019}}</ref> [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], who plays [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] in the film, said that \"the comfort of [Jones reprising his role] is going to be very rewarding in taking [the audience] on this journey again.

Her name means \"[[mirage]]\" in Swahili. In ''[[The Lion King]]'', she serves as the Queen of Pride Rock. Years after Scar usurps the throne, Sarabi helps Simba fight against Scar and his hyenas. When Simba defeats Scar, Nala becomes Queen and Sarabi becomes the Queen Dowager.\n\nIn the live action film following Mufasa's death, Scar tries to get Sarabi to be his mate; however, she turns down his advances.\n\n===Sarafina===\nSarafina (voiced by Zoe Leader in ''[[The Lion King]]'' and [[Penny Johnson Jerald]] [[The Lion King (2019 film)|in the 2019 film]]) is a lioness who is Nala's mother. She is first seen sleeping inside Pride Rock with Nala and the rest of the pride. She later cleans Nala before the latter leaves to go to the Elephant Graveyard with Simba. She makes her final appearance mourning the loss of Mufasa and Simba, unaware that Simba is still alive.\n\nIn the live action film, Sarafina's role is still the same. When the hyenas arrived at Pride Rock following Mufasa's death, Sarafina told Nala to stay close to her.\n\n===Zazu===\nZazu is a [[red-billed hornbill]]<ref name=hornbill>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Wednesdays: Zazu's 'Cousin' - Abyssinian Ground Hornbill Chick - a New Addition at Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2011/08/wildlife-wednesdays-zazus-cousin%E2%80%94abyssinian-ground-hornbill-chick-a-new-addition-at-disneys-animal-kingdom-lodge|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> and [[majordomo]] to Mufasa and later Simba. (He is voiced by [[Rowan Atkinson]] in ''The Lion King''; [[Jim Piddock]] in ''Timon and Pumbaa's Jungle Games'' and ''The Lion King Simba's Mighty Adventure''; [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa''; [[Edward Hibbert]] in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and ''The Lion King 1\u00bd''; [[Jeff Bennett]] in ''The Lion Guard''; and [[John Oliver]] in the 2019 film). After Mufasa's death, Zazu becomes a prisoner of Scar before Pumbaa breaks the bone cage releasing him when Simba returns to the Pride Lands. He eventually acts as a scout and advises Simba on royal protocol.\n\nIn ''Timon & Pumbaa'', it is revealed that Zazu is not only a lion king's majordomo, he is a jungle administrator. In the episode \"Zazu's Off-By-One Day\", he is shown to be responsible for counting the population of the animals.\n\nIn the musical, Zazu is a puppet controlled by an actor dressed in blue striped clothes and a bowler hat, much like a stereotypical butler. Zazu's blue feathers have been replaced with white and the puppet is partially constructed from parachute silk with a slinky contained in the neck for ease in movement.<ref name=puppets>{{cite web|title=What's behind those wild 'Lion King' masks?|url=http://www.adn.com/2009/09/04/924245/whats-behind-those-wild-lion-king.html|work=www.adn.com|publisher=Anchorage Daily News|accessdate=22 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414141239/http://www.adn.com/2009/09/04/924245/whats-behind-those-wild-lion-king.html|archive-date=14 April 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlso appearing in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|2019 remake]] of ''The Lion King'', Zazu plays the same role as in the original version, but this time, he is introduced to Timon and Pumbaa and helps out in the battle by pecking Kamari numerous times.\n\n===Rafiki===\nRafiki (voiced by [[Robert Guillaume]] in the animated films and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa]]''; [[Khary Payton]] in ''[[The Lion Guard]]''; and [[John Kani]] in the 2019 film), whose name means \"friend\" in Swahili, is a [[mandrill]] with an unnaturally long tail. He lives in a [[baobab]] tree in the Pride Lands and performs [[Shamanism|shamanistic]] services for the lions of Pride Rock. He's also shown to be a great martial artist.\n\nIn ''The Lion King'', Rafiki is introduced in the opening scene when he travels to Pride Rock to perform newborn Simba's presentation ceremony. During the film, Rafiki sings a nonsense chant: \"Asante sana, squash banana, wewe nugu, mimi hapana.\" This is a Swahili playground rhyme which translates to \"Thank you very much (squash banana), you're a baboon and I'm not!\" Like \"hakuna matata\" (no worries), the chant was heard by the filmmakers on their research trip to Kenya. Rafiki travels to the jungle where Simba lives with Timon and Pumbaa, and teaches him lessons about learning from the past: \"Yes, the past can hurt but, the way I see it you can either run from  it, or learn from it\" and then whacks him with his stick. During the battle for Pride Rock, Rafiki saves Simba from Banzai by whacking him with his stick, while fighting many more hyenas. At the end of the film, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub.\n\nIn ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', Rafiki is more closely involved with the affairs and politics of the pride and is often seen with the lions. Mufasa's spirit persuades him to bring Simba's daughter Kiara and Zira's son Kovu together as a way of uniting the Outsiders with the pride. Rafiki tries to make them fall in love by singing to them about a place called \"Upendi\", which means \"love\" in Swahili. In the end, he blesses the union of Kovu and Kiara, and Kovu is welcomed into the pride. Rafiki appears briefly in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'', teaching Timon the philosophy of \"[[Hakuna Matata]]\", talking to Timon's mother about her son, and later convincing Timon to follow Simba to Pride Rock to confront Scar.\n\nIn the musical, the character of Rafiki was significantly modified. Because director [[Julie Taymor]] felt that the story lacked a strong female character, Rafiki was changed into a female mandrill and [[sangoma]]. She acts as narrator throughout the story, at one point speaking to the audience in a [[Click language#Languages with clicks|click language]] for comic effect. She sings the opening song \"[[Circle of Life]]\", a [[keening]] song called \"Rafiki Mourns\" following Mufasa's death, and a brief part in Nala's song \"Shadowland\", when she blesses Nala for her journey to find help. Instead of detecting Simba's scent on dust, Rafiki hears Simba's song \"Endless Night\" on the wind. Rafiki finds Simba and shows him that his father lives on in him through the song \"[[He Lives in You]]\". She is present during the battle, fighting a hyena, and adorns Simba with the king's mantle after his victory; the play ends with her at the presentation of Simba and Nala's newborn cub.\n\nRafiki serves as a supporting character in the ''Timon and Pumbaa'' TV series, as well as a main character of said series as he has his own segments called \"Rafiki Fables\", where his shamanism is expanded. In the episode \"Good Mousekeeping\", it is revealed that Rafiki can grant wishes and can even take some of the wishes back. In another episode \"Rafiki's Apprentice\", Rafiki's stick is revealed to have magical powers. He explains to his nephew Nefu (voiced by [[Tahj Mowry]]) that the gourds on his stick are powerful for his magic. \n\nRafiki serves as a recurring character in ''[[The Lion Guard]]''.\n\n===Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed===\nShenzi (voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] in the animated films; [[Tress MacNeille]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa'' and ''Kingdom Hearts II''; Jennifer Lewis in ''Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom''; and [[Florence Kasumba]] in the 2019 film), Banzai (voiced by [[Cheech Marin]] in the animated films, ''Kingdom Hearts II'', and ''Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom''; and [[Rob Paulsen]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa'') and Ed (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) are the three [[spotted hyena]]s who make up Scar's henchmen that reside in the Elephant Graveyard. After Scar promises them and the rest of their fellow hyenas that they will have food in return for them helping him get rid of his brother Mufasa and nephew Simba in order to become King of the Pride Lands, the three hyenas trigger the [[wildebeest]] [[stampede]] which kills Mufasa and then chase Simba out of the Pride Lands on Scar's orders. When Simba returns to Pride Rock, Shenzi and Banzai are defeated by Pumbaa. The three turn on Scar when the latter tries to blame them for Mufasa's death and the ruin of the Pride Lands, and lead the rest of the hyenas into eating him alive during a wildfire, where they are engulfed by the surrounding flames.\n\nShenzi, Banzai, and Ed serve as main characters and [[Antihero|antiheroes]] in ''Timon & Pumbaa.'' They are given their own segments titled \"The Laughing Hyenas\" where they wander around the Serengeti looking for food. At the end of the episode \"TV Dinner\", the hyenas replace television host Martin Pardon, which may indicate that they are living a new life as directors and stars of the wildlife documentary show ''Kingdom of the Creatures'', where they get fed during their new career. In later seasons, they made minor appearances trying to attack Timon and Pumbaa.\n\nIn ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', it was only mentioned by Nuka that the hyenas have left the Elephant Graveyard. However, in the original draft of ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed were going to return as Zira's henchmen, with Cheech Marin reprising his role as Banzai from the original film despite presumably Whoopi Goldberg and Jim Cummings were supposed to come back as Shenzi and Ed. Yet they were cut, presumably due to Scar's death being at the hands of the hyena trio.\n\nIn ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'', Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed act as the local predators who attack Timon's meerkat colony before their allegiance with Scar.\n\nShenzi (voiced by [[Florence Kasumba]]) appears in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|CGI remake]] complete with a different personality. She is portrayed as ruthless and cunning matriarch with no-nonsense attitude and air of authority. She is also shown to have a rivalry with Nala. Ed was renamed Azizi (now voiced by [[Eric Andre]]), and Banzai was renamed Kamari (voiced by [[Keegan-Michael Key]]). Nevertheless, these two play largely similar roles to the original film, except Azizi (Ed) is able to talk. Like the film, Shenzi, Azizi, and Kamari heard the insult that Scar used on them. When Scar is defeated and the hyena pack confronts him, Scar states that they can retake the Pride Lands if they build an army. Azizi annd Kamari state that they heard the insult he used on them. Scar claims that he was trying to fool Simba. Shenzi quotes \"You're right about one thing Scar, a hyena's belly is never full.\" The hyenas attack as Scar strikes at some of them before the hyenas swarm over Scar and kill him.\n\nIn the original draft of the film, the hyenas were [[African wild dog]]s, referred to as \"Cape dogs\" in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://concept.lionking.org/characters/capedogs.shtml|title=The Lion King Concept Art Archive|website=concept.lionking.org|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> Their species may have been changed to illustrate the strong rivalry and competition between lions and hyenas in real life, the competition being much stronger than between lions and other predators.\n\n===Gopher===\nGopher (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) is a [[gopher]] who works for Zazu as an informant. In the film, he is seen warning Zazu that the hyenas have invaded the Pride Lands.\n\nGopher appeared in two segments starring Zazu in ''Timon & Pumbaa''.\n\n==Introduced in ''Timon & Pumbaa'' (1995-1999)==\n\n===Quint===\nQuint (voiced by [[Corey Burton]]) is a human who is Timon and Pumbaa's archenemy. He is a sneaky, muscular man with black hair, a pink nose, and a shaven face; he has varying roles. His wears different clothes in each episode because of the different jobs he has, but he is often seen wearing a hat. He also has different first names that show what his jobs are (in which they all happen to start with C).\n\nQuint is a con artist who tricks Timon into stealing a gold nugget Pumbaa found in the episode \"Yukon Con\", a criminal who stole a suitcase that has $1,290,000 in the episode \"How to Beat the High Costa Rica\", an evil clock inspector who wants to get revenge on a timekeeper in the episode \"Swiss Missed\", a French chef who wants to make Speedy the Snail an escargot in the episode \"French Fried\", etc. In the episode \"The Pain in Spain\", two Quints are seen together which may prove that there is more than one of him.\n\nIn some episodes, Quint appears to be a respectable man with an honest job, but he still seems to annoy Timon and Pumbaa. Notably in Season 2, Quint's face appears to be clean-shaven except in the episode \"Klondike Con\" when he becomes a gold thief. Also in the episode \"Escape From Newark\", his nose is the same color as his body for the first time.\n\n===Speedy the Snail===\nSpeedy (voiced by [[Corey Burton]] impersonating [[Bing Crosby]]) is a talking grayish/bluish snail with a shiny red shell and a yellow fedora. Timon and Pumbaa plan to eat him at first, but his ability to speak and sing and his bon viveur, good-humored attitude gets him to become friends with them. Timon gives him the name \"Speedy\", because he thinks that it would be a brilliant incongruity. Speedy always finds himself in danger, such as becoming a French gourmet snail and an earring out of his shell, and it's always up for Timon and Pumbaa to save him.\n\nIn the episode \"The Man from J.U.N.G.L.E.\", Speedy is revealed to be a superhero called Super Duper Hero X after Timon and Pumbaa were captured by his nemesis Chromosome Quint. Every episode featuring Speedy end with Timon and Pumbaa saying bye to Speedy when they return him home, a seagull capturing Speedy, and then Timon and Pumbaa trying to save him once again. Speedy also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the episode \"Washington Applesauce\".\n\n===Fred===\nFred (voiced by [[S. Scott Bullock]]) is a meerkat who is Timon's other best friend back at the meerkat colony. He is a practical joker, employing such gags as the hand buzzer, the squirting flower, and the whoopee cushion. He also loved Timon's hyena jokes. When Fred visits Timon and Pumbaa, he pulls more practical jokes on the duo, such as impersonating Timon's mother or impersonating a Billy Goat guard. Timon and Pumbaa, however, don't find Fred's jokes very funny and they often overpower him. Aside from pulling practical jokes, Fred enjoys doing all sorts of activities, such as playing Turtle Tennis and Fishing for Flamingos. He also mentions that he and Timon have always gone Bowling for Buzzards.\n\nAt the meerkat colony, Fred's duty was to guard the Duke Meerkat's castle, although on the day the Duke left the colony, he snuck away to get a snack and convinced Timon that it was now his chance to go on a date with Princess Tatiana. When the Duke banished Timon from the colony after a cobra kidnapped the princess, Fred's new duty was to guard the back gate, which indicates that he has been demoted for failing to protect the castle.\n\nFred appears in a total of four episodes: \"Tanzania Zany\", \"Mombasa-In-Law\", \"Once Upon a Timon\", and \"Mind Over Matterhorn\".\n\n===Boss Beaver===\nBoss Beaver (voiced by [[Brad Garrett]]) is an ill-tempered and cantankerous [[beaver]] with a white hard hat. His lifestyle is the exact opposite of Timon and Pumbaa's Hakuna Matata lifestyle: Boss Beaver likes to work while Timon and Pumbaa like to relax. He owns a lumber mill and an amusement park called \"Boss Beaver's Log Land\". Boss Beaver also has three mottos: \"Makuta Hamaka\", which means \"work real hard\", \"safety first\" and \"you break it, you buy it.\"\n\nBoss Beaver's favorite quote is \"I am Boss Beaver and the reason they call me Boss Beaver is that I am your boss and I am a beaver. Therefore, I am Boss Beaver.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Amusement Bark\", it is revealed that he has a mischievous son named Boy Beaver, who keeps breaking things at his amusement park and getting Timon blamed for it.\n\nBoss Beaver appears in a total of three episodes.\n\nHe also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the episode \"Washington Applesauce.\"\n\n===Irwin===\nIrwin (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) is a clumsy, accident-prone penguin with a green scarf and a brown hat. Timon and Pumbaa befriend him at a boat stop in Antarctica when they see that he has two extra tickets for the duo to get on the ship. When Irwin leaves his home with the duo, it is shown that he has obviously injured all of his penguin \"friends\", as they are all seen wearing bandages. Timon dislikes Irwin's clumsiness, and tries to get rid of him by tricking him into playing a game of Hide-and-Seek. Irwin accidentally causes the boat to sink and Timon and Pumbaa run into him on an island. Timon confronts the penguin and he tricks him into playing another game and Irwin accidentally causes the island to sink.\n\nIrwin meets Timon and Pumbaa again at a Hakuna Matata Megamall. Due to his clumsiness, Timon and Pumbaa try to avoid him by hiding in various stores. Irwin appears in two episodes of the TV series, \"Frantic Atlantic\" and \"Shopping Mauled\".\n\n===Toucan Dan===\nToucan Dan (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is a dangerously clever criminal mastermind lying toucan who wears a red [[fez]]. He is a convincing liar and impersonator and would also do anything to get someone in trouble. In his debut episode \"I Don't Bolivia\", he keeps tricking Timon into freeing him from his cage. Later in the episode, while Timon impersonates Toucan Dan in order to not be in trouble with the police, Toucan Dan impersonates Timon and this makes Pumbaa have to decide which one is the real Timon.\n\nToucan Dan makes his second and final appearance in the episode \"Alcatraz Mataz\". In that episode, he frames Timon and Pumbaa for stealing a train car full of beak polish and the police throw them in jail. Angry at Toucan Dan, Timon and Pumbaa escape to catch the toucan and make him tell the truth.\n\n===Rabbit===\nRabbit (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) is a large and tall pink hare who appears to be very annoying, tiring. He made his debut in the episode \"Mojave Desserted\". In that episode, Timon and Pumbaa save his life when he was drowning in [[quicksand]] and he decides to repay the duo hand and foot. Annoyed by Rabbit, Timon and Pumbaa hatch a plan to put themselves in danger and have Rabbit save them and then leave them alone.\n\nRabbit makes his second and final appearance in the episode \"Africa-Dabra!,\" this time appearing as an unsympathetic and ruthless magician. After Timon pulls him out of a hat, he teams up with the meerkat to become part of his magic act, telling him that he has been looking for a partner for years. When he gets annoyed by Pumbaa ruining the magic acts, he breaks up Timon and Pumbaa's friendship. When Pumbaa finds out that Timon never truly said anything mean about him, he gets revenge on Rabbit by trapping him in a cage and later skinning him for his disguise.\n\n===Vulture Police===\nThe Vulture Police (voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]] and [[Brian Cummings]]) are recurring characters.\n\nThey make their first appearance in the episode \"The Law of the Jungle,\" where they arrest Timon for using the Forbidden Stick to scratch his back and take him to Judge Rhino, who gives a number of tests to see whether he's innocent or guilty.\n\nIn the episode \"Yosemite Remedy,\" Timon and Pumbaa go to the police after a criminal raccoon steals their suitcase full of valuables. When they handcuff the thief, he tells them that he didn't steal Timon and Pumbaa's suitcase, he found it. The police let him go, but later arrest him again when they find out that he really stole the duo's suitcase while catching him in the act.\n\nIn the episode \"Alcatraz Mataz\", the Vulture Police throw Timon and Pumbaa in jail after they were convinced by Toucan Dan that they stole the train car full of beak polish. After Timon and Pumbaa confront Toucan Dan, the police show up and realize that it was really Toucan Dan who stole the train car, so they arrest the toucan. However, they also throw Timon and Pumbaa back in jail since they escaped when they told them not to no matter if they were framed or not.\n\nThe Vulture Police make a brief appearance in the episode \"Wide Awake in Wonderland\".\n\n===Cheetata and Cheetato===\nCheetata (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) and Cheetato (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) are a pair of sophisticated twin [[cheetah]]s, reminiscent of Warner Bros' [[Goofy Gophers]], speaking in British accents and using similar phrases (\"Indubitably,\" \"How very kind of you\"). In order to tell them apart, not only do they have different voices, they also have different personalities: Cheetata appears to be more eager and aggressive while Cheetato seems more likely to think things through.\n\nThe cheetahs first appear in the episode \"Cooked Goose\", where they are annoyed by Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed getting in the way of their wildebeest hunt, so they try sending them on various wild goose chases. They also appear in \"Gabon with the Wind,\" where they are convinced by Timon that he is going to catch Pumbaa for them, when he is actually going to find his friend so that they can both run away to safety.\n\nIn the episode \"Boary Glory Days\", Timon and Pumbaa use Cheetata and Cheetato to play a game of Predator Tag. While the cheetahs are chasing Timon and Pumbaa, the duo outsmarts the brothers by having them jump over a mud pool and fall into it.\n\n===The Three Natives===\nThe Three Natives (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) are a trio of tribes who are really university students taking part in the \"Be a Native\" weekends. They have a leader (also voiced by Jeff Bennett) who is also a university student and who usually precedes what he says with \"Bungala, bungala.\" The natives first appear in \"Boara Boara\". This episode shows that they used to have a warthog king of the island, which is unknown what might've happened to him. Therefore, the natives might have not seen their king in a really long time. When Timon and Pumbaa visit the island, the natives mistake Pumbaa for their long-lost king and they make Timon his servant. Everything goes well until they make Pumbaa relight the fire and realize that he's an impostor when they see that he is unable to do so. After Timon and Pumbaa escape, the three natives shed their disguises upon getting tired of being hit by the leader's staff and return to the university. The leader orders them to return or else they'll lose their deposit.\n\nThe natives also appear in the episode \"New Guinea Pig,\" where Pumbaa decides to trade his tusks to them. After they fail to get the tusks, the three natives shed their disguises and return to the university.\n\nIn \"Beast of Eden\", the three natives are shown with their leader again where they steal a golden magic tooth that belongs to a beast and Timon and Pumbaa have to retrieve it from them.\n\nThey also make a brief appearance in the episode \"Mozam-Beaked\" when Timon and Pumbaa go to Bora Bora to throw a woodpecker into the volcano.\n\n===Mr. Bear===\nMr. Bear (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]) is a grumpy, short-tempered, but nice grizzly bear, although he gets easily angered, such as when he is awoken from his nap or when someone gets his food order wrong. He also has a romantic interest in a beautiful supermodel named Leslie Lambeau (voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]). He appears in seven episodes, from \"Slalom Problem\" to \"It Runs Good\". In the episode \"Jailhouse Shock,\" Mr. Bear becomes cell mates with Little Jimmy, who gets even with Timon and Pumbaa by taking advantage of him by convincing him that the duo hurt him so that he could beat them up. Mr. Bear starts to show compassion for Timon and Pumbaa in the episodes \"Ready, Aim, Fire\" and \"Stay Away from my Honey!\" In the former, he operated as Smolder the Bear (a parody of [[Smokey Bear]]) who dislikes fires and saves Timon and Pumbaa from being cooked on Quint's fire.\n\n===Tatiana===\nTatiana (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) is the daughter of the Duke Meerkat and the princess of the meerkat colony. She only appears in one episode but she's vital for Timon's past. After Timon leaves his sentry duty post to prepare for his date with Tatiana, a king cobra enters the colony and kidnaps the princess, which makes everyone believe she's dead and which causes Timon to get banished. After Timon and Pumbaa meet for the first time, they see that Tatiana is still alive and rescue her from a cobra. When Tatiana returns to the colony with Timon and Pumbaa, Timon is offered her hand in marriage. When the Duke makes him choose between Tatiana or Pumbaa, he chooses to be Bestest Best friends with Pumbaa as they leave the Meerkat colony. Although \"Once Upon a Timon\" was meant to be Tatiana's only appearance, there is a female meerkat who bears a striking resemblance to her in the episode \"Timon in Love\". The only difference is that Tatiana has blond hair while the other meerkat has red hair, and she's not wearing a tiara.\n\n===Sharla===\nSharla (voiced by [[Billy West]]) is a female warthog who is the leader of Pumbaa's former sounder as well as Pumbaa's former girlfriend. While she only appears in one episode, she is vital for Pumbaa's past. She and three other male warthogs of the sounder banished Pumbaa from the group due to his awful scent, which was appalling even by warthog standards.\n\nYears later, Sharla and the three warthogs carry around a big bag of bugs for the rainy season, but come across a flock of Guinea fowl, who are their natural enemies and nightmares. Due to the birds' abilities to remove their furs in just a few seconds, the warthogs refuge in a hut and make a distress call, which Pumbaa answers. When Pumbaa reunites with his sounder, he has Timon come up with ideas on how they can get rid of the Guinea fowl. However, none of Timon's ideas work, so Pumbaa suggests that he and Timon use the jeep so that they carry a fake bag of bugs (which have firecrackers inside) to distract the Guinea fowl while Sharla and the other warthogs leave the hut with the real bag of bugs.\n\nAlthough Sharla banished Pumbaa from the group, they still have romantic feelings for each other. When Pumbaa arrives at the hut, they tell each other that they have never forgotten one another. Sharla tells Pumbaa that he should stay with the group, but Pumbaa decides to continue living his Hakuna Matata lifestyle with Timon, which the female warthog understands.\n\n===Ned the Elephant===\nNed (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is a high and mighty African bush elephant who thinks he's wonderful at everything. He seems to enjoy teasing Timon and Pumbaa when they fail at proving their worth to him. In the episode \"Uganda be an Elephant\", Timon states that Ned is the most popular guy in the jungle and Pumbaa decides to turn himself into an elephant in order to be popular as well. Although Ned is selfish and sarcastic, he gets a change of heart after Pumbaa rescues him and his hippo henchmen from falling off a cliff.\n\nIn the episode \"Unlucky in Lesotho\", it is revealed that Ned has a Good Luck Club, which lost most of its members due to Ned bringing an unlucky jar into the club. Because he gets attacked by piranha upon falling into the river after a [[black panther]] cub crosses his path, Ned is never seen or heard from again after this episode, implying that he was devoured by the piranha.\n\n===Little Jimmy===\nLittle Jimmy (voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]]) is a cute, yet dangerous bluebird. He is similar to Toucan Dan, with the fact that he is also a criminal mastermind and he can also be dishonest. He also has two voices: his fake cute, innocent voice to pass himself off as a hatchling and his criminal voice to show that he is truly an adult. Little Jimmy first appears in the episode \"Nest Best Thing,\" where he tricks Pumbaa into building a birdhouse for him, which is actually a hideout. The pigeon police show up and arrest Little Jimmy.\n\nIn the episode \"Jailhouse Shock,\" Little Jimmy is cell mates with Mr. Bear. In order to get revenge on Timon and Pumbaa for turning him in, he tricks Mr. Bear into thinking that Timon and Pumbaa hurt him so that he could hurt them back.\n\n==Introduced in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' (1998)==\n\n===Kiara===\nKiara (voiced by [[Neve Campbell]] as an adult; [[Michelle Horn]] as Kiara when she is a cub in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride''; and [[Eden Riegel]] in ''The Lion Guard'') is the daughter of [[Simba]] and [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]], and Kion's older sister. She has a cameo appearance in ''The Lion King'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} and is a major character in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and ''The Lion Guard''. Kiara is also a granddaughter of Mufasa and Sarabi, who are Simba's parents.\n\nKiara is portrayed as a feisty, playful, and adventurous princess whom her over-protective father Simba easily fears for her safety. As a cub, Kiara befriends Kovu when playing at the Outlands where they work together to escape a group of crocodiles. Unfortunately, their friendship is cut short as they are separated by their respective parents. As a young adult, Kiara is rescued by Kovu as part of Zira's plan to avenge Scar's death, but the two lions eventually fall in love. When Kovu is exiled from the Pride Lands following Zira's ambush on Simba, Kiara helps him return to the Pride Lands to stop the war and reunite the Pridelanders and Outsiders. Afterwards, she becomes Kovu's wife.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'' Kiara is seen being trained by her parents to be Queen and has a subtle sibling rivalry with Kion. Years later, she is engaged to Kovu where she assists him in explaining to Kion on what happened while he was away and what happened to Zira. Simba names her and Kovu as his successor as the ruler of the Pride Lands.\n\n===Kovu===\nKovu (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]] as an adult, as well as both a cub and an adult in ''The Lion Guard''; [[Ryan O'Donohue]] as Kovu when he is a cub) is the youngest child of Zira, the brother of Nuka and Vitani, and Scar's chosen heir. His name means \"scar\" in Swahili, similar to his adoptive father Scar. In his childhood, Kovu befriends Kiara, though this didn't last long as they are separated by their feuding parents. However, Kovu's newfound friendship with Kiara gives Zira the idea to use their friendship so that Kovu will have the opportunity to kill Simba. Since then, Zira trains Kovu to assassinate Simba and take his place as the king of Pride Rock. As young adult, Kovu rescues Kiara during a planned ambush and Simba reluctantly allows him to stay in the Pride Lands. While spending time with Kiara, Kovu begins to fall in love with her and thus, unable to bring himself to hurt Simba. However, after Simba is ambushed by the Outsiders and Nuka is killed, Simba mistakenly assumes Kovu to be behind the ambush and exiles him from the Pride Lands. While wandering around after being exiled, Kovu reunited with Kiara and she persuades him to unite both lion factions. Together with Kiara, they stops the war between two factions and convinced everyone except Zira to reconcile. Having proved himself, Simba pardons Kovu and allows him to become his eventual successor.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', Kovu appears with his family in their plot to take over Jasiri's territory. Kion learns from Kovu that Kiara knows him. Years later, Kion and the Lion Guard learn that Kovu and the rest of the Outsiders have rejoined Simba's pride following Zira's death. Simba names Kovu and Kiara as his successor as the ruler of the Pride Lands.\n\nKovu was originally going to be Scar's real son instead of adoptive, however this would make him and Kiara \"second cousins\" so Disney made him Scar's adoptive son.\n\n===Outsiders===\nThe Outsiders are a pride of offshoot lions that were loyal to Scar. After a failed takeover following Scar's death, Simba banished them to the Outlands. In ''[[The Lion Guard]]'', they tried to invade the territory that Jasiri's clan lives in. Kion was hesitant to use the Roar of the Elders because of what it did to Scar. After being told by the rest of the Lion Guard that Scar used the Roar for evil, Kion defeated the Outsiders with the Roar of the Elders which sent them flying to the Outlands' termite mound area which became their base of operations.\n\n====Zira====\nZira (voiced by [[Suzanne Pleshette]] in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and [[Nika Futterman]] in ''The Lion Guard''), meaning \"hate\" in Swahili, is the mother of Nuka, Kovu, and Vitani. She is Scar's most loyal follower, and plots to avenge Scar's death by forming the Outsiders. She takes advantage of Kovu's friendship with Simba's daughter Kiara, as part of her plan to assassinate Simba. When this plan failed due to Kovu's love for Kiara, Zira resorts to all-out war against Simba's pride. However, with Kiara and Kovu's help, Vitani and the other Outsiders decide to join Simba's pride and turn against Zira who persists in her revenge. Attempting to attack Simba, Zira is intercepted by Kiara and falls into a flash flood to her death, despite Kiara's failed attempt to rescue her.\n\nZira makes an appearance in ''[[The Lion Guard]]'' alongside Kovu, Nuka, Vitani, and the rest of her pride in the episode \"Lions of the Outlands\". She tries to convince Kion that using the Roar of the Elders against her and the other Outsiders would cause him to lose it just as Scar did, and to side with his fellow lions. However, Kion is eventually able to see through her deceptions and drives her and the others off with the Roar. Years later, her death was mentioned by Kiara and Kovu when the Lion Guard returned and met Vitani's incarnation of the Lion Guard.\n\nZira was also originally going to be the mate of Scar so that their son had a claim to rule the Pride. However, this idea was scratched due to an incest theme that would happen with Kiara and Kovu, so they make Zira the most loyal supporter of Scar.\n\n====Nuka====\nNuka (voiced by [[Andy Dick]]) is the eldest child of Zira and the older brother to Vitani and Kovu. His name means \"stink\" in Swahili. Jealous of Zira's apparent favouritism for Kovu, Nuka often attempts to gain his mother's approval. During the Outsiders' ambush, Nuka attempts to kill Simba to prove himself to his mother, but is crushed to death by the falling logs, though he finally gained the attention he longed for from his mother. Zira mourned her son's death and blamed Kovu for the incident.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', Nuka assisted his mother in a plot to take over Jasiri's territory.\n\n====Vitani====\nVitani (voiced by [[Jennifer Lien]] as an adult; [[Lacey Chabert]] as Vitani when she is a cub, as well as both a cub and an adult in ''The Lion Guard''; Crysta Macalush for her cub form's singing voice) is the middle child and only daughter of Zira. Although she has a prominent appearance in ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', she makes a cameo appearance in ''The Lion Guard''. As a young adult, Vitani is Zira's strongest lieutenant, supporting and acting on her mother's violent plans. With Kovu and Kiara's help, Vitani and the Outsiders turn on Zira and join the Pridelanders to stop the fighting between the two prides. After Zira's death, Vitani and the other Outsiders are pardoned by Simba and rejoin his pride.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', Vitani assisted her mother in a plot to take over Jasiri's territory. Years later after she and her pride joined Simba's pride while Kion and his friends journeyed to the Tree of Life, Vitani formed her own Lion Guard in their absence where it was also mentioned what happened to Zira. As the future king's older sister, she believes that it is her responsibility to protect the Pride Lands. She proves herself worthy to become leader of the Lion Guard after she bravely challenges Kion despite not having the Roar of the Elders. Kion then bestows her the position and power of the leader of the Lion Guard. This allows Vitani to use the Roar of the Elders, and she and her Lion Guard are officially recognized as the new Lion Guard of the Pride Lands.\n\nHer name is a Swahili portmanteau of the words \"Vita\" (\"War\"), \"Ni\" (\"I Am\"), and \"Shetani\" (\"She-Demon\"); the portmanteau can be roughly translated to \"I Am War\" or \"Demon of War\".{{fact|date=July 2019}} \"Shetani\" itself ''was'' originally her name in early drafts of ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', but this was softened to \"Vitani\".\n\n==Introduced in ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' (2004)==\n\n===Ma===\nMa (voiced by [[Julie Kavner]]) is Timon's mother. Generally encouraging and optimistic, she believes in Timon and convinces Uncle Max to give him a job as a sentry or look-out. After Timon fails in his duty, she remains convinced that he can still find a place in the colony, but when he insists that he has to go, Ma supports him.\n\nLater, she gets worried about Timon after speaking to Rafiki and searches for him. They finally reunite at Pride Rock and Ma helps in the battle against the hyenas by digging a long tunnel to trap them. After Simba becomes king with the death of Scar, Timon takes them and the entire meerkat colony to the jungle paradise which he and Pumbaa discovered. Ma is mentioned several times in ''Timon & Pumbaa'' and in ''The Lion Guard'' episode \"Beware the Zimwi\" by Timon, who claims that her cousin's friend knew an ox that was eaten by the Zimwi.\n\n===Uncle Max===\nUncle Max (voiced by [[Jerry Stiller]]) is a prominent member of the meerkat colony and relative of Timon and Ma. He has grey head-fur and a very large nose. Max is a pessimist by nature and very paranoid, believing that a meerkat's fate is to be \"food for other animals! Feared by nothing and eaten by all!\" Max reluctantly agrees to let Timon be a sentry for the colony and attempts to train him for the job, but is nearly eaten by the hyenas when they attack. He is glad to see Timon go but ends up going with Ma to find him. Max appears again towards the end of the film, where he and Ma encounter Timon and Pumbaa at Pride Rock, and helps Timon get rid of the hyenas by digging a tunnel. Max finally believes in Timon, and after Timon takes the meerkats to his jungle paradise, Max teaches the meerkats [[T'ai chi ch'uan|tai chi]].\n\n==Introduced in ''The Lion Guard'' (2015\u20132019)==\n\n===Kion===\nKion (voiced by [[Max Charles]]<ref name=\"ew.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/11/lion-king-spinoff-voice-cast-rob-lowe-gabrielle-union|title=Lion King spinoff voice cast includes Rob Lowe, Gabrielle Union, James Earl Jones, and more - EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}</ref>) is the son of Simba and Nala. Sometime after Kiara's first encounter with Kovu, Kion is born as the second born son of Simba. In the series prequel and pilot ''The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar'', Simba has Kion organize the titular guard along with Bunga, Beshte, Fuli, and Ono. As leader of the Lion Guard and second-born to the throne, Kion is gifted with a power called the Roar of the Elders which causes the great lion spirits of the Pride Lands past to roar with him.\n\nKion is surprisingly mature for his young age, unlike his older sister or his parents when they were cubs. He is also kindhearted and has a strong sense of responsibility, and does not want to end up like his great-uncle Scar, who used the Roar for evil and thus lost it forever. He also demonstrates a strong yet open sense of discernment, which warms him to scavengers like Jasiri the hyena and her clan. However, more cunning neighbors such as Zira of the Outsiders and Reirei's jackal pack have used his trusting spirit to exert their will, only to be soundly subdued when Kion's instincts come into play. Sometimes, when he has doubts, he communicates with the spirit of his wise grandfather Mufasa, who gives him advice when he needs his help.\n\nBy the end of the episode ''The Rise of Scar'', Kion travels to the Outlands to save Kiara, and unknowingly summons Scar after he uses the Roar in anger when Janja threatens his family. Later in the season, Kion and the Lion Guard find out that Scar has returned while they are in the Outlands getting volcanic ash needed to cure Simba from a scorpion sting. Upon returning to the Pride Lands, Kion acknowledges to his team that they have a tough fight ahead, but remains confident that they will be able to defeat Scar. By the end of the season 3 premiere ''Battle for the Pride Lands'', Kion manages to defeat Scar once and for all by summoning the Lions of the Past to destroy him with rain. However, in the process, Ushari, the venomous snake follower of Scar, attacks Kion, giving him a scar over his left eye and poisoning him. Kion and the Lion Guard then journey to find the Tree of Life to heal him. On the way to the tree, Kion often acts rude and aggressive and loses control of his Roar due to the venom inside his body. Because of his scar, Kion stopped talking to Mufasa out of shame because his scar makes him look like Scar. \n\nOnce reaching the Tree of Life, Kion meets the protectors of the Tree of Life, the Night Pride, who guides him during his recovery process. While Kion is recovering, Kion becomes closer to and develops romantic feeling for Rani, the leader of the Night Pride, and later the queen of the Tree of Life. Only after being encouraged by her, he finally decides to talk to his grandfather again after several months and tells him he was afraid of facing him due to his scar and his concerns about turning evil like Scar, but Mufasa is understanding, telling Kion that he could have talked to him anytime and reminds him that he would always be there for him. After he is healed from the poison, Kion becomes unsure that he can lead the guard as he can't control the Roar, but then realized that he was already a great leader even without the Roar. This realization allows him to completely master the Roar under Askari's guidance. Kion and his friends returns to the Pride Lands after hearing Zira is planning to attack his pride, but finds the two prides have merged and Zira's daughter Vitani has formed her own Lion Guard in their absence. Kion decides to pass on the role of the Lion Guard and the Roar of the Elders to Vitani and her lionesses, ending his and his friends' Lion Guard. Kion and his friends then return to the Tree of Life where Kion marries Rani, making him the king of the Tree of Life and its protector together with his friends.\n\n===Bunga===\nBunga (voiced by [[Joshua Rush]]) is a [[honey badger]], Kion's childhood best friend and the bravest member of the Lion Guard. He is also the adoptive nephew of Timon and Pumbaa. Bunga is shown to be very adventurous and he rarely acts serious or even sits still, as he is always on the move, working off boundless energy and enthusiasm, and makes even the most dire of situations into a fantastic time. Though this makes him a great friend and playmate, it lands him into trouble more often than not. According to Kiara, Bunga is \"brave, bordering on stupid,\" but a valued member of the Lion Guard nonetheless.\n\n===Fuli===\nFuli (voiced by [[Diamond White (singer)|Diamond White]])<ref name=\"ew.com\"/> is a [[cheetah]], one of Kion's friends and the fastest member of the Lion Guard, as well as its first female member. She is quite prideful in her running abilities and shows extreme delight for being able to outpace a pursuer of any species. Despite being friends with Kion, she is somewhat resentful of the lions for lording over the Pride Lands, was skeptical about Kion's Roar of the Elders, and hates water. Despite these negative traits, she was willing to join the Lion Guard with her friends to defend the Circle of Life when Janja and his clan invaded the Pride Lands. She is also the first female animal to ever serve in the Guard as mentioned in the season 2 special ''The Rise of Scar''. In season 3, Fuli occasionally takes command of the Guard from Kion when his scar affects his rational thinking. \n\n===Beshte===\nBeshte (voiced by Dusan Brown)<ref name=\"ew.com\"/> is a [[hippopotamus]], one of Kion's friends and the strongest member of the Lion Guard. Being one of the most popular animals of the Pridelands, Beshte is shown to be kind-hearted. His friendliness extends to everyone, as he acts like a big brother to the younger members of his herd, a friend to animals of all different species, and a protector of the Pride Lands at large. Beshte can also, however, be sensitive, being especially tactful when his friend Kion is unable to use the Roar of the Elders. For an animal so large and full of life, Beshte has an appropriately large heart and never fails to treat his friends with kindness.  \n\n===Ono===\nOno (voiced by [[Atticus Shaffer]])<ref name=\"ew.com\"/> is a [[cattle egret]], one of Kion's friends and the keenest of sight of the Lion Guard, as well as its only non-mammal member. He is one of the more easygoing members of the group, being friendly and group-oriented. He is used to spending time around other animals and is content to be part of the Lion Guard. Ono is also shown to be blunt, as he is able to lay out his feelings without sugar-coating. He is by far the most realistic member of the group, as he always thinks things through before jumping in.\n\nWhen it comes to his role on the Lion Guard, Ono is brave and has a knack for following the rules. He obeys Kion's orders without question and proves himself to be plucky and thrifty, considerably useful when it comes to scouting out a situation. His principles are clear in his willingness to fight with his full heart for the Circle of Life, and he is a valued member of the Lion Guard for his intelligence and ability to see things from afar. \n\nDuring the final confrontation against Scar, Ono saved Bunga from falling into volcano, consequently sucking too much smog that resulted with near loss of his vision. He gave up his position as the keenest of sight to Anga, but still remain as a member of the Lion Guard after Kion bestowed him the new title of the smartest. He joins the guard to find the Tree of Life in hope of curing his eyes.

She is a serious and no-nonsense bird, giving her the impression that she's cold and unfriendly. In reality, she is kind and caring, and her cold exterior is just her way of being calm. Like most birds, she admires Hadithi to the point she hardly able to contain her excitement whenever he is involved, making it one of rare occasions Anga loses her composure.\n\nIn season 3, she becomes a member of the Lion Guard following Ono's injuries during the battle for the Pride Lands, taking up his position as the team's keenest of sight.

She is shown to be kind and patient, as seen when she comforts an overreacting Zuri.

She joins the Lion Guard on their journey to the Tree of Life, though she unintentionally reveals the Tree of Life's existence to Makucha.\n\n===Vitani's Lion Guard===\nVitani's Lion Guard are a group of lionesses who take the role of the Lion Guard during Kion & his Lion Guard's absence, due to their journey to the Tree of Life. Led by Kovu's sister Vitani who is the Fiercest member of her guard, her Lion Guard is the first Lion Guard to be led by a female lion, have all female members, and be led by the elder sibling instead of the younger (due to Kovu being the future king, despite being younger than Vitani, though Vitani is still a second born child). Once Kion and his Lion Guard returned, they and Vitani mistaken each other for enemies (with the former having received warning that Zira's pride is attacking the Pride Lands, unaware that the war was already over). However, after Kiara and Kovu stopped the fight, Kion and his allies are told what have happened, and Vitani realizes that it was Kion she was fighting, not recognizing him due to his scar. Although the initial battle was resolved, Vitani's guard and Kion's guard share a rivalry at first, but eventually become friends as time progressed.\n\nBesides Vitani, the rest of her Lion Guard consists of:\n\n* '''Shabaha''' (voiced by Fiona Riley) is the Bravest member of Vitani's Lion Guard, known for her level of insanity. Janja comments that her fighting style is similar to Bunga (much to the latter's liking); but whereas Bunga's bravery leaves him dimwitted, Shabaha's makes her slightly unhinged: she often laughs maniacally in the midst of a challenge. Her catchphrase is \"Bila hofu!\", which is Swahili for \"Without fear!\"\n\n* '''Kasi''' (voiced by Savannah Smith) is the Fastest member of Vitani's Lion Guard, noted to have Fuli's level of serenity. Though without the advantage of Fuli's cheetah speed, Kasi has more constant stamina (as she is a lion) and agility (in part due to her thin build). Her catchphrase is \"Haraka, haraka!\", which is Swahili for \"Hurry, hurry!\"\n\n* '''Imara''' (voiced by [[Rachel Crow]]) is the Strongest member of Vitani's Lion Guard, given her tenacity. With a stocky build, she proves nearly as strong as Beshte, as seen when she is able to slightly push back Beshte during their first encounter and when they are competing by pushing elephant-topped rocks. Her catchphrase is \"Misuli!\" (pronounced as \"Musuli!\"), which is Swahili for \"Muscles!\"\n\n* '''Tazama''' (voiced by [[Sophie Reynolds]]) is the Keenest of Sight in Vitani's Lion Guard, as well as a supportive team player. While not able to fly like Anga or Ono, Tazama is capable of seeing in darkness (something Anga and Ono cannot do) and has some level of Ono's tact (using his rules in the challenges against Anga). Her catchphrase is \"Hiyo kali!\", which is Swahili for \"That's terrific!\"\n\n===Reirei's pack===\nReirei's pack is a family of [[black-backed jackal]]s who first appeared in the episode \"The Kupatana Celebration\". They trick the Lion Guard into letting them into the Pride Lands so that they can devour all the animals. At Kupatana, the jackals attack the Pridelanders until they are defeated by the Lion Guard. Simba himself approaches the jackal pack and roars, sending them scurrying back into the Outlands. Reirei and Goigoi reappear in the episode \"Too Many Termites\", where they attempt to eat a pack of aardwolves, but are stopped by the Lion Guard. In Season 2, they become members of Scar's army. Following Scar's defeat, Reirei's pack had to accept Jasiri as the Outlands' leader.\n\n* '''Reirei''' (voiced by [[Ana Gasteyer]]) is a clever, scheming, and manipulative jackal who is the matriarch of her family pack.\n\n* '''Goigoi''' (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) is Reirei's mate who only thinks with his stomach and has the tendency to fall asleep.\n\n* '''Dogo''' (voiced by Jacob Guenther) is one of Reirei and Goigoi's sons who uses his innocent looks to his advantage to win the trust of others in order to take advantage of them. After Reirei and her pack joined Scar's army, Dogo and his siblings, including his sister Kijana, would not be seen again for a long time until the Season 3 opener ''Battle for the Pride Lands''.\n\n* '''Dogo's Siblings''' (voiced by Jacob Guenther and [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) are Reirei and Goigoi's sons and brothers of Dogo. After Reirei & her pack joined Scar's army, Dogo's siblings, along with Dogo himself & Kijana, would not be seen again for a long time until the Season 3 opener ''Battle for the Pride Lands''.\n\n* '''Kijana''' (voiced by [[Amber Hood]]) is Reirei and Goigoi's daughter. She had only made one major appearance in the Lion Guard, in the episode ''Babysitter Bunga''. Like Dogo & his siblings, Kijana would not be seen again for a long time after Reirei and her pack joined Scar's army, but she eventually made appearance in the Season 3 opener ''Battle for the Pride Lands''.\n\n===Shupavu's Group===\nShupavu's group are a group of [[skink]]s who are friends with Ushari and serve as his spies in the Pride Lands.

She dislikes being close to Pride Rock.\n\n* '''Njano''' (voiced by [[Ford Riley]]) is a crafty, blue-tongued skink who is Shupavu's second-in-command.\n\n* '''Nyeusi''' (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is a stealthy black skink who is a member of the group.\n\n* '''Waza''' is an observant blue skink who is a member of the group.\n\n* '''Nyata''' is a swift purple skink who is a member of the group.\n\n===Ushari===\nUshari (voiced by [[Christian Slater]]) is an [[Egyptian cobra]] who often conflicted with Bunga and would get disturbed whenever the Lion Guard was near him. In ''The Rise of Scar'', Ushari finally gets fed up with the Lion Guard disturbing his peace and inadvertently finds out that Kion talks to Mufasa's spirit. With this knowledge he decides to join forces with Janja's clan and ends up helping them orchestrate the events that allow them to summon Scar's spirit so that he can guide them in defeating the Lion Guard. At the end of the Season 3 opener ''Battle for the Pride Lands'', Scar plots with Ushari to kill the Guard once and for all, as well as Janja, (after overhearing his hesitation on which sides to join). However, the plot fails, Janja betrays Scar, and a battle in the Outlands ensues. In a confrontation between Kion and Scar, Ushari attacks Kion, and gives him a scar on his left eye, similar to his great uncle's. Despite this, Kion manages to defeat and destroy Scar once and for all by summoning the Great Kings of the Past, who vanquish Scar with rainwater. Ushari, in disbelief and anger, makes one last attempt on Kion's life, but is thwarted by Bunga, and falls to his death in the lava below.\n\n===Aardvarks===\nThe following [[aardvark]]s appear in ''The Lion Guard'':\n\n* '''Muhangus''' (voiced by [[Khary Payton]]) is an aardvark and the leader of his shoal.\n\n* '''Muhanga''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]) is an aardvark who is Muhangus' mate.\n\n===Aardwolves===\nThe following [[Aardwolf|aardwolves]] appear in ''The Lion Guard'':\n\n* '''Mjomba''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) is a grumpy and impatient aardwolf who is the leader of the pack.

His name in Swahili means \"uncle.\"\n\n* '''Ogopa''' (voiced by [[Marieve Herington]]) is a bright and cheerful aardwolf. She has blue-gray fur and black markings, as well as a narrow muzzle and a black nose. Her yellow eyes are large and framed by a few eyelashes, and her inner ears are pink with a couple of hairs sprouting from each. Like the rest of the pack, she adores termites. She is easily frightened and has a tendency to jump to conclusions. She also tends to add afterthoughts after she states her opinion on a subject.\n\n* '''Haya''' (voiced by [[Ogie Banks]]) is a nervous and shy aardwolf. He has dark gray fur with longer fur on his cheeks and black markings, and his inner ears are pink with a few hairs sprouting from them. His upper teeth protrude from his dark muzzle. Like the rest of the pack, he adores termites.

Upon defeat, Pua leaves the float.\n\n* '''Makuu''' (voiced by [[Blair Underwood]]) is a young, sleek, and well-built Nile crocodile who leads the crocodile float that lives in the Pride Lands after defeating the previous leader Pua in battle. He is shown to be boastful and loves to bask in the attention of others. Unlike his predecessor, Makuu initially has no respect for tradition or the Circle of Life, and certainly not for authority (except his own), seeing both Pua and Kion as weak and cowardly. He appears to only respond to strength and power, as he was awestruck by the Roar of the Elders and gave into Kion's second demand to leave Big Springs while trying to save face. In Season 2, Makuu has decided to become a better leader for his float, reforming from his trouble-making ways.\n\n* '''Kiburi''' (voiced by [[Common (rapper)|Common]]) is a former member of Makuu's float. Much like a less experienced Makuu, he saw no reason why the crocodiles should have regard for the other animals of the Pride Lands. After the crocodiles were accidentally awakened from dry season [[aestivation]] by the Lion Guard, Kiburi led most of the float in an effort to seize bodies of water. He later challenged Makuu to a mashindano, having made an alliance with Ushari and a plan to eliminate Simba. Upon being defeated, he and his three supporters were expelled from the Pride Lands, and became a part of Scar's growing collective in the Outlands. In some later episodes of Season 2 & the Season 3 opener, more crocodiles have been known to be part of Kiburi's float in the Outlands.

Much like her father, she is always game for a laugh. Even when Simba makes a mistake at her father's funeral, she is gracious and kind, and makes light of the situation by dwelling on the good. She is similarly gracious to Nala and Kiara when they are the only members of their family to attend the elephant concert. Ma Tembo's herd resided in Kilio Valley until it was destroyed by a fire caused by the Outlanders in \"The Kilio Valley Fire\".\n** '''Mtoto''' (voiced by Natalie Coughlin in \"Bunga the Wise,\" Justin Felbinger in later episodes) is an elephant calf who idolizes Beshte.

Being so learned in the ways of the animals, Basi is knowledgeable and wise. Despite being an animal with a very different way of life, he understands the customs of the crocodiles and how this affects his pod's everyday life.

Makucha is later revealed to be the leader of his leap which is first shown when the Lion Guard was looking for water in the Back Lands during a water shortage in the Pride Lands. Makucha becomes the main antagonist of Season 3, starting with the episode \"The Harmattan\". After hearing from Makini excitedly talking all about the Tree of Life and the rare animals, Makucha uses that info to make a new goal: sneakily follow the Lion Guard to the Tree of Life, so that he can feast on the rare animals.

He debuts in the story ''A Tale of Two Brothers'', which served as a prequel to ''[[The Lion King]]''. The books were released before the film's production had finished, and thus, Alex Simmons (Kopa's creator) did not know that Simba and Nala would be given a cub at the end of the film.\n\nIn the 1995 commentary tract based on the film, Roger Allens and Rob Minkoff describe the cub at the end of the first film as \"Fluffy\"; therefore scrapping Kopa, and as a result, he is non-canon to the films. Kopa was also originally going to be the oldest of Simba and Nala.\n\n===Ahadi===\nAhadi is the father of Mufasa and Taka (Scar), the grandfather of Simba, the great-grandfather of Kopa, and the king of the Pride Lands during the events of ''The Lion King: Six New Adventures'' story ''A Tale of Two Brothers''.

She is absent from the book but is mentioned to have left to search for water to save the kingdom.\n\n===Mohatu===\nMohatu is the father of Ahadi, the grandfather of Mufasa and Scar, the great-grandfather of Simba, and King of the Pride Lands during the events of the story ''The Brightest Star''. He went to find water for the animals of the land during a drought and helped the animals get on with each other. When he died, he became a star which was brighter than the others. He is shown to look a lot like a darker furred version of Mufasa, having facial features like Simba's and was said to have been one of the greatest kings of the Pride Lands.\n\n===Ni===\nNi is a character who appears in ''The Lion King: Six New Adventures'' story ''Nala's Dare''. He is a young lion who has left his pride to start his own and travels through the Pride Lands during Scar's reign and saves Nala from hyenas before leaving, after meeting the rest of the Pridelanders.\n\n===Kula===\nKula is a character in ''The Lion King: Six New Adventures'' story ''Nala's Dare''. She is one of Nala's friends and one of the cubs of the Pridelanders who lived during Scar's reign.\n\n===Chumvi===\nChumvi is a character in ''The Lion King: Six New Adventures'' story ''Nala's Dare''. He is one of Nala's friends and one of the cubs of the Pridelanders.\n\n===Joka===\nJoka is a giant [[African rock python]] in ''The Lion King: Six New Adventures'' story ''A Snake in the Grass''. He is extremely intelligent and is able to formulate complicated plans in a short amount of time. He has the power to twist his words into whatever he rightly wants and uses hypnotism to lure unsuspecting victims into believing his empty words. The name Joka translates as 'dragon' in the [[Swahili language|Swahili tongue]].\n\n===Jelani===\nJelani is Rafiki's lazy cousin in ''The Lion King: Six New Adventures'' story ''Follow the Leader''. Despite being considered leader of his troop, he is unconcerned about the suffering of his subjects, as he is often too concerned about his own welfare to lead them to a new home.\n\n===Kwaheri===\nKwaheri is Kopa's monkey friend in ''The Lion King: Six New Adventures'' stories ''Nala's Dare'' and ''How True, Zazu?'' He is social, talkative, and critical to his friends. He often flaunts his talents around Kopa to either spark a reaction or just be a show-off.\n\n===Boma===\nBoma is a cape buffalo who appears in ''The Lion King: Six New Adventures'' stories ''A Tale of Two Brothers'' and ''How True, Zazu?''. His grandparents were killed during an attack by ants. He is the leader of the cape buffalo and he is aggressive, controlling, selfish, strong, and short-tempered. He is also somewhat reclusive and gruff, as he doesn't seem to understand that there is a balance between species and refuses to share the last remaining water-hole during a drought, which can affect the whole of the Pride Lands. It is due to him that Taka got his scar after which he renamed himself to Scar. If challenged or insulted he becomes very angry. However, he is mildly co-operative if not insulted or challenged. Taka tries to get Mufasa in trouble by telling him to talk with Boma to share the water-hole. Mufasa tries to reason with him to share the water-hole however he refuses. Scar then roars and tells him that he must obey or challenge Mufasa. He then chases after Mufasa who is rescued by Rafiki. Rafiki starts to grow tired while running but is picked up by Mufasa who then jumps across a ravine. Boma is unable to make the jumps and falls into it. Mufasa tells him that he doesn't have to fight but he keeps hurling thret{{Clarification|date=February 2018}} while saying that the other buffaloes can still harm Taka.

She only appeared in ''A Tale of Two Brothers''; although she was mentioned in ''How True, Zazu?'' It is revealed that she is Zazu's mother. Flirtatious and gossipy, Zuzu is a very maternal bird who never passes up the chance for some juicy gossip, much like her son, Zazu. Her talkative nature and nosy habits often make her a bit of an annoyance to the other animals; however, Ahadi puts her personality to good use in order to get a better grip on the doings of his kingdom. Zuzu is also known for being loyal and brave, as she was willing to help Rafiki even though she did not fully understand the danger Mufasa was in. It is revealed that she retired and gave Zazu her place as the king's majordomo.\n\n===King Joe===\nKing Joe is a comic book character in The Lion King book \"A False Ancestor\" as he is a rogue stranger who lurks in the Pride Lands. He tricked Simba by saying that he was the great-great-great-grandfather of the current king, which is Mufasa. He later saves Simba from a river from nearly getting eaten by an alligator. After he saved Simba, he was never mentioned or seen again. He bears a similar mane and appearance to Nuka.\n\n==Introduced in the ''Hakuna Matata'' Magazine==\n===Kataka===\nKataka is a meerkat who appears in the story called ''Falling in Love''. She is part of a meerkat colony that lives in the same oasis that Timon and Pumbaa reside in.\n\n===Zak===\nZak is a zebra who appears in a story called ''Falling in Love''.

Using the lost wax method, Chase-Riboud carves, bends, folds, and manipulates large sheets of wax prior to casting molds of the handmade designs. She then pours the metal to produce the metal-work, which melts the original wax sculpture. The finished metal is then combined with material threads, which are manipulated into knots and cords, and often serve as the base for the metal portion of her sculptures, including those in the Malcolm X Steles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Barbara Chase-Riboud : the Malcolm X steles|publisher=|others=Chase-Riboud, Barbara,, Basualdo, Carlos, 1964-, Rub, Timothy,, Shaw, Gwendolyn DuBois, 1968-, Spitz, Ellen Handler,, Vick, John|year=2013|isbn=9780300196405|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=21\u201331|oclc=858949783}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, her woodcut ''Reba'' was displayed in the [[Carnegie Hall]] Gallery as a part of the exhibit ''It's All Yours'' (sponsored by ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine).<ref name=\"Chase-Riboud2015\" /> This [[woodcut]] was subsequently purchased by the [[Museum of Modern Art]].<ref name=SmithJCp177 /><ref name=\"Chase-Riboud2015\" />\n\nThe Temple University yearbook ''Templar'' published fourteen of her woodcuts in 1956.

''Valide: A Novel of the Harem'' (1986) examined slavery in the [[Ottoman empire]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Her ''Echo of Lions'' (1989) was one of the first serious novels about the historic ''[[La Amistad|Amistad]]'' slave-ship revolt of 1839.\n\nIn 1994, Chase-Riboud published ''The President's Daughter,'' a work that continued the Sally Hemings story, by imagining the life of her and Jefferson's mixed-race daughter Harriet Hemings.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> At the age of 21, Harriet left Monticello, given traveling money by Jefferson via his overseer, and went North. She settled in Washington, DC where her brother Beverley had already settled. Like him, she passed into white society.

It was based on the life of Thomas Jefferson's [[quadroon]] slave of that name; she was a much-younger half-sister to his late wife and was rumored to have been his [[concubine]] for years.

Brodie]], Chase-Riboud was among those who believed that Thomas Jefferson fathered six children with Hemings. The young slave was nearly 30 years younger than the president and little had been documented about her life.\n\nChase-Riboud was the first writer to present a fully realized, fictional character of Sally Hemings, with a rich interior life. Finally Sally Hemings had a voice. The public accepted her portrayal of Hemings and could believe such a woman had a relationship with Jefferson. Sally Hemings was vivid as an American historical figure. Chase-Riboud's book became an international bestseller and won the [[Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize]] in fiction by an American woman.<ref name=Steles115 />\n\nIt was so popular that [[CBS]] planned to adapt it as a TV mini-series.

It also presented African Americans of a range of skin tones, representing the many Hemings mixed-race descendants.\n\nA rearguard of Jefferson historians has continued to deny the possibility of a relationship, but in 2000 and 2001 the [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]] at [[Monticello]], and the [[National Genealogical Society]] independently announced their conclusions that Jefferson had likely fathered all of Hemings' children, based on both the DNA and other historical evidence.<ref>[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\"], Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation.

The [[Smithsonian Museum]] and [[Monticello]] collaborated on a groundbreaking exhibition in 2012 in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]: ''[[Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello]]'', which explored Jefferson as a slaveholder and six of the major slave families. It said that Jefferson was likely the father of all Sally Hemings' children. The exhibit was seen by more than one million people.\n\nChase-Riboud explored the interweaving relationships between the Hemings' and Jefferson families; as Sally Hemings was a much younger half-sister of Jefferson's late wife, she was an aunt to his two daughters. \n<blockquote>In place of civic myths that deny America's [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] beginnings, Chase-Riboud turns to the Hemings family to unveil the historical presence of antebellum interracial relationships and the possibilities of a post-civil rights multiracial community.<ref name=\"tillet\">Salamishah Tillet, \"Chap.

She had filed suit against the playwright of ''Dusky Sally'' in 1987, shortly before a production was to open at the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] in Philadelphia. She said his work infringed on her copyright for her novel ''Sally Hemings'' because it borrowed her fictional ideas. [[Robert F. Kelly|Judge Robert F. Kelly]] concluded that while \n<blockquote>laws were not enacted to inhibit creativity ... it is one thing to inhibit creativity and another to use the idea-versus-expression distinction as something akin to an absolute defense -- to maintain that the protection of copyright law is negated by any small amount of tinkering with another writer's idea that results in a different expression.\"<ref name=CohenRoger>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/15/theater/judge-says-copyright-covers-writer-s-ideas-of-a-jefferson-affair.html Cohen, Roger. \"Judge Says Copyright Covers Writer's Ideas of a Jefferson Affair\"], ''The New York Times,'' August 15, 1991.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe also said, \n<blockquote>the similarity between the two works is so obvious and so unapologetic that an ordinary observer can only conclude that Burgess felt he was justified in copying 'Sally Hemings,' or at least that there was no legal impediment to doing so, assuming a few modifications were made.\" The resulting decision constituted a significant victory for artists and writers, reinforcing protection for creative ideas even when expressed in a slightly different form.\"<ref name=CohenRoger/></blockquote>\n\n==== Lawsuit: ''Chase-Riboud v.

Chase-Riboud also writes and publishes poetry, including her first work ''Memphis & Peking'' (1974), edited by Toni Morrison, and her more recent publication: ''Everytime a Knot is Undone, a God is Released'' (2014).Chase-Riboud continued her literary exploration into slavery and exploitation of African people with her subsequent novels. ''Valide: A Novel of the Harem'' (1986) examined slavery in the [[Ottoman empire]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Her ''Echo of Lions'' (1989) was one of the first serious novels about the historic ''[[La Amistad|Amistad]]'' slave-ship revolt of 1839.\n\nIn 1994, Chase-Riboud published ''The President's Daughter,'' a work that continued the Sally Hemings story, by imagining the life of her and Jefferson's mixed-race daughter Harriet Hemings.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> At the age of 21, Harriet left Monticello, given traveling money by Jefferson via his overseer, and went North. She settled in Washington, DC where her brother Beverley had already settled. Like him, she passed into white society. She married a white man, according to her letters to her brother [[Madison Hemings]]. He was the only one of the four surviving Hemings children who lived the remainder of his life identifying as African-American.\n\nChase-Riboud's most recent novel, ''Hottentot Venus: A Novel'' (2003), humanizes [[Sarah Baartman]], a [[Khoikhoi]] woman who was exhibited naked in [[freak show]]s in 19th-century Europe.\n\n====''Sally Hemings: A Novel''====\nIn 1979 she gained widespread attention and critical acclaim for her writing with her first novel ''Sally Hemings''. It was based on the life of Thomas Jefferson's [[quadroon]] slave of that name; she was a much-younger half-sister to his late wife and was rumored to have been his [[concubine]] for years. In the Summer of 1974 Chase-Riboud had met with editor [[Jacqueline Onassis]] to discuss her plans for the work, and Onassis persuaded her to write it.<ref name=Steles115>{{cite book|last=Chase-Riboud|year=2013|pp=115|title=The Malcolm X Steles|publisher=|isbn=|ref=harv}}</ref> Based on Jefferson's biography by [[Fawn M. Brodie]], Chase-Riboud was among those who believed that Thomas Jefferson fathered six children with Hemings. The young slave was nearly 30 years younger than the president and little had been documented about her life.\n\nChase-Riboud was the first writer to present a fully realized, fictional character of Sally Hemings, with a rich interior life. Finally Sally Hemings had a voice. The public accepted her portrayal of Hemings and could believe such a woman had a relationship with Jefferson. Sally Hemings was vivid as an American historical figure. Chase-Riboud's book became an international bestseller and won the [[Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize]] in fiction by an American woman.<ref name=Steles115 />\n\nIt was so popular that [[CBS]] planned to adapt it as a TV mini-series. But mainline historians who were still \"guarding\" Jefferson as an icon of integrity put pressure on president [[William Paley]] to end the effort.<ref name=\"CBS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/ |title=The History of a Secret |work=Jefferson's Blood | publisher=PBS Frontline|date= May 2000 |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}Quote: \"More than 20 years after CBS executives were pressured by Jefferson historians to drop plans for a mini-series on Jefferson and Hemings, the network airs ''Sally Hemings: An American Scandal.'' Though many quarreled with the portrayal of Hemings as unrealistically modern and heroic, no major historian challenged the series' premise that Hemings and Jefferson had a 38-year relationship that produced children.</ref> No adaptation was made at the time.\n\nBut, more than 20 years later, CBS produced ''[[Sally Hemings: An American Scandal]]'' (2000), a made-for-TV mini-series that portrayed Hemings' and Jefferson's relationship. This has been widely accepted since a 1998 [[DNA]] study showed a match between a Hemings descendant and the Jefferson male line.<ref name=\"CBS\"/><ref>Foster, EA; Jobling MA, Taylor PG, Donnelly P, de Knijff P, Mieremet R, Zerjal T, Tyler-Smith C (1998). \"Jefferson fathered slave\u2019s last child,\" ''Nature'' 396 (6706): 27\u201328. {{doi|10.1038/23835}}. {{PMID|9817200}}.</ref> Although some reviewers argued about the characterization of Sally Hemings, \"no major historian challenged the series' premise that Hemings and Jefferson had a 38-year relationship that produced children.\"<ref name=\"CBS\"/> The series featured a beautiful actress as Sally Hemings, as historic accounts of her agreed on her beauty. It also presented African Americans of a range of skin tones, representing the many Hemings mixed-race descendants.\n\nA rearguard of Jefferson historians has continued to deny the possibility of a relationship, but in 2000 and 2001 the [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]] at [[Monticello]], and the [[National Genealogical Society]] independently announced their conclusions that Jefferson had likely fathered all of Hemings' children, based on both the DNA and other historical evidence.<ref>[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\"], Monticello Website, Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Retrieved June 22, 2011. Quote: \"Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife\u2019s death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings.\"</ref><ref>Helen F. M. Leary, ''National Genealogical Society Quarterly'', Vol. 89, No. 3, September 2001, pp. 207, 214\u2013218. Quote: Leary concluded that \"the chain of evidence securely fastens Sally Hemings' children to their father, Thomas Jefferson.\"</ref> This historic consensus has been reflected in academic writing about Jefferson and his times. The [[Smithsonian Museum]] and [[Monticello]] collaborated on a groundbreaking exhibition in 2012 in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]: ''[[Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello]]'', which explored Jefferson as a slaveholder and six of the major slave families. It said that Jefferson was likely the father of all Sally Hemings' children. The exhibit was seen by more than one million people.\n\nChase-Riboud explored the interweaving relationships between the Hemings' and Jefferson families; as Sally Hemings was a much younger half-sister of Jefferson's late wife, she was an aunt to his two daughters. \n<blockquote>In place of civic myths that deny America's [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] beginnings, Chase-Riboud turns to the Hemings family to unveil the historical presence of antebellum interracial relationships and the possibilities of a post-civil rights multiracial community.<ref name=\"tillet\">Salamishah Tillet, \"Chap.

She had filed suit against the playwright of ''Dusky Sally'' in 1987, shortly before a production was to open at the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] in Philadelphia. She said his work infringed on her copyright for her novel ''Sally Hemings'' because it borrowed her fictional ideas. [[Robert F. Kelly|Judge Robert F. Kelly]] concluded that while \n<blockquote>laws were not enacted to inhibit creativity ... it is one thing to inhibit creativity and another to use the idea-versus-expression distinction as something akin to an absolute defense -- to maintain that the protection of copyright law is negated by any small amount of tinkering with another writer's idea that results in a different expression.\"<ref name=CohenRoger>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/15/theater/judge-says-copyright-covers-writer-s-ideas-of-a-jefferson-affair.html Cohen, Roger. \"Judge Says Copyright Covers Writer's Ideas of a Jefferson Affair\"], ''The New York Times,'' August 15, 1991.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe also said, \n<blockquote>the similarity between the two works is so obvious and so unapologetic that an ordinary observer can only conclude that Burgess felt he was justified in copying 'Sally Hemings,' or at least that there was no legal impediment to doing so, assuming a few modifications were made.\" The resulting decision constituted a significant victory for artists and writers, reinforcing protection for creative ideas even when expressed in a slightly different form.\"<ref name=CohenRoger/></blockquote>\n\n==== Lawsuit: ''Chase-Riboud v.

This was under an option held by [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s Punch Productions. Franzoni claimed he had never read Chase-Riboud's book, which she had sold to Dustin Hoffman's production company. Burt Fields, DreamWorks main lawyer, was at the same time unbeknownst to Chase-Riboud's attorneys a stockholder, lawyer and board member of Punch Productions who did not recuse himself from the suit, but on the contrary managed to have Punch Productions dropped from the original complaint and Franzoni was never obliged to testify under oath.\" He may have carried over some of his thinking to his screenplay for ''Amistad.''<ref>Kim Musters, \"The Studios Aging Bulls,\" ''Vanity Fair,'' April 1998.</ref> When Chase-Riboud filed a second suit against DreamWorks in France, the dispute was quickly settled out of court for an undisclosed amount days before the 1998 [[Academy Awards|Oscar nominations]] were announced.<ref>\"'Amistad' Libel Case Settled,\" '' Variety,'' February 10, 1998.</ref>\n\n===Poetry===\nChase-Riboud's first work of poetry, ''From Memphis & Peking'' (1974), was edited by [[Toni Morrison]] and published to critical acclaim.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Her poetry volume, ''Portrait of a Nude Woman as Cleopatra,'' (1987), won the [[Carl Sandburg|Carl Sandburg Award]] in 1988.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In 1994, Chase-Riboud published ''Roman Egyptien,'' poetry written in French.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 2014, she published ''Everytime a Knot is Undone, a God is Released: Collected and New Poems 1974-2011''.<ref>[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/243774/everytime-a-knot-is-undone-a-god-is-released-by-barbara-chase-riboud/9781609805944/ ''Everytime a Knot is Undone, a God is Released''] at Penguin Random House.</ref>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn Paris, Chase met [[Marc Riboud]], a photographer who was part of the [[Magnum Photos|Magnum]] group.
