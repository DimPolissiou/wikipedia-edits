Claims of [[media bias]] in the [[United States]] include claims of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] bias and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] bias. Such claims have increased as the US political parties have become more [[Political polarization|polarized]]. There are also claims of [[#Corporate bias and power bias|corporate bias]], bias in reporting to favor the corporate owners of the media, and mainstream bias, a tendency for the media to focus on certain \"hot\" stories and ignore news of more substance.

It prohibited the publication of \"false, scandalous, or malicious writing\" against the government and made it a crime to voice any public opposition to any law or presidential act. This part of the law act was in effect until 1801.<ref>Walter Berns, \"Freedom of the Press and the Alien and Sedition Laws: A Reappraisal.\" ''The Supreme Court Review 1970'' (1970): 109-159.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Thomas Jefferson]], 1801\u20131809, was the target of many venomous attacks. He advised editors to divide their newspapers into four sections labeled \"truth,\" \"probabilities,\" \"possibilities,\" and \"lies,\" and observed that the first section would be the smallest and the last the largest. In retirement he grumbled, \"Advertisements contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper.\"<ref>Harvey G.

To some extent this was mitigated by a separation between ''news'' and ''editorial''. News reporting was expected to be relatively neutral or at least factual, whereas editorial sections openly relayed the opinion of the publisher. Editorials often were accompanied by [[editorial cartoon]]s, which lampooned the publisher's opponents.<ref name=\"journalism2002\">W.

For the private media, profits are dependent on viewing figures, regardless of whether the viewers found the programs adequate or outstanding. The strong profit-making incentive of the American media leads them to seek a simplified format and uncontroversial position which will be adequate for the largest possible audience. The market mechanism only rewards media outlets based on the number of viewers who watch those outlets, not by how informed the viewers are, how good the analysis is, or how impressed the viewers are by that analysis.\n\nAccording to some, the profit-driven quest for high numbers of viewers, rather than high quality for viewers, has resulted in a slide from serious news and analysis to entertainment, sometimes called [[infotainment]]:\n\n<blockquote> \"Imitating the rhythm of sports reports, exciting live coverage of major political crises and foreign wars was now available for viewers in the safety of their own homes. By the late 1980s, this combination of information and entertainment in news programmes was known as infotainment.\" [Barbrook, Media Freedom, (London, Pluto Press, 1995) part 14] </blockquote>\n\n===Oversimplification===\n[[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] claimed in her book ''The Interplay of Influence: News, Advertising, Politics, and the Internet'' that most television news stories are made to fit into one of five categories:<ref name=\"Ref_aj\">Kathleen Jamieson and Karlyn Kohrs Campbell (2000), ''The Interplay of Influence: News, Advertising, Politics, and the Internet'', Wadsworth, 362 pages, {{ISBN|0534533647}}.</ref>\n*Appearance versus reality\n*Little guys versus big guys\n*Good versus evil\n*Efficiency versus inefficiency\n*Unique and bizarre events versus ordinary events.\n\nReducing news to these five categories, and tending towards an unrealistic black/white mentality, simplifies the world into easily understood opposites. According to Jamieson, the media provides an oversimplified skeleton of information that is more easily commercialized.\n\n===Media imperialism===\n[[Media imperialism]] is a critical theory regarding the perceived effects of globalization on the world's media which is often seen as dominated by American media and culture.

There were also some changes in the average ideological slant of endorsements: while in the 1940s and in the 1950s there was a clear advantage to Republican candidates, this advantage continuously eroded in subsequent decades, to the extent that in the 1990s the authors found a slight Democratic lead in the average endorsement choice.<ref name=\"Ref_al\">{{cite web|url=http://econ-www.mit.edu/faculty/download_pdf.php?id=1148|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901070920/http://econ-www.mit.edu/faculty/download_pdf.php?id=1148|archivedate=September 1, 2006|title=The Political Orientation of Newspaper Endorsements in U.S. Elections, 1940-2002|author=Stephen Ansolabehere|publisher=Web.archive.com|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nRiccardo Puglisi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology looks at the editorial choices of ''The New York Times'' from 1946 to 1997.<ref name=\"Ref_am\">{{cite document|ssrn=573801 |title=Being the New York Times: The Political Behaviour of a Newspaper  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.573801 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=September 27, 2004 |last1=Puglisi |first1=Riccardo |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/19292/1/Being_the_new_york_times.pdf }}</ref> He finds that the ''Times'' displays Democratic partisanship, with some [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] aspects. This is the case, because during presidential campaigns the ''Times'' systematically gives more coverage to Democratic topics of civil rights, health care, labor and social welfare, but only when the [[incumbent]] president is a Republican. These topics are classified as Democratic ones, because Gallup polls show that on average U.S. citizens think that Democratic candidates would be better at handling problems related to them. According to Puglisi, in the post-1960 period the ''Times'' displays a more symmetric type of watchdog behavior, just because during presidential campaigns it also gives more coverage to the typically Republican issue of Defense when the incumbent President is a Democrat, and less so when the incumbent is a Republican.\n\nJohn Lott and Kevin Hassett of the conservative think tank [[American Enterprise Institute]] studied the coverage of economic news by looking at a panel of 389 U.S. newspapers from 1991 to 2004, and at a subsample of the two ten newspapers and the Associated Press from 1985 to 2004.<ref name=\"Ref_an\">Lott, John R. and Hassett, Kevin A.

Hudson<ref name=\"Ref_au\">Hudson, ''American Democracy in Peril: Eight Challenges to America's Future'' (Washington, D.C., CQ Press, 2004)</ref> argued that America's news media elections coverage damages the democratic process. He argues that elections are centered on candidates, whose advancement depends on funds, personality and sound-bites, rather than serious political discussion or policies offered by parties. His argument is that it is on the media which Americans are dependent for information about politics (this is of course true almost by definition) and that they are therefore greatly influenced by the way the media report, which concentrates on short sound-bites, gaffes by candidates, and scandals. The reporting of elections avoids complex issues or issues which are time-consuming to explain. Of course, important political issues are generally both complex and time-consuming to explain, so are avoided.\n\nHudson blames this style of media coverage, at least partly, for trivialised elections:\n<blockquote>\"The bites of information voters receive from both print and electronic media are simply insufficient for constructive political discourse{{nbsp}}... candidates for office have adjusted their style of campaigning in response to this tabloid style of media coverage{{nbsp}}... modern campaigns are exercises in image manipulation{{nbsp}}...

The only other factor with as strong an influence on belief that media is biased is extensive coverage of celebrities.

For the private media, profits are dependent on viewing figures, regardless of whether the viewers found the programs adequate or outstanding. The strong profit-making incentive of the American media leads them to seek a simplified format and uncontroversial position which will be adequate for the largest possible audience. The market mechanism only rewards media outlets based on the number of viewers who watch those outlets, not by how informed the viewers are, how good the analysis is, or how impressed the viewers are by that analysis.\n\nAccording to some, the profit-driven quest for high numbers of viewers, rather than high quality for viewers, has resulted in a slide from serious news and analysis to entertainment, sometimes called [[infotainment]]:\n\n<blockquote> \"Imitating the rhythm of sports reports, exciting live coverage of major political crises and foreign wars was now available for viewers in the safety of their own homes. By the late 1980s, this combination of information and entertainment in news programmes was known as infotainment.\" [Barbrook, Media Freedom, (London, Pluto Press, 1995) part 14] </blockquote>\n\n===Oversimplification===\n[[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] claimed in her book ''The Interplay of Influence: News, Advertising, Politics, and the Internet'' that most television news stories are made to fit into one of five categories:<ref name=\"Ref_aj\">Kathleen Jamieson and Karlyn Kohrs Campbell (2000), ''The Interplay of Influence: News, Advertising, Politics, and the Internet'', Wadsworth, 362 pages, {{ISBN|0534533647}}.</ref>\n*Appearance versus reality\n*Little guys versus big guys\n*Good versus evil\n*Efficiency versus inefficiency\n*Unique and bizarre events versus ordinary events.\n\nReducing news to these five categories, and tending towards an unrealistic black/white mentality, simplifies the world into easily understood opposites. According to Jamieson, the media provides an oversimplified skeleton of information that is more easily commercialized.\n\n===Media imperialism===\n[[Media imperialism]] is a critical theory regarding the perceived effects of globalization on the world's media which is often seen as dominated by American media and culture.

There were also some changes in the average ideological slant of endorsements: while in the 1940s and in the 1950s there was a clear advantage to Republican candidates, this advantage continuously eroded in subsequent decades, to the extent that in the 1990s the authors found a slight Democratic lead in the average endorsement choice.<ref name=\"Ref_al\">{{cite web|url=http://econ-www.mit.edu/faculty/download_pdf.php?id=1148|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901070920/http://econ-www.mit.edu/faculty/download_pdf.php?id=1148|archivedate=September 1, 2006|title=The Political Orientation of Newspaper Endorsements in U.S. Elections, 1940-2002|author=Stephen Ansolabehere|publisher=Web.archive.com|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nRiccardo Puglisi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology looks at the editorial choices of ''The New York Times'' from 1946 to 1997.<ref name=\"Ref_am\">{{cite document|ssrn=573801 |title=Being the New York Times: The Political Behaviour of a Newspaper  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.573801 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date=September 27, 2004 |last1=Puglisi |first1=Riccardo |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/19292/1/Being_the_new_york_times.pdf }}</ref> He finds that the ''Times'' displays Democratic partisanship, with some [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] aspects. This is the case, because during presidential campaigns the ''Times'' systematically gives more coverage to Democratic topics of civil rights, health care, labor and social welfare, but only when the [[incumbent]] president is a Republican. These topics are classified as Democratic ones, because Gallup polls show that on average U.S. citizens think that Democratic candidates would be better at handling problems related to them. According to Puglisi, in the post-1960 period the ''Times'' displays a more symmetric type of watchdog behavior, just because during presidential campaigns it also gives more coverage to the typically Republican issue of Defense when the incumbent President is a Democrat, and less so when the incumbent is a Republican.\n\nJohn Lott and Kevin Hassett of the conservative think tank [[American Enterprise Institute]] studied the coverage of economic news by looking at a panel of 389 U.S. newspapers from 1991 to 2004, and at a subsample of the two ten newspapers and the Associated Press from 1985 to 2004.<ref name=\"Ref_an\">Lott, John R. and Hassett, Kevin A.

Hudson<ref name=\"Ref_au\">Hudson, ''American Democracy in Peril: Eight Challenges to America's Future'' (Washington, D.C., CQ Press, 2004)</ref> argued that America's news media elections coverage damages the democratic process. He argues that elections are centered on candidates, whose advancement depends on funds, personality and sound-bites, rather than serious political discussion or policies offered by parties. His argument is that it is on the media which Americans are dependent for information about politics (this is of course true almost by definition) and that they are therefore greatly influenced by the way the media report, which concentrates on short sound-bites, gaffes by candidates, and scandals. The reporting of elections avoids complex issues or issues which are time-consuming to explain. Of course, important political issues are generally both complex and time-consuming to explain, so are avoided.\n\nHudson blames this style of media coverage, at least partly, for trivialised elections:\n<blockquote>\"The bites of information voters receive from both print and electronic media are simply insufficient for constructive political discourse{{nbsp}}... candidates for office have adjusted their style of campaigning in response to this tabloid style of media coverage{{nbsp}}... modern campaigns are exercises in image manipulation{{nbsp}}...

Ladd, who has conducted intensive studies of media trust and media bias, concluded that the primary cause of widespread popular belief in media bias is media telling their audience that other particular media are biased.

The only other factor with as strong an influence on belief that media is biased is extensive coverage of celebrities.

As a composer and pianist, music writer, journalist and lecturer he represents the German piano group of the 19th century.\n\n==Life ==\nOtto Neitzel was the second son out of six musically talented children of the teacher Gottfried Neitzel and his wife Louise, n\u00e9e Messerschmidt. At the age of eight he caused a sensation as a \"Wunderkind\" playing piano in his hometown Falkenburg and nearby cities (Dramburg, Kallies and Rummelsburg) in the [[Pomeranian Switzerland|Pommersche Schweiz]], Pommern. In Stettin he was promoted by Carl Loewe, in Berlin by Eduard Grell (1800-1886), the violinist Hubert Ries and the composer Robert Tauber. Because his father was not able to finance his musical education his talented son was sponsored by patron Bernhard Loeser from the cigar manufacturers \"Loeser&Wolff\". (2) (\"Tadell\u00f6ser&Wolff\", novel by Walter Kempowski) 1865 the young boy left home to become a quartaner at the Joachimsthaler Gymnasium in Berlin. He got piano lessons at the Neue Akademie der Tonkunst by Theodor Kullak, Richard W\u00fcerst and Friedrich Kiel (according to Friedrich-Kiel-Gesellschaft e.V.).\n\nFrom 1873 to 1875 he was a student of Franz List. 1875 he wrote his dissertation \"Die \u00e4sthetische Grenze der Programmmusik\" (The Esthetic Limit of Program-Music). He went on tour accompanying the sopran singer Pauline Lucca and the famous violinist Pablo de Sarasate on piano. (3)\n1878 Neitzel became director of the Musikverein in Stra\u00dfburg. From 1879 till 1881 he was music-director at the Stra\u00dfburger Stadttheater and worked as a teacher at the Stra\u00dfburger Konservatorium. Its Director Max Erdmannsd\u00f6rfer recommended him as a representative for the German piano school at the Moscow Konservatory. He was offered a chair as \"Imperatorial-Russian\" professor. (4) He married his student, the alto singer Sophie Romboi.  1885 he became teacher at the K\u00f6lner Konservatorium. 1887 he became chief of the musical section of the \"K\u00f6lnische Zeitung\", where he published as a journalist. 1887 was the debut of his first opera \"Angela\" in Halle a.d. Saale.\n\nExcited about the new technical inventions, Neitzel recorded parts of [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Concert No. 2]] by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] in Cologne among other musicians on 23 January 1890 in the last session of the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] phonograph recording expedition through Europe. With this [[Phonograph cylinder|phonograph-wax-cylinder]] he left one of the oldest music recordings still in existence. In the winter of 1906/07 he was invited to play and hold lecture recitals in the United States, where he played Beethoven's G-major concert in Philadelphia and Boston, directed by [[Karl Muck]]. In 1909 Neitzel directed Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] and his [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]. Because of its success Muck encouraged him to direct the orchestra, but Neitzel rejected the offer.\n\nIn 1910 Neitzel tried out a new technical facility for recording music for the second time: The Welter-Grand-Piano, with whom he recorded some of the \"Davidsb\u00fcndler T\u00e4nze\" by Robert Schumann on paper-tape-rolls. (C) He was acquainted with Richard Wagner and Richard Strau\u00df, who he supported. In 1919 he became member of the Preu\u00dfische Akademie der K\u00fcnste in Berlin. He held a chair as a professor. He died on 10 March 1920 in Cologne, where he left behind four daughters. One became a piano player and another played harp in an orchestra.\nNeitzel wrote plays and published steadily: His work enfolds 6 operas and several music pieces for piano. Among them adaptions for piano, like \"The spanisch dances\" from Sarasate, 1878. As an author for music literature he had written several opera guides including one about Richard Wagner, books about Beethovens symphony's and about Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. His entertaining style of writing is exemplified  in \"Out of my musical potofolio\" (\"Aus meiner musikanten-Mappe\").\n\nThe K\u00f6lnische Zeitung reports on 27 January 1890 from Neitzels music record: \"Herr Wangemann, the real Edison apostle who received the honor of demonstrating his instruments to the German Kaiser invites local musicians and music-lovers to see and listen to the phonograph, which he exhibits at Ibach & Son at the New Market. It maybe that the handling was not always accurate, but with the fresh made cylinders there was nearly nothing to hear of the mentioned disturbing, abnormal sounds. A recorded piano rendering by the phonograph resulted the truest details, delicacy nuances, every blue and every false note. A gypsy band and a Vienna tenor were clearly audible on earlier cylinders. The mashine, that was not shown a greater audience, was specially prepared for musical recitals\".  (B)\nOriginal Article:\n(\"Herr Wangemann, der echte Edison Apostel, der n\u00e4mliche, welcher die Ehre hatte, dem deutschen Kaiser seine Apparate vorzuf\u00fchren, beehrte einige hiesige Musiker und Musikfreunde mit Einladungen zur Besichtigung und Anh\u00f6rung seines bei Ibach Sohn am Neumarkt aufgestellten Phonographen. Es scheint doch wohl, da\u00df die Handhabung dieses Instruments nicht immer mit der n\u00f6tigen Sorgfalt betrieben wird; denn von den sonst erw\u00e4hnten Nebenger\u00e4uschen war namentlich an den frisch angefertigten Cylindern kaum etwas zu sp\u00fcren.

As a composer and pianist, music writer, journalist and lecturer he represents the German piano group of the 19th century.\n\n==Life ==\nOtto Neitzel was the second son out of six musically talented children of the teacher Gottfried Neitzel and his wife Louise, n\u00e9e Messerschmidt. At the age of eight he caused a sensation as a \"Wunderkind\" playing piano in his hometown Falkenburg and nearby cities (Dramburg, Kallies and Rummelsburg) in the Pommersche Schweiz, Pommern. In Stettin he was promoted by Carl Loewe, in Berlin by Eduard Grell (1800-1886), the violinist Hubert Ries and the composer Robert Tauber. Because his father was not able to finance his musical education his talented son was sponsored by patron Bernhard Loeser from the cigar manufacturers \"Loeser&Wolff\". (2) (\"Tadell\u00f6ser&Wolff\", novel by Walter Kempowski) 1865 the young boy left home to become a quartaner at the Joachimsthaler Gymnasium in Berlin. He got piano lessons at the Neue Akademie der Tonkunst by Theodor Kullak, Richard W\u00fcerst and Friedrich Kiel (according to Friedrich-Kiel-Gesellschaft e.V.).\n\nFrom 1873 to 1875 he was a student of Franz List. 1875 he wrote his dissertation \"Die \u00e4sthetische Grenze der Programmmusik\" (The Esthetic Limit of Program-Music). He went on tour accompanying the sopran singer Pauline Lucca and the famous violinist Pablo de Sarasate on piano. (3)\n1878 Neitzel became director of the Musikverein in Stra\u00dfburg. From 1879 till 1881 he was music-director at the Stra\u00dfburger Stadttheater and worked as a teacher at the Stra\u00dfburger Konservatorium. Its Director Max Erdmannsd\u00f6rfer recommended him as a representative for the German piano school at the Moscow Konservatory. He was offered a chair as \"Imperatorial-Russian\" professor. (4) He married his student, the alto singer Sophie Romboi.  1885 he became teacher at the K\u00f6lner Konservatorium. 1887 he became chief of the musical section of the \"K\u00f6lnische Zeitung\", where he published as a journalist. 1887 was the debut of his first opera \"Angela\" in Halle a.d. Saale.\n\nExcited about the new technical inventions, Neitzel recorded parts of [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Concert No. 2]] by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] in Cologne among other musicians on 23 January 1890 in the last session of the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] phonograph recording expedition through Europe. With this [[Phonograph cylinder|phonograph-wax-cylinder]] he left one of the oldest music recordings still in existence. In the winter of 1906/07 he was invited to play and hold lecture recitals in the United States, where he played Beethoven's G-major concert in Philadelphia and Boston, directed by [[Karl Muck]]. In 1909 Neitzel directed Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]] and his [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]. Because of its success Muck encouraged him to direct the orchestra, but Neitzel rejected the offer.\n\nIn 1910 Neitzel tried out a new technical facility for recording music for the second time: The Welter-Grand-Piano, with whom he recorded some of the \"Davidsb\u00fcndler T\u00e4nze\" by Robert Schumann on paper-tape-rolls. (C) He was acquainted with Richard Wagner and Richard Strau\u00df, who he supported. In 1919 he became member of the Preu\u00dfische Akademie der K\u00fcnste in Berlin. He held a chair as a professor. He died on 10 March 1920 in Cologne, where he left behind four daughters. One became a piano player and another played harp in an orchestra.\nNeitzel wrote plays and published steadily: His work enfolds 6 operas and several music pieces for piano. Among them adaptions for piano, like \"The spanisch dances\" from Sarasate, 1878. As an author for music literature he had written several opera guides including one about Richard Wagner, books about Beethovens symphony's and about Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. His entertaining style of writing is exemplified  in \"Out of my musical potofolio\" (\"Aus meiner musikanten-Mappe\").\n\nThe K\u00f6lnische Zeitung reports on 27 January 1890 from Neitzels music record: \"Herr Wangemann, the real Edison apostle who received the honor of demonstrating his instruments to the German Kaiser invites local musicians and music-lovers to see and listen to the phonograph, which he exhibits at Ibach & Son at the New Market. It maybe that the handling was not always accurate, but with the fresh made cylinders there was nearly nothing to hear of the mentioned disturbing, abnormal sounds. A recorded piano rendering by the phonograph resulted the truest details, delicacy nuances, every blue and every false note. A gypsy band and a Vienna tenor were clearly audible on earlier cylinders. The mashine, that was not shown a greater audience, was specially prepared for musical recitals\".  (B)\nOriginal Article:\n(\"Herr Wangemann, der echte Edison Apostel, der n\u00e4mliche, welcher die Ehre hatte, dem deutschen Kaiser seine Apparate vorzuf\u00fchren, beehrte einige hiesige Musiker und Musikfreunde mit Einladungen zur Besichtigung und Anh\u00f6rung seines bei Ibach Sohn am Neumarkt aufgestellten Phonographen. Es scheint doch wohl, da\u00df die Handhabung dieses Instruments nicht immer mit der n\u00f6tigen Sorgfalt betrieben wird; denn von den sonst erw\u00e4hnten Nebenger\u00e4uschen war namentlich an den frisch angefertigten Cylindern kaum etwas zu sp\u00fcren.

In this description, the natural observables are connectivities of clusters, i.e. probabilities that a number of points belong to the same cluster. \nThe Ising model can then be viewed as the case <math>q=2</math> of the <math>q</math>-state [[Potts model]], whose parameter <math>q</math> can vary continuously, and is related to the central charge of the [[Virasoro algebra]]. \n\nIn the critical limit, connectivities of clusters have the same behaviour under conformal transformations as correlation functions of the spin operator. Nevertheless, connectivities do not coincide with spin correlation functions: for example, the three-point connectivity does not vanish, while <math>\\langle\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\rangle=0</math>. There are four independent four-point connectivities, and their sum coincides with <math>\\langle\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\rangle</math>.<ref name=\"dv11\"/> Other combinations of four-point connectivities are not known analytically. In particular they are not related to correlation functions of the minimal model,<ref name=\"dv10\"/> although they are related to the <math> q\\to 2</math> limit of spin correlators in the <math>q</math>-state Potts model.<ref name=\"dv11\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"dv10\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=On three-point connectivity in two-dimensional percolation | website=arXiv.org | date=2010-09-07 | doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/3/032001 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1314v1 | access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"dv11\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=Potts q-color field theory and scaling random cluster model | website=arXiv.org | date=2011-04-21 | doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2011.06.012 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4323v2 | access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"cgl20\">{{cite web | last=Cheng | first=Miranda C.

The image of the spin operator <math>\\sigma</math> under this duality is a disorder operator <math>\\mu</math>, which has the same left and right conformal dimensions <math>(\\Delta_\\mu,\\bar\\Delta_\\mu) = (\\Delta_\\sigma,\\bar \\Delta_\\sigma)=(\\tfrac{1}{16},\\tfrac{1}{16})</math>.

In this description, the natural observables are connectivities of clusters, i.e. probabilities that a number of points belong to the same cluster. \nThe Ising model can then be viewed as the case <math>q=2</math> of the <math>q</math>-state [[Potts model]], whose parameter <math>q</math> can vary continuously, and is related to the central charge of the [[Virasoro algebra]]. \n\nIn the critical limit, connectivities of clusters have the same behaviour under conformal transformations as correlation functions of the spin operator. Nevertheless, connectivities do not coincide with spin correlation functions: for example, the three-point connectivity does not vanish, while <math>\\langle\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\rangle=0</math>. There are four independent four-point connectivities, and their sum coincides with <math>\\langle\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\rangle</math>.<ref name=\"dv11\"/> Other combinations of four-point connectivities are not known analytically. In particular they are not related to correlation functions of the minimal model,<ref name=\"dv10\"/> although they are related to the <math> q\\to 2</math> limit of spin correlators in the <math>q</math>-state Potts model.<ref name=\"dv11\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"dv10\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=On three-point connectivity in two-dimensional percolation | website=arXiv.org | date=2010-09-07 | doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/3/032001 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1314v1 | access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"dv11\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=Potts q-color field theory and scaling random cluster model | website=arXiv.org | date=2011-04-21 | doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2011.06.012 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4323v2 | access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"cgl20\">{{cite web | last=Cheng | first=Miranda C.

The river crossed by the original bridge, which gave the town its name, is the [[River Ogmore]], but the [[River Ewenny]] also passes to the south of the town.\n\n[[Historic counties of Wales|Historically]] a part of [[Glamorgan]], Bridgend has greatly expanded in size since the early 1980s \u2013 the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] recorded a population of 39,429 for the town<ref name=census /> and the 2011 census reported that the Bridgend Local Authority had a population of 139,200 \u2013 up from 128,700 in 2001. This 8.2% increase was the largest increase in Wales except for Cardiff. The town is undergoing a redevelopment project, with the town centre mainly pedestrianised and ongoing works including Brackla Street Centre redevelopment to Bridgend Shopping Centre, Rhiw Car Park redevelopment, ongoing public realm improvements and the upgrade of the Bridgend Life Centre and demolition of Sunnyside offices to accommodate a large retirement complex.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Prehistoric and Roman===\n\nSeveral [[prehistoric]] burial mounds have been found in the vicinity of Bridgend, suggesting that the area was settled before [[Roman times]]. The [[A48 road|A48]] between Bridgend and [[Cowbridge]] has a portion, known locally as \"Crack Hill\", a [[Roman road]] and the 'Golden Mile' where it is believed Roman soldiers were lined up to be paid. The [[Vale of Glamorgan]] would have been a natural low-level route west to the [[Roman fort]] and harbour at [[Neath]] (''[[Nidum]]'') from settlements in the east like Cardiff and [[Caerleon]] (''Isca'').\n\n===Norman invasion===\n[[File:Newcastle Castle Bridgend.jpg|thumb|right|Front view of Newcastle Castle Bridgend]]\nIn the decades after the [[Norman conquest]] of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] in 1066, the [[Normans]] looked westwards to create new seats for lords loyal to [[William the Conqueror]]. Groups of Norman barons arrived in Wales, and in the south and east created what would later become the [[Welsh Marches]], while the north and west remained largely unconquered.\n\nAt [[Coity]], the local Welsh chieftain Morgan Gam already had a stronghold. Sometime in the 11th century, Norman Lord Payn de Turberville approached Morgan to turn over control of [[Coity Castle]] to Turberville. Morgan Gam agreed, on condition that Turberville either fought Morgan for the land, or took Gam's daughter Sybil's hand in marriage. Turberville married Sybil and became Lord of Coity, and rebuilt the castle.\n\n[[Newcastle Castle, Bridgend|Newcastle Castle]] (on Newcastle Hill, overlooking the town centre, 1106) and [[Ogmore Castle]] (1116) were built by [[Robert Fitzhamon]] and [[William de Londres]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/93036/details/NEWCASTLE+CASTLE%2C+BRIDGEND/ | title=Newcastle Castle, Bridgend |  work=Coflein | publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Wales | date=11 March 2008 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/93019/details/OGMORE+CASTLE/ | title=Ogmore Castle | work=Coflein | publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Wales | date=10 March 2008 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> About {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} north-east of [[Ogmore Castle]], Maurice de Londres founded the fortified [[Benedictine]] [[Ewenny Priory]] in 1141.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewenny.org.uk/ |title=Ewenny and St Brides Major \u2013 Parish Control |publisher=Ewenny.org.uk |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThese three castles provided a \"defensive triangle\" for the area \u2013 a quadrilateral if Ewenny Priory is included.\n\n===Early development===\nBridgend developed at a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] on the [[River Ogmore]], which was on the main route between east and [[west Wales]]. Just north of the town is the confluence of three rivers, the Ogmore, the [[River Llynfi|Llynfi]], and the [[Afon Garw|Garw]]. South of Bridgend, the River Ewenny merges with the River Ogmore and flows into the [[Bristol Channel]]. In the 15th century, a stone bridge was built as a permanent connection between the two sides of the Ogmore (and was later rebuilt). Originally, this bridge had four arches, but in the 18th century, a massive flood washed two of them away. The rest of the bridge still stands and remains a focal point of the town: aesthetic restoration took place in 2006.\n\nBridgend grew rapidly into an agricultural town. It became an important [[market town]], a status it retained until the late 20th century.\n\n===Industrial era===\nThe discovery of [[coal]] in the [[South Wales Valleys]] north of Bridgend had a massive impact on the town. The first [[coal mining]] operations opened north of Bridgend in the 17th century; the Llynfi Valley was the first to be industrialised. Bridgend itself never had coal deposits and remained a market town for some time, but the valleys of the three rivers grew into an important part of the [[South Wales coalfield]]s. [[Ironworks]] and brickworks (notably at [[Tondu]]) were also established in the same period by [[John Bedford]], although the ironworks faltered after his death and ceased operating entirely in 1836.\n\nThe [[Great Western Railway]] arrived and Bridgend was at the junction between the main [[London]] to [[Fishguard]] line and the branch to the three valleys. Frequent coal trains took coal down the valleys; and when the Vale of Glamorgan railway opened, coal could be sent directly to port at [[Barry, Wales|Barry]] or via other branch lines to [[Porthcawl]].\n\nSeveral [[quarry|quarries]] opened in and around Bridgend town centre; some remnants of these can still be seen today near Brackla. An engine works was opened in the town and a larger farmers' market also opened in the town centre, where it remained until the 1970s.\n\nIn 1801, the population of what is now Bridgend County was around 6000. By the beginning of the 20th century this had risen to 61,000. By this time Bridgend was a bustling market town with prosperous valleys to the north, a thriving community and good links to other towns and cities.\n\n===Second World War===\nIn the [[Second World War]], Bridgend had a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) camp at [[Island Farm]] and a large [[munitions]] factory ([[ROF Bridgend]] \u2013 known as the \"Admiralty\") at [[Waterton, Bridgend|Waterton]], as well as a large underground munitions storage base at [[Brackla]] (known as the 8Xs). This was an overspill of the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]].\n\nAt its peak, the arsenal had 40,000 workers, many of them women. Large numbers of them were transported by bus from the [[Rhondda]] and the valleys.\n\nThe factory complex had three sites in Bridgend, all linked together by a large network of railways. Many reminders of the factory sites remain to this day \u2013 [http://www.bracklaordnance.co.uk/ Brackla Ordnance Site].\n\nIn March 1945, 87 POWs from [[Island Farm]] escaped through a tunnel, but all were recaptured.<ref>{{cite journal | year=2017 |last1=Rees-Hughes |first1=L |last2=Pringle |first2=JK |last3=Russill |first3=N |last4=Wisniewski |first4=K |last5=Doyle |first5=P |title=Multi-disciplinary investigations at PoW Camp 198, Bridgend, S.

Two of the munitions-storage magazines in the Brackla ROF site were converted to a regional government headquarters during the [[Cold War]] as part of the UK [[continuity of government]] plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/b/brackla/index.html |title=Brackla RGHQ |publisher=Subbrit.org.uk |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> It is now in the hands of a private company.\n\n===After the war===\nBridgend remained a solid market town after the war. In 1948, Newbridge Fields (a short distance from the town centre) hosted the 1948 [[National Eisteddfod]].\n\nIn 1960, the River Ogmore burst its banks and flooded the town centre. Subsequent floods and extreme weather led the [[Welsh Water]] Authority to develop concrete flood defence walls along the banks of the River Ogmore in the town centre. The town centre has not been flooded since. During this time, Bridgend was chosen to become the headquarters for [[South Wales Police]]. This action was ideal as geographically, Bridgend stands equidistantly between Swansea to the west and Cardiff to the east.\n\nThe [[Beeching cuts]] of the 1960s had the loss of passenger rail links in the Vale of Glamorgan and to the northern valleys. The Vale of Glamorgan link to [[Barry, Wales|Barry]] via [[Rhoose]] was reinstated in June 2005.\n\nIn the 1970s, Bridgend began to see the catalyst of arguably its biggest growth period. The \"missing section\" of the [[M4 motorway]] was constructed around the town, plans were afoot to change the Waterton Admiralty into an industrial estate, and the water supply was improved including new [[sewage treatment]] works near [[Ogmore-by-Sea|Ogmore]]. Two major multinational [[corporation]]s, the [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[Sony]], set up factories in or on the outskirts of the new [[Bridgend Industrial Estate]] (former Waterton Arsenal).\n\nThe development of the Brackla Housing Estate in the 1980s, housing developments at Broadlands to the south-west of the town centre and the continuing expansion of Brackla to the north-east have caused Bridgend's population to swell dramatically. Due to this, traffic congestion and a lack of parking facilities within the town have become important issues in the area. In 1997, a new link road/[[bypass route|bypass]] was built to link the town centre directly to the M4 motorway, as well as redirect traffic around the town centre.\n\nA new [[Securicor]]-operated prison ([[Parc (HM Prison)|HM Parc Prison]]) was built near Coity in the late 1990s. The prison opened in November 1997.\n\nThe [[Bridgend Designer Outlet|McArthur Glen Designer Outlet]] opened in 1998.\n\n===New millennium===\n\n[[Objective 1]] investment in regeneration and public realm improvements has led to the pedestrianisation of the town centre and the restoration of some buildings.<ref>[http://www.bridgend.gov.uk/web/groups/public/documents/services/048214.hcsp#TopOfPage Town Centre Streetscene] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427232245/http://www.bridgend.gov.uk/web/groups/public/documents/services/048214.hcsp#TopOfPage |date=27 April 2011 }} Bridgend County Council</ref> Some local traders have argued that this has damaged trade due to a lack of access by taxis and the disabled.<ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/bridgend-maesteg/2009/06/25/angry-trader-calls-for-town-centre-shutdown-to-bring-back-traffic-91466-23967031/ Angry trader calls for town centre \u2018shutdown\u2019 to bring back traffic] WalesOnline 25 June 2009</ref> Car parking provision and pricing have also been a concern to retailers with calls for free or reduced-price parking to increase town centre visits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/bridgend-maesteg/2009/01/22/free-parking-may-tempt-shoppers-back-into-town-91466-22747583/ |title=Free parking may tempt shoppers back into town|publisher=WalesOnline |date=22 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nTo counteract the dominance of [[Tesco]] in the area, [[Asda]] were granted planning permission for a new superstore near the town centre.

The club has also hosted international matches at women and age grade.\n\n'''Bridgend Athletic'''\n[[Bridgend Athletic RFC]] was reformed in 1972, after the Bridgend Youth team members in that year wanted to form a senior team so they didn't have to go their separate ways into senior rugby, hence the formation of the club which had previously existed up to 1939. The club become full members of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1983.

However, they were dissolved after one season due to financial problems that had plagued the club. Pontypridd RFC had sold their share of the region early on due to their own financial difficulties, with the remaining share which had been owned by Bridgend RFC, being sold off to the Welsh Rugby Union at the end of the season. This led to the winding up of the Celtic Warriors region by the WRU, as there was not enough money to keep the region afloat.<ref>{{cite news|title=WRU axe falls on Warriors|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/welsh/3754959.stm|work=BBC Website|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref> There were high points for the region: 10,000 turned up to watch them face European champions-in-waiting [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]] and even beat the Wasps 9\u201314<ref>{{cite news|title=Wasps stung by try on the Celtic fringe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jan/12/rugbyunion.heinekencup2003044|newspaper=Guardian|accessdate=14 October 2013|date=12 January 2004}}</ref> at [[Adams Park|Adam's Park]] a week earlier.

Although the Ospreys play their home matches at the [[Liberty Stadium]] in Swansea, since 2010 they have played their home Anglo-Welsh Cup home games at the Brewery Field, which is normally two games a season.\n\n===Soccer===\n\nBridgend had two [[association football|football]] teams, [[Bridgend Town A.F.C.]], and a Bridgend suburb side [[Bryntirion Athletic F.C.]] that played in the [[Welsh Football League First Division]].

One year on they were refused permission to continue playing at the Brewery Field in the middle of the season. They were then aided by Porthcawl RFC and staged the remaining 2006 home games at the Porthcawl ground. Subsequently, Porthcawl RFC have become their regular home and have even staged an amateur rugby league international there during 2008 (Wales v Ireland).\n\n===Other sports===\nBridgend has local [[cricket]] clubs including Bridgend Town CC and Great Western CC, a men's and women's [[hockey]] club, [[golf]] courses and [[tennis]] & [[bowls]] facilities at the local club, the Bridgend Lawn Tennis and Bowls Association.\n\n==Notable people==\n:''See [[:Category:People from Bridgend]] and [[:Category:People from Bridgend County Borough]]''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Gerald Battrick]] (tennis player)\n* [[Jonathan Brown (Welsh footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] (footballer)\n* [[Downtown Julie Brown]] (actress)\n* [[Steve Brace]] (Olympic marathon runner)\n* [[Paul Burston]] (author and journalist)\n* [[Lee Byrne]] (rugby player)\n* [[Nicole Cooke]] (cyclist)\n* [[Peter Cottrell]] (historian and writer)\n* [[The Featherz|Danie Centric]] (singer)\n* [[Matt Crowell]] (footballer)\n* [[Aled Davies (athlete)|Aled Davies]] (Paralympian)\n* [[Deddie Davies]] (actor)\n* [[Rhys Davies (golfer)|Rhys Davies]] (European Tour golfer)\n* [[Rhys Day]] (footballer)\n* [[Ryan Day (snooker player)|Ryan Day]] (snooker player)\n* [[Leondre Devries]] (rapper)\n* [[Mark Donovan]] (actor)\n* [[Huw Edwards (journalist)|Huw Edwards]] (journalist and newsreader)\n* [[Rhian Edwards (poet)|Rhian Edwards]] (poet)\n* [[David Emanuel (fashion designer)|David Emanuel]] (fashion designer)\n* [[Scott Gibbs]] (rugby player)\n* [[Ray Giles]] (rugby player)\n* [[Mike Hall (rugby union)|Michael Hall]] (rugby player)\n* [[Gavin Henson]] (rugby player)\n* [[Robert Howley]] (rugby player)\n* [[Jonathan Humphreys]] (rugby player)\n* [[Dafydd James]] (rugby player)\n* [[Marc Jenkins]] (Olympic triathlete)\n* [[Alex Jones (cricketer)|Alex Jones]] (cricketer)\n* [[Carwyn Jones]] (politician, [[First Minister of Wales]])\n* [[Ruth Jones]] (actress)\n* [[Amanda Levete]] (architect)\n* [[Jayce Lewis]] (musician/producer)\n* [[Gareth Llewellyn]] (Rugby player)\n* [[Sean McCarthy (footballer)|Sean McCarthy]] (footballer)\n* [[Howard Marks]] (drug smuggler and author)\n* [[William Morgan (actuary)|William Morgan]] (physician, physicist and statistician) \n* Sir [[Morien Morgan]] (aeronautical engineer) \n* [[Josh Navidi]] (rugby player)\n* [[Alan Phillips (rugby)|Alan Phillips]] (rugby player)\n* [[Ben Phillips (rugby union)|Ben Phillips]] (rugby player) \n* [[Leeroy Reed]] (musician)\n* [[Billy Rees]] (footballer)\n* [[Nathan Stephens]] (Paralympian)\n* [[Steve Strange]] (singer)\n* [[Owen Teale]] (actor) \n* [[Gareth Thomas (rugby player)|Gareth Thomas]] (rugby player)\n* [[Helen Tucker]] (2008 World Triathlon champion)\n* [[Matthew Tuck]] (Singer)\n* [[Bradley Wadlan]] (cricketer)\n* [[Rhys Webb]] (rugby player)\n* [[David Williams (crime writer)|David Williams]] (crime writer)\n* [[J.

The river crossed by the original bridge, which gave the town its name, is the [[River Ogmore]], but the [[River Ewenny]] also passes to the south of the town.\n\n[[Historic counties of Wales|Historically]] a part of [[Glamorgan]], Bridgend has greatly expanded in size since the early 1980s \u2013 the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] recorded a population of 39,429 for the town<ref name=census /> and the 2011 census reported that the Bridgend Local Authority had a population of 139,200 \u2013 up from 128,700 in 2001. This 8.2% increase was the largest increase in Wales except for Cardiff. The town is undergoing a redevelopment project, with the town centre mainly pedestrianised and ongoing works including Brackla Street Centre redevelopment to Bridgend Shopping Centre, Rhiw Car Park redevelopment, ongoing public realm improvements and the upgrade of the Bridgend Life Centre and demolition of Sunnyside offices to accommodate a large retirement complex.\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Prehistoric and Roman===\n\nSeveral [[prehistoric]] burial mounds have been found in the vicinity of Bridgend, suggesting that the area was settled before [[Roman times]]. The [[A48 road|A48]] between Bridgend and [[Cowbridge]] has a portion, known locally as \"Crack Hill\", a [[Roman road]] and the 'Golden Mile' where it is believed Roman soldiers were lined up to be paid. The [[Vale of Glamorgan]] would have been a natural low-level route west to the [[Roman fort]] and harbour at [[Neath]] (''[[Nidum]]'') from settlements in the east like Cardiff and [[Caerleon]] (''Isca'').\n\n===Norman invasion===\n[[File:Newcastle Castle Bridgend.jpg|thumb|right|Front view of Newcastle Castle Bridgend]]\nIn the decades after the [[Norman conquest]] of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[England]] in 1066, the [[Normans]] looked westwards to create new seats for lords loyal to [[William the Conqueror]]. Groups of Norman barons arrived in Wales, and in the south and east created what would later become the [[Welsh Marches]], while the north and west remained largely unconquered.\n\nAt [[Coity]], the local Welsh chieftain Morgan Gam already had a stronghold. Sometime in the 11th century, Norman Lord Payn de Turberville approached Morgan to turn over control of [[Coity Castle]] to Turberville. Morgan Gam agreed, on condition that Turberville either fought Morgan for the land, or took Gam's daughter Sybil's hand in marriage. Turberville married Sybil and became Lord of Coity, and rebuilt the castle.\n\n[[Newcastle Castle, Bridgend|Newcastle Castle]] (on Newcastle Hill, overlooking the town centre, 1106) and [[Ogmore Castle]] (1116) were built by [[Robert Fitzhamon]] and [[William de Londres]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/93036/details/NEWCASTLE+CASTLE%2C+BRIDGEND/ | title=Newcastle Castle, Bridgend |  work=Coflein | publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Wales | date=11 March 2008 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/93019/details/OGMORE+CASTLE/ | title=Ogmore Castle | work=Coflein | publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Wales | date=10 March 2008 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> About {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} north-east of [[Ogmore Castle]], Maurice de Londres founded the fortified [[Benedictine]] [[Ewenny Priory]] in 1141.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewenny.org.uk/ |title=Ewenny and St Brides Major \u2013 Parish Control |publisher=Ewenny.org.uk |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThese three castles provided a \"defensive triangle\" for the area \u2013 a quadrilateral if Ewenny Priory is included.\n\n===Early development===\nBridgend developed at a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] on the [[River Ogmore]], which was on the main route between east and [[west Wales]]. Just north of the town is the confluence of three rivers, the Ogmore, the [[River Llynfi|Llynfi]], and the [[Afon Garw|Garw]]. South of Bridgend, the River Ewenny merges with the River Ogmore and flows into the [[Bristol Channel]]. In the 15th century, a stone bridge was built as a permanent connection between the two sides of the Ogmore (and was later rebuilt). Originally, this bridge had four arches, but in the 18th century, a massive flood washed two of them away. The rest of the bridge still stands and remains a focal point of the town: aesthetic restoration took place in 2006.\n\nBridgend grew rapidly into an agricultural town. It became an important [[market town]], a status it retained until the late 20th century.\n\n===Industrial era===\nThe discovery of [[coal]] in the [[South Wales Valleys]] north of Bridgend had a massive impact on the town. The first [[coal mining]] operations opened north of Bridgend in the 17th century; the Llynfi Valley was the first to be industrialised. Bridgend itself never had coal deposits and remained a market town for some time, but the valleys of the three rivers grew into an important part of the [[South Wales coalfield]]s. [[Ironworks]] and brickworks (notably at [[Tondu]]) were also established in the same period by [[John Bedford]], although the ironworks faltered after his death and ceased operating entirely in 1836.\n\nThe [[Great Western Railway]] arrived and Bridgend was at the junction between the main [[London]] to [[Fishguard]] line and the branch to the three valleys. Frequent coal trains took coal down the valleys; and when the Vale of Glamorgan railway opened, coal could be sent directly to port at [[Barry, Wales|Barry]] or via other branch lines to [[Porthcawl]].\n\nSeveral [[quarry|quarries]] opened in and around Bridgend town centre; some remnants of these can still be seen today near Brackla. An engine works was opened in the town and a larger farmers' market also opened in the town centre, where it remained until the 1970s.\n\nIn 1801, the population of what is now Bridgend County was around 6000. By the beginning of the 20th century this had risen to 61,000. By this time Bridgend was a bustling market town with prosperous valleys to the north, a thriving community and good links to other towns and cities.\n\n===Second World War===\nIn the [[Second World War]], Bridgend had a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) camp at [[Island Farm]] and a large [[munitions]] factory ([[ROF Bridgend]] \u2013 known as the \"Admiralty\") at [[Waterton, Bridgend|Waterton]], as well as a large underground munitions storage base at [[Brackla]] (known as the 8Xs). This was an overspill of the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]].\n\nAt its peak, the arsenal had 40,000 workers, many of them women. Large numbers of them were transported by bus from the [[Rhondda]] and the valleys.\n\nThe factory complex had three sites in Bridgend, all linked together by a large network of railways. Many reminders of the factory sites remain to this day \u2013 [http://www.bracklaordnance.co.uk/ Brackla Ordnance Site].\n\nIn March 1945, 87 POWs from [[Island Farm]] escaped through a tunnel, but all were recaptured.<ref>{{cite journal | year=2017 |last1=Rees-Hughes |first1=L |last2=Pringle |first2=JK |last3=Russill |first3=N |last4=Wisniewski |first4=K |last5=Doyle |first5=P |title=Multi-disciplinary investigations at PoW Camp 198, Bridgend, S.

Two of the munitions-storage magazines in the Brackla ROF site were converted to a regional government headquarters during the [[Cold War]] as part of the UK [[continuity of government]] plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/b/brackla/index.html |title=Brackla RGHQ |publisher=Subbrit.org.uk |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> It is now in the hands of a private company.\n\n===After the war===\nBridgend remained a solid market town after the war. In 1948, Newbridge Fields (a short distance from the town centre) hosted the 1948 [[National Eisteddfod]].\n\nIn 1960, the River Ogmore burst its banks and flooded the town centre. Subsequent floods and extreme weather led the [[Welsh Water]] Authority to develop concrete flood defence walls along the banks of the River Ogmore in the town centre. The town centre has not been flooded since. During this time, Bridgend was chosen to become the headquarters for [[South Wales Police]]. This action was ideal as geographically, Bridgend stands equidistantly between Swansea to the west and Cardiff to the east.\n\nThe [[Beeching cuts]] of the 1960s had the loss of passenger rail links in the Vale of Glamorgan and to the northern valleys. The Vale of Glamorgan link to [[Barry, Wales|Barry]] via [[Rhoose]] was reinstated in June 2005.\n\nIn the 1970s, Bridgend began to see the catalyst of arguably its biggest growth period. The \"missing section\" of the [[M4 motorway]] was constructed around the town, plans were afoot to change the Waterton Admiralty into an industrial estate, and the water supply was improved including new [[sewage treatment]] works near [[Ogmore-by-Sea|Ogmore]]. Two major multinational [[corporation]]s, the [[Ford Motor Company]] and [[Sony]], set up factories in or on the outskirts of the new [[Bridgend Industrial Estate]] (former Waterton Arsenal).\n\nThe development of the Brackla Housing Estate in the 1980s, housing developments at Broadlands to the south-west of the town centre and the continuing expansion of Brackla to the north-east have caused Bridgend's population to swell dramatically. Due to this, traffic congestion and a lack of parking facilities within the town have become important issues in the area. In 1997, a new link road/[[bypass route|bypass]] was built to link the town centre directly to the M4 motorway, as well as redirect traffic around the town centre.\n\nA new [[Securicor]]-operated prison ([[Parc (HM Prison)|HM Parc Prison]]) was built near Coity in the late 1990s. The prison opened in November 1997.\n\nThe [[Bridgend Designer Outlet|McArthur Glen Designer Outlet]] opened in 1998.\n\n===New millennium===\n\n[[Objective 1]] investment in regeneration and public realm improvements has led to the pedestrianisation of the town centre and the restoration of some buildings.<ref>[http://www.bridgend.gov.uk/web/groups/public/documents/services/048214.hcsp#TopOfPage Town Centre Streetscene] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427232245/http://www.bridgend.gov.uk/web/groups/public/documents/services/048214.hcsp#TopOfPage |date=27 April 2011 }} Bridgend County Council</ref> Some local traders have argued that this has damaged trade due to a lack of access by taxis and the disabled.<ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/bridgend-maesteg/2009/06/25/angry-trader-calls-for-town-centre-shutdown-to-bring-back-traffic-91466-23967031/ Angry trader calls for town centre \u2018shutdown\u2019 to bring back traffic] WalesOnline 25 June 2009</ref> Car parking provision and pricing have also been a concern to retailers with calls for free or reduced-price parking to increase town centre visits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/south-wales-news/bridgend-maesteg/2009/01/22/free-parking-may-tempt-shoppers-back-into-town-91466-22747583/ |title=Free parking may tempt shoppers back into town|publisher=WalesOnline |date=22 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nTo counteract the dominance of [[Tesco]] in the area, [[Asda]] were granted planning permission for a new superstore near the town centre. The store was opened on 31 March 2008 by the local MP, and players from [[Bridgend Ravens]]. Over 1500 customers were thought to have walked through the new doors to take a look around the new store.\n\nIn 2004, an award-winning new bus station was constructed and traffic movements around the town centre were altered. Local committees, together with the council, started to use the pedestrianisation of the town centre to its advantage, culminating in several fairs including Continental Markets, [[Celt]]ic Festivals, a small [[Mardi-Gras]], and seasonal markets and events. [[Bridgend County Borough Council|Bridgend Council]] estimated in 2009 that these events have brought 900,000 visitors to the town and generated around \u00a353 million for the local economy.<ref>[http://google.com/search?q=cache:YcYdu4Bu71AJ:www.bridgend.gov.uk/web/groups/public/documents/report/067339.doc+bridgend+council+footfall&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk Bridgend County Borough Council] Report to Town and Community Council Forum, 14 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:riverside walk.jpg|thumb|right|Riverside walk over the Ogmore 2009]]\nAbout \u00a32.5 million of European funding was used to create a \"riverside cafe culture\" by constructing a walkway along the [[River Ogmore]],<ref>[http://www.bridgend.gov.uk/web/groups/public/documents/services/048216.hcsp River Ogmore Walkway & Bridge, Bridgend] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185643/http://www.bridgend.gov.uk/web/groups/public/documents/services/048216.hcsp |date=24 July 2011 }} Bridgend County Borough Council</ref> which was completed in March 2009.\n\n===Future developments===\n[[File:cheapside 2009.jpg|thumb|left|Old Cheapside, which is being extensively renovated]]Construction on a 1500-home sustainable \"village\" at Parc Derwen near Coity began in 2011.

They have also played against international teams, New Zealand won on their visit in 1978, but Bridgend have beaten Italy, Western Samoa and Australia. The club has also hosted international matches at women and age grade.\n\n'''Bridgend Athletic'''\n[[Bridgend Athletic RFC]] was reformed in 1972, after the Bridgend Youth team members in that year wanted to form a senior team so they didn't have to go their separate ways into senior rugby, hence the formation of the club which had previously existed up to 1939. The club become full members of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1983. The club were promoted from Division 5 Central in 2001, were WRU Division Four East Champions in 2002, were then promoted from Division 3 to WRU Division Two West in 2003 through the league organisation and were promoted to Division 1 in 2004.

When regional rugby was enforced by the [[Welsh Rugby Union]], Bridgend RFC and Pontypridd RFC, who were both professional clubs at the time, merged to create the Celtic Warriors as one of the five new regional rugby teams in Wales.  However, they were dissolved after one season due to financial problems that had plagued the club. Pontypridd RFC had sold their share of the region early on due to their own financial difficulties, with the remaining share which had been owned by Bridgend RFC, being sold off to the Welsh Rugby Union at the end of the season. This led to the winding up of the Celtic Warriors region by the WRU, as there was not enough money to keep the region afloat.<ref>{{cite news|title=WRU axe falls on Warriors|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/welsh/3754959.stm|work=BBC Website|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref> There were high points for the region: 10,000 turned up to watch them face European champions-in-waiting [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]] and even beat the Wasps 9\u201314<ref>{{cite news|title=Wasps stung by try on the Celtic fringe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jan/12/rugbyunion.heinekencup2003044|newspaper=Guardian|accessdate=14 October 2013|date=12 January 2004}}</ref> at [[Adams Park|Adam's Park]] a week earlier.

Bridgend became part of this region following the demise of the Celtic Warriors.  Although the Ospreys play their home matches at the [[Liberty Stadium]] in Swansea, since 2010 they have played their home Anglo-Welsh Cup home games at the Brewery Field, which is normally two games a season.\n\n===Soccer===\n\nBridgend had two [[association football|football]] teams, [[Bridgend Town A.F.C.]], and a Bridgend suburb side [[Bryntirion Athletic F.C.]] that played in the [[Welsh Football League First Division]]. Bridgend Town AFC from 2009 played at The Brewery Field (The Football Club purchased The Brewery Field in 2009) as the club sold its ground at Coychurch Road ground due to works in conjunction with the new Asda store.\nIn 2013, the two clubs joined to form [[Pen-y-Bont F.C.]] who, following promotion in 2019, play in the [[Welsh Premier League]], the top level of Welsh football.

A staunch royalist, he retreated to the mountains near [[Belgrade]] when the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] overran [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in April 1941 and there he organized bands of guerrillas known as the [[Chetniks|Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army]].\n\nThe organisation is commonly known as the Chetniks, although the name of the organisation was later changed to the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland (JVUO, \u0408\u0412\u0423\u041e).{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=125}} Founded as the first Yugoslav [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement]], it was royalist and nationalist, as opposed to the other, [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] who were communist. Initially, the two groups operated in parallel, but by late 1941 began fighting each other in the attempt to gain control of post-war Yugoslavia. Many Chetnik groups [[Collaborationism|collaborated]] or established ''[[modus vivendi]]'' with the [[Axis powers]]. Mihailovi\u0107 himself collaborated with [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]] at the end of the war.  After the war, Mihailovi\u0107 was captured by the communists. He was [[Trial of Mihailovi\u0107 et al.|tried and convicted]] of [[high treason]] and [[war crimes]] by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|communist authorities]] of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]], and executed by [[firing squad]] in Belgrade. The nature and extent of his responsibility for collaboration and ethnic massacres remains controversial. On 14 May 2015, Mihailovi\u0107's verdict was overturned on appeal with the ruling showing that his trial amounted to a communist kangaroo court. The [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Serbia)|Supreme Court of Cassation]], and [[appellate court]] handed out the rulings. While some see this as a rehabilitation the courts did not go as far and only ruled on the previous trial without offering to retry the case. This was done to satisfy his offspring's legal rights to property which the ruling at his trial stripped from them. \n\n==Early life and military career==\n\nDragoljub \"Dra\u017ea\" Mihailovi\u0107 was born on 27 April 1893 in [[Ivanjica]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]] to Mihailo and Smiljana Mihailovi\u0107 (''n\u00e9e'' Petrovi\u0107).{{sfn|Mihailovi\u0107|1946|p=13}} His father was a [[court clerk]]. Orphaned at seven years of age, Mihailovi\u0107 was raised by his paternal uncle in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=13}} As both of his uncles were military officers, Mihailovi\u0107 himself joined the Serbian [[Military Academy (Serbia)|Military Academy]] in October 1910. He fought as a cadet in the [[Serbian Army]] during the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u201313 and was awarded the [[Silver Medal of Valor]] at the end of the [[First Balkan War]], in May 1913.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=26\u201327}} At the end of the [[Second Balkan War]], during which he mainly led operations along the [[Provisional Government of Albania|Albanian]] border, he was given the rank of second [[lieutenant]] as the top soldier in his class, ranked sixth at the Serbian military academy.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=26\u201327}} He served in [[World War I]] and was involved in the [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania|Serbian Army's retreat]] through [[Principality of Albania|Albania]] in 1915. He later received several decorations for his achievements on the [[Salonika Front]]. Following the war, he became a member of the Royal Guard of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] but had to leave his position in 1920 after taking part in a public argument between communist and nationalist sympathizers. He was subsequently stationed to [[Skopje]]. In 1921, he was admitted to the Superior Military Academy of Belgrade. In 1923, having finished his studies, he was promoted as an assistant to the [[Staff (military)|military staff]], along with the fifteen other best alumni of his promotion.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=45\u201349}} He was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] in 1930. That same year, he spent three months in [[Paris]], following classes at the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]]. Some authors claim that he met and befriended [[Charles de Gaulle]] during his stay, although there is no known evidence of this.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=55\u201356}} In 1935, he became a military [[attach\u00e9]] to the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and was stationed to [[Sofia]]. On 6 September 1935, he was promoted to the rank of [[colonel]]. Mihailovi\u0107 then came in contact with members of [[Zveno]] and considered taking part in a plot which aimed to provoke [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]]'s abdication and the creation of an alliance between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, but, being untrained as a spy, he was soon identified by Bulgarian authorities and was asked to leave the country. He was then appointed as an attach\u00e9 to [[Czechoslovakia]] in [[Prague]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nHis military career almost came to an abrupt end in 1939, when he submitted a report strongly criticizing the organization of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] ({{lang-sh|Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VKJ). Among his most important proposals were abandoning the defence of the northern frontier to concentrate forces in the mountainous interior; re-organizing the armed forces into [[Serb]], [[Croat]], and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] units in order to better counter subversive activities; and using mobile Chetnik units along the borders. [[Milan Nedi\u0107]], the Minister of the Army, was incensed by Mihailovi\u0107's report and ordered that he be confined to barracks for 30&nbsp;days.{{sfn|Trew|1998|pp=5\u20136}} Afterwards, Mihailovi\u0107 became a professor at Belgrade's [[staff college]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=66\u201368}} In the summer of 1940, he attended a function put on by the British military attach\u00e9 for the Association of Yugoslav Reserve NCOs. The meeting was seen as highly anti-Nazi in tone, and the German ambassador protested Mihailovi\u0107's presence. Nedi\u0107 once more ordered him confined to barracks for 30&nbsp;days as well as demoted and placed on the retired list. These last punishments were avoided only by Nedi\u0107's retirement in November and his replacement by [[Petar Pe\u0161i\u0107]].{{sfn|Trew|1998|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nIn the years preceding the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]], Mihailovi\u0107 was stationed in [[Celje]], [[Drava Banovina]] (modern [[Slovenia]]). At the time of the invasion, Colonel Mihailovi\u0107 was an assistant to the chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav [[2nd Army (Yugoslavia)|Second Army]] in northern Bosnia. He briefly served as the Second Army chief-of-staff{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=53}} prior to taking command of a \"Rapid Unit\" (''brzi odred'') shortly before the Yugoslav High Command capitulated to the Germans on 17 April 1941.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n==World War II==\n\nFollowing the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]], a small group of officers and soldiers led by Mihailovi\u0107 escaped in the hope of finding VKJ units still fighting in the mountains. After skirmishing with several [[Usta\u0161e]] and Muslim bands and attempting to sabotage several objects, Mihailovi\u0107 and about 80 of his men crossed the [[Drina River]] into [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied Serbia]]{{efn|name=Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia}} on 29 April.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=13}} Mihailovi\u0107 planned to establish an underground intelligence movement and establish contact with the Allies, though it is unclear if he initially envisioned to start an actual armed resistance movement.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=54}}\n\n===Formation of the Chetniks===\n\n{{See also|Uprising in Serbia (1941)}}\n\n[[File:Chetniks Flag.svg|thumb|The Chetnik flag. The flag reads: \"For King and Fatherland \u2013 [[Give me Liberty, or give me Death!|Liberty or Death]]\".]]\n\nFor the time being, Mihailovi\u0107 established a small nucleus of officers with an armed guard, which he called the \"Command of Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=54}} After arriving at [[Ravna Gora (highland)|Ravna Gora]] in early May 1941, he realized that his group of seven officers and twenty-four non-commissioned officers and soldiers was the only one.{{sfn|Freeman|2007|p=123}} He began to draw up lists of conscripts and reservists for possible use. His men at Ravna Gora were joined by a group of civilians, mainly intellectuals from the [[Serbian Cultural Club]], who took charge of the movement's propaganda sector.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=54}}\n\nThe [[Chetniks of Kosta Pe\u0107anac|Chetniks]] of [[Kosta Pe\u0107anac]], which were already in existence before the invasion, did not share Mihailovi\u0107's desire for resistance.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=21}} In order to distinguish his Chetniks from other groups calling themselves Chetniks, Mihailovi\u0107 and his followers identified themselves as the \"Ravna Gora movement\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=21}} The stated goal of the Ravna Gora movement was the liberation of the country from the occupying armies of Germany, Italy and the [[Usta\u0161e]], and the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-sh|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}, NDH).{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=21\u201322}}\n\nMihailovi\u0107 spent most of 1941 consolidating scattered VKJ remnants and finding new recruits. In August, he set up a civilian advisory body, the Central National Committee, composed of Serb political leaders including some with strong nationalist views such as [[Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107]] and [[Stevan Moljevi\u0107]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=21\u201322}} On 19 June, a clandestine Chetnik courier reached [[Istanbul]], whence royalist Yugoslavs reported that Mihailovi\u0107 appeared to be organizing a resistance movement against Axis forces.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=22}} Mihailovi\u0107 first established radio contact with the British in September 1941, when his radio operator raised a ship in the [[Mediterranean]]. On 13 September, Mihailovi\u0107's first radio message to [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]]'s [[Yugoslav government-in-exile|government-in-exile]] announced that he was organizing VKJ remnants to fight against the Axis powers.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=22}}\n\nMihailovi\u0107 also received help from officers in other areas of Yugoslavia, such as Slovene officer [[Rudolf Perinhek]], who brought reports on the situation in Montenegro. Mihailovi\u0107 sent him back to Montenegro with written authorization to organize units there, with the oral approval of officers such as [[\u0110or\u0111ije La\u0161i\u0107]], [[Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]], [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]] and [[Kosta Mu\u0161icki]]. Mihailovi\u0107 only gave vague and contradictory orders to Perinhek, mentioning the need to put off civil strife and to \"remove enemies\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=79}}\n\nMihailovi\u0107's strategy was to avoid direct conflict with the Axis forces, intending to rise up after Allied forces arrived in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=26}} Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks had had defensive encounters with the Germans, but reprisals and the tales of the massacres in the NDH made them reluctant to engage directly in armed struggle, except against the Usta\u0161e in Serbian border areas.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=59}} In the meantime, following the Axis [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ), led by [[Josip Broz Tito]], also went into action and called for a popular insurrection against the Axis powers in July 1941. Tito subsequently set up a communist resistance movement known as the [[Yugoslav Partisans]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=56}} By the end of August, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks and the Partisans began attacking Axis forces, sometimes jointly despite their mutual diffidence, and captured numerous prisoners.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=60}} On 28 October 1941 Mihailovi\u0107 received an order from the Prime Minister of the Yugoslav Government in exile [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] who urged Mihailovi\u0107 to avoid premature actions and avoid reprisals.<ref>{{harv|Karchmar|1973|p=241}}</ref> Mihailovi\u0107 discouraged sabotage due to German reprisals (such as more than 3,000 killed in [[Kraljevo]] and [[Kragujevac]]) unless some great gain could be accomplished. Instead, he favoured sabotage that could not easily be traced back to the Chetniks.{{sfn|Freeman|2007|pp=124\u2013126}} His reluctance to engage in more active resistance meant that most sabotage carried out in the early period of the war were due to efforts by the Partisans, and Mihailovi\u0107 lost several commanders and a number of followers who wished to fight the Germans to the Partisan movement.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nEven though Mihailovi\u0107 initially asked for discreet support, propaganda from the British and from the Yugoslav government-in-exile quickly began to exalt his feats. The creation of a resistance movement in occupied Europe was received as a morale booster. On 15 November, the [[BBC]] announced that Mihailovi\u0107 was the commander of the ''Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland'', which became the official name of Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=64}}\n\n===Conflicts with Axis troops and Partisans===\n\n[[File:Mihailovi\u0107 poternica 1941.jpg|thumb|Nazi wanted poster for Colonel Mihailovi\u0107 from 9 December 1941]]\n\n[[File:Cetnik-2.jpg|thumb|1942 German proclamation and reward offer for Mihailovi\u0107, after the Chetnik killing of four German officers]]\n\n[[File:Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 propaganda poster.jpg|thumb|Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 as a small pet in the hands of the supposedly [[Jews|Jewish]]-controlled [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Soviet Union]] as part of [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory]], depicted in a poster from the [[Grand Anti-Masonic Exhibition]] ]]\n\nMihailovi\u0107 soon realized that his men did not have the means to protect Serbian civilians against German reprisals.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=63}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=148}} The prospect of reprisals also fed Chetnik concerns regarding a possible takeover of Yugoslavia by the Partisans after the war, and they did not wish to engage in actions that might ultimately result in a post-war Serb minority.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=48}} Mihailovi\u0107's strategy was to bring together the various Serb bands and build an organization capable of seizing power after the Axis withdrew or were defeated, rather than engaging in direct confrontation with them.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=15\u201316}} In contrast to the reluctance of Chetnik leaders to directly engage the Axis forces, the Partisans advocated open resistance, which appealed to those Chetniks desiring to fight the occupation.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=21}} By September 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 began losing men to the Partisans, such as Vlado Ze\u010devi\u0107 (a priest), Lieutenant Ratko Martinovi\u0107, and the [[Cer (mountain)|Cer]] Chetniks led by Captain [[Dragoslav Ra\u010di\u0107]]{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=21}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=141}}\n\nOn 19 September 1941, Tito met with Mihailovi\u0107 to negotiate an alliance between the Partisans and Chetniks, but they failed to reach an agreement as the disparity of the aims of their respective movements was great enough to preclude any real compromise.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=140}} Tito was in favour of a joint full-scale offensive, while Mihailovi\u0107 considered a general uprising to be premature and dangerous, as he thought it would trigger reprisals.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=63}} For his part, Tito's goal was to prevent an assault from the rear by the Chetniks, as he was convinced that Mihailovi\u0107 was playing a \"double game\", maintaining contacts with German forces via the Nedi\u0107 government.

While Mihailovi\u0107 approved the destruction of communist forces, he aimed to exploit the connections of Chetniks commanders with the Italians to get food, arms and ammunition in the expectation of an Allied landing in the Balkans. On 1 December, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 organised a Chetnik \"youth conference\" at \u0160ahovi\u0107i. The congress, which historian [[Stevan K.

Mihailovi\u0107 and \u0110ukanovi\u0107 did not attend the event, which was entirely dominated by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, but they sent representatives.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=110\u2013112}} In the same month, Mihailovi\u0107 informed his subordinates that: \"The units of the Partisans are filled with thugs of the most varied kinds, such as Usta\u0161as&nbsp;\u2013 the worst butchers of the Serb people&nbsp;\u2013 Jews, Croats, Dalmatians, Bulgarians, Turks, Magyars, and all the other nations of the world.\"{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=161}}\n\n[[File:Predrag Rakovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|right|British Brigadier [[Charles Armstrong (soldier)|Charles Armstrong]] visits the 2nd Ravna Gora Corps in the fall of 1943.

Italian commander [[Mario Roatta]] aimed to spare Italian lives, but also to counter the Usta\u0161e and Germans, to undermine Mihailovi\u0107's authority among the Chetniks by playing up local leaders. Chetniks, led by [[Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107]], came from Montenegro to help the Bosnian Serb population against the Usta\u0161e. They murdered and pillaged in [[Fo\u010da]] until the Italians intervened in August. The Chetniks also asked the Italians for protection against Usta\u0161e retribution. On 22 July, Mihailovi\u0107 met with Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin, Jev\u0111evi\u0107, and his newly appointed delegate in Herzegovina, [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]]. The meeting was supposedly secret, but was known to Italian intelligence. Mihailovi\u0107 gave no precise orders but expressed his confidence in both his subordinates, adding, according to Italian reports, that he was waiting for help from the Allies to start a real guerrilla campaign, in order to spare Serb lives. Summoned by Roatta upon their return, Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin and Jev\u0111evi\u0107 assured the Italian commander that Mihailovi\u0107 was merely a \"moral head\" and that they would not attack Italians, even if he should give such an order.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=122\u2013126}}\n\nHaving become more and more concerned with domestic enemies and concerned that he be in a position to control Yugoslavia after the Allies defeated the Axis, Mihailovi\u0107 concentrated from Montenegro on directing operations, in the various parts of Yugoslavia, mostly against Partisans, but also against the Usta\u0161e and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]]'s [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] (SDK).{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=67}} During the autumn of 1942, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks\u2014at the request of the British organization\u2014sabotaged several railway lines used to supply Axis forces in the [[Western Desert campaign|Western Desert]] of [[North African campaign|northern Africa]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=98}} In September and December, Mihailovi\u0107's actions damaged the railway system seriously; the Allies gave him credit for inconveniencing Axis forces and contributing to Allied successes in Africa.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=98\u2013100}} The credit given to Mihailovi\u0107 for sabotages was maybe undeserved:\n: ''But an S.O.E.

This prompted fighting between the Chetniks and followers of the Nedi\u0107 regime. The Germans, whom the Nedi\u0107 administration had called for help against Mihailovi\u0107, responded to Nedi\u0107's request and to the sabotages with mass terror, and attacked the Chetniks in late 1942 and early 1943.

Thousands of arrests were made and it has been estimated that during December 1942, 1,600 Chetnik combatants were killed by the Germans through combat actions and executions. These actions by the Nedi\u0107 regime and the Germans \"brought to an abrupt conclusion much of the anti-German action Mihailovi\u0107 had started up again since the summer (of 1942)\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=100}} [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote to [[Benito Mussolini]] on February 16, 1943, demanding that in addition to the partisans be pursued the chetniks who possessed \"a special danger in the long-term plans that Mihailovic's supporters were building.\" Hitler adds: \"In any case, the liquidation of the Mihailovic movement will no longer be an easy task, given the forces at its disposal and the large number of armed Chetniks\". At that time, General Mihailovic was with his Supreme Command in [[Montenegro]], which was under Italian occupation. From the beginning of 1943, General Mihailovic prepared his units for the supports of Allied landing on the [[Adriatic]] coast.

The report concluded that, while aid to Mihailovi\u0107 was as necessary as ever, it would be advisable to extend assistance to other resistance groups and to try to reunite the Chetniks and the Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=90\u201391}} British liaison officers reported in February that Mihailovi\u0107 had \"at no time\" been in touch with the Germans, but that his forces had been in some instances aiding the Italians against the Partisans (the report was simultaneous with [[Operation Trio]]). Bailey reported that Mihailovi\u0107 was increasingly dissatisfied with the insufficient help he was receiving from the British.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=91\u201392}} Mihailovi\u0107's movement had been so inflated by British propaganda that the liaison officers found the reality decidedly below expectations.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=167}}\n\nOn 3 January 1943, just before [[Case White]], an Axis conference was held in Rome, attended by German commander [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], NDH representatives, and by Jev\u0111evi\u0107 who, this time, collaborated openly with the Axis forces against the Partisans, and had gone to the conference without Mihailovi\u0107's knowledge. Mihailovi\u0107 disapproved of Jev\u0111evi\u0107's presence and reportedly sent him an angry message, but his actions were limited to announcing that Jev\u0111evi\u0107's military award would be withdrawn.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=164}} On 3 February 1943 [[Charles de Gaulle]] awarded Mihailovi\u0107 with [[Croix de Guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)|Croix de Guerre]], a French military decoration to honour people who fought with the Allies against the Axis forces at any time during World War II.<ref name=\"MiljusMilju\u01611982\">{{cite book|last=Miljus|first=Branko|title=La Revolution yougoslave. - &#91;Paris&#93;: L'Age d'homme (1982). 247 S. 8\u00b0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZjgQ55smgC&pg=PA127|year=1982|publisher=L'AGE D'HOMME|page=127|id=GGKEY:3ETA934ZGPG}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 1943, in Bailey's presence, Mihailovi\u0107 addressed his troops in [[Lipovo, Montenegro|Lipovo]]. Bailey reported that Mihailovi\u0107 had expressed his bitterness over \"[[perfidious Albion]]\" who expected the Serbs to fight to the last drop of blood without giving them any means to do so, had said that the Serbs were completely friendless, that the British were holding King Peter II and his government as virtual prisoners, and that he would keep accepting help from the Italians as long as it would give him the means to annihilate the Partisans. Also according to Bailey's report, he added that his enemies were the Usta\u0161e, the Partisans, the Croats and the Muslims and that only after dealing with them would he turn to the Germans and the Italians.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=92\u201393}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\nWhile defenders of Mihailovi\u0107 have argued that Bailey had mistranslated the speech,{{efn|name=speech translation}} and may have even done so intentionally,{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=162\u2013163}} the effect on the British was disastrous and marked the beginning of the end for British-Chetnik cooperation. The British officially protested to the Yugoslav government-in-exile and demanded explanations regarding Mihailovi\u0107's attitude and collaboration with the Italians. Mihailovi\u0107 answered to his government that he had had no meetings with Italian generals and that Jev\u0111evi\u0107 had no command to do so. The British announced that they would send him more abundant supplies.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=93\u201396}} Also in early 1943, the tone of the BBC broadcasts became more and more favourable to the Partisans, describing them as the only resistance movement in Yugoslavia, and occasionally attributing to them resistance acts actually undertaken by the Chetniks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=361}} Bailey complained to the Foreign Office that his position with Mihailovi\u0107 was being prejudiced by this.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=86}} The Foreign Office protested and the BBC apologized, but the line did not really change.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=86}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"In the internal struggles in the various occupied countries, the British press has in almost all cases sided with the faction favoured by the Russians and libelled the opposing faction, sometimes suppressing material evidence in order to do so.

The Russians, who had their own Jugoslav protege in Marshal Tito, accused Mihailovich of collaborating with the Germans. This accusation was promptly taken up by the British press: Mihailovich\u2019s supporters were given no chance of answering it, and facts contradicting it were simply kept out of print. In July of 1943 the Germans offered a reward of 100,000 gold crowns for the capture of Tito, and a similar reward for the capture of Mihailovich.

The Germans disapproved of this collaboration, about which Hitler personally wrote to Mussolini.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=103\u2013106}} At the end of February, shortly after his speech, Mihailovi\u0107 himself joined his troops in [[Herzegovina]] near the Neretva in order to try to salvage the situation. The Partisans nevertheless defeated the opposing Chetniks troops, who were in a state of disarray, and managed to go across the Neretva.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=159\u2013160}} In March, the Partisans negotiated a truce with Axis forces in order to gain some time and use it to defeat the Chetniks. While Ribbentrop and Hitler finally overruled the orders of their subordinates and forbade any such contacts, the Partisans benefited from this brief truce, during which Italian support for the Chetniks was suspended, and which allowed Tito's forces to deal a severe blow to Mihailovi\u0107's troops.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=161\u2013165}}\n\nIn May, the German intelligence service also tried to establish a contact with Mihailovi\u0107 to see if an alliance against the Partisans was possible. In [[Kola\u0161in]], they met with a Chetnik officer, who did not introduce himself. They assumed they had met the general himself, but the man was possibly not Mihailovi\u0107, whom [[William Bailey (soldier)|Bailey]] reported to be in another area at the same period. The German command, however, reacted strongly against any attempt at \"negotiating with the enemy\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\nThe Germans then turned to their next operation, code-named [[Case Black|Schwarz]], and attacked the Montenegrin Chetniks. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 appears to have suggested to Mihailovi\u0107 a short-term cooperation with the Germans against the Partisans, something Mihailovi\u0107 refused to condone. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 ended up defending his headquarters at Kola\u0161in against the Partisans. On 14 May, the Germans entered Kola\u0161in and captured \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, while Mihailovi\u0107 escaped.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=161\u2013165}}{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=106\u2013112}}\n\nIn late May, after regaining control of most of Montenegro, the Italians turned their efforts against the Chetniks, at least against Mihailovi\u0107's forces, and put a reward of half-a-million lire for the capture of Mihailovi\u0107, and one million for the capture of Tito.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=171}}\n\n==Allied support shifts==\n\nIn April and May 1943, the British sent a mission to the Partisans and strengthened their mission to the Chetniks. Major [[Jasper Rootham]], one of the liaison officers to the Chetniks, reported that engagements between Chetniks and Germans did occur, but were invariably started by German attacks. During the summer, the British sent supplies to both Chetniks and Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=117\u2013120}}\n\nMihailovi\u0107 returned to Serbia and his movement rapidly recovered its dominance in the region. Receiving more weapons from the British, he undertook a series of actions and sabotages, disarmed [[Serbian State Guard]] (SDS) detachments and skirmished with Bulgarian troops, though he generally avoided the Germans, considering that his troops were not yet strong enough. In Serbia, his organization controlled the mountains where Axis forces were absent. The collaborationist Nedi\u0107 administration was largely infiltrated by Mihailovi\u0107's men and many SDS troops being actually sympathetic to his movement. After his defeat in Case White, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to improve his organization. Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107, the movement's ideologue who had opposed the Italian connection and clashed with Mihailovi\u0107, left the supreme command. Mihailovi\u0107 tried to extend his contacts to Croats and traditional parties, and to revitalise his contacts in Slovenia.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=182\u2013186}} The [[United States]] sent liaison officers to join Bailey's mission with Mihailovi\u0107, while also sending men to Tito.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=138\u2013144}} The Germans, in the meantime, became worried by the growing strength of the Partisans and made local arrangements with Chetnik groups, though not with Mihailovi\u0107 himself. According to Walter R. Roberts, there is \"little doubt\" that Mihailovi\u0107 was aware of these arrangements and that he might have regarded them as the lesser of two evils, his primary aim being to defeat the Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nFrom the beginning of 1943, British impatience with Mihailovi\u0107 grew. From the decrypts of German wireless messages, Churchill and his government concluded that the Chetniks' collaboration with the Italians went beyond what was acceptable and that the Partisans were doing the most severe damage to the Axis.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nWith Italy's withdrawal from the war in September 1943, the Chetniks in Montenegro found themselves under attack by both the Germans and the Partisans, who took control of large parts of Montenegrin territory, including the former \"Chetnik capital\" of Kola\u0161in. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, having escaped from a German camp in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], found his way to Yugoslavia, was captured again, and was then asked by collaborationist prime minister Milan Nedi\u0107 to form a [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]] against the Partisans. He was pledged to Nedi\u0107, but also made a secret allegiance to Mihailovi\u0107. Both Mihailovi\u0107 and \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 expected a landing by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. In Serbia, Mihailovi\u0107 was considered the representative of the victorious Allies.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=192\u2013195}} In the chaotic situation created by the Italian surrender, several Chetnik leaders overtly collaborated with the Germans against the reinforced Partisans; approached by an Abwehr agent, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 offered the services of about 5,000 men. [[Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107]] also went to the Germans for cover against the Usta\u0161e and Partisans, although he was distrusted.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=204\u2013205}} In October 1943, Mihailovi\u0107, at the Allies' request, agreed to undertake two sabotage operations, which had the effect of making him even more of a wanted man and forced him, according to British reports, to change his headquarters frequently.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nBy November and December 1943, the Germans had realized that Tito was their most dangerous opponent; German representative [[Hermann Neubacher]] managed to conclude secret arrangements with four of Mihailovi\u0107's commanders for the cessation of hostilities for periods of five to ten weeks. The Germans interpreted this as a sign of weakness from the Mihailovi\u0107 movement. The truces were kept secret but came to the knowledge of the British through decrypts. There is no evidence that Mihailovi\u0107 had been involved or approved, though British Military Intelligence found it possible that he was \"conniving\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=197\u2013199}} At the end of October, the local signals decrypted in Cairo had disclosed that Mihailovi\u0107 had ordered all Chetnik units to co-operate with Germany against the Partisans.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993|p=358}} This order for cooperation was originally decrypted by Germans, and it was noted in the ''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'' War Journal.{{sfn|Schramm|1963|pp=1304}}{{efn|name=quote from KTB OKW}}\n\nThe British were more and more concerned about the fact that the Chetniks were more willing to fight Partisans than Axis troops. At the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|third Moscow Conference]] in October 1943, [[Anthony Eden]] expressed impatience about Mihailovi\u0107's lack of action.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=157\u2013160}} The report of [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]], liaison officer to the Partisans, convinced Churchill that Tito's forces were the most reliable resistance group. The report of Charles Armstrong, liaison officer to Mihailovi\u0107, arrived too late for Anthony Eden to take it to the [[Tehran Conference]] in late November 1943, though Stevan K. Pavlowitch thinks that it would probably been insufficient to change Churchill's mind. At Tehran, Churchill argued in favour of the Partisans, while [[Joseph Stalin]] expressed limited interest but agreed that they should receive the greatest possible support.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nOn 10 December, Churchill met King Peter II in London and told him that he possessed irrefutable proofs of Mihailovi\u0107's collaboration with the enemy and that Mihailovi\u0107 should be eliminated from the Yugoslav cabinet. Also in early December, Mihailovi\u0107 was asked to undertake an important sabotage mission against railways, which was later interpreted as a \"final opportunity\" to redeem himself. However, possibly not realizing how Allied policy had evolved, he failed to give the go-ahead.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=178\u2013180}} On 12 January 1944, the SOE in Cairo sent a report to the Foreign Office, saying that Mihailovi\u0107's commanders had collaborated with Germans and Italians and that Mihailovi\u0107 himself had condoned and in certain cases approved their actions. This hastened the British's decision to withdraw their thirty liaison officers to Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=197}} The mission was effectively withdrawn in the spring of 1944. In April, one month before leaving, liaison officer Brigadier Armstrong noted that Mihailovi\u0107 had been mostly active in propaganda against the Axis, that he had missed numerous occasions for sabotage in the last six or eight months and that the efforts of many Chetnik leaders to follow Mihailovi\u0107's orders for inactivity had evolved into non-aggression pacts with Axis troops, although the mission had no evidence of collaboration with the enemy.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=225}} \n\nIn the meantime, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to improve the organization of his movement. On 25 January 1944, with the help of [[\u017divko Topalovi\u0107]], he organized in [[Ba (Ljig)|Ba]], a village near Ravna Gora, the [[Ba Congress]] also meant to remove the shadow of the previous congress held in Montenegro. The congress was attended by 274 people, representing various parties, and aimed to be a reaction against the arbitrary behaviour of some commanders. The organization of a new, democratic, possibly federal, Yugoslavia, was mentioned, though the proposals remained vague, and an appeal was even made for the KPJ to join. The Chetnik command structure was formally reorganized. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was still in charge of Montenegro and \u0110uji\u0107 of Dalmatia, but Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was excluded. The Germans and Bulgarians reacted to the congress by conducting an operation against the Chetniks in northern Serbia in February, killing 80 and capturing 913.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=223\u2013226}}\n\nAfter May and the withdrawal of the British mission, Mihailovi\u0107 kept transmitting radio messages to the Allies and to his government but no longer received replies.\n\nIn July and August 1944, Mihailovi\u0107 ordered his forces to cooperate with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and 60th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS) in the successful rescue of hundreds downed Allied airmen between August and December 1944 in what was called [[Operation Halyard]];{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=245\u2013257}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=378}} for this, he was posthumously awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] by United States President [[Harry S. Truman]].  Details of this rescue mission are described in The Forgotten 500, by Gregory A. Freeman, published in 2007.  [http://www.gregoryafreeman.com/forgotten500.html]\n\nAccording to historian [[Marko Attila Hoare]], \"On other occasions, however, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks rescued German airmen and handed them over safely to the German armed forces&nbsp;... The Americans, with a weaker intelligence presence in the Balkans than the British, were less in touch with the realities of the Yugoslav civil war. They were consequently less than enthusiastic about British abandonment of the anti-communist Mihailovi\u0107, and more reserved toward the Partisans.\" Several Yugoslavs were also evacuated in Operation Halyard, along with Topalovi\u0107; they tried to raise more support abroad for Mihailovi\u0107's movement, but this came too late to reverse Allied policy.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=253\u2013254}} The United States also sent an intelligence mission to Mihailovi\u0107 in March, but withdrew it after Churchill advised Roosevelt that all support should go to Tito and that \"complete chaos\" would ensue if the Americans also backed Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=245\u2013257}}\n\nIn July, [[Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107]] formed the new Yugoslav government-in-exile, which did not include Mihailovi\u0107 as a minister. Mihailovi\u0107, however, remained the official chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav Army. On 29 August, upon the recommendation of his government, King Peter dissolved by royal decree the Supreme Command, therefore abolishing Mihailovi\u0107's post. On 12 September, King Peter broadcast a message from London, announcing the gist of 29 August's decree and calling upon all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to \"join the National Liberation Army under the leadership of Marshal Tito\". He also proclaimed that he strongly condemned \"the misuse of the name of the King and the authority of the Crown by which an attempt has been made to justify collaboration with the enemy\". Though the King did not mention Mihailovi\u0107, it was clear who he meant. According to his own account, Peter had obtained after strenuous talks with the British not to say a word directly against Mihailovi\u0107. The message had a devastating effect on the morale of the Chetniks. Many men left Mihailovi\u0107 after the broadcast; others remained out of loyalty to him.\n{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=258\u2013260}} Mihailovi\u0107 resented the fact that he was abandoned by his former allies and in August 1944 summed up his position by stating that:\n\n: ''\"More than three years ago I took up arms to fight for democracy against dictatorship in the form of nazism and fascism. In fighting for this cause there were ten occasions on which I almost lost my life. If I must die in fighting against a new form of dictatorship, I shall die, bitter because I have been deserted by those who profess to believe in democracy, but satisfied that I myself have fought bravely and honestly and have refused to compromise my cause.\"''{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=292}}\n\n==Defeat in 1944\u201345==\n\nAt the end of August 1944, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]] arrived on the eastern borders of Yugoslavia. In early September, it invaded Bulgaria and coerced it into turning against the Axis. Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks, meanwhile, were so badly armed to resist the Partisan incursions into Serbia that some of Mihailovi\u0107's officers, including [[Nikola Kalabi\u0107]], Ne\u0161ko Nedi\u0107 and Dragoslav Ra\u010di\u0107, met German officers on 11 August to arrange a meeting of Mihailovi\u0107 with Neubacher and to set forth the conditions for increased collaboration.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=342}} Nedi\u0107, in turn, apparently picked up the idea and suggested forming an army of united anti-communist forces; he arranged a secret meeting with Mihailovi\u0107, which apparently took place around 20 August. From the existing accounts, they met in a dark room and Mihailovi\u0107 remained mostly silent, so much so that Nedi\u0107 was not even sure afterwards that he had actually met the real Mihailovi\u0107. According to British official Stephen Clissold, Mihailovi\u0107 was initially very reluctant to go to the meeting, but was finally convinced by Kalabi\u0107. It appears that Nedi\u0107 offered to obtain arms from the Germans, and to place his Serbian State Guard under Mihailovi\u0107's command, possibly as part of an attempt to switch sides as Germany was losing the war.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=257\u2013258}} Neubacher favoured the idea, but it was vetoed by Hitler, who saw this as an attempt to establish an \"English fifth column\" in Serbia. According to Pavlowitch, Mihailovi\u0107, who was reportedly not enthusiastic about the proposal, and Nedi\u0107 might have been trying to \"exploit each other's predicaments\", while Nedi\u0107 may have considered letting Mihailovi\u0107 \"take over\". At the end of August, Mihailovi\u0107 also met an OSS mission, headed by Colonel [[Robert H. McDowell]], who stayed with him until November.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nAs the Red Army approached, Mihailovi\u0107 thought that the outcome of war would depend on [[Turkey]] entering the conflict, followed at last by an Allied incursion in the Balkans. He called upon all Yugoslavs to remain faithful to the King, and claimed that Peter had sent him a message telling him not to believe what he had heard on the radio about his dismissal. His troops started to break up outside Serbia in mid-August, as he tried to reach to Muslim and Croat leaders for a national uprising. However, whatever his intentions, he proved to have little attraction for non-Serbs. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, while leading his [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]], which was related on paper to Ljoti\u0107's forces, accepted once again Mihailovi\u0107's command.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=230\u2013235}} Mihailovi\u0107 ordered a general mobilization on 1 September; his troops were engaged against the Germans and the Bulgarians, while also under attack by the Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=258\u2013260}} On 4 September, Mihailovi\u0107 issued a circular telegram ordering his commanders that no action can be undertaken without his orders, save against the communists.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=380}} German sources confirm the loyalty of Mihailovi\u0107 and forces under his direct influence in this period.{{efn|name=Army Group F Ic notice}} The Partisans then penetrated Chetnik territory, fighting a difficult battle and ultimately defeating Mihailovi\u0107's main force by October. On 6 September, what was left of Nedi\u0107's troops openly joined Mihailovi\u0107. In the meantime, the [[Red Army]] encountered both the Partisans and Chetniks while entering from Romania and Bulgaria. They briefly cooperated with the Chetniks against retreating Germans, before disarming them. Mihailovi\u0107 sent a delegation to the Soviet command, but his representatives were ignored and ultimately arrested. Mihailovi\u0107's movement collapsed in Serbia under the attacks of Soviets, Partisans, Bulgarians and fighting with the retreating Germans. Still hoping for a landing by the Western Allies, he headed for Bosnia with his staff, McDowell and a force of a few hundred. He set up a few Muslim units and appointed Croat Major Matija Parac as the head of an as yet non-existent Croatian Chetnik army. Nedi\u0107 himself had fled to Austria. On 25 May 1945, he wrote to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], asserting that he had always been a secret ally of Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=231\u2013238}}\n\nNow hoping for support from the United States, Mihailovi\u0107 met a small British mission between the Neretva river and Dubrovnik, but realized that it wasn't the signal of the hoped-for landing. McDowell was evacuated on 1 November and was instructed to offer Mihailovi\u0107 the opportunity to leave with him. Mihailovi\u0107 refused, as he wanted to remain until the expected change of Western Allied policy.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=254}} During the next weeks, the British government also raised the possibility of evacuating Mihailovi\u0107 by arranging a \"rescue and honorable detention\", and discussed the matter with the United States. In the end, no action was taken.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=280\u2013282}} With their main forces in eastern Bosnia, the Chetniks under Mihailovi\u0107's personal command in the late months of 1944 continued to collaborate with Germans. Colonel Borota and ''vojvoda'' Jev\u0111evi\u0107 maintained contacts with Germans for the whole group.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=433}} In January 1945, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to regroup his forces on the [[Ozren (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ozren]] heights, planning Muslim, Croatian and Slovenian units. His troops were, however, decimated and worn out, some selling their weapons and ammunition, or pillaging the local population. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 joined Mihailovi\u0107, with his own depleted forces, and found out that Mihailovi\u0107 had no plan.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=440}} \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 went his own way, and was killed on 12 April in a battle with the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=254\u2013256}}\n\nOn 17 March 1945, Mihailovi\u0107 was visited in Bosnia by German emissary St\u00e4rker, who requested that Mihailovi\u0107 transmit to the Allied headquarters in Italy a secret German offer of capitulation. Mihailovi\u0107 transmitted the message, which was to be his last.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=306\u2013307}} Ljoti\u0107 and several independent Chetnik leaders in [[Istria]] proposed the forming of a common anti-communist front in the north-western coast, which could be acceptable to the Western Allies. Mihailovi\u0107 was not in favour of such a heterogeneous gathering, but did not reject Ljoti\u0107's proposal entirely, since the littoral area would be a convenient place to meet the Western Allies, and to join Slovene anti-communists, while Germany's collapse might make an anti-communist alliance possible. He authorized the departure of all who wanted to go, but few Chetniks ultimately arrived on the coast, with many being decimated on their way by Usta\u0161e, Partisans, sickness and hunger.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=256\u2013258}} On 13 April, Mihailovi\u0107 set out for northern Bosnia, on a 280&nbsp;km-long march back to Serbia, aiming to start over a resistance movement, this time against the communists. His units were decimated by clashes with the Usta\u0161e and Partisans, as well as dissension and [[typhus]]. On 10 May, they were attacked and defeated by [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), the successor to the Partisans, in [[battle of Zelengora]]. Mihailovi\u0107 managed to escape with 1,000\u20132,000 men, who gradually dispersed. Mihailovi\u0107 himself went into hiding in the mountains with a handful of men.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=266\u2013267}}\n\n==Capture, trial and execution==\n\n{{Main|Trial of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107}}\n\n[[File:Dra\u017ea pred sudom.jpg|thumbnail|Mihailovi\u0107's trial]]\n\nThe Yugoslav authorities wanted to catch Mihailovi\u0107 alive in order to stage a full-scale trial.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=267}} He was finally caught on 13 March 1946.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=307}} The elaborate circumstances of his capture were kept secret for sixteen years. According to one existing version, Mihailovi\u0107 was approached by men who were supposedly British agents offering him help and an evacuation by aeroplane. After hesitating, he boarded the aeroplane, only to discover that it was a trap set up by the [[Department for the Protection of the People|OZNA]]. Another version, proposed by the Yugoslav government, is that he was betrayed by Nikola Kalabi\u0107, who revealed his place of hiding in exchange for leniency.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=250\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Ravnagora spomenik1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Monument to General Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 on [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]], Serbia.]]\n\nThe [[trial of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] opened on 10 June 1946. His co-defendants were other prominent figures of the Chetnik movement as well as members of the Yugoslav government-in-exile, such as [[Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107]], who were tried in absentia, but also members of [[ZBOR]] and of the [[Nedi\u0107 regime]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=262}} The main prosecutor was [[Milo\u0161 Mini\u0107]], later Minister of Foreign Affairs in the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] government. The Allied airmen he had rescued in 1944 were not allowed to testify in his favour.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=260\u2013262}} Mihailovi\u0107 evaded several questions by accusing some of his subordinates of incompetence and disregard of his orders. The trial shows, according to Jozo Tomasevich, that he never had firm and full control over his local commanders.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=462\u2013463}} A ''Committee for the Fair Trial of General Mihailovi\u0107'' was set up in the United States, but to no avail.

Mihailovi\u0107 was convicted of [[high treason]] and [[war crimes]], and was executed on 17 July 1946.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=307}} He was executed together with nine other officers in Lisi\u010diji Potok, about 200 meters from the former Royal Palace.

Tomasevich suggests one main cause of his defeat was his failure to grow professionally, politically or ideologically as his responsibilities increased, rendering him unable to face both the exceptional circumstances of the war and the complex situation of the Chetniks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p={{page needed|date=September 2012}}}} Tomasevich also criticizes Mihailovi\u0107's loss of the Allied support through Chetnik collaboration with the Axis, as well as his doctrine of \"passive resistance\" which was perceived as idleness, stating \"of generalship in the general there was precious little.\"{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=470}} Pavlowitch also points to Mihailovi\u0107's failure to grow and evolve during the conflict and describes him as a man \"generally out of his depth\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=279}} Roberts asserts that Mihailovi\u0107's policies were \"basically static\", that he \"gambled all in the faith of an Allied victory,\" and that ultimately he was unable to control the Chetniks, who, \"although hostile to the Germans and the Italians&nbsp;... allowed themselves to drift into a policy of accommodations with both in the face of what they considered the greatest danger.\"{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=322}}\n\nPolitical views of Mihailovi\u0107 cover a wide range. After the war, Mihailovi\u0107's wartime role was viewed in the light of his movement's collaboration, particularly in Yugoslavia where he was considered a collaborator convicted of high treason. Charles de Gaulle considered Mihailovi\u0107 a \"pure hero\" and always refused to have personal meetings with Tito, whom he considered as Mihailovi\u0107's \"murderer\".{{sfn|Peyrefitte|1997|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Lutard-Tavard|2005|p=78}} During the war, Churchill believed intelligence reports had shown that Mihailovi\u0107 had engaged \"...&nbsp;in active collaboration with the Germans\".{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=409\u2013415}} He observed that, under the pressure of German reprisals in 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 \"drifted gradually into a posture where some of his commanders made accommodations with German and Italian troops to be left alone in certain mountain areas in return for doing little or nothing against the enemy\", but concluded that \"those who have triumphantly withstood such strains may brand his [Mihailovi\u0107's] name, but history, more discriminating, should not erase it from the scroll of Serbian patriots.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=408\u2013409}} In the United States, due to the efforts of Major Richard L.

27 April 1893&nbsp;\u2013 17 July 1946) was a Yugoslav [[Serb]] general during [[World War II]]. A staunch royalist, he retreated to the mountains near [[Belgrade]] when the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] overran [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in April 1941 and there he organized bands of guerrillas known as the [[Chetniks|Chetnik Detachments of the Yugoslav Army]].\n\nThe organisation is commonly known as the Chetniks, although the name of the organisation was later changed to the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland (JVUO, \u0408\u0412\u0423\u041e).{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=125}} Founded as the first Yugoslav [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement]], it was royalist and nationalist, as opposed to the other, [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] who were communist. Initially, the two groups operated in parallel, but by late 1941 began fighting each other in the attempt to gain control of post-war Yugoslavia. Many Chetnik groups [[Collaborationism|collaborated]] or established ''[[modus vivendi]]'' with the [[Axis powers]]. Mihailovi\u0107 himself collaborated with [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]] at the end of the war.  After the war, Mihailovi\u0107 was captured by the communists. He was [[Trial of Mihailovi\u0107 et al.|tried and convicted]] of [[high treason]] and [[war crimes]] by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|communist authorities]] of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]], and executed by [[firing squad]] in Belgrade. The nature and extent of his responsibility for collaboration and ethnic massacres remains controversial. On 14 May 2015, Mihailovi\u0107's verdict was overturned on appeal with the ruling showing that his trial amounted to a communist kangaroo court. The [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Serbia)|Supreme Court of Cassation]], and [[appellate court]] handed out the rulings. While some see this as a rehabilitation the courts did not go as far and only ruled on the previous trial without offering to retry the case. This was done to satisfy his offspring's legal rights to property which the ruling at his trial stripped from them. \n\n==Early life and military career==\n\nDragoljub \"Dra\u017ea\" Mihailovi\u0107 was born on 27 April 1893 in [[Ivanjica]], [[Kingdom of Serbia]] to Mihailo and Smiljana Mihailovi\u0107 (''n\u00e9e'' Petrovi\u0107).{{sfn|Mihailovi\u0107|1946|p=13}} His father was a [[court clerk]]. Orphaned at seven years of age, Mihailovi\u0107 was raised by his paternal uncle in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=13}} As both of his uncles were military officers, Mihailovi\u0107 himself joined the Serbian [[Military Academy (Serbia)|Military Academy]] in October 1910. He fought as a cadet in the [[Serbian Army]] during the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u201313 and was awarded the [[Silver Medal of Valor]] at the end of the [[First Balkan War]], in May 1913.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=26\u201327}} At the end of the [[Second Balkan War]], during which he mainly led operations along the [[Provisional Government of Albania|Albanian]] border, he was given the rank of second [[lieutenant]] as the top soldier in his class, ranked sixth at the Serbian military academy.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=26\u201327}} He served in [[World War I]] and was involved in the [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania|Serbian Army's retreat]] through [[Principality of Albania|Albania]] in 1915. He later received several decorations for his achievements on the [[Salonika Front]]. Following the war, he became a member of the Royal Guard of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] but had to leave his position in 1920 after taking part in a public argument between communist and nationalist sympathizers. He was subsequently stationed to [[Skopje]]. In 1921, he was admitted to the Superior Military Academy of Belgrade. In 1923, having finished his studies, he was promoted as an assistant to the [[Staff (military)|military staff]], along with the fifteen other best alumni of his promotion.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=45\u201349}} He was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]] in 1930. That same year, he spent three months in [[Paris]], following classes at the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]]. Some authors claim that he met and befriended [[Charles de Gaulle]] during his stay, although there is no known evidence of this.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=55\u201356}} In 1935, he became a military [[attach\u00e9]] to the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and was stationed to [[Sofia]]. On 6 September 1935, he was promoted to the rank of [[colonel]]. Mihailovi\u0107 then came in contact with members of [[Zveno]] and considered taking part in a plot which aimed to provoke [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]]'s abdication and the creation of an alliance between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, but, being untrained as a spy, he was soon identified by Bulgarian authorities and was asked to leave the country. He was then appointed as an attach\u00e9 to [[Czechoslovakia]] in [[Prague]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nHis military career almost came to an abrupt end in 1939, when he submitted a report strongly criticizing the organization of the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]] ({{lang-sh|Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VKJ). Among his most important proposals were abandoning the defence of the northern frontier to concentrate forces in the mountainous interior; re-organizing the armed forces into [[Serb]], [[Croat]], and [[Slovenes|Slovene]] units in order to better counter subversive activities; and using mobile Chetnik units along the borders. [[Milan Nedi\u0107]], the Minister of the Army, was incensed by Mihailovi\u0107's report and ordered that he be confined to barracks for 30&nbsp;days.{{sfn|Trew|1998|pp=5\u20136}} Afterwards, Mihailovi\u0107 became a professor at Belgrade's [[staff college]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=66\u201368}} In the summer of 1940, he attended a function put on by the British military attach\u00e9 for the Association of Yugoslav Reserve NCOs. The meeting was seen as highly anti-Nazi in tone, and the German ambassador protested Mihailovi\u0107's presence. Nedi\u0107 once more ordered him confined to barracks for 30&nbsp;days as well as demoted and placed on the retired list.

At the time of the invasion, Colonel Mihailovi\u0107 was an assistant to the chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav [[2nd Army (Yugoslavia)|Second Army]] in northern Bosnia. He briefly served as the Second Army chief-of-staff{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=53}} prior to taking command of a \"Rapid Unit\" (''brzi odred'') shortly before the Yugoslav High Command capitulated to the Germans on 17 April 1941.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n==World War II==\n\nFollowing the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]], a small group of officers and soldiers led by Mihailovi\u0107 escaped in the hope of finding VKJ units still fighting in the mountains.

The creation of a resistance movement in occupied Europe was received as a morale booster.

Mihailovi\u0107 and \u0110ukanovi\u0107 did not attend the event, which was entirely dominated by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, but they sent representatives.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=110\u2013112}} In the same month, Mihailovi\u0107 informed his subordinates that: \"The units of the Partisans are filled with thugs of the most varied kinds, such as Usta\u0161as&nbsp;\u2013 the worst butchers of the Serb people&nbsp;\u2013 Jews, Croats, Dalmatians, Bulgarians, Turks, Magyars, and all the other nations of the world.\"{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=161}}\n\n[[File:Predrag Rakovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|right|British Brigadier [[Charles Armstrong (soldier)|Charles Armstrong]] visits the 2nd Ravna Gora Corps in the fall of 1943.

He led the \"nationalist\" resistance against Partisans and [[Usta\u0161e]] and acknowledged Mihailovi\u0107 as formal leader, but acted on his own, with his troops being used by the Italians as the local [[Anti-Communist Volunteer Militia]] (MVAC). Italian commander [[Mario Roatta]] aimed to spare Italian lives, but also to counter the Usta\u0161e and Germans, to undermine Mihailovi\u0107's authority among the Chetniks by playing up local leaders. Chetniks, led by [[Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107]], came from Montenegro to help the Bosnian Serb population against the Usta\u0161e. They murdered and pillaged in [[Fo\u010da]] until the Italians intervened in August. The Chetniks also asked the Italians for protection against Usta\u0161e retribution. On 22 July, Mihailovi\u0107 met with Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin, Jev\u0111evi\u0107, and his newly appointed delegate in Herzegovina, [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]]. The meeting was supposedly secret, but was known to Italian intelligence. Mihailovi\u0107 gave no precise orders but expressed his confidence in both his subordinates, adding, according to Italian reports, that he was waiting for help from the Allies to start a real guerrilla campaign, in order to spare Serb lives. Summoned by Roatta upon their return, Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin and Jev\u0111evi\u0107 assured the Italian commander that Mihailovi\u0107 was merely a \"moral head\" and that they would not attack Italians, even if he should give such an order.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=122\u2013126}}\n\nHaving become more and more concerned with domestic enemies and concerned that he be in a position to control Yugoslavia after the Allies defeated the Axis, Mihailovi\u0107 concentrated from Montenegro on directing operations, in the various parts of Yugoslavia, mostly against Partisans, but also against the Usta\u0161e and [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]]'s [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] (SDK).{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=67}} During the autumn of 1942, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks\u2014at the request of the British organization\u2014sabotaged several railway lines used to supply Axis forces in the [[Western Desert campaign|Western Desert]] of [[North African campaign|northern Africa]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=98}} In September and December, Mihailovi\u0107's actions damaged the railway system seriously; the Allies gave him credit for inconveniencing Axis forces and contributing to Allied successes in Africa.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=98\u2013100}} The credit given to Mihailovi\u0107 for sabotages was maybe undeserved:\n: ''But an S.O.E.

This prompted fighting between the Chetniks and followers of the Nedi\u0107 regime. The Germans, whom the Nedi\u0107 administration had called for help against Mihailovi\u0107, responded to Nedi\u0107's request and to the sabotages with mass terror, and attacked the Chetniks in late 1942 and early 1943.

Thousands of arrests were made and it has been estimated that during December 1942, 1,600 Chetnik combatants were killed by the Germans through combat actions and executions. These actions by the Nedi\u0107 regime and the Germans \"brought to an abrupt conclusion much of the anti-German action Mihailovi\u0107 had started up again since the summer (of 1942)\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=100}} [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote to [[Benito Mussolini]] on February 16, 1943, demanding that in addition to the partisans be pursued the chetniks who possessed \"a special danger in the long-term plans that Mihailovic's supporters were building.\" Hitler adds: \"In any case, the liquidation of the Mihailovic movement will no longer be an easy task, given the forces at its disposal and the large number of armed Chetniks\". At that time, General Mihailovic was with his Supreme Command in [[Montenegro]], which was under Italian occupation. From the beginning of 1943, General Mihailovic prepared his units for the supports of Allied landing on the [[Adriatic]] coast.

Receiving more weapons from the British, he undertook a series of actions and sabotages, disarmed [[Serbian State Guard]] (SDS) detachments and skirmished with Bulgarian troops, though he generally avoided the Germans, considering that his troops were not yet strong enough. In Serbia, his organization controlled the mountains where Axis forces were absent. The collaborationist Nedi\u0107 administration was largely infiltrated by Mihailovi\u0107's men and many SDS troops being actually sympathetic to his movement. After his defeat in Case White, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to improve his organization. Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107, the movement's ideologue who had opposed the Italian connection and clashed with Mihailovi\u0107, left the supreme command.

According to Walter R. Roberts, there is \"little doubt\" that Mihailovi\u0107 was aware of these arrangements and that he might have regarded them as the lesser of two evils, his primary aim being to defeat the Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\nFrom the beginning of 1943, British impatience with Mihailovi\u0107 grew. From the decrypts of German wireless messages, Churchill and his government concluded that the Chetniks' collaboration with the Italians went beyond what was acceptable and that the Partisans were doing the most severe damage to the Axis.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nWith Italy's withdrawal from the war in September 1943, the Chetniks in Montenegro found themselves under attack by both the Germans and the Partisans, who took control of large parts of Montenegrin territory, including the former \"Chetnik capital\" of Kola\u0161in. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, having escaped from a German camp in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], found his way to Yugoslavia, was captured again, and was then asked by collaborationist prime minister Milan Nedi\u0107 to form a [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]] against the Partisans. He was pledged to Nedi\u0107, but also made a secret allegiance to Mihailovi\u0107. Both Mihailovi\u0107 and \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 expected a landing by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. In Serbia, Mihailovi\u0107 was considered the representative of the victorious Allies.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=192\u2013195}} In the chaotic situation created by the Italian surrender, several Chetnik leaders overtly collaborated with the Germans against the reinforced Partisans; approached by an Abwehr agent, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 offered the services of about 5,000 men. [[Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107]] also went to the Germans for cover against the Usta\u0161e and Partisans, although he was distrusted.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=204\u2013205}} In October 1943, Mihailovi\u0107, at the Allies' request, agreed to undertake two sabotage operations, which had the effect of making him even more of a wanted man and forced him, according to British reports, to change his headquarters frequently.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nBy November and December 1943, the Germans had realized that Tito was their most dangerous opponent; German representative [[Hermann Neubacher]] managed to conclude secret arrangements with four of Mihailovi\u0107's commanders for the cessation of hostilities for periods of five to ten weeks. The Germans interpreted this as a sign of weakness from the Mihailovi\u0107 movement. The truces were kept secret but came to the knowledge of the British through decrypts. There is no evidence that Mihailovi\u0107 had been involved or approved, though British Military Intelligence found it possible that he was \"conniving\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=197\u2013199}} At the end of October, the local signals decrypted in Cairo had disclosed that Mihailovi\u0107 had ordered all Chetnik units to co-operate with Germany against the Partisans.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993|p=358}} This order for cooperation was originally decrypted by Germans, and it was noted in the ''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'' War Journal.{{sfn|Schramm|1963|pp=1304}}{{efn|name=quote from KTB OKW}}\n\nThe British were more and more concerned about the fact that the Chetniks were more willing to fight Partisans than Axis troops. At the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|third Moscow Conference]] in October 1943, [[Anthony Eden]] expressed impatience about Mihailovi\u0107's lack of action.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=157\u2013160}} The report of [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]], liaison officer to the Partisans, convinced Churchill that Tito's forces were the most reliable resistance group. The report of Charles Armstrong, liaison officer to Mihailovi\u0107, arrived too late for Anthony Eden to take it to the [[Tehran Conference]] in late November 1943, though Stevan K. Pavlowitch thinks that it would probably been insufficient to change Churchill's mind. At Tehran, Churchill argued in favour of the Partisans, while [[Joseph Stalin]] expressed limited interest but agreed that they should receive the greatest possible support.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nOn 10 December, Churchill met King Peter II in London and told him that he possessed irrefutable proofs of Mihailovi\u0107's collaboration with the enemy and that Mihailovi\u0107 should be eliminated from the Yugoslav cabinet. Also in early December, Mihailovi\u0107 was asked to undertake an important sabotage mission against railways, which was later interpreted as a \"final opportunity\" to redeem himself. However, possibly not realizing how Allied policy had evolved, he failed to give the go-ahead.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=178\u2013180}} On 12 January 1944, the SOE in Cairo sent a report to the Foreign Office, saying that Mihailovi\u0107's commanders had collaborated with Germans and Italians and that Mihailovi\u0107 himself had condoned and in certain cases approved their actions. This hastened the British's decision to withdraw their thirty liaison officers to Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=197}} The mission was effectively withdrawn in the spring of 1944. In April, one month before leaving, liaison officer Brigadier Armstrong noted that Mihailovi\u0107 had been mostly active in propaganda against the Axis, that he had missed numerous occasions for sabotage in the last six or eight months and that the efforts of many Chetnik leaders to follow Mihailovi\u0107's orders for inactivity had evolved into non-aggression pacts with Axis troops, although the mission had no evidence of collaboration with the enemy.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=225}} \n\nIn the meantime, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to improve the organization of his movement. On 25 January 1944, with the help of [[\u017divko Topalovi\u0107]], he organized in [[Ba (Ljig)|Ba]], a village near Ravna Gora, the [[Ba Congress]] also meant to remove the shadow of the previous congress held in Montenegro. The congress was attended by 274 people, representing various parties, and aimed to be a reaction against the arbitrary behaviour of some commanders. The organization of a new, democratic, possibly federal, Yugoslavia, was mentioned, though the proposals remained vague, and an appeal was even made for the KPJ to join. The Chetnik command structure was formally reorganized. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was still in charge of Montenegro and \u0110uji\u0107 of Dalmatia, but Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was excluded. The Germans and Bulgarians reacted to the congress by conducting an operation against the Chetniks in northern Serbia in February, killing 80 and capturing 913.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=223\u2013226}}\n\nAfter May and the withdrawal of the British mission, Mihailovi\u0107 kept transmitting radio messages to the Allies and to his government but no longer received replies.\n\nIn July and August 1944, Mihailovi\u0107 ordered his forces to cooperate with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) and 60th Troop Carrier Squadron (TCS) in the successful rescue of hundreds downed Allied airmen between August and December 1944 in what was called [[Operation Halyard]];{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=245\u2013257}}{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=378}} for this, he was posthumously awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] by United States President [[Harry S. Truman]].  Details of this rescue mission are described in The Forgotten 500, by Gregory A. Freeman, published in 2007.  [http://www.gregoryafreeman.com/forgotten500.html]\n\nAccording to historian [[Marko Attila Hoare]], \"On other occasions, however, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks rescued German airmen and handed them over safely to the German armed forces&nbsp;... The Americans, with a weaker intelligence presence in the Balkans than the British, were less in touch with the realities of the Yugoslav civil war. They were consequently less than enthusiastic about British abandonment of the anti-communist Mihailovi\u0107, and more reserved toward the Partisans.\" Several Yugoslavs were also evacuated in Operation Halyard, along with Topalovi\u0107; they tried to raise more support abroad for Mihailovi\u0107's movement, but this came too late to reverse Allied policy.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=253\u2013254}} The United States also sent an intelligence mission to Mihailovi\u0107 in March, but withdrew it after Churchill advised Roosevelt that all support should go to Tito and that \"complete chaos\" would ensue if the Americans also backed Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=245\u2013257}}\n\nIn July, [[Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107]] formed the new Yugoslav government-in-exile, which did not include Mihailovi\u0107 as a minister. Mihailovi\u0107, however, remained the official chief-of-staff of the Yugoslav Army. On 29 August, upon the recommendation of his government, King Peter dissolved by royal decree the Supreme Command, therefore abolishing Mihailovi\u0107's post. On 12 September, King Peter broadcast a message from London, announcing the gist of 29 August's decree and calling upon all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to \"join the National Liberation Army under the leadership of Marshal Tito\". He also proclaimed that he strongly condemned \"the misuse of the name of the King and the authority of the Crown by which an attempt has been made to justify collaboration with the enemy\". Though the King did not mention Mihailovi\u0107, it was clear who he meant. According to his own account, Peter had obtained after strenuous talks with the British not to say a word directly against Mihailovi\u0107. The message had a devastating effect on the morale of the Chetniks. Many men left Mihailovi\u0107 after the broadcast; others remained out of loyalty to him.\n{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=258\u2013260}} Mihailovi\u0107 resented the fact that he was abandoned by his former allies and in August 1944 summed up his position by stating that:\n\n: ''\"More than three years ago I took up arms to fight for democracy against dictatorship in the form of nazism and fascism. In fighting for this cause there were ten occasions on which I almost lost my life. If I must die in fighting against a new form of dictatorship, I shall die, bitter because I have been deserted by those who profess to believe in democracy, but satisfied that I myself have fought bravely and honestly and have refused to compromise my cause.\"''{{sfn|Martin|1946|p=292}}\n\n==Defeat in 1944\u201345==\n\nAt the end of August 1944, the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]] arrived on the eastern borders of Yugoslavia. In early September, it invaded Bulgaria and coerced it into turning against the Axis. Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks, meanwhile, were so badly armed to resist the Partisan incursions into Serbia that some of Mihailovi\u0107's officers, including [[Nikola Kalabi\u0107]], Ne\u0161ko Nedi\u0107 and Dragoslav Ra\u010di\u0107, met German officers on 11 August to arrange a meeting of Mihailovi\u0107 with Neubacher and to set forth the conditions for increased collaboration.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=342}} Nedi\u0107, in turn, apparently picked up the idea and suggested forming an army of united anti-communist forces; he arranged a secret meeting with Mihailovi\u0107, which apparently took place around 20 August. From the existing accounts, they met in a dark room and Mihailovi\u0107 remained mostly silent, so much so that Nedi\u0107 was not even sure afterwards that he had actually met the real Mihailovi\u0107. According to British official Stephen Clissold, Mihailovi\u0107 was initially very reluctant to go to the meeting, but was finally convinced by Kalabi\u0107. It appears that Nedi\u0107 offered to obtain arms from the Germans, and to place his Serbian State Guard under Mihailovi\u0107's command, possibly as part of an attempt to switch sides as Germany was losing the war.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=257\u2013258}} Neubacher favoured the idea, but it was vetoed by Hitler, who saw this as an attempt to establish an \"English fifth column\" in Serbia. According to Pavlowitch, Mihailovi\u0107, who was reportedly not enthusiastic about the proposal, and Nedi\u0107 might have been trying to \"exploit each other's predicaments\", while Nedi\u0107 may have considered letting Mihailovi\u0107 \"take over\". At the end of August, Mihailovi\u0107 also met an OSS mission, headed by Colonel [[Robert H. McDowell]], who stayed with him until November.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=228\u2013230}}\n\nAs the Red Army approached, Mihailovi\u0107 thought that the outcome of war would depend on [[Turkey]] entering the conflict, followed at last by an Allied incursion in the Balkans. He called upon all Yugoslavs to remain faithful to the King, and claimed that Peter had sent him a message telling him not to believe what he had heard on the radio about his dismissal. His troops started to break up outside Serbia in mid-August, as he tried to reach to Muslim and Croat leaders for a national uprising. However, whatever his intentions, he proved to have little attraction for non-Serbs. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, while leading his [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]], which was related on paper to Ljoti\u0107's forces, accepted once again Mihailovi\u0107's command.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=230\u2013235}} Mihailovi\u0107 ordered a general mobilization on 1 September; his troops were engaged against the Germans and the Bulgarians, while also under attack by the Partisans.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=258\u2013260}} On 4 September, Mihailovi\u0107 issued a circular telegram ordering his commanders that no action can be undertaken without his orders, save against the communists.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=380}} German sources confirm the loyalty of Mihailovi\u0107 and forces under his direct influence in this period.{{efn|name=Army Group F Ic notice}} The Partisans then penetrated Chetnik territory, fighting a difficult battle and ultimately defeating Mihailovi\u0107's main force by October. On 6 September, what was left of Nedi\u0107's troops openly joined Mihailovi\u0107. In the meantime, the [[Red Army]] encountered both the Partisans and Chetniks while entering from Romania and Bulgaria. They briefly cooperated with the Chetniks against retreating Germans, before disarming them. Mihailovi\u0107 sent a delegation to the Soviet command, but his representatives were ignored and ultimately arrested. Mihailovi\u0107's movement collapsed in Serbia under the attacks of Soviets, Partisans, Bulgarians and fighting with the retreating Germans. Still hoping for a landing by the Western Allies, he headed for Bosnia with his staff, McDowell and a force of a few hundred. He set up a few Muslim units and appointed Croat Major Matija Parac as the head of an as yet non-existent Croatian Chetnik army. Nedi\u0107 himself had fled to Austria. On 25 May 1945, he wrote to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], asserting that he had always been a secret ally of Mihailovi\u0107.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=231\u2013238}}\n\nNow hoping for support from the United States, Mihailovi\u0107 met a small British mission between the Neretva river and Dubrovnik, but realized that it wasn't the signal of the hoped-for landing. McDowell was evacuated on 1 November and was instructed to offer Mihailovi\u0107 the opportunity to leave with him. Mihailovi\u0107 refused, as he wanted to remain until the expected change of Western Allied policy.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=254}} During the next weeks, the British government also raised the possibility of evacuating Mihailovi\u0107 by arranging a \"rescue and honorable detention\", and discussed the matter with the United States. In the end, no action was taken.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=280\u2013282}} With their main forces in eastern Bosnia, the Chetniks under Mihailovi\u0107's personal command in the late months of 1944 continued to collaborate with Germans. Colonel Borota and ''vojvoda'' Jev\u0111evi\u0107 maintained contacts with Germans for the whole group.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=433}} In January 1945, Mihailovi\u0107 tried to regroup his forces on the [[Ozren (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ozren]] heights, planning Muslim, Croatian and Slovenian units. His troops were, however, decimated and worn out, some selling their weapons and ammunition, or pillaging the local population. \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 joined Mihailovi\u0107, with his own depleted forces, and found out that Mihailovi\u0107 had no plan.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=440}} \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 went his own way, and was killed on 12 April in a battle with the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=254\u2013256}}\n\nOn 17 March 1945, Mihailovi\u0107 was visited in Bosnia by German emissary St\u00e4rker, who requested that Mihailovi\u0107 transmit to the Allied headquarters in Italy a secret German offer of capitulation. Mihailovi\u0107 transmitted the message, which was to be his last.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=306\u2013307}} Ljoti\u0107 and several independent Chetnik leaders in [[Istria]] proposed the forming of a common anti-communist front in the north-western coast, which could be acceptable to the Western Allies. Mihailovi\u0107 was not in favour of such a heterogeneous gathering, but did not reject Ljoti\u0107's proposal entirely, since the littoral area would be a convenient place to meet the Western Allies, and to join Slovene anti-communists, while Germany's collapse might make an anti-communist alliance possible. He authorized the departure of all who wanted to go, but few Chetniks ultimately arrived on the coast, with many being decimated on their way by Usta\u0161e, Partisans, sickness and hunger.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=256\u2013258}} On 13 April, Mihailovi\u0107 set out for northern Bosnia, on a 280&nbsp;km-long march back to Serbia, aiming to start over a resistance movement, this time against the communists. His units were decimated by clashes with the Usta\u0161e and Partisans, as well as dissension and [[typhus]]. On 10 May, they were attacked and defeated by [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), the successor to the Partisans, in [[battle of Zelengora]]. Mihailovi\u0107 managed to escape with 1,000\u20132,000 men, who gradually dispersed. Mihailovi\u0107 himself went into hiding in the mountains with a handful of men.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=266\u2013267}}\n\n==Capture, trial and execution==\n\n{{Main|Trial of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107}}\n\n[[File:Dra\u017ea pred sudom.jpg|thumbnail|Mihailovi\u0107's trial]]\n\nThe Yugoslav authorities wanted to catch Mihailovi\u0107 alive in order to stage a full-scale trial.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=267}} He was finally caught on 13 March 1946.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=307}} The elaborate circumstances of his capture were kept secret for sixteen years. According to one existing version, Mihailovi\u0107 was approached by men who were supposedly British agents offering him help and an evacuation by aeroplane. After hesitating, he boarded the aeroplane, only to discover that it was a trap set up by the [[Department for the Protection of the People|OZNA]]. Another version, proposed by the Yugoslav government, is that he was betrayed by Nikola Kalabi\u0107, who revealed his place of hiding in exchange for leniency.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=250\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Ravnagora spomenik1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Monument to General Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 on [[Ravna Gora (Suvobor)|Ravna Gora]], Serbia.]]\n\nThe [[trial of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] opened on 10 June 1946. His co-defendants were other prominent figures of the Chetnik movement as well as members of the Yugoslav government-in-exile, such as [[Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107]], who were tried in absentia, but also members of [[ZBOR]] and of the [[Nedi\u0107 regime]].{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=262}} The main prosecutor was [[Milo\u0161 Mini\u0107]], later Minister of Foreign Affairs in the [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] government. The Allied airmen he had rescued in 1944 were not allowed to testify in his favour.{{sfn|Buisson|1999|p=260\u2013262}} Mihailovi\u0107 evaded several questions by accusing some of his subordinates of incompetence and disregard of his orders. The trial shows, according to Jozo Tomasevich, that he never had firm and full control over his local commanders.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=462\u2013463}} A ''Committee for the Fair Trial of General Mihailovi\u0107'' was set up in the United States, but to no avail. Mihailovi\u0107 is quoted as saying, in his final statement, \"I wanted much; I began much; but the gale of the world carried away me and my work.\"{{sfn|''Time''|7 October 1957}}\n\nRoberts considers that the trial was \"anything but a model of justice\" and that \"it is clear that Mihailovi\u0107 was not guilty of all, or even many, of the charges brought against him\" though Tito would probably not have had a fair trial either, had Mihailovi\u0107 prevailed. Mihailovi\u0107 was convicted of [[high treason]] and [[war crimes]], and was executed on 17 July 1946.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=307}} He was executed together with nine other officers in Lisi\u010diji Potok, about 200 meters from the former Royal Palace.

Tomasevich suggests one main cause of his defeat was his failure to grow professionally, politically or ideologically as his responsibilities increased, rendering him unable to face both the exceptional circumstances of the war and the complex situation of the Chetniks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p={{page needed|date=September 2012}}}} Tomasevich also criticizes Mihailovi\u0107's loss of the Allied support through Chetnik collaboration with the Axis, as well as his doctrine of \"passive resistance\" which was perceived as idleness, stating \"of generalship in the general there was precious little.\"{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=470}} Pavlowitch also points to Mihailovi\u0107's failure to grow and evolve during the conflict and describes him as a man \"generally out of his depth\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=279}} Roberts asserts that Mihailovi\u0107's policies were \"basically static\", that he \"gambled all in the faith of an Allied victory,\" and that ultimately he was unable to control the Chetniks, who, \"although hostile to the Germans and the Italians&nbsp;... allowed themselves to drift into a policy of accommodations with both in the face of what they considered the greatest danger.\"{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=322}}\n\nPolitical views of Mihailovi\u0107 cover a wide range. After the war, Mihailovi\u0107's wartime role was viewed in the light of his movement's collaboration, particularly in Yugoslavia where he was considered a collaborator convicted of high treason. Charles de Gaulle considered Mihailovi\u0107 a \"pure hero\" and always refused to have personal meetings with Tito, whom he considered as Mihailovi\u0107's \"murderer\".{{sfn|Peyrefitte|1997|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Lutard-Tavard|2005|p=78}} During the war, Churchill believed intelligence reports had shown that Mihailovi\u0107 had engaged \"...&nbsp;in active collaboration with the Germans\".{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=409\u2013415}} He observed that, under the pressure of German reprisals in 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 \"drifted gradually into a posture where some of his commanders made accommodations with German and Italian troops to be left alone in certain mountain areas in return for doing little or nothing against the enemy\", but concluded that \"those who have triumphantly withstood such strains may brand his [Mihailovi\u0107's] name, but history, more discriminating, should not erase it from the scroll of Serbian patriots.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1953|pp=408\u2013409}} In the United States, due to the efforts of Major Richard L. Felman and his friends, President Truman, on the recommendation of Eisenhower, posthumously awarded Mihailovi\u0107 the Legion of Merit for the rescue of American airmen by the Chetniks. The award and the story of the rescue was classified secret by the State Department so as not to offend the Yugoslav government.\n\n: ''\"The unparalleled rescue of over 500 American Airmen from capture by the Enemy Occupation Forces in Yugoslavia during World War II by General Dragoljub Mihailovich and his Chetnik Freedom Fighters for which this \"Legion of Merit\" medal was awarded by President Harry S. Truman, also represents a token of deep personal appreciation and respect by all those rescued American Airmen and their descendants, who will be forever grateful.\"'' (NATIONAL COMMITTEE OF AMERICAN AIRMEN RESCUED BY GENERAL Mihailovi\u0107H&nbsp;\u2013 1985)\n\n[[Maximilian von Weichs|Generalfeldmarschall von Weichs]], German commander-in-chief south east 1943\u20131945, in his interrogation statement in October 1945, wrote about Mihailovi\u0107 and his forces in section named \"Groups Aiding Germany\":\n: ''\"MIHAILOVIC 's troops once fought against our occupation troops out of loyalty to their King. At the same time they fought against TITO, because of anti\u2014Communist convictions. This two front war could not last long, particularly when British support favored TITO. Consequently MIHAILOVIC showed pro-German leanings. There were engagements during which Serbian Chetniks fought TITO alongside German troops. On the other hand, hostile Chetnik groups were known to attack German supply trains in order to replenish their own stocks.\"''\n: ''\"MIHAILOVIC liked to remain in the background, and leave such affairs up to his subordinates. He hoped to bide his time with this play of power until an Anglo\u2014American landing would provide sufficient support against TITO. Germany welcomed his support, however temporary. Chetnik reconnaissance activities were valued highly by our commanders.\"''{{sfn|von Weichs|1945|p=22}}\n\nAlmost sixty years after his death, on 29 March 2005, Mihailovi\u0107's daughter, Gordana, was presented with the posthumous decoration by president [[George W. Bush]].{{sfn|Hoare|2005}} The decision was controversial; in [[Croatia]] Zoran Pusi\u0107, head of the Civil Committee for Human Rights, protested against the decision and stated that Mihailovi\u0107 was directly responsible for the war crimes committed by the Chetniks.{{sfn|Balkan News|2005}}{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}}\n\nWith the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] and the renewal of ethnic nationalism, the historical perception of Mihailovi\u0107's collaboration has been challenged by parts of the public in [[Serbia]] and other ethnic Serb-populated regions of the former Yugoslavia. In the 1980s, political and economic problems within Yugoslavia undermined faith in the communist regime, and historians in Serbia began a re-evaluation of Serbian historiography and proposed the rehabilitation of Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetniks.{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}} In the 1990s, during the [[Yugoslav Wars]], several Serbian nationalist groups began calling themselves \"Chetniks\", while Serb paramilitaries often self-identified with them and were referred to as such.{{sfn|Cathcart|1994}} [[Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj]]'s [[Serbian Radical Party]] formed the [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|White Eagles]], a paramilitary group considered responsible for war crimes and ethnic cleansing, which identified with the Chetniks.{{sfn|Allen|1996|p={{page needed|date=September 2012}}}}{{sfn|Bassiouni|1994}} [[Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107]]'s Serbian Renewal Movement was closely associated with the [[Serbian Guard]], which was also associated with Chetniks and monarchism.{{sfn|Glas javnosti|1999}} Reunions of Chetnik survivors and nostalgics and of Mihailovi\u0107 admirers have been held in Serbia{{sfn|Buisson|1999|pp=9\u201310}} By the late 20th and early 21st century, Serbian history textbooks and academic works characterized Mihailovi\u0107 and the Chetniks as \"fighters for a just cause\", and Chetnik massacres of civilians and commission of war crimes were ignored or barely mentioned.{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}} In 2004, Mihailovi\u0107 was officially rehabilitated in Serbia by an act of the Serbian Parliament.{{sfn|Cviji\u0107|2010}} In a 2009 survey carried out in Serbia, 34.44 percent of respondents favored annulling the 1946 verdict against Mihailovi\u0107 (in which he was found to be a traitor and Axis collaborator), 15.92 percent opposed, and 49.64 percent stated they did not know what to think.{{sfn|Ramet|2011|p=2}}\n\nThe revised image of Mihailovi\u0107 is not shared in non-Serbian post-Yugoslav nations. In Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] analogies are drawn between war crimes committed during World War II and those of the Yugoslav Wars, and Mihailovi\u0107 is \"seen as a war criminal responsible for ethnic cleansing and genocidal massacres.\"{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}} The differences were illustrated in 2004, when a Serbian basketball player, Milan Gurovi\u0107, who has a tattoo of Mihailovi\u0107 on his left arm, was banned by the Croatian Ministry of the Interior Zlatko Mehun from traveling to Croatia for refusing to cover the tattoo, as its display was deemed equivalent to \"provoking hatred or violence because of racial background, national identity or religious affiliation.\"{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}}{{sfn|MSNBC|2004}} Serbian press and politicians reacted to the ban with surprise and indignation, while in Croatia the decision was seen as \"wise and a means of protecting the player himself against his own stupidity.\"{{sfn|Sindb\u00e6k|2009}} In 2009, a Serb group based in Chicago offered a reward of $100,000.00 for help finding Mihailovi\u0107's grave.{{sfn|Meyer|2009}} A commission formed by the Serbian government began an investigation and in 2010 suggested Mihailovi\u0107 may have been interred at [[Ada Ciganlija]].{{sfn|Cviji\u0107|2010}}\n\n{{quote|General Dragoljub Mihailovich distinguished himself in an outstanding manner as Commander-in-Chief of the Yugoslavian Army Forces and later as Minister of War by organizing and leading important resistance forces against the enemy which occupied Yugoslavia, from December 1941 to December 1944.

{"title_page": "Aegean dispute", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Aegeansea.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Aegean Sea]]\n[[File:Aegean with legends.svg|thumb|Map of the Aegean Sea]]\n[[File:Aegean 6 nm.svg|thumb|'''6 [[nautical miles]] (nmi)''': Current territorial waters and airspace as recognized by Turkey]]\n[[File:Aegean 10 nm.svg|thumb|'''10 nmi''': Current national airspace as claimed by Greece]]\n[[File:Aegean 12 nm.svg|thumb|'''12 nmi''': Possible future extension of Greek territorial waters and national airspace]]\n\nThe '''Aegean dispute''' is a set of interrelated controversies between [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] over sovereignty and related rights in the area of the [[Aegean Sea]]. This set of conflicts has had a large effect on [[Greek-Turkish relations]] since the 1970s. It has twice led to crises coming close to the outbreak of military hostilities, in 1987 and in early 1996. The issues in the Aegean fall into several categories:\n* The delimitation of the [[territorial waters]],\n* The delimitation of the [[national airspace]],\n* The delimitation of [[exclusive economic zone]]s and the use of the [[continental shelf]],\n* The role of [[flight information region]]s (FIR) for the control of military flight activity,\n* The issue of the [[demilitarized]] status assigned to some of the Greek islands in the area,\n* Turkish claims of \"grey zones\" of undetermined sovereignty over a number of small islets, most notably the islets of [[Imia/Kardak]].\n\nBetween 1998 and the early 2010s, the two countries came closer to overcoming the tensions through a series of diplomatic measures, particularly with a view to easing [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's accession to the]] [[European Union]]. However, differences over suitable diplomatic paths to a substantial solution remained unresolved, and as of 2020 tensions remain high.\n\n==Maritime and aerial zones of influence==\nSeveral of the Aegean issues deal with the delimitation of both countries' zones of influence in the air and on the sea around their respective territories. These issues owe their virulence to a geographical peculiarity of the Aegean sea and its territories. While the mainland coasts of Greece and Turkey bordering the Aegean Sea on both sides represent roughly equal shares of its total coastline, the overwhelming number of the many [[Aegean islands]] belong to Greece. In particular, there is a chain of Greek islands lined up along the Turkish west coast ([[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], and the [[Dodecanese islands]]), some of them in very close proximity to the mainland. Their existence blocks Turkey from extending any of its zones of influence beyond a few nautical miles off its coastline. As the breadth of maritime and areal zones of influence, such as the territorial waters and national airspace, are measured from the nearest territory of the state in question, including its islands, any possible extension of such zones would necessarily benefit Greece much more than Turkey proportionally.\n\nAccording to a popular perception of these issues in the two countries, Turkey is concerned that Greece might be trying to extend its zones of influence to such a degree that it would turn the Aegean effectively into a \"Greek lake\". Conversely, Greece is concerned that Turkey might try to \"occupy half of the Aegean\", i.e. establish Turkish zones of influence towards the middle of the Aegean, beyond the chain of outlying Greek islands, turning these into a kind of exclave surrounded by Turkish waters, and thus cutting them off from their motherland.<ref name=\"ba\u015flar\">Kemal Ba\u015flar (2001): Two facets of the Aegean Sea dispute: 'de lege lata' and 'de lege ferenda'. In: K. Ba\u015flar (ed.), ''Turkey and international law''. Ankara. [http://www.turkishweekly.net/pdf/aegean_sea.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822022924/http://www.turkishweekly.net/pdf/aegean_sea.pdf |date=22 August 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Territorial waters===\n\nTerritorial waters give the littoral state full control over air navigation in the airspace above, and partial control over shipping, although foreign ships (both civil and military) are normally guaranteed [[innocent passage]] through them. The standard width of territorial waters that countries are customarily entitled to has steadily increased in the course of the 20th century: from initially {{convert|3|nmi|km}} at the beginning of the century, to {{convert|6|nmi|km}}, and currently {{convert|12|nmi|km}}. The current value has been enshrined in treaty law by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] of 1982 (Art.3). In the Aegean the territorial waters claimed by both sides are still at 6 miles. The possibility of an extension to 12 miles has fuelled Turkish concerns over a possible disproportionate increase in Greek-controlled space. Turkey has refused to become a member of the convention and does not consider itself bound by it. Turkey considers the convention as ''[[res inter alios acta]],'' i.e. a treaty that can only be binding to the signing parties but not to others. Greece, which is a party to the convention, has stated that it reserves the right to apply this rule and extend its waters to 12 miles at some point in the future, although it has never actually attempted to do so. It holds that the 12-mile rule is not only treaty law but also [[customary law]], as per the wide consensus established among the international community. Against this, Turkey argues that the special geographical properties of the Aegean Sea make a strict application of the 12-mile rule in this case illicit in the interest of [[equity (law)|equity]].<ref name=\"heintschel\">Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg (1989): ''Der \u00c4g\u00e4is-Konflikt: Die Abgrenzung des Festlandsockels zwischen Griechenland und der T\u00fcrkei und das Problem der Inseln im Seev\u00f6lkerrecht. Berlin: Duncker und Humblot''. {{in lang|de}}</ref> Turkey has itself applied the customary 12-mile limit to its coasts outside the Aegean.\n\nTensions over the 12-mile question ran highest between the two countries in the early 1990s, when the Law of the Sea was going to come into force. On 9 June 1995, the Turkish parliament officially declared that unilateral action by Greece would constitute a ''[[casus belli]]'', i.e. reason to go to war. This declaration has been condemned by Greece as a violation of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], which forbids \"the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\".<ref name=\"ba\u015flar\" />\n\n===National airspace===\nThe national airspace is normally defined as the airspace covering a state's land territory and its adjacent territorial waters. National airspace gives the sovereign state a large degree of control over foreign air traffic. While civil aviation is normally allowed passage under international treaties, foreign military and other state aircraft (unlike military vessels in the territorial waters) do not have a right to free passage through another state's national airspace.<ref name=\"Haanappel\">{{cite book|author=Haanappel, Peter P. C.|title=The Law and Policy of Air Space and Outer Space|work=Kluwer|year=2003|page=22}}</ref> The delimitation of national airspace claimed by Greece is unique, as it does not coincide with the boundary of the territorial waters. Greece claims {{convert|10|nmi|km}} of airspace, as opposed to currently 6 miles of territorial waters. Since 1974, Turkey has refused to acknowledge the validity of the outer 4-mile belt of airspace that extends beyond the Greek territorial waters. Turkey cites the statutes of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] ''(ICAO)'' of 1948, as containing a binding definition that both zones must coincide.<ref name=\"mfatr\">[http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=225&Itemid=240 Embassy of Turkey in Washington: Aegean Disputes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415091248/http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=225&Itemid=240 |date=15 April 2006 }}</ref> Against this, Greece argues that:\n* its {{convert|10|nmi|km|adj=on}} claim predates the ICAO statute, having been fixed in 1931, and that it was acknowledged by all its neighbours, including Turkey, before and after 1948, hence constituting an established right;<ref name=\"mfagr2\">[http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Turkey/Turkish+claims/ Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Unilateral Turkish claims in the Aegean]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305200307/http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic%2BRegions/South-Eastern%2BEurope/Turkey/Turkish%2Bclaims/ |date=5 March 2007 }}.</ref>\n* its 10-mile claim can also be interpreted as just a partial, selective use of the much wider rights guaranteed by the Law of the Sea, namely the right to a 12-mile zone both in the air and on the water;\n* Greek territorial waters are set at the 6-mile boundary only because of Turkey's [[casus belli]].\n\nThe conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations, with Turkish aircraft flying in the outer 4-mile zone of contentious airspace and Greek aircraft intercepting them. These encounters often lead to so-called \"dog-fights\", dangerous flight maneuvers that have repeatedly ended in casualties on both sides. In one instance in 1996, it has been alleged that a Turkish plane was accidentally shot down by a Greek one.<ref name=\"NErdo\u011fan\">The incident was first described as an accident. In 2004, a Greek newspaper published claims that the Turkish plane had unintentionally been shot down by the Greek one. The shootdown was confirmed by the Turkish government but denied by the Greek side [http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100010_20/05/2003_29809].</ref>\n\n===Continental shelf===\nIn the context of the Aegean dispute, the term [[continental shelf]] refers to a littoral state's exclusive right to economic exploitation of resources on and under the sea-bed, for instance [[Petroleum|oil drilling]], in an area adjacent to its [[territorial waters]] and extending into the [[International waters|High Seas]]. The width of the continental shelf is commonly defined for purposes of international law as not exceeding 200 [[nautical miles]]. Where the territories of two states lie closer opposite each other than double that distance, the division is made by the [[median line]].\nThe concept of the continental shelf is closely connected to that of an [[exclusive economic zone]], which refers to a littoral state's control over [[fishery]] and similar rights. Both concepts were developed in international law from the middle of the 20th century, and were codified in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] in 1982.\n\nThe dispute between Turkey and Greece is to what degree the Greek islands off the Turkish coast should be taken into account for determining the Greek and Turkish economic zones. Turkey argues that the notion of \"continental shelf\", by its very definition, implies that distances should be measured from the continental mainland, claiming that the sea-bed of the Aegean geographically forms a [[natural prolongation]] of the [[Anatolia]]n land mass. This would mean for Turkey to be entitled to economic zones up to the median line of the Aegean (leaving out, of course, the territorial waters around the Greek islands in its eastern half, which would remain as Greek exclaves.) Greece, on the other hand, claims that all islands must be taken into account on an equal basis. This would mean that Greece would gain the economic rights to almost the whole of the Aegean.<ref name=\"heintschel\" />\n\nIn this matter, Greece has the UN Law of the Sea on its side, although the Convention restricts the application of this rule to islands of a notable size, as opposed to small uninhabitable [[islets]] and rocks. The precise delimitation of the economic zones is the only one of all the Aegean issues where Greece has officially acknowledged that Turkey has legitimate interests that might require some international process of arbitration or compromise between the two sides.<ref name=\"mfagr2\" />\n\nTensions over the continental shelf were particularly high during the mid-1970s and again the late 1980s, when it was believed that the Aegean Sea might hold rich [[oil reserves]].

A FIR is a zone of responsibility assigned to a state within the framework of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). It relates to the responsibility for regulating civil aviation. A FIR may stretch beyond the national airspace of a country, i.e. over areas of [[high seas]], or in some cases even over the airspace of another country. It does not give the responsible state the right to prohibit flights by foreign aircraft; however, foreign aircraft are obliged to submit flight plans to the authorities administrating the FIR. Two separate disputes have arisen over flight control in the Aegean: the issue of a unilaterally proposed revision of the FIR demarcation, and the question of what rights and obligations arise from the FIR with respect to military as opposed to civil flights.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Demarcation====\nBy virtue of an agreement signed in 1952, the whole airspace over the Aegean, up to the boundary of the national airspace of Turkey, has been assigned to Athens FIR, administered by Greece. Shortly after the [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus crisis]] of 1974, Turkey unilaterally attempted to change this arrangement, issuing a notice to airmen ([[NOTAM]]) stating that it would take over the administration of the eastern half of the Aegean airspace, including the national airspace of the Greek islands in that area. Greece responded with a declaration rejecting this move, and declaring the disputed zone unsafe for aviation due to the conflicting claims to authority. This led to some disruption in civil aviation in the area. Turkey later changed its stance, and since 1980 has returned to recognizing Athens FIR in its original demarcation.<ref name=\"mfagr2\" /> In practice, the FIR demarcation is currently no longer a disputed issue.\n\n====Turkish Military overflights====\n{{As of|2009|post=,}} the current controversy over the FIR relates to the question whether the Greek authorities have a right to oversee not only civil but also military flight activities in the international parts of the Aegean airspace. According to common international practice, military aircraft normally submit flight plans to FIR authorities when moving in international airspace, just like civil aircraft do. Turkey refuses to do so, citing the ICAO charter of 1948, which explicitly restricts the scope of its regulations to civil aircraft, arguing that therefore the practice of including military aircraft in the same system is optional. Greece, in contrast, argues that it is obligatory on the basis of later regulations of the ICAO, which it claims have given states the authority to issue more wide-reaching restrictions in the interest of civil aviation safety.\n\nThis disagreement has led to similar practical consequences as the issue of 6 versus 10 miles of national airspace, as Greece considers all Turkish military flights not registered with its FIR authorities as transgressions of international air traffic regulations, and routinely has its own air force jets intercepting the Turkish ones. In popular perception in Greece, the issue of Turkish flights in the international part of Athens FIR is often confused with that of the Turkish intrusions in the disputed outer 4-mile belt of Greek airspace. However, in careful official usage, Greek authorities and media distinguish between \"violations\" (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) of the national airspace, and \"transgressions\" (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) of traffic regulations, i.e. of the FIR.\n\nOne of the routine interception maneuvers led to a fatal accident on 23 May 2006. Two Turkish [[F-16]]s and one reconnaissance [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] were flying in the international airspace over the southern Aegean at {{convert|27000|ft|m}} without having submitted flight plans to the Greek FIR authorities. They were intercepted by two Greek F-16s off the coast of the Greek island [[Karpathos]]. During the ensuing mock dog fight, a Turkish F-16 and a Greek F-16 collided midair and subsequently crashed. The pilot of the Turkish plane survived the crash, but the Greek pilot died. The incident also highlighted another aspect of the FIR issue, a dispute over conflicting claims to responsibility for maritime [[search and rescue]] operations. The Turkish pilot reportedly refused to be rescued by the Greek forces that had been dispatched to the area. After the incident, both governments expressed an interest to revive an earlier plan of establishing a direct hotline between the air force commands of both countries in order to prevent escalation of similar situations in the future.\n\n==Islands==\n[[File:Aegean islands accession.svg|thumb|Islands by date of accession to Greece]]\n[[File:Aegean islands demilitarisation.svg|thumb|Islands by demilitarization status]]\n\nWhile all the issues described so far are related to zones of influence at sea or in the air, there have also been a number of disputes related to the territories of the Greek islands themselves. These have related to the demilitarized status of some of the main islands in the area; to Turkish concerns over alleged endeavours by Greece to artificially expand settlements to previously uninhabited islets; and to the existence of alleged \"grey zones\", an undetermined number of small islands of undetermined sovereignty.\n\n===Demilitarized status===\nThe question of the [[demilitarization|demilitarized]] status of some major Greek islands is complicated by a number of facts. Several of the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean as well as the Turkish straits region were placed under various regimes of demilitarization in different international treaties. The regimes developed over time, resulting in difficulties of treaty-interpretation. However, the military status of the islands in question did not constitute a serious problem in the bilateral relations until the [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus crisis]] of 1974, after which both Greece and Turkey re-interpreted the stipulations of the treaties. Greece, claiming an inalienable right to defend itself against Turkish aggression, reinforced its military and National Guard forces in the region. Furthermore, Greece maintains the position that she has the right to demilitarize her islands in the same context as the rest of Europe, where the appliance of demilitarization statute on islands and territories ceased with the creation of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]; i.e. the cessation of demilitarization of Italy's Panteleria, Lampedusa, Lampione and Linosa islands, and West Germany from the NATO side, and the cessation of demilitarization of Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany, Hungary and Finland from the Warsaw Pact's side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onalert.gr/stories/to-dhmophfisma-sthn-tourkia-pyrodotei-entash-aigaio/55661|title=\u03a4\u03bf \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c8\u03ae\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03af \u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u0391\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03bf|website=onalert.gr|access-date=6 May 2018}}</ref> Turkey, on the other hand, denounces this as an aggressive act by Greece and as a breach of international treaties.<ref name=\"mfatr\" /> From a legal perspective, three groups of islands may be distinguished: (a) the islands right off the Turkish [[Dardanelles]] straits, i.e. [[Lemnos]] and [[Samothrace]]; (b) the [[Dodecanese]] islands in the southeast Aegean; and (c) the remaining northeast Aegean islands ([[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], and [[Ikaria]]).\n\n====Lemnos and Samothrace====\nThese islands were placed under a demilitarization statute by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923, to counterbalance the simultaneous demilitarization of the Turkish straits area (the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Bosphorus]]), [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]]. The demilitarization on the Turkish side was later abolished through the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] in 1936. Greece holds that, by superseding the relevant sections of the earlier treaty, the convention simultaneously lifted also the Greek obligations with respect to these islands. Against this, Turkey argues that the Montreux treaty did not mention the islands and has not changed their status.<ref name=\"mfatr\" /> Greece, on the other hand, cites Turkish official declarations, by the then Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Rustu Aras, to that effect made in 1936,<ref>Gazette of the Minutes of the Turkish National Assembly, volume 12. 31 July 1936, page 309</ref> assuring the Greek side that Turkey would consider the Greek obligations lifted.<ref name=\"mfagr2\" />\n\n====Dodecanese====\nThese islands were placed under a demilitarization statute after the Second World War by the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)]], when [[Italy]] ceded them to Greece. Italy had previously not been under any obligation towards Turkey in this respect. Turkey, in turn, was not a party to the 1947 treaty, having been neutral during WWII. Greece therefore holds that the obligations it incurred towards Italy and the other parties in 1947 are ''[[res inter alios acta]]'' for Turkey in the sense of Article 34 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], which states that ''a treaty does not create obligations or rights for a third country'', and that Turkey thus cannot base any claims on them. Turkey argues that the demilitarization agreement constitutes a [[status treaty]] (an ''[[objective r\u00e9gime]]''), where according to general rules of treaty law such an exclusion does not hold.\n\n====Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria====\nThe remaining islands ([[Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], and [[Ikaria]]) were placed under a partial demilitarization statute by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923. It prohibited the establishment of naval bases and fortifications, but allowed Greece to maintain a limited military contingent recruited from the local population, as well as police forces. With respect to these islands, Greece has not claimed that the treaty obligations have been formally superseded. However, in recent years it has argued that it is entitled to discount them, invoking Article 15 of the [[Charter of the United Nations]]. It argues that after the Turkish occupation of northern [[Cyprus]] and the Turkish threat of war over the 12 miles issue, re-armament is an act of legitimate self-defence.<ref name=\"mfagr2\" />\n\n===\"Grey zones\"===\n====Imia/Kardak====\n{{main|Imia/Kardak}}\n[[File:Imia with legends.svg|thumb|right|250px|Imia/Kardak]]\nThe first time a dispute between the two countries in the Aegean touched on questions of actual sovereignty over territories was in early 1996 at the tiny barren islets of [[Imia/Kardak]], situated between the [[Dodecanese]] island chain and the Turkish mainland.<ref>Sezgin, I.Can (2009): Why they did not fight?

The media of the two countries took up the issue and gave it a nationalistic turn, before the two governments even had the time to come to a full technical understanding of the true legal and geographical situation. Both governments finally adopted an intransigent stance, publicly asserting their own claims of sovereignty over the islets. The result was military escalation, which was perceived abroad as quite out of proportion with the size and significance of the rocks in question. The two countries were at the brink of war for a few days, until the crisis was defused with the help of foreign mediation.<ref>Ch. Maechling (1997): The Aegean sea: a crisis waiting to happen. ''US Naval Institute Proceeding 71\u201373.</ref>\n\nDuring the crisis and in the months following it, both governments elaborated legal arguments to support their claims to sovereignty. The arguments exchanged concerned the interpretation of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of 1923, which forms the principal basis for the legal status of territories in most of the region, as well as certain later diplomatic dealings between Turkey, Greece and Italy.\n\n====Other \"grey zones\"====\nIn the wake of the Imia crisis, the Turkish government widened its argumentation to include not only Imia but also a possibly large number of other islands and small formations across the Aegean. Since then, Turkish authorities have spoken of \"grey zones\" of undetermined sovereignty. According to the Turkish argument, these islets, while not explicitly retained under Turkish sovereignty in 1923, were also not explicitly ceded to any other country, and their sovereignty has therefore remained objectively undecided.\n\nThe Turkish government has avoided stating exactly which islets it wishes to include in this category. On various occasions, Turkish government sources have indicated that islands such as [[Pserimos]], [[Agathonisi]], [[Fourni Korseon|Fournoi]] and [[Gavdos]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/bilateral/gavdos.htm|title=Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement on the Gavdos issue|website=hri.org|access-date=6 May 2018}}</ref> (situated south of [[Crete]]) might be included. Most of them, unlike Imia/Kardak, had undeniably been in factual Greek possession, which had never previously been challenged by Turkey, and all but the final two listed below have Greek residents and infrastructure.

The Turkish Air Force routinely ignores Greek national airspace around such formations that it counts as grey zones.

Thus, the [[1987 Aegean crisis|crisis]] of 1987 was followed by a series of negotiations and agreements in [[Davos]] and [[Brussels]] in 1988. Again, after the Imia/Kardak crisis of 1996, there came an agreement over peaceful neighbourly relations reached at a meeting in [[Madrid]] in 1997. The period since about 1999 has been marked by a steady improvement of bilateral relations.\n\nFor years, the Aegean dispute has been a matter not only about conflicting claims of substance. Rather, proposed strategies of how to resolve the substantial differences have themselves constituted a matter of heated dispute. Whereas Turkey has traditionally preferred to regard the whole set of topics as a ''political'' issue, requiring bilateral political negotiation,<ref name=\"ba\u015flar\" /> Greece views them as ''separate'' and purely ''legal'' issues,<ref>[http://repo.lib.duth.gr/jspui/bitstream/123456789/10744/1/Agapakis%20Ioannes_2016.pdf Agapakis, I. \u0397 \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf], page 9 {{in lang|el}} {{Retrieved|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> requiring only the application of existing principles of international law. Turkey has advocated direct negotiation, with a view to establishing what it would regard as an equitable compromise. Greece refuses to accept any process that would put it under pressure to engage in a give-and-take over what it perceives as inalienable and unnegotiable sovereign rights. Up to the late 1990s, the only avenue of conflict resolution that Greece deemed acceptable was to submit the issues separately to the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]].\n\nThe resulting stalemate between both sides over process was partially changed after 1999, when the European summit of Helsinki opened up a path towards [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's accession to the EU]]. In the summit agreement, Turkey accepted an obligation to solve its bilateral disputes with Greece before actual accession talks would start. This was perceived as giving Greece a new tactical advantage over Turkey in determining which paths of conflict resolution to choose. During the following years, both countries held regular bilateral talks on the level of technical specialists, trying to determine possible future procedures.

This set of conflicts has had a large effect on [[Greek-Turkish relations]] since the 1970s. It has twice led to crises coming close to the outbreak of military hostilities, in 1987 and in early 1996. The issues in the Aegean fall into several categories:\n* The delimitation of the [[territorial waters]],\n* The delimitation of the [[national airspace]],\n* The delimitation of [[exclusive economic zone]]s and the use of the [[continental shelf]],\n* The role of [[flight information region]]s (FIR) for the control of military flight activity,\n* The issue of the [[demilitarized]] status assigned to some of the Greek islands in the area,\n* Turkish claims of \"grey zones\" of undetermined sovereignty over a number of small islets, most notably the islets of [[Imia/Kardak]].\n\nBetween 1998 and the early 2010s, the two countries came closer to overcoming the tensions through a series of diplomatic measures, particularly with a view to easing [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's accession to the]] [[European Union]]. However, differences over suitable diplomatic paths to a substantial solution remained unresolved, and as of 2020 tensions remain high.\n\n==Maritime and aerial zones of influence==\nSeveral of the Aegean issues deal with the delimitation of both countries' zones of influence in the air and on the sea around their respective territories. These issues owe their virulence to a geographical peculiarity of the Aegean sea and its territories. While the mainland coasts of Greece and Turkey bordering the Aegean Sea on both sides represent roughly equal shares of its total coastline, the overwhelming number of the many [[Aegean islands]] belong to Greece. In particular, there is a chain of Greek islands lined up along the Turkish west coast ([[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], and the [[Dodecanese islands]]), some of them in very close proximity to the mainland. Their existence blocks Turkey from extending any of its zones of influence beyond a few nautical miles off its coastline. As the breadth of maritime and areal zones of influence, such as the territorial waters and national airspace, are measured from the nearest territory of the state in question, including its islands, any possible extension of such zones would necessarily benefit Greece much more than Turkey proportionally.\n\nAccording to a popular perception of these issues in the two countries, Turkey is concerned that Greece might be trying to extend its zones of influence to such a degree that it would turn the Aegean effectively into a \"Greek lake\". Conversely, Greece is concerned that Turkey might try to \"occupy half of the Aegean\", i.e. establish Turkish zones of influence towards the middle of the Aegean, beyond the chain of outlying Greek islands, turning these into a kind of exclave surrounded by Turkish waters, and thus cutting them off from their motherland.<ref name=\"ba\u015flar\">Kemal Ba\u015flar (2001): Two facets of the Aegean Sea dispute: 'de lege lata' and 'de lege ferenda'.

[http://www.turkishweekly.net/pdf/aegean_sea.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822022924/http://www.turkishweekly.net/pdf/aegean_sea.pdf |date=22 August 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Territorial waters===\n\nTerritorial waters give the littoral state full control over air navigation in the airspace above, and partial control over shipping, although foreign ships (both civil and military) are normally guaranteed [[innocent passage]] through them. The standard width of territorial waters that countries are customarily entitled to has steadily increased in the course of the 20th century: from initially {{convert|3|nmi|km}} at the beginning of the century, to {{convert|6|nmi|km}}, and currently {{convert|12|nmi|km}}. The current value has been enshrined in treaty law by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] of 1982 (Art.3). In the Aegean the territorial waters claimed by both sides are still at 6 miles. The possibility of an extension to 12 miles has fuelled Turkish concerns over a possible disproportionate increase in Greek-controlled space. Turkey has refused to become a member of the convention and does not consider itself bound by it. Turkey considers the convention as ''[[res inter alios acta]],'' i.e. a treaty that can only be binding to the signing parties but not to others. Greece, which is a party to the convention, has stated that it reserves the right to apply this rule and extend its waters to 12 miles at some point in the future, although it has never actually attempted to do so. It holds that the 12-mile rule is not only treaty law but also [[customary law]], as per the wide consensus established among the international community. Against this, Turkey argues that the special geographical properties of the Aegean Sea make a strict application of the 12-mile rule in this case illicit in the interest of [[equity (law)|equity]].<ref name=\"heintschel\">Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg (1989): ''Der \u00c4g\u00e4is-Konflikt: Die Abgrenzung des Festlandsockels zwischen Griechenland und der T\u00fcrkei und das Problem der Inseln im Seev\u00f6lkerrecht. Berlin: Duncker und Humblot''. {{in lang|de}}</ref> Turkey has itself applied the customary 12-mile limit to its coasts outside the Aegean.\n\nTensions over the 12-mile question ran highest between the two countries in the early 1990s, when the Law of the Sea was going to come into force. On 9 June 1995, the Turkish parliament officially declared that unilateral action by Greece would constitute a ''[[casus belli]]'', i.e. reason to go to war. This declaration has been condemned by Greece as a violation of the [[Charter of the United Nations]], which forbids \"the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state\".<ref name=\"ba\u015flar\" />\n\n===National airspace===\nThe national airspace is normally defined as the airspace covering a state's land territory and its adjacent territorial waters. National airspace gives the sovereign state a large degree of control over foreign air traffic. While civil aviation is normally allowed passage under international treaties, foreign military and other state aircraft (unlike military vessels in the territorial waters) do not have a right to free passage through another state's national airspace.<ref name=\"Haanappel\">{{cite book|author=Haanappel, Peter P. C.|title=The Law and Policy of Air Space and Outer Space|work=Kluwer|year=2003|page=22}}</ref> The delimitation of national airspace claimed by Greece is unique, as it does not coincide with the boundary of the territorial waters. Greece claims {{convert|10|nmi|km}} of airspace, as opposed to currently 6 miles of territorial waters. Since 1974, Turkey has refused to acknowledge the validity of the outer 4-mile belt of airspace that extends beyond the Greek territorial waters. Turkey cites the statutes of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] ''(ICAO)'' of 1948, as containing a binding definition that both zones must coincide.<ref name=\"mfatr\">[http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=225&Itemid=240 Embassy of Turkey in Washington: Aegean Disputes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415091248/http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=225&Itemid=240 |date=15 April 2006 }}</ref> Against this, Greece argues that:\n* its {{convert|10|nmi|km|adj=on}} claim predates the ICAO statute, having been fixed in 1931, and that it was acknowledged by all its neighbours, including Turkey, before and after 1948, hence constituting an established right;<ref name=\"mfagr2\">[http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Turkey/Turkish+claims/ Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Unilateral Turkish claims in the Aegean]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305200307/http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic%2BRegions/South-Eastern%2BEurope/Turkey/Turkish%2Bclaims/ |date=5 March 2007 }}.</ref>\n* its 10-mile claim can also be interpreted as just a partial, selective use of the much wider rights guaranteed by the Law of the Sea, namely the right to a 12-mile zone both in the air and on the water;\n* Greek territorial waters are set at the 6-mile boundary only because of Turkey's [[casus belli]].\n\nThe conflict over military flight activities has led to a practice of continuous tactical military provocations, with Turkish aircraft flying in the outer 4-mile zone of contentious airspace and Greek aircraft intercepting them. These encounters often lead to so-called \"dog-fights\", dangerous flight maneuvers that have repeatedly ended in casualties on both sides. In one instance in 1996, it has been alleged that a Turkish plane was accidentally shot down by a Greek one.<ref name=\"NErdo\u011fan\">The incident was first described as an accident. In 2004, a Greek newspaper published claims that the Turkish plane had unintentionally been shot down by the Greek one. The shootdown was confirmed by the Turkish government but denied by the Greek side [http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100010_20/05/2003_29809].</ref>\n\n===Continental shelf===\nIn the context of the Aegean dispute, the term [[continental shelf]] refers to a littoral state's exclusive right to economic exploitation of resources on and under the sea-bed, for instance [[Petroleum|oil drilling]], in an area adjacent to its [[territorial waters]] and extending into the [[International waters|High Seas]]. The width of the continental shelf is commonly defined for purposes of international law as not exceeding 200 [[nautical miles]]. Where the territories of two states lie closer opposite each other than double that distance, the division is made by the [[median line]].\nThe concept of the continental shelf is closely connected to that of an [[exclusive economic zone]], which refers to a littoral state's control over [[fishery]] and similar rights. Both concepts were developed in international law from the middle of the 20th century, and were codified in the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] in 1982.\n\nThe dispute between Turkey and Greece is to what degree the Greek islands off the Turkish coast should be taken into account for determining the Greek and Turkish economic zones. Turkey argues that the notion of \"continental shelf\", by its very definition, implies that distances should be measured from the continental mainland, claiming that the sea-bed of the Aegean geographically forms a [[natural prolongation]] of the [[Anatolia]]n land mass. This would mean for Turkey to be entitled to economic zones up to the median line of the Aegean (leaving out, of course, the territorial waters around the Greek islands in its eastern half, which would remain as Greek exclaves.) Greece, on the other hand, claims that all islands must be taken into account on an equal basis. This would mean that Greece would gain the economic rights to almost the whole of the Aegean.<ref name=\"heintschel\" />\n\nIn this matter, Greece has the UN Law of the Sea on its side, although the Convention restricts the application of this rule to islands of a notable size, as opposed to small uninhabitable [[islets]] and rocks. The precise delimitation of the economic zones is the only one of all the Aegean issues where Greece has officially acknowledged that Turkey has legitimate interests that might require some international process of arbitration or compromise between the two sides.<ref name=\"mfagr2\" />\n\nTensions over the continental shelf were particularly high during the mid-1970s and again the late 1980s, when it was believed that the Aegean Sea might hold rich [[oil reserves]]. Turkey at that time conducted exploratory [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] research missions in parts of the disputed area. These were perceived as a dangerous provocation by Greece, which led to a buildup of mutual military threats in 1976 and again in 1987.<ref name=\"mfagr2\" />\n\n===Blue Homeland===\n{{POV section|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn 2 September 2019, [[President of Turkey|Turkey's President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]] appeared in a photograph with a map that depicted nearly half of the Aegean Sea and an area up to the eastern coast of Crete as belonging to Turkey. The map was displayed during an official ceremony at the [[National Defense University]] in Istanbul<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/244125/article/ekathimerini/news/erdogan-takes-photograph-in-front-of-blue-homeland-map |title= Erdogan takes photograph in front of 'Blue Homeland' map |work=Kathimerini |date= 2 September 2019 |access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref> and shows an area labelled as \"Turkey's blue homeland\" stretching up to the median line of the Aegean, enclosing the Greek islands in that part of the Aegean without any indication of the Greek territorial waters around them.

A FIR is a zone of responsibility assigned to a state within the framework of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). It relates to the responsibility for regulating civil aviation. A FIR may stretch beyond the national airspace of a country, i.e. over areas of [[high seas]], or in some cases even over the airspace of another country. It does not give the responsible state the right to prohibit flights by foreign aircraft; however, foreign aircraft are obliged to submit flight plans to the authorities administrating the FIR. Two separate disputes have arisen over flight control in the Aegean: the issue of a unilaterally proposed revision of the FIR demarcation, and the question of what rights and obligations arise from the FIR with respect to military as opposed to civil flights.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Demarcation====\nBy virtue of an agreement signed in 1952, the whole airspace over the Aegean, up to the boundary of the national airspace of Turkey, has been assigned to Athens FIR, administered by Greece. Shortly after the [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus crisis]] of 1974, Turkey unilaterally attempted to change this arrangement, issuing a notice to airmen ([[NOTAM]]) stating that it would take over the administration of the eastern half of the Aegean airspace, including the national airspace of the Greek islands in that area. Greece responded with a declaration rejecting this move, and declaring the disputed zone unsafe for aviation due to the conflicting claims to authority. This led to some disruption in civil aviation in the area. Turkey later changed its stance, and since 1980 has returned to recognizing Athens FIR in its original demarcation.<ref name=\"mfagr2\" /> In practice, the FIR demarcation is currently no longer a disputed issue.\n\n====Turkish Military overflights====\n{{As of|2009|post=,}} the current controversy over the FIR relates to the question whether the Greek authorities have a right to oversee not only civil but also military flight activities in the international parts of the Aegean airspace. According to common international practice, military aircraft normally submit flight plans to FIR authorities when moving in international airspace, just like civil aircraft do. Turkey refuses to do so, citing the ICAO charter of 1948, which explicitly restricts the scope of its regulations to civil aircraft, arguing that therefore the practice of including military aircraft in the same system is optional. Greece, in contrast, argues that it is obligatory on the basis of later regulations of the ICAO, which it claims have given states the authority to issue more wide-reaching restrictions in the interest of civil aviation safety.\n\nThis disagreement has led to similar practical consequences as the issue of 6 versus 10 miles of national airspace, as Greece considers all Turkish military flights not registered with its FIR authorities as transgressions of international air traffic regulations, and routinely has its own air force jets intercepting the Turkish ones. In popular perception in Greece, the issue of Turkish flights in the international part of Athens FIR is often confused with that of the Turkish intrusions in the disputed outer 4-mile belt of Greek airspace. However, in careful official usage, Greek authorities and media distinguish between \"violations\" (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) of the national airspace, and \"transgressions\" (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) of traffic regulations, i.e. of the FIR.\n\nOne of the routine interception maneuvers led to a fatal accident on 23 May 2006. Two Turkish [[F-16]]s and one reconnaissance [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] were flying in the international airspace over the southern Aegean at {{convert|27000|ft|m}} without having submitted flight plans to the Greek FIR authorities. They were intercepted by two Greek F-16s off the coast of the Greek island [[Karpathos]]. During the ensuing mock dog fight, a Turkish F-16 and a Greek F-16 collided midair and subsequently crashed. The pilot of the Turkish plane survived the crash, but the Greek pilot died. The incident also highlighted another aspect of the FIR issue, a dispute over conflicting claims to responsibility for maritime [[search and rescue]] operations. The Turkish pilot reportedly refused to be rescued by the Greek forces that had been dispatched to the area. After the incident, both governments expressed an interest to revive an earlier plan of establishing a direct hotline between the air force commands of both countries in order to prevent escalation of similar situations in the future.\n\n===Turkey-Libya maritime agreement===\n\nOn 28 November, President Erdo\u011fan signed a controversial<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gulfnews.com/opinion/op-eds/turkey-gets-a-free-pass-from-big-powers-1.68187036|title=Turkey gets a free pass from big powers|work=Gulf News|date= 2 December 2019 |access-date= 2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/03/greece-hopes-talks-with-turkeys-erdogan-will-ease-maritime-frictions|title=Greece hopes talks with Erdo\u011fan will ease maritime frictions |work=The Guardian|date= 3 December 2019 |access-date= 4 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"AmbassadorExpulsion\">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/greece-expels-libyan-ambassador-in-row-with-turkey/2019/12/06/f158bb5a-1819-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html|title=Greece expels Libyan ambassador in dispute with Turkey|work=Washington Post |date=6 December 2019 |access-date=6 December 2019}}</ref> Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in Istanbul with the Prime Minister of the [[Government of National Accord|Government of National Accord of Libya]], [[Fayez al-Sarraj]], to demarcate maritime zones in the Eastern Mediterranean on an area between Turkey and Libya, appearing to \"write [the Greek island of] Crete off the map entirely\" in the words of ''Foreign Policy''<nowiki/>'s Keith Johnson.<ref name=\"FPJohnson\" />\n\nThis agreement drew condemnation by Greece and others, including the rival [[Tobruk]] government led by the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|Libyan House of Representatives]] and [[Khalifa Haftar]], the [[European Union]], [[United States]], [[Russia]], [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Israel]], [[Germany]], [[Serbia]], and the [[Arab League]], as a violation of the International Law of the Sea and the [[House of Representatives (Libya)#Government of National Accord|Skhirat Agreement]].{{efn|See:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/356811/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-condemns-MoUs-signed-between-Turkey,-Libyan-.aspx |title= Egypt condemns MoUs signed between Turkey, Libyan PM |work=ahram online |date= 29 November 2019 |access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.in.gr/2019/11/29/politics/diplomatia/proklitiki-symfonia-tourkias-livyis-anoigei-dromo-gia-aoz/ |title=The provocative Turkey-Libya agreement opens the way for EEZ (original: \u0397 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u2013 \u039b\u03b9\u03b2\u03cd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u0391\u039f\u0396) |quote=Another attempt in the realization of the \u00abBlue Homeland\u00bb whereby Turkey seeks to seize parts of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean by asserting the position that no islands are entitled to maritime zones beyond territorial waters.

These have related to the demilitarized status of some of the main islands in the area; to Turkish concerns over alleged endeavours by Greece to artificially expand settlements to previously uninhabited islets; and to the existence of alleged \"grey zones\", an undetermined number of small islands of undetermined sovereignty.\n\n===Demilitarized status===\nThe question of the [[demilitarization|demilitarized]] status of some major Greek islands is complicated by a number of facts. Several of the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean as well as the Turkish straits region were placed under various regimes of demilitarization in different international treaties. The regimes developed over time, resulting in difficulties of treaty-interpretation. However, the military status of the islands in question did not constitute a serious problem in the bilateral relations until the [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus crisis]] of 1974, after which both Greece and Turkey re-interpreted the stipulations of the treaties. Greece, claiming an inalienable right to defend itself against Turkish aggression, reinforced its military and National Guard forces in the region. Furthermore, Greece maintains the position that she has the right to demilitarize her islands in the same context as the rest of Europe, where the appliance of demilitarization statute on islands and territories ceased with the creation of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]; i.e. the cessation of demilitarization of Italy's Panteleria, Lampedusa, Lampione and Linosa islands, and West Germany from the NATO side, and the cessation of demilitarization of Bulgaria, Romania, East Germany, Hungary and Finland from the Warsaw Pact's side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onalert.gr/stories/to-dhmophfisma-sthn-tourkia-pyrodotei-entash-aigaio/55661|title=\u03a4\u03bf \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c8\u03ae\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03af \u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u0391\u03b9\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03bf|website=onalert.gr|access-date=6 May 2018}}</ref> Turkey, on the other hand, denounces this as an aggressive act by Greece and as a breach of international treaties.<ref name=\"mfatr\" /> From a legal perspective, three groups of islands may be distinguished: (a) the islands right off the Turkish [[Dardanelles]] straits, i.e. [[Lemnos]] and [[Samothrace]]; (b) the [[Dodecanese]] islands in the southeast Aegean; and (c) the remaining northeast Aegean islands ([[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], and [[Ikaria]]).\n\n====Lemnos and Samothrace====\nThese islands were placed under a demilitarization statute by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923, to counterbalance the simultaneous demilitarization of the Turkish straits area (the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Bosphorus]]), [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]]. The demilitarization on the Turkish side was later abolished through the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] in 1936. Greece holds that, by superseding the relevant sections of the earlier treaty, the convention simultaneously lifted also the Greek obligations with respect to these islands. Against this, Turkey argues that the Montreux treaty did not mention the islands and has not changed their status.<ref name=\"mfatr\" /> Greece, on the other hand, cites Turkish official declarations, by the then Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Rustu Aras, to that effect made in 1936,<ref>Gazette of the Minutes of the Turkish National Assembly, volume 12. 31 July 1936, page 309</ref> assuring the Greek side that Turkey would consider the Greek obligations lifted.<ref name=\"mfagr2\" />\n\n====Dodecanese====\nThese islands were placed under a demilitarization statute after the Second World War by the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)]], when [[Italy]] ceded them to Greece. Italy had previously not been under any obligation towards Turkey in this respect. Turkey, in turn, was not a party to the 1947 treaty, having been neutral during WWII. Greece therefore holds that the obligations it incurred towards Italy and the other parties in 1947 are ''[[res inter alios acta]]'' for Turkey in the sense of Article 34 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], which states that ''a treaty does not create obligations or rights for a third country'', and that Turkey thus cannot base any claims on them. Turkey argues that the demilitarization agreement constitutes a [[status treaty]] (an ''[[objective r\u00e9gime]]''), where according to general rules of treaty law such an exclusion does not hold.\n\n====Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Ikaria====\nThe remaining islands ([[Lesbos]], [[Chios]], [[Samos]], and [[Ikaria]]) were placed under a partial demilitarization statute by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923. It prohibited the establishment of naval bases and fortifications, but allowed Greece to maintain a limited military contingent recruited from the local population, as well as police forces. With respect to these islands, Greece has not claimed that the treaty obligations have been formally superseded. However, in recent years it has argued that it is entitled to discount them, invoking Article 15 of the [[Charter of the United Nations]]. It argues that after the Turkish occupation of northern [[Cyprus]] and the Turkish threat of war over the 12 miles issue, re-armament is an act of legitimate self-defence.<ref name=\"mfagr2\" />\n\n===\"Grey zones\"===\n====Imia/Kardak====\n{{main|Imia/Kardak}}\n[[File:Imia with legends.svg|thumb|right|250px|Imia/Kardak]]\nThe first time a dispute between the two countries in the Aegean touched on questions of actual sovereignty over territories was in early 1996 at the tiny barren islets of [[Imia/Kardak]], situated between the [[Dodecanese]] island chain and the Turkish mainland.<ref>Sezgin, I.Can (2009): Why they did not fight?

The media of the two countries took up the issue and gave it a nationalistic turn, before the two governments even had the time to come to a full technical understanding of the true legal and geographical situation. Both governments finally adopted an intransigent stance, publicly asserting their own claims of sovereignty over the islets. The result was military escalation, which was perceived abroad as quite out of proportion with the size and significance of the rocks in question. The two countries were at the brink of war for a few days, until the crisis was defused with the help of foreign mediation.<ref>Ch. Maechling (1997): The Aegean sea: a crisis waiting to happen. ''US Naval Institute Proceeding 71\u201373.</ref>\n\nDuring the crisis and in the months following it, both governments elaborated legal arguments to support their claims to sovereignty. The arguments exchanged concerned the interpretation of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of 1923, which forms the principal basis for the legal status of territories in most of the region, as well as certain later diplomatic dealings between Turkey, Greece and Italy.\n\n====Other \"grey zones\"====\nIn the wake of the Imia crisis, the Turkish government widened its argumentation to include not only Imia but also a possibly large number of other islands and small formations across the Aegean. Since then, Turkish authorities have spoken of \"grey zones\" of undetermined sovereignty. According to the Turkish argument, these islets, while not explicitly retained under Turkish sovereignty in 1923, were also not explicitly ceded to any other country, and their sovereignty has therefore remained objectively undecided.\n\nThe Turkish government has avoided stating exactly which islets it wishes to include in this category.

Thus, the [[1987 Aegean crisis|crisis]] of 1987 was followed by a series of negotiations and agreements in [[Davos]] and [[Brussels]] in 1988. Again, after the Imia/Kardak crisis of 1996, there came an agreement over peaceful neighbourly relations reached at a meeting in [[Madrid]] in 1997. The period since about 1999 has been marked by a steady improvement of bilateral relations.\n\nFor years, the Aegean dispute has been a matter not only about conflicting claims of substance. Rather, proposed strategies of how to resolve the substantial differences have themselves constituted a matter of heated dispute. Whereas Turkey has traditionally preferred to regard the whole set of topics as a ''political'' issue, requiring bilateral political negotiation,<ref name=\"ba\u015flar\" /> Greece views them as ''separate'' and purely ''legal'' issues,<ref>[http://repo.lib.duth.gr/jspui/bitstream/123456789/10744/1/Agapakis%20Ioannes_2016.pdf Agapakis, I. \u0397 \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03bb\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf], page 9 {{in lang|el}} {{Retrieved|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> requiring only the application of existing principles of international law. Turkey has advocated direct negotiation, with a view to establishing what it would regard as an equitable compromise. Greece refuses to accept any process that would put it under pressure to engage in a give-and-take over what it perceives as inalienable and unnegotiable sovereign rights. Up to the late 1990s, the only avenue of conflict resolution that Greece deemed acceptable was to submit the issues separately to the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]].\n\nThe resulting stalemate between both sides over process was partially changed after 1999, when the European summit of Helsinki opened up a path towards [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's accession to the EU]]. In the summit agreement, Turkey accepted an obligation to solve its bilateral disputes with Greece before actual accession talks would start. This was perceived as giving Greece a new tactical advantage over Turkey in determining which paths of conflict resolution to choose. During the following years, both countries held regular bilateral talks on the level of technical specialists, trying to determine possible future procedures.

{"title_page": "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe", "text_new": "{{short description|Children's counting rhyme}}\n\"'''Eeny, meeny, miny, moe'''\" \u2014 which can be spelled a number of ways \u2014 is a children's [[counting rhyme]], used to select a person in games such as [[tag (game)|tag]], or for selecting various other things. It is one of a large group of similar rhymes in which the child who is pointed to by the chanter on the last syllable is either \"chosen\" or \"counted out\". The rhyme has existed in various forms since well before 1820<ref>I. & P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery rhymes'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 1952), p. 12.</ref> and is common in many languages with similar-sounding nonsense syllables.\n\nSince many similar counting rhymes existed earlier, it is difficult to ascertain this rhyme's exact origin.\n\n== Current versions ==\nA common modern version is:<ref name=\"Donna Wood\">{{cite book|author=Donna Wood|title=Move, Sing, Listen, Play|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCeIvb1PA14C&pg=PA75|year=1971|publisher=Alfred Music 01101 Publishing |isbn=1-4574-9680-1|page=75}}</ref>\n:Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,\n:Catch a tiger by the toe.\n:If he hollers, let him go, <!-- This is the version given in the 1971 source above; don't change it to \"yells\" or \"squeals\" without updating the source. -->\n:Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.\n\nThere are many common variations, such as replacing tiger with \"piggy\", \"tinker\", \"[[Tigger]]\",  a two-syllable name, etc.; and changing the verb in the third line to \"screams\", \"wiggles\", \"squeals\" or another verb.<ref name=opie1997 />\n\nSometimes additional lines are added at the end of the rhyme to draw out or manipulate the selection process or make it seem less predetermined, such as:\n\n:My mother told me/says to pick the very best one, and that is Y-O-U/you are [not] it<ref name=opie1997 />\n\nOr alternatively:\n\n:O-U-T spells out, you are not it.\n:Pig snout you are out.

Wie? Wo? Was?<ref name=opie1997 />\n\nVariations of this rhyme, with the nonsense/counting first line have been collected since the 1820s, such as this Scottish one:\n:Hickery Pickery, pease scon\n:Where will this young man gang?\n:He'll go east, he'll go west,\n:he'll go to the crow's nest.\n:Hickery Pickery, Hickery Pickery<ref>Charles Taylor ''Chatterings of the Pica'' (1820)</ref>\n\nMore recognizable as a variation, which even includes the 'toe' and 'olla' from Kipling's version, is:\n:Eenie, Meenie, Tipsy, toe;\n:Olla bolla Domino,\n:Okka, Pokka dominocha,\n:Hy! Pon! Tush!\nThis was one of many variants of \"counting out rhymes\" collected by Bolton in 1888.<ref>H. Bolton, H., ''The Counting-Out Rhymes of Children: Their Antiquity, Origin and Wide Distribution'' (1888)</ref>\n\nA [[Cornish language|Cornish]] version collected in 1882 runs:\n:Ena, mena, mona, mite,\n:Bascalora, bora, bite,\n:Hugga, bucca, bau,\n:Eggs, butter, cheese, bread.\n:Stick, stock, stone dead \u2013 OUT.<ref>Fred Jago ''The Glossary of the Cornish Dialect'' (1882)</ref>\n\nOne theory about the origins of the rhyme is that it is descended from [[Old English]] or [[Celtic languages|Welsh]] counting, similar to the old Shepherd's count \"[[Yan Tan Tethera]]\" or the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] \"Eena, mena, mona, mite\".<ref name=\"opie1997\" />\n\nAnother possibility is that British colonials returning from [[British India|India]] introduced a [[doggerel]] version of an Indian children's rhyme used in the game of [[carom billiards]]:\n\n:baji neki baji thou,\n:elim tilim latim gou.<ref name=\"Mishra\">Nihar Ranjan Mishra, ''From Kamakhya, a socio-cultural study''  (New Delhi: D.K. Printworld, 2004), p. 157.</ref>\n\nAnother possible origin is from a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] poem brought to the Americas by enslaved Africans: ''Iino ya mmiini maiini mo''.<ref>Bennett, P.R. (1974). Remarks on a little-known Africanism. ''Ba Shiru'', 6(1), 69-71.</ref>\n\nMost likely the origin is a centuries-old, possibly Old Saxon diviner rhyme, as was shown in 1957 by the Dutch philologist dr. Jan Naarding, supported by prof. dr. Klaas Heeroma at the Nedersaksisch Instituut (Low Saxon Institute) at the University of Groningen. They published their findings in an article called ''Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten'' (An old diviner rhyme and its relatives).<ref>J. Naarding en K.H. Heeroma, ''Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten'', in: ''Driemaandelijkse Bladen'', 1957, p. 37-43. Online at the [http://www.twentsetaalbank.nl/media/teksten/13722.html, Twentse Taalbank].</ref> In part I of the article Naarding explains, why the counting rhyme he found in ''Twents-Achterhoeks woordenboek'' (1948), a dictionary by G.H. Wanink, stands close to an early mediaeval or even older archetype. That same version was recorded in 1904 in Goor in Twente by [[Nynke van Hichtum]]:\n\n:Anne manne miene mukke,\n:Ikke tikke takke tukke,\n:Eere vrouwe grieze knech,\n:Ikke wikke wakke weg.\n\nNaarding calls its origin 'a heathen priest song, that begs the highest goddess for an oracle while divining, an oracle that may decide about life and death of a human'. The first lines can be translated as 'foremother of mankind, give me a sign, I take the cut off pieces of a branch (= the rune wands).\"\nThis explanation was revived and extended in 2016 by Goaitsen van der Vliet, founder of the Twentse Taalbank (Twents Language Bank).<ref>Goaitsen van der Vliet, ''Germaans uit Goor'', in: ''Aold Hoksebarge'', nummer 49.2 (juli 2016), p. 4216-4218.

Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 156-8.</ref>\n\nThis version was similar to that reported by [[Henry Carrington Bolton]] as the most common version among American schoolchildren in 1888.<ref>H. Bolton, H., ''The Counting-Out Rhymes of Children: Their Antiquity, Origin and Wide Distribution'' (1888, Kessinger Publishing, 2006), pp. 46 and 105.</ref> It was used in the chorus of [[Bert Fitzgibbon]]'s 1906 song \"Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo\":\n\n:Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Mo,\n:Catch a nigger by his toe,\n:If he won't work then let him go;\n:Skidum, skidee, skidoo.\n:But when you get money, your little bride\n:Will surely find out where you hide,\n:So there's the door and when I count four,\n:Then out goes you.<ref>B. Fitzgibbon, Words and music, \"Eeny, meeny, miny, mo\"\nF. B. Haviland Publishing Co (1906).</ref>\n\nIt was also used by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his \"A Counting-Out Song\", from ''Land and Sea Tales for Scouts and Guides'', published in 1935.<ref>R. Kipling, R. T. Jones, G. Orwell, eds ''The Works of Rudyard Kipling'' (Wordsworth Editions, 1994), p. 771.</ref> This may have helped popularise this version in the United Kingdom where it seems to have replaced all earlier versions until the late twentieth century.<ref name=opie1997 />\n\n[[Iona and Peter Opie]] pointed out in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' that the word \"nigger\" was common in American folk-lore, but unknown in any English traditional rhyme or proverb.<ref name=opie1997 /> This, combined with evidence of various other versions of the rhyme in the British Isles pre-dating this post-slavery version, would seem to suggest that it originated in North America, although the apparently American word \"[[Wikt:holler|holler]]\" was first recorded in written form in England in the fourteenth century, whereas according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the words \"Niger\" or \"'nigger\" were first recorded in England in the sixteenth century with their current disparaging meaning. The 'olla' and 'toe' are found as nonsense words in some nineteenth century versions of the rhyme.\n\n== Variations ==\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL VERSIONS TO THIS PAGE UNLESS THEY ARE: clearly related to the original, make some important point (more than just here's also another version) and are fully sourced.-->\nThere are considerable variations in the lyrics of the rhyme, including from early twentieth century in the United States of America:\n:Eeny, meeny, miny moe,\n:Catch a tiger by the toe.\n:If he hollers make him pay,\n:Fifty dollars every day.<ref name=opie1997 />\n\nDuring the Second World War, an AP dispatch from [[Atlanta, Georgia]] reported: \"Atlanta children were heard reciting this wartime rhyme: \n:Eenie, meenie, minie, moe,\n:Catch the emperor by his toe.\n:If he hollers make him say:\n:'I surrender to the USA.'\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1S8XwCM-EYcC&pg=PA1438|title=Black and African-American Studies: American Dilemma, the Negro Problem and Modern Democracy|last=Myrdal|first=Gunnar|date=1944|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412815116|language=en}}</ref>\n\nA distinct version of the rhyme in the United Kingdom, collected in the 1950s & 1960s, is:\n:Eeeny, meeny, miney, mo.\n:Put the baby on the po.\n:When he's done,\n:Wipe his bum.\n:And tell his mother what he's done.<ref>I.

Two versions of the rhyme were attested in court; both \"Eeny meeny miny mo, Please sit down it's time to go\" and \"Pick a seat, it's time to go\".

(1974). Remarks on a little-known Africanism. ''Ba Shiru'', 6(1), 69-71.</ref>\n\nMost likely the origin is a centuries-old, possibly Old Saxon diviner rhyme, as was shown in 1957 by the Dutch philologist dr. Jan Naarding, supported by prof. dr. Klaas Heeroma at the Nedersaksisch Instituut (Low Saxon Institute) at the University of Groningen. They published their findings in an article called ''Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten'' (An old diviner rhyme and its relatives).<ref>J. Naarding en K.H. Heeroma, ''Een oud wichellied en zijn verwanten'', in: ''Driemaandelijkse Bladen'', 1957, p. 37-43. Online at the [http://www.twentsetaalbank.nl/media/teksten/13722.html, Twentse Taalbank].</ref> In part I of the article Naarding explains, why the counting rhyme he found in ''Twents-Achterhoeks woordenboek'' (1948), a dictionary by G.H. Wanink, stands close to an early mediaeval or even older archetype. That same version was recorded in 1904 in Goor in Twente by [[Nynke van Hichtum]]:\n\n:Anne manne miene mukke,\n:Ikke tikke takke tukke,\n:Eere vrouwe grieze knech,\n:Ikke wikke wakke weg.\n\nNaarding calls its origin 'a heathen priest song, that begs the highest goddess for an oracle while divining, an oracle that may decide about life and death of a human'. The first lines can be translated as 'foremother of mankind, give me a sign, I take the cut off pieces of a branch (= the rune wands).\"\nThis explanation was revived and extended in 2016 by Goaitsen van der Vliet, founder of the Twentse Taalbank (Twents Language Bank).<ref>Goaitsen van der Vliet, ''Germaans uit Goor'', in: ''Aold Hoksebarge'', nummer 49.2 (juli 2016), p. 4216-4218.
