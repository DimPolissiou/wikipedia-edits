In [[Medieval Europe]] feudal territory rulers from the king downward tried to enforce exclusive rights of the nobility to hunt and fish on the lands they ruled. Poaching was deemed a serious crime punishable by imprisonment, but the enforcement was comparably weak until the 16th century. Peasants were still allowed to continue small game hunting, but the right of the nobility to hunt was restricted in the 16th century and transferred to land ownership. The low quality of guns made it necessary to approach to the game as close as {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the restrictions on hunting and shooting rights on private property were being enforced by gamekeepers and foresters. They denied shared usages of forests, e.g. [[Resin worker|resin collection]] and [[wood pasture]] and the peasant's right to hunt and fish.

The reform of hunting law in 1849 restricted legal hunting to rich land owners and members of the bourgeoisie able to pay hunting fees; this led to disappointment among the general public, who continued to view poachers favourably.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some of the frontier regions, where smuggling was important, showed especially strong resistance to this development. In 1849, the Bavarian military forces were asked to occupy a number of municipalities on the frontier with Austria. Both in Wallgau (today a part of [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]) and in Lackenh\u00e4user in the Bavarian forest each household had to feed and accommodate one soldier for a month as part of a military mission to quell the uproar. The people of Lackenh\u00e4user had several skirmishes with Austrian foresters and military that started due to poached deer. The well-armed people set against the representatives of the state were known as ''bold poachers'' (kecke Wilderer).<ref name=Krauss1997/>\nSome poachers and their violent deaths, like [[Matthias Klostermayr]] (1736\u20131771), [[Georg Jennerwein]] (1848\u20131877) and [[Pius Walder]]&nbsp;(1952\u20131982) gained notoriety and had a strong cultural impact till the present.<ref name=BSZ2014 /> Poaching was being used then as a dare. It had a certain erotic connotation, as in [[Franz Schubert]]'s Hunter's love song, (1828, [[Schubert Thematic Catalogue]]&nbsp;909). The lyrics of&nbsp;[[Franz von Schober]]s connected unlimited hunting with the pursuit of love. Further poaching related legends and stories include the 1821 opera [[Freisch\u00fctz]] till [[Wolfgang Franz von Kobell]]'s 1871 story about the Brandner Kasper, a [[Tegernsee]] locksmith and poacher achieving a special deal with the [[Death (personification)|grim reaper]].<sup>[[Wolfgang Franz von Kobell#cite note-5|[5]]]</sup>\n\nWhile poachers had strong local support until the early 20th century, Walder's case showed a significant change in attitudes.

This operated outside the [[common law]], and served to protect game animals and their forest habitat from hunting by the common people of England and reserved hunting rights for the new French-speaking Anglo-Norman aristocracy. Henceforth hunting of game in royal forests by commoners or in other words poaching, was invariably punishable by death by hanging. In 1087, a poem called \"[[The Rime of King William]]\" contained in the [[Peterborough Chronicle]], expressed English indignation at the severe new laws. Poaching was romanticised in literature from the time of the [[ballad]]s of [[Robin Hood]], as an aspect of the \"greenwood\" of [[Merry England]]; in one tale, Robin Hood is depicted as offering King [[Richard the Lion Heart]] venison from deer illegally hunted in the Sherwood Forest, the King overlooking the fact that this hunting was a capital offence.  The widespread acceptance of this common criminal activity is encapsulated in the observation ''Non est inquirendum, unde venit venison'' (\"It is not to be inquired, whence comes the venison\"), made by [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]] in his ''Traitte de la v\u00e9nerie''.<ref>Bud\u00e9, G.

Usually, bushmeat is considered a subset of poaching due to the hunting of animals regardless of the laws that conserve certain species of animals. Poachers hunt for bushmeat for both consumption and for profit.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe conclusion of the study found that many families would consume more bushmeat if there weren't protein alternatives such as fish and the further away the families were from the reserve, the less likely they were to illegally hunt the wildlife for bushmeat. Finally, families were more likely to hunt for bushmeat right before harvest season and during heavy rains, as before the harvest season, there is not much agricultural work and heavy rainfall obscures human tracks, making it easier for poachers to get away with their crimes.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPoverty seems to be a large impetus to cause people to poach, something that affects both residents in Africa and Asia. For example, in Thailand, there are anecdotal accounts of the desire for a better life for children, which drive rural poachers to take the risk of poaching even though they dislike exploiting the wildlife.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book |title=Tigers of the World (2nd Edition) |last=Nyhus |first=Philip J. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8155-1570-8 |location= |pages=118 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother major cause of poaching is due to the cultural high demand of wildlife products, such as ivory, that are seen as symbols of status and wealth in China. According to Joseph Vandegrift, China saw an unusual spike in demand for ivory in the twenty-first century due to the economic boom that allowed more middle-class Chinese to have a higher purchasing power that incentivized them to show off their newfound wealth using ivory, a rare commodity since the Han Dynasty.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Elephant Poaching: CITES Failure to Combat the Growth in Chinese Demand for Ivory |journal=Virginia Environmental Law Journal |volume=}}</ref>\n\nIn China, there are problems with wildlife conservation, specifically relating to tigers. Several authors collaborated on a piece titled \"Public attitude toward tiger farming and tiger conservation in Beijing, China\", exploring the option of whether it would be a better policy to raise tigers on a farm or put them in a wildlife conservation habitat to preserve the species. Conducting a survey on 1,058 residents of Beijing, China with 381 being university students and the other 677 being regular citizens, they tried to gauge public opinion about tigers and conservation efforts for them. They were asked questions regarding the value of tigers in relations to ecology, science, education, aestheticism, and culture. However, one reason emerged as to why tigers are still highly demanded in illegal trading: culturally, they are still status symbols of wealth for the upper class, and they are still thought to have mysterious medicinal and healthcare effects.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal |title=Public attitude toward tiger farming and tiger conservation in Beijing, China. |journal=Animal Conservation |volume=18 |issue=4 |doi=10.1111/acv.12181 |year=2015 |pages=367\u2013376 |author1=Liu, Z. |author2=Jiang, Z. |author3=Li, C. |author4=Fang, H. |author5=Ping, X. |author6=Luo, Z. |author7=Tang, S. |author8=Li, L. |author9=Meng, Z. |author10=Zeng, Y.|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a3942545449cebc9b6723cb4ae0d48d095c4c7ea }}</ref>\n\n== Effects of poaching ==\n[[File:Rhino Killings.jpg|thumb|Memorial to rhinos killed by poachers near [[St Lucia Estuary]], South Africa]]\n{{Further|Species affected by poaching}}\nThe detrimental effects of poaching can include:\n* [[Defaunation]] of forests: [[predator]]s, [[herbivore]]s and fruit-eating [[vertebrate]]s cannot recover as fast as they are removed from a forest; as their populations decline, the pattern of [[seed predation]] and [[seed dispersal|dispersal]] is altered; tree species with large seeds progressively dominate a forest, while small-seeded plant species become [[Local extinction|locally extinct]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Redford |first=K. |title=The Empty Forest |journal=BioScience |date=1992 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=412\u2013422 |jstor=1311860 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111203443/http://www.biology.ufl.edu/courses/pcb5356/2011fall/kitajima/Redford1992Biosci.pdf|doi=10.2307/1311860 }}</ref>\n* Reduction of animal populations in the wild and possible extinction.\n* The effective size of protected areas is reduced as poachers use the edges of these areas as [[open-access resource]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dobson, A. |author2=Lynes, L. |year=2008 |title=How does poaching affect the size of national parks? |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=177\u2013180|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2007.08.019 |pmid=18313793 }}</ref>\n* [[Wildlife tourism]] destinations face a negative publicity; those holding a permit for wildlife-based land uses, tourism-based tour and [[lodging]] operators lose income; employment opportunities are reduced.<ref name=Lindsey2012 />\n* Emergence of [[zoonotic disease]]s caused by transmission of highly variable [[retrovirus]] chains:\n** Outbreaks of the [[Ebola virus]] in the [[Congo Basin]] and in [[Gabon]] in the 1990s have been associated with the butchering of [[Pan (genus)|apes]] and consumption of their meat.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Georges-Courbot |first1=M.

The former deals with people desiring a product due to many other people buying it, while the latter is similar but with one distinct difference: people will clamour to buy something if it denotes wealth that only a few elites could possibly afford. Therefore, the snob effect would offset some of the gains made by anti-poaching laws, regulations, or practices: if a portion of the supply is cut off, the rarity and price of the object would increase, and only a select few would have the desire and purchasing power for it. While approaches to dilute mitigate poaching from a supply-side may not be the best option as people can become more willing to purchase rarer items, especially in countries gaining more wealth and therefore higher demand for illicit goods\u2014Frederick Chen still advocates that we should also focus on exploring ways to reduce the demand for these goods to better stop the problem of poaching.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chen |first=Frederick |date=2016-01-01 |title=Poachers and Snobs: Demand for Rarity and the Effects of Antipoaching Policies |journal=Conservation Letters |language=en |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=65\u201369 |doi=10.1111/conl.12181 |issn=1755-263X}}</ref> Indeed, there is some evidence that interventions to reduce consumer demand may be more effective for combatting poaching than continually increased policing to catch poachers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Holden|first=M.

This multi-lateral approach include working with different agencies to fight and prevent poaching since organized crime syndicates benefit from tiger poaching and trafficking; therefore, there is a need to raise social awareness and implement more protection and investigative techniques. For example, conservation groups raised more awareness amongst park rangers and the local communities to understand the impact of tiger poaching\u2014they achieved this through targeted advertising that would impact the main audience. Targeting advertising using more violent imagery to show the disparity between tigers in nature and as a commodity made a great impact on the general population to combat poaching and indifference towards this problem. The use of spokespeople such as Jackie Chan and other famous Asian actors and models who advocated against poaching also helped the conservation movement for tigers too.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn July 2019, rhino horns encased in plaster were seized in [[Vietnam]] that were being trafficked from the [[United Arab Emirates]].

Conservationists hope the new emerging multi-lateral approach, which would include the public, conservation groups, and the police, will be successful for the future of these animals.{{citation needed |date=September 2019}}\n\n=== United States of America ===\nSome [[game warden]]s have made use of robotic decoy animals placed in high visibility areas to draw out poachers for arrest after the decoys are shot.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jones, M. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1683&dat=20010402&id=vr0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lDgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3886,2120467 |title=Animal robots help enforce hunting laws |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |year=2001}}</ref> Decoys with robotics to mimic natural movements are also in use by law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Neal |first1=M. |title=Poachers are still getting duped into shooting robot Deer |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/poachers-are-still-getting-duped-into-shooting-robot-deer |website=Motherboard |publisher=Vice |accessdate=12 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602101402/http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/poachers-are-still-getting-duped-into-shooting-robot-deer |archivedate=2 June 2016 }}</ref> The [[ProtectedSeas|Marine Monitor]] radar system watches sensitive marine areas for illicit vessel movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalconservation.org/news/mpa-protection-mission-isla-de-la-plata-machalilla-national-park/|title=MPA Protection Mission - Isla de la Plata, Machalilla National Park, Ecuador|last=|first=|date=February 8, 2019|website=Global Conservation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Europe ===\nSome poachers and their violent ends, as Matthias Klostermayr (1736\u20131771), Georg Jennerwein (1848\u20131877)[11] and Pius Walder (1952\u20131982) gained notoriety and had a strong cultural impact till the present. Poaching was being used then as a dare. It had a certain erotic connotation, as e.g. in Franz Schubert's Hunter's love song, (1828, D 909). The lyrics of Franz von Schobers connected unlimited hunting with the pursuit of love. Further poaching related legends and stories include the 1821 opera Freisch\u00fctz till Wolfgang Franz von Kobell's 1871 story about the Brandner Kasper, a Tegernsee locksmith and poacher achieving a special deal with the grim reaper.[5]\n\nWhile poachers had strong local support until the early 20th century, Walder's case showed a significant change in attitudes. Urban citizens still had some sympathy for the hillbilly rebel, while the local community were much less in favor.[79]\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Animals|Ecology}}\n* [[Cruelty to animals]]\n* [[Federal and state environmental relations]]\n* [[Game law]]\n* [[Game preservation]]\n* [[Ivory trade]]\n* [[Tiger poaching in India]]\n* [[Wildlife trade]]\n* [[African vulture trade|African Vulture Trade]]\n* [[Environmental crime]]\n* [[Rhino poaching in Southern Africa]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=Jacoby, K. |year=2001 |title=Crimes against Nature: Squatters, Poachers, Thieves, and the Hidden History of American Conservation |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=9780520282292}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Archer, J.

Poaching was deemed a serious crime punishable by imprisonment, but the enforcement was comparably weak until the 16th century. Peasants were still allowed to continue small game hunting, but the right of the nobility to hunt was restricted in the 16th century and transferred to land ownership. The low quality of guns made it necessary to approach to the game as close as {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

This operated outside the [[common law]], and served to protect game animals and their forest habitat from hunting by the common people of England and reserved hunting rights for the new French-speaking Anglo-Norman aristocracy. Henceforth hunting of game in royal forests by commoners or in other words poaching, was invariably punishable by death by hanging. In 1087, a poem called \"[[The Rime of King William]]\" contained in the [[Peterborough Chronicle]], expressed English indignation at the severe new laws. Poaching was romanticised in literature from the time of the [[ballad]]s of [[Robin Hood]], as an aspect of the \"greenwood\" of [[Merry England]]; in one tale, Robin Hood is depicted as offering King [[Richard the Lion Heart]] venison from deer illegally hunted in the Sherwood Forest, the King overlooking the fact that this hunting was a capital offence.  The widespread acceptance of this common criminal activity is encapsulated in the observation ''Non est inquirendum, unde venit venison'' (\"It is not to be inquired, whence comes the venison\"), made by [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]] in his ''Traitte de la v\u00e9nerie''.<ref>Bud\u00e9, G.

They decided to interview people from multiple villages who lived near the Ugalla Game Reserve. To make sure the interview and their results were unbiased, they randomly picked several villages and several families from each village to interview.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal |last=MacColl |first=Andrew |last2=Wilfred |first2=Paul |title=Local Perspectives on Factors Influencing the Extent of Wildlife Poaching for Bushmeat in a Game Reserve, Western Tanzania |journal=International Journal of Conservation Science |volume=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the major cases of poaching is for bushmeat, or meat consumed from non-domesticated species of animals from all sorts of classes such as mammals or birds. Usually, bushmeat is considered a subset of poaching due to the hunting of animals regardless of the laws that conserve certain species of animals. Poachers hunt for bushmeat for both consumption and for profit.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe conclusion of the study found that many families would consume more bushmeat if there weren't protein alternatives such as fish and the further away the families were from the reserve, the less likely they were to illegally hunt the wildlife for bushmeat. Finally, families were more likely to hunt for bushmeat right before harvest season and during heavy rains, as before the harvest season, there is not much agricultural work and heavy rainfall obscures human tracks, making it easier for poachers to get away with their crimes.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPoverty seems to be a large impetus to cause people to poach, something that affects both residents in Africa and Asia. For example, in Thailand, there are anecdotal accounts of the desire for a better life for children, which drive rural poachers to take the risk of poaching even though they dislike exploiting the wildlife.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book |title=Tigers of the World (2nd Edition) |last=Nyhus |first=Philip J. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8155-1570-8 |location= |pages=118 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother major cause of poaching is due to the cultural high demand of wildlife products, such as ivory, that are seen as symbols of status and wealth in China. According to Joseph Vandegrift, China saw an unusual spike in demand for ivory in the twenty-first century due to the economic boom that allowed more middle-class Chinese to have a higher purchasing power that incentivized them to show off their newfound wealth using ivory, a rare commodity since the Han Dynasty.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Elephant Poaching: CITES Failure to Combat the Growth in Chinese Demand for Ivory |journal=Virginia Environmental Law Journal |volume=}}</ref>\n\nIn China, there are problems with wildlife conservation, specifically relating to tigers. Several authors collaborated on a piece titled \"Public attitude toward tiger farming and tiger conservation in Beijing, China\", exploring the option of whether it would be a better policy to raise tigers on a farm or put them in a wildlife conservation habitat to preserve the species. Conducting a survey on 1,058 residents of Beijing, China with 381 being university students and the other 677 being regular citizens, they tried to gauge public opinion about tigers and conservation efforts for them. They were asked questions regarding the value of tigers in relations to ecology, science, education, aestheticism, and culture. However, one reason emerged as to why tigers are still highly demanded in illegal trading: culturally, they are still status symbols of wealth for the upper class, and they are still thought to have mysterious medicinal and healthcare effects.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal |title=Public attitude toward tiger farming and tiger conservation in Beijing, China. |journal=Animal Conservation |volume=18 |issue=4 |doi=10.1111/acv.12181 |year=2015 |pages=367\u2013376 |author1=Liu, Z. |author2=Jiang, Z. |author3=Li, C. |author4=Fang, H. |author5=Ping, X. |author6=Luo, Z. |author7=Tang, S. |author8=Li, L. |author9=Meng, Z. |author10=Zeng, Y.|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a3942545449cebc9b6723cb4ae0d48d095c4c7ea }}</ref>\n\n== Effects of poaching ==\n[[File:Rhino Killings.jpg|thumb|Memorial to rhinos killed by poachers near [[St Lucia Estuary]], South Africa]]\n{{Further|Species affected by poaching}}\nThe detrimental effects of poaching can include:\n* [[Defaunation]] of forests: [[predator]]s, [[herbivore]]s and fruit-eating [[vertebrate]]s cannot recover as fast as they are removed from a forest; as their populations decline, the pattern of [[seed predation]] and [[seed dispersal|dispersal]] is altered; tree species with large seeds progressively dominate a forest, while small-seeded plant species become [[Local extinction|locally extinct]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Redford |first=K. |title=The Empty Forest |journal=BioScience |date=1992 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=412\u2013422 |jstor=1311860 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111203443/http://www.biology.ufl.edu/courses/pcb5356/2011fall/kitajima/Redford1992Biosci.pdf|doi=10.2307/1311860 }}</ref>\n* Reduction of animal populations in the wild and possible extinction.\n* The effective size of protected areas is reduced as poachers use the edges of these areas as [[open-access resource]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dobson, A. |author2=Lynes, L. |year=2008 |title=How does poaching affect the size of national parks? |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=177\u2013180|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2007.08.019 |pmid=18313793 }}</ref>\n* [[Wildlife tourism]] destinations face a negative publicity; those holding a permit for wildlife-based land uses, tourism-based tour and [[lodging]] operators lose income; employment opportunities are reduced.<ref name=Lindsey2012 />\n* Emergence of [[zoonotic disease]]s caused by transmission of highly variable [[retrovirus]] chains:\n** Outbreaks of the [[Ebola virus]] in the [[Congo Basin]] and in [[Gabon]] in the 1990s have been associated with the butchering of [[Pan (genus)|apes]] and consumption of their meat.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Georges-Courbot |first1=M.

The former deals with people desiring a product due to many other people buying it, while the latter is similar but with one distinct difference: people will clamour to buy something if it denotes wealth that only a few elites could possibly afford. Therefore, the snob effect would offset some of the gains made by anti-poaching laws, regulations, or practices: if a portion of the supply is cut off, the rarity and price of the object would increase, and only a select few would have the desire and purchasing power for it. While approaches to dilute mitigate poaching from a supply-side may not be the best option as people can become more willing to purchase rarer items, especially in countries gaining more wealth and therefore higher demand for illicit goods\u2014Frederick Chen still advocates that we should also focus on exploring ways to reduce the demand for these goods to better stop the problem of poaching.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chen |first=Frederick |date=2016-01-01 |title=Poachers and Snobs: Demand for Rarity and the Effects of Antipoaching Policies |journal=Conservation Letters |language=en |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=65\u201369 |doi=10.1111/conl.12181 |issn=1755-263X}}</ref> Indeed, there is some evidence that interventions to reduce consumer demand may be more effective for combatting poaching than continually increased policing to catch poachers.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Holden|first=M.

This multi-lateral approach include working with different agencies to fight and prevent poaching since organized crime syndicates benefit from tiger poaching and trafficking; therefore, there is a need to raise social awareness and implement more protection and investigative techniques. For example, conservation groups raised more awareness amongst park rangers and the local communities to understand the impact of tiger poaching\u2014they achieved this through targeted advertising that would impact the main audience. Targeting advertising using more violent imagery to show the disparity between tigers in nature and as a commodity made a great impact on the general population to combat poaching and indifference towards this problem. The use of spokespeople such as Jackie Chan and other famous Asian actors and models who advocated against poaching also helped the conservation movement for tigers too.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn July 2019, rhino horns encased in plaster were seized in [[Vietnam]] that were being trafficked from the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Despite the ban on trade since the 1970s, poaching level of rhino horns has risen over the last decade, leading the rhino population into crisis.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vietnam seizes 125kg of rhino horn worth \u00a36m concealed in plaster shipment |accessdate=29 July 2019 |newspaper=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/29/vietnam-seizes-125-kg-rhino-horn-worth-6m-concealed-plaster/}}</ref>\n\nPoaching has many causes in both Africa and China. The issue of poaching is not a simple one to solve as traditional methods to counter poaching have not taken into the account the poverty levels that drive some poachers and the lucrative profits made by organized crime syndicates who deal in illegal wildlife trafficking. Conservationists hope the new emerging multi-lateral approach, which would include the public, conservation groups, and the police, will be successful for the future of these animals.{{citation needed |date=September 2019}}\n\n=== United States of America ===\nSome [[game warden]]s have made use of robotic decoy animals placed in high visibility areas to draw out poachers for arrest after the decoys are shot.<ref>{{cite news |author=Jones, M. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1683&dat=20010402&id=vr0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lDgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3886,2120467 |title=Animal robots help enforce hunting laws |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |year=2001}}</ref> Decoys with robotics to mimic natural movements are also in use by law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Neal |first1=M. |title=Poachers are still getting duped into shooting robot Deer |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/poachers-are-still-getting-duped-into-shooting-robot-deer |website=Motherboard |publisher=Vice |accessdate=12 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602101402/http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/poachers-are-still-getting-duped-into-shooting-robot-deer |archivedate=2 June 2016 }}</ref> The [[ProtectedSeas|Marine Monitor]] radar system watches sensitive marine areas for illicit vessel movement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalconservation.org/news/mpa-protection-mission-isla-de-la-plata-machalilla-national-park/|title=MPA Protection Mission - Isla de la Plata, Machalilla National Park, Ecuador|last=|first=|date=February 8, 2019|website=Global Conservation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Animals|Ecology}}\n* [[Cruelty to animals]]\n* [[Federal and state environmental relations]]\n* [[Game law]]\n* [[Game preservation]]\n* [[Ivory trade]]\n* [[Tiger poaching in India]]\n* [[Wildlife trade]]\n* [[African vulture trade|African Vulture Trade]]\n* [[Environmental crime]]\n* [[Rhino poaching in Southern Africa]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=Jacoby, K. |year=2001 |title=Crimes against Nature: Squatters, Poachers, Thieves, and the Hidden History of American Conservation |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=9780520282292}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Archer, J.

He was defeated in the redefined [[Newton Abbot (UK Parliament constituency)|Newton Abbot]] constituency in [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 election]]. In 2013 he fought and won the [[Devon County Council]] seat of Teignmouth Town, but four years later, on 4 May 2017, he lost his seat to Sylvia Russell, a Conservative,  by just 22 votes.\n\n==Early life==\nRichard Younger-Ross was born in Surrey in 1953. He attended Walton County Secondary School for Boys (a [[Secondary modern school|secondary modern]], which became Ambleside Junior School, then [http://www.oak.surrey.sch.uk Walton Oak] primary school) on ''Ambleside Avenue'' in [[Walton on Thames]], [[Brooklands College|Brooklands Technical College]] on ''Heath Road'' in [[Weybridge]], then Ewell Technical College (now called [[North East Surrey College Of Technology]] - NESCOT) in [[Ewell]].

This proposal is being considered by the Government following the Walker Report.\n\nIn 2006, Younger-Ross proposed a Ten Minute Rule Bill restricting Sunday trading hours in the UK for shops, arguing that without such legislation the British people would lose \"rhythm of life\" (House of Commons Debate, 24 May 2006). He is a member of the [[Beveridge Group]].<ref>[http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/about-us/about-us.html About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705215144/http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/about-us/about-us.html |date=5 July 2008 }} - ''The Beveridge Group'' 2007-10-28</ref>\n\nIn 2008 he proposed that Park Home Site owners should be \"fit and proper people\", a proposal currently being consulted on by the Government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Personal life==\nYounger-Ross moved to [[Teignmouth]], [[Devon]] in 1989, with his wife, Susan Younger, whom he married in 1982 in Oxford. He is a [[Roman Catholic]], attending a church in Teignmouth.\n\n==Expenses==\nOn 16 May 2009, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' released details of several of Younger-Ross's parliamentary expense claims.<ref name=\"telegraph1\">{{cite news|last=Beckford |first=Martin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5330878/Richard-Younger-Ross-spent-1235-on-four-mirrors-and-bought-Don-Juan-bookcase-MPs-expenses.html |title=Richard Younger-Ross spent \u00a31,235 on four mirrors and bought 'Don Juan' bookcase : MPs' expenses |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}</ref> The disclosures were part of the newspaper's wider [[disclosure of expenses of British Members of Parliament]].\n\nYounger-Ross was reported to have claimed more than \u00a31200 for 5 mirrors to furnish his [[London]] flat, on which the rent was \u00a31566 per month. A further \u00a31475 was claimed for a single [[chest of drawers]]. These claims were submitted and approved by the Fees Office despite the fact that it was in excess of the so-called \"[[John Lewis List]]\". It was not issued to MPs but stated that MPs should not spend more than \u00a3500 on chests of drawers or more than \u00a3300 on a mirror.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7295150.stm |title=In full: MPs' 'John Lewis list' |publisher=BBC News |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}</ref> The Telegraph interpreted the claims as excessive, stating that they were \"in clear breach of guidelines that state members must not use public funds\" for \"antique or luxury\" goods.<ref name=\"telegraph1\"/> When questioned on Sky TV, he apologised saying that perceptions of what was luxury depended on your background and income, \"clearly we have got it wrong\".\n\nOn 21 March 2010, Younger-Ross was forced to apologise and pay \u00a34,000 to Parliament after breaching commons rules over a payment he accepted relating to his second home. Younger-Ross had accepted \u00a38,000 windfall money from the new landlord of his second home in Dolphin Square, London. In a letter to Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee, Mr Younger-Ross said: \"I wholly accept the report and its conclusions and unreservedly apologise.\" MPs had been told they could accept this payment by the fees office. Many MPs profited from using the allowance to assist them buying a home, the House of Commons considered this to be acceptable although they may profit by tens of thousands of pounds on the sale of the property.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bell |first=John L |url=http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/news/Teign-MP-apology-expenses-scandal/article-1962868-detail/article.html |title=Teign MP in apology over expenses scandal |publisher=This is Exeter |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404063546/http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/news/Teign-MP-apology-expenses-scandal/article-1962868-detail/article.html |archivedate=4 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSubsequent to this, the Telegraph reported that a number of MPs had secretly requested refunds of their initially repaid expense claims after demands received from the House of Commons were lower than expected. Mr Younger-Ross received the fourth largest refund, an amount of \u00a33,170.92, thereby effectively negating the entirety of his initial payment.<ref>{{cite news|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/7946745/MPs-expenses-disgraced-MPs-obtain-secret-refunds.html |title=MPs' expenses: disgraced MPs obtain secret refunds |publisher=The Telegraph |date=15 August 2010 |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Hunting==\nYounger-Ross had a mixed voting record on hunting, rebelling against his party whips and voting against the fox hunting ban during the amendment stage of the bill and earlier abstaining on the key vote. He argued that although he disliked hunting, he would not vote for a ban which did not compensate those who had legitimately made a living from it.

This proposal is being considered by the Government following the Walker Report.\n\nIn 2006, Younger-Ross proposed a Ten Minute Rule Bill restricting Sunday trading hours in the UK for shops, arguing that without such legislation the British people would lose \"rhythm of life\" (House of Commons Debate, 24 May 2006). He is a member of the [[Beveridge Group]].<ref>[http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/about-us/about-us.html About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705215144/http://www.beveridgegroup.org.uk/about-us/about-us.html |date=5 July 2008 }} - ''The Beveridge Group'' 2007-10-28</ref>\n\nIn 2008 he proposed that Park Home Site owners should be \"fit and proper people\", a proposal currently being consulted on by the Government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Personal life==\nYounger-Ross moved to [[Teignmouth]], [[Devon]] in 1989, with his wife, Susan Younger, whom he married in 1982 in Oxford. He is a [[Roman Catholic]], attending a church in Teignmouth.\n\n==Expenses==\nOn 16 May 2009, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' released details of several of Younger-Ross's parliamentary expense claims.<ref name=\"telegraph1\">{{cite news|last=Beckford |first=Martin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5330878/Richard-Younger-Ross-spent-1235-on-four-mirrors-and-bought-Don-Juan-bookcase-MPs-expenses.html |title=Richard Younger-Ross spent \u00a31,235 on four mirrors and bought 'Don Juan' bookcase : MPs' expenses |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}</ref> The disclosures were part of the newspaper's wider [[disclosure of expenses of British Members of Parliament]].\n\nYounger-Ross was reported to have claimed more than \u00a31200 for 5 mirrors to furnish his [[London]] flat, on which the rent was \u00a31566 per month. A further \u00a31475 was claimed for a single [[chest of drawers]]. These claims were submitted and approved by the Fees Office despite the fact that it was in excess of the so-called \"[[John Lewis List]]\". It was not issued to MPs but stated that MPs should not spend more than \u00a3500 on chests of drawers or more than \u00a3300 on a mirror.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7295150.stm |title=In full: MPs' 'John Lewis list' |publisher=BBC News |date=13 March 2008 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}</ref> The Telegraph interpreted the claims as excessive, stating that they were \"in clear breach of guidelines that state members must not use public funds\" for \"antique or luxury\" goods.<ref name=\"telegraph1\"/> When questioned on Sky TV, he apologised saying that perceptions of what was luxury depended on your background and income, \"clearly we have got it wrong\".\n\nOn 21 March 2010, Younger-Ross was forced to apologise and pay \u00a34,000 to Parliament after breaching commons rules over a payment he accepted relating to his second home. Younger-Ross had accepted \u00a38,000 windfall money from the new landlord of his second home in Dolphin Square, London. In a letter to Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee, Mr Younger-Ross said: \"I wholly accept the report and its conclusions and unreservedly apologise.\" MPs had been told they could accept this payment by the fees office. Many MPs profited from using the allowance to assist them buying a home, the House of Commons considered this to be acceptable although they may profit by tens of thousands of pounds on the sale of the property.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bell |first=John L |url=http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/news/Teign-MP-apology-expenses-scandal/article-1962868-detail/article.html |title=Teign MP in apology over expenses scandal |publisher=This is Exeter |date=1 April 2010 |accessdate=2011-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404063546/http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/news/Teign-MP-apology-expenses-scandal/article-1962868-detail/article.html |archivedate=4 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSubsequent to this, the Telegraph reported that a number of MPs had secretly requested refunds of their initially repaid expense claims after demands received from the House of Commons were lower than expected. Mr Younger-Ross received the fourth largest refund, an amount of \u00a33,170.92, thereby effectively negating the entirety of his initial payment.<ref>{{cite news|last=Prince |first=Rosa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/7946745/MPs-expenses-disgraced-MPs-obtain-secret-refunds.html |title=MPs' expenses: disgraced MPs obtain secret refunds |publisher=The Telegraph |date=15 August 2010 |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Hunting==\nYounger-Ross had a mixed voting record on hunting, rebelling against his party whips and voting against the fox hunting ban during the amendment stage of the bill and earlier abstaining on the key vote. He argued that although he disliked hunting, he would not vote for a ban which did not compensate those who had legitimately made a living from it.

A [[Normans|Norman]], he was a member of the cathedral clergy at [[Rouen]] before becoming a [[Clerk#History and etymology|royal clerk]] under King [[William I of England]] and subsequently his son King [[William II of England|William II Rufus]]. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the [[Bishop of Hereford|Bishopric of Hereford]] in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, [[Henry I of England]], within days of William's death.\n\nSoon after Henry's coronation Gerard was appointed to the recently vacant [[Diocese of York|see of York]], and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the [[Diocese of Canterbury|see of Canterbury]] concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure [[The Pope|papal]] recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in [[Scotland]], but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the [[Investiture Controversy]] between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.\n\nGerard was a patron of learning, to the extent that he urged at least one of his clergy to study [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a language not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of [[astrology]], which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside [[York Minster]] after his sudden death in 1108.

As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Antioch]], who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure.<ref name=Cantor238/> In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did.<ref name=Thurstan26>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' p. 26</ref> At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute.<ref name=Cantor238/>\n\nGerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office.<ref name=Vaughn334>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' pp. 334\u2013336</ref> Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nGerard also had an uneasy relationship with his [[cathedral chapter]],<ref name=Thurstan43/> after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines and become ordained priests.<ref name=DNB/>{{efn|Priestly celibacy was not enforced with any rigour until the 12th century; most clergy of the 11th century would have been sons of priests.<ref name=Hamilton40>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 40</ref> Nor was it required that all cathedral clergy be ordained priests, they could have only taken vows for one of the lower [[Major orders|orders of the clergy]], such as the [[subdeacon]]ate or [[deaconate]].<ref name=Hamilton34>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 34</ref>}} He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular [[canon (priest)|canons]] who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting [[prebend]]s but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others.<ref name=Thurstan43>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' pp. 43\u201344</ref> It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between himself and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.<ref name=Thursatn114>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' p. 114</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nGerard was an associate of the anonymous author of the ''[[Quadripartitus]]'' and the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'', two 12th-century law books.

A [[Normans|Norman]], he was a member of the cathedral clergy at [[Rouen]] before becoming a [[Clerk#History and etymology|royal clerk]] under King [[William I of England]] and subsequently his son King [[William II of England|William II Rufus]]. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the [[Bishop of Hereford|Bishopric of Hereford]] in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, [[Henry I of England]], within days of William's death.\n\nSoon after Henry's coronation Gerard was appointed to the recently vacant [[Diocese of York|see of York]], and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the [[Diocese of Canterbury|see of Canterbury]] concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure [[The Pope|papal]] recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in [[Scotland]], but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the [[Investiture Controversy]] between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.\n\nGerard was a patron of learning, to the extent that he urged at least one of his clergy to study [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a language not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of [[astrology]], which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside [[York Minster]] after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the [[Architecture_of_the_medieval_cathedrals_of_England#Facades|cathedral porch]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nGerard was the nephew of [[Walkelin]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], and [[Simeon (abbot)|Simon, Abbot of Ely]].<ref name=BHOYork>Greenway ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: Volume 6: York: Archbishops''</ref> His parents were Osbert and Anna,<ref name=DNB>Burton \"Gerard\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> and his brother Peter was also a royal clerk.<ref name=Rufus409>Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 409</ref> The places and times of his birth and upbringing are unknown; he is documented as [[Cantor (church)|cantor]] of [[Rouen Cathedral]],<ref name=BHOHere/> and [[precentor]] of the same cathedral, although the dates of his appointments to either office are unrecorded.<ref name=BHOHere/> By 1091 he had become [[archdeacon]] of Rouen.<ref name=BHOHere>Barrow ''Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: Volume 8: Hereford: Bishops''</ref> He served in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|royal chancery]] under successive kings of England, William I and William II.<ref name=BHOHere/>\n\n==Bishop of Hereford==\n[[File:Saint Urbain II pr\u00eachant la croisade.jpg|left|thumb|Gerard undertook missions to Pope Urban II, seen here preaching the [[First Crusade]] in an illustration from the ''Grand Chronicle of France,'' a work from about 1455.]]\n\nGerard was appointed Lord Chancellor of England in 1085,<ref name=Handbook83>Fryde, et al.

Gerard then deposed Ranulf from his bishopric.<ref name=HenryI135>Hollister ''Henry I'' pp. 135\u2013136</ref> Soon after his [[Translation (ecclesiastical)|translation]] to York, Gerard began a long dispute with Anselm, claiming equal primacy with the Archbishop of Canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long [[Canterbury\u2013York dispute]]. At the 1102 [[Synods of Westminster|Council of Westminster]], Gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as Anselm's.<ref name=Church43>Barlow ''English Church 1066\u20131154'' p. 43</ref> He travelled to Rome in 1102 to receive his pallium from the pope,<ref name=BHOYork/> to whom he presented the king's side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding [[investiture]]s.<ref name=Vaughn239>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' p. 239</ref> The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced.

Gerard gave generously to the monasteries of his diocese; the medieval chronicler [[Hugh the Chantor]] stated that Thomas II, Gerard's successor, accused Gerard of having dissipated the diocese's endowment.<ref name=DNB/> King [[Olaf I of the Isle of Man|Olaf I]] of Man and the Isles wrote to \"G\", Archbishop of York, asking for the consecration of \"our bishop\" by York, but it does not appear to have taken place under Gerard or his successor.<ref name=Watt110>Watt \"Bishops of the Isles\" ''Innes Review'' pp. 110\u2013111</ref>{{efn|Olaf had been in exile in England and is likely to have met Gerard there.<ref name=Watt110/>}}\n\nDuring the first four years of Henry's reign Gerard was one of the king's chief advisors, along with [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert of Meulan]], [[Counts of Meulan|Count of Meulan]] in Normandy and later [[Earl of Leicester]]. Gerard was one of Henry's greatest supporters among the bishops during the [[Investiture Controversy|Investiture Crisis]].<ref name=Cantor238>Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' pp. 238\u2013249</ref> In 1101 Gerard witnessed a treaty between Henry and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]], the [[Count of Flanders]], which sought as far as possible to distance Robert from any future conflict between Henry and his elder brother Robert Curthose, or between Henry and King [[Philip I of France]].<ref name=Green61>Green ''Henry I'' pp. 61\u201362</ref> After Gerard's return from Rome he restored Ranulf Flambard to the see of Durham.<ref name=DNB/> In 1102 Anselm refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king; Gerard offered to consecrate them instead, but all except one refused.<ref name=Cantor166>Cantor ''Church, Kingship, and Lay Investiture'' pp. 166\u2013167</ref> From 1105 onwards Gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops, which opposed laymen investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority. As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Antioch]], who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure.<ref name=Cantor238/> In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did.<ref name=Thurstan26>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' p. 26</ref> At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute.<ref name=Cantor238/>\n\nGerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office.<ref name=Vaughn334>Vaughn ''Anselm of Bec and Robert of Meulan'' pp. 334\u2013336</ref> Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nGerard also had an uneasy relationship with his [[cathedral chapter]],<ref name=Thurstan43/> after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines and become ordained priests.<ref name=DNB/>{{efn|Priestly celibacy was not enforced with any rigour until the 12th century; most clergy of the 11th century would have been sons of priests.<ref name=Hamilton40>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 40</ref> Nor was it required that all cathedral clergy be ordained priests, they could have only taken vows for one of the lower [[Major orders|orders of the clergy]], such as the [[subdeacon]]ate or [[deaconate]].<ref name=Hamilton34>Hamilton ''Religion in the Medieval West'' p. 34</ref>}} He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular [[canon (priest)|canons]] who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting [[prebend]]s but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others.<ref name=Thurstan43>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' pp. 43\u201344</ref> It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between himself and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.<ref name=Thursatn114>Nicholl ''Thurstan'' p. 114</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nGerard was an associate of the anonymous author of the ''[[Quadripartitus]]'' and the ''[[Leges Henrici Primi]]'', two 12th-century law books. The medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] charged Gerard with immorality, avarice and the practice of magic.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Church72>Barlow ''English Church 1066\u20131154'' p. 72</ref> Gerard encouraged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a language not normally studied at the time.<ref name=Church247>Barlow ''English Church 1066\u20131154'' p. 247</ref> Some chroniclers considered his ownership of a Hebrew [[psalter]] to be disturbing, seeing it as a sign of heresy or secret Judaism.
