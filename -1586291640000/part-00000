He initially played in a military band before attending the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his [[Opus number|Op]]. 1, ''[[Suite for String Orchestra (Nielsen)|Suite for Strings]]'', in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the [[Royal Danish Orchestra]] under the conductor [[Johan Svendsen]], during which he played in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' and ''[[Otello]]'' at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death.\n\nAlthough his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \"psychological\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor [[Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen|Anne Marie Brodersen]]. Nielsen is especially noted for his six [[symphony|symphonies]], his [[Wind Quintet (Nielsen)|Wind Quintet]] and his concertos for [[Violin Concerto (Nielsen)|violin]], [[Flute Concerto (Nielsen)|flute]] and [[Clarinet Concerto (Nielsen)|clarinet]]. In Denmark, his opera ''[[Maskarade]]'' and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with [[progressive tonality]] and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, [[Symphony No. 6 (Nielsen)|''Sinfonia semplice'']], was written in 1924\u201325. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in [[Vestre Cemetery]], Copenhagen.\n\nNielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through [[Leonard Bernstein]] and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when three of his compositions were [[Danish Culture Canon|listed by the Ministry of Culture]] amongst the twelve greatest pieces of Danish music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish [[Banknotes of Denmark, 1997 series|hundred-kroner banknote]]. The [[Carl Nielsen Museum]] in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the [[Royal Danish Library]], sponsored by the Danish government, completed the ''[[Carl Nielsen Edition]]'', freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all of Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:20110101 Carl Nielsen home cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of a thatched country cottage|Nielsen's childhood home at [[Sortelung]] near N\u00f8rre Lyndelse]]\nNielsen was born on 9 June 1865, the seventh of twelve children in a poor peasant family, at [[Sortelung]] near N\u00f8rre Lyndelse, south of [[Odense]] on the island of Funen.<ref>{{cite book |first=S.

Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography {{lang|da|[[Min Fynske Barndom]]}} (''My Childhood on Funen''). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains,{{sfn|Lawson|1997|p=16}} while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837\u20131881), was a talented musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/biography/funen-childhood.php|title=Funen Childhood|publisher=Carl Nielsen Society|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Larsen|2015}}\n\nNielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: \"I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin.\"{{sfn|Nielsen|1953|p=23}} He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six.<ref name=earlyyears /> He studied violin and piano as a child, and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka that he mentions in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper in a nearby village when he was fourteen. The shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play [[brass instrument]]s, on 1 November 1879 he became a [[bugle (instrument)|bugler]] and [[Types of trombone#Alto trombone|alto trombonist]] in the band of the army's 16th Battalion in Odense.<ref name=\"mmio\" />\n\nNielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father.<ref name=\"mmio\" /> The army paid him three [[Danish krone|kroner]] and 45 [[\u00f8re]] and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances.<ref name=earlyyears>{{cite web |title=The Early Years |work=Carl Nielsen 2015 |url=http://www.carlnielsen.org/en/man-myth-and-music/the-early-years |accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Studies and early career ===\n[[File:Carl Nielsen - 1879.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=photograph of young Nielsen in band parade uniform with two brass instruments|Nielsen, aged about 14, in Odense]]\nIn 1881, Nielsen began to take his violin playing more seriously, studying privately under Carl Larsen, the [[Sexton (office)|sexton]] at [[Odense Cathedral]]. It is not known how much Nielsen composed during this period, but from his autobiography, it can be deduced that he wrote some trios and quartets for brass instruments, and that he had difficulty in coming to terms with the fact that brass instruments were tuned in different keys. Following an introduction to [[Niels Gade|Niels W. Gade]], the director of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, by whom he was well received, Nielsen obtained his release from the military band at short notice,<ref name=\"mmio\" /> and studied at the Academy from the beginning of 1884.{{sfn|Ahlgren Jensen|2008}}\n\nThough not an outstanding student and composing little, Nielsen progressed well in violin under [[Valdemar Tofte]] (1832\u20131907), and received a solid grounding in [[music theory]] from [[Orla Rosenhoff]] (1844\u20131905), who would remain a valued adviser during his early years as a professional composer.{{sfn|Ahlgren Jensen|2008}} He also studied composition under Gade, whom he liked as a friend but not for his music. Contacts with fellow students and cultured families in Copenhagen, some of whom would become lifelong friends, became equally important. The patchy education resulting from his country background left Nielsen insatiably curious about the arts, philosophy and aesthetics. But, in the opinion of the musicologist [[David Fanning (musicologist)|David Fanning]], it also left him \"with a highly personal, common man's point of view on those subjects\".{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=888}} He left the Academy at the end of 1886, after graduating with good but not outstanding marks in all subjects. He then went to stay with the retired Odense merchant Jens Georg Nielsen (1820\u20131901) and his wife at their apartment on Slagelsegade as he was not yet in a position to pay his own way.<ref name=studyyears>{{cite web |title=Study years |work=Carl Nielsen 2015 |url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/biography/study-years.php |accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> While there, he fell in love with their 14-year-old daughter Emilie Demant.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlnielsen.org/en/timeline |title=Timeline |publisher=Carl Nielsen Society |accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> The affair was to last for the next three years.{{sfn|Fellow|2005}}\n\nOn 17 September 1887, Nielsen played the violin in the [[Tivoli Concert Hall]] when his ''Andante tranquillo e Scherzo'' for strings was premiered. Shortly afterwards, on 25 January 1888, his String Quartet in F major was played at one of the private performances of the {{lang|da|Privat Kammermusikforening}} (Private Chamber Music Society).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/biography/young-and-promising.php|title=Young and promising|publisher=Carl Nielsen Society|accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> While Nielsen considered the Quartet in F to be his official debut as a professional composer, a far greater impression was made by his ''Suite for Strings''. Performed at [[Tivoli Gardens]], Copenhagen on 8 September 1888, it was designated by Nielsen as his Op. 1.{{sfn|Fanning|2001|pp=888\u201389}}\n\nBy September 1889 Nielsen had progressed well enough on the violin to gain a position with the second violins in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra which played at Copenhagen's [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]], then conducted by Johan Svendsen. In this position he experienced Giuseppe Verdi's ''Falstaff'' and ''Otello'' at their Danish premieres. Although this employment sometimes caused Nielsen considerable frustration, he continued to play there until 1905. After Svendsen's retirement in 1906, Nielsen increasingly served as conductor (being officially appointed assistant conductor in 1910).<ref name=timeline /><ref name=\"OCM-Layton\">{{harvnb|Layton}}. ''Oxford Companion to Music''.</ref> Between graduation and attaining this position, he made a modest income from private violin lessons while enjoying the continuing support of his patrons, not only Jens Georg Nielsen but also Albert Sachs (born 1846) and Hans Demant (1827\u20131897) who both ran factories in Odense.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carl Nielsen & Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen |language=da |publisher=Odense Bys Museer |url=http://museum.odense.dk/viden/carl-nielsen-anne-marie-carl-nielsen/publikationer-/spillemand-cn |accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> After less than a year at the Royal Theatre, Nielsen won a scholarship of 1,800 kroner, giving him the means to spend several months travelling in Europe.{{sfn|Fanning|2001|pp=888\u201389}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Marriage and children ===\nWhile travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[music drama]]s, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist [[Ferruccio Busoni]] in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years.{{sfn|Grimley|2005|pp=212\u201313}} Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor [[Anne Marie Brodersen]], who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in [[St Mark's English Church, Florence]], on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark.{{sfn|Lawson|1997|p=58}} According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \"love match\", but also a \"meeting of minds\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\".{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=889}} This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.<ref name=\"CNS-crisis\" />\n\nNielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \"psychological\" period.{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=889}} Fanning writes, \"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera ''[[Saul og David|Saul and David]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 2 (Nielsen)|Second Symphony (''The Four Temperaments'')]] and the cantatas {{lang|la|[[Hymnus amoris]]}} and {{lang|da|[[S\u00f8vnen]]}}\".{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=889}} Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start,{{sfn|Lawson|1997|p=104}} but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.<ref name=\"CNS-crisis\" />\n\nNielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate daughter was born&nbsp;\u2013 Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned.<ref name=\"CNS-crisis\" /> With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert M\u00f8ller (1893\u20131978), a medical doctor who became a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and director of the [[polyclinic]] at the [[Rigshospitalet|National Hospital]]. The younger daughter [[Anne Marie Telm\u00e1nyi|Anne Marie]], who graduated from the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Copenhagen Academy of Arts]], married the Hungarian violinist [[Emil Telm\u00e1nyi]] (1892\u20131988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen's music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen's son, Hans B\u00f8rge, was handicapped as a result of [[meningitis]] and spent most of his life away from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956.<ref name=\"CNS-family\" />\n\n=== Mature composer ===\n[[File:Carl Nielsen family at Fuglsang, Lolland.jpg|thumb|alt=photo of Carl Nielsen and four members of his family|Nielsen and his family at [[Fuglsang Manor]], {{circa|1915}}]]\nAt first, Nielsen's works did not gain sufficient recognition for him to be able to support himself. During the concert which saw the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Nielsen)|First Symphony]] on 14 March 1894 conducted by Svendsen, Nielsen played in the second violin section. The symphony was a great success when played in Berlin in 1896, contributing significantly to his reputation. He was increasingly in demand to write [[incidental music]] for the theatre as well as cantatas for special occasions, both of which provided a welcome source of additional income. Fanning comments on the relationship which developed between his programmatic and symphonic works: \"Sometimes he would find stageworthy ideas in his supposedly pure orchestral music; sometimes a text or scenario forced him to invent vivid musical imagery which he could later turn to more abstract use.\"{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=889}}\n\nNielsen's [[cantata]] ''Hymnus amoris'' for soloists, chorus and orchestra was first performed at Copenhagen's [[Musikforeningen]] (The Music Society) on 27 April 1897. It was inspired by [[Titian]]'s painting ''[[Miracle of the Jealous Husband]]'' which Nielsen had seen on his honeymoon in Italy in 1891. On one of the copies, he wrote: \"To my own Marie! These tones in praise of love are nothing compared to the real thing.\"{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|pp=xi\u2013xiv}}<ref name=\"CNS-sym-op\" />\n\nBeginning in 1901, Nielsen received a modest state pension&nbsp;\u2013 initially 800 kroner per annum, growing to 7,500 kroner by 1927&nbsp;\u2013 to augment his violinist's salary. This allowed him to stop taking private pupils and left him more time to compose. From 1903, he also had an annual retainer from his principal publisher, {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Hansen Edition|da}}. Between 1905 and 1914 he served as second conductor at the Royal Theatre. For his son-in-law, Emil Telm\u00e1nyi, Nielsen wrote his Violin Concerto, Op. 33 (1911). From 1914 to 1926, he conducted the Musikforeningen orchestra. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen, and continued to work there until his death.<ref name=\"CNS-sym-op\" />\n[[File:Carl Nielsen 1917 adjusted.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nielsen in 1917|alt=Carl Nielsen, seated, facing right, smartly dressed in a suit and waistcoat]]\n\nThe strain of dual careers and constant separation from his wife led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916\u201322, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in [[Gothenburg]].<ref name=\"CNS-crisis\" /> The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his [[Symphony No. 4 (Nielsen)|Fourth]] (1914\u201316) and [[Symphony No. 5 (Nielsen)|Fifth symphonies]] (1921\u201322), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning.{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=890}} The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication of many of his major works, including ''Aladdin'' and ''Pan and Syrinx''.<ref name=\"CNS-pile\" />\n\nThe sixth and final symphony, ''Sinfonia semplice'', was written in 1924\u201325. After suffering a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; in an article in ''[[Politiken]]'' on 9 November 1925 he wrote: <blockquote>If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end&nbsp;... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/biography/art-and-consciousness.php|title=Art and consciousness|publisher=Carl Nielsen Society|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Final years and death ===\nNielsen's final large-scale orchestral works were his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: \"If ever there was music from another planet, this is surely it. Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air rarefied and bracing.\"<ref name=\"OCM-Layton\" /> Nielsen's last musical composition, the organ work ''[[Commotio (Nielsen)|Commotio]]'', was premiered posthumously in 1931.{{sfn|Gibbs|1963|p=208}}\n\nDuring his final years, Nielsen produced a short book of essays entitled ''Living Music'' (1925), followed in 1927 by his memoir ''Min Fynske Barndom''. In 1926 he wrote in his diary \"My home soil pulls me more and more like a long sucking kiss. Does it mean that I shall finally return and rest in the earth of Funen? Then it must be in the place where I was born: Sortelung, Frydenlands parish\".<ref>Cited in {{harvnb|Grimley|2005|p=218}}.</ref>\n\nThis was not to be. Nielsen was admitted to Copenhagen's National Hospital (Rigshospitalet) on 1 October 1931 following a series of [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]]. He died there at ten minutes past midnight on 3 October, surrounded by his family. His last words to them were \"You are standing here as if you were waiting for something\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carlnielsen.dk/gb/bio/ |title=Carl Nielsen biografi |last=Ketting |first=Knud |website=Carl Nielsen Society |language=en-GB |access-date=1 October 2018 }}</ref>\n\nHe was buried in Copenhagen's Vestre Cemetery; all the music at his funeral, including the hymns, was the work of the composer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/biography/last-years.php|title=Last years|publisher=Carl Nielsen Society|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref> After his death, his wife was commissioned to sculpt a monument to him, to be erected in central Copenhagen. She wrote: \"I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was to sit there between the rushing wings blowing a reed pipe out over Copenhagen.\" Dispute about her design and a shortfall in funding meant that erection of the monument was delayed and that Anne Marie herself ended up subsidising it. The  [[Carl Nielsen Monument]] was finally unveiled in 1939.{{sfn|Holmen|1985|pp=29\u201331}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|List of compositions by Carl Nielsen}}\nNielsen's works are sometimes referred to by CNW numbers, based on the ''Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works'' (CNW) published online by the [[Danish Royal Library]] in 2015. The CNW catalogue is intended to replace the 1965 catalogue compiled by [[Dan Fog]] and [[Torben Schousboe]] (FS numbers).<ref>{{cite web |title=List of Works |publisher=Carl Nielsen Society |url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/list-of-works.php |accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Musical style ===\n[[File:Nielsen5 poster.jpg|thumb|alt=Poster advertising a concert programme at Musikforeningen with items by Beethoven, Bach, and lastly Nielsen's fifth Symphony, 1922|Poster for premiere of Carl Nielsen's Fifth Symphony, 1922]]In his ''Lives of the Great Composers'', the music critic [[Harold Schonberg]] emphasizes the breadth of Nielsen's compositions, his energetic rhythms, generous orchestration and his individuality. In comparing him with [[Jean Sibelius]], he considers he had \"just as much sweep, even more power, and a more universal message\".{{sfn|Schonberg|1997|p=94}} The [[Oxford University]] music professor Daniel M. Grimley qualifies Nielsen as \"one of the most playful, life-affirming, and awkward voices in twentieth-century music\" thanks to the \"melodic richness and harmonic vitality\" of his work.{{sfn|Grimley|2010|p=ix}} Anne-Marie Reynolds, author of ''Carl Nielsen's Voice: His Songs in Context'', cites Robert Simpson's view that \"all of his music is vocal in origin\", maintaining that song-writing strongly influenced Nielsen's development as a composer.{{sfn|Reynolds|2010|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nThe Danish sociologist Benedikte Brincker observes that the perception of Nielsen and his music in his home country is rather different from his international appreciation. His interest and background in folk music had special resonance for Danes, and this was intensified during the nationalistic movements of the 1930s and during World War II, when singing was an important basis for the Danes to distinguish themselves from their German enemies.{{sfn|Brincker|2008|p=684}} Nielsen's songs retain an important place in Danish culture and education. The musicologist Niels Krabbe describes the popular image of Nielsen in Denmark as being like \"the ugly duckling syndrome\" \u2013 a reference to the tale of the Danish writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]] \u2013  whereby \"a poor boy&nbsp;... passing through adversity and frugality&nbsp;... marches into Copenhagen and&nbsp;... comes to conquer the position as the uncrowned King\". Thus while outside Denmark Nielsen is largely thought of as the composer of orchestral music and the opera ''Maskarade'', in his own country he is more of a national symbol. These two sides were officially brought together in Denmark in 2006 when the Ministry of Culture issued a list of the twelve greatest Danish musical works, which included three by Nielsen \u2013 ''Maskarade'', the Fourth Symphony, and a pair of his Danish songs.{{sfn|Krabbe|2012|p=55}} Krabbe asks the rhetorical question: \"Can 'the national' in Nielsen be demonstrated in the music in the form of particular themes, harmonies, sounds, forms, etc., or is it a pure construct of reception history?\"{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|p=44}}\n\nNielsen himself was ambiguous about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He wrote to the Dutch composer [[Julius R\u00f6ntgen]] in 1909 \"I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What do you think about songs sung in [[unison]]? We must go back&nbsp;... to the pure and the clear.\"{{sfn|Brincker|2008|p=689}} On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 \"Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does&nbsp;... and it is impossible to deliver national music on request.\"{{sfn|Brincker|2008|p=684}}\n\nNielsen studied Renaissance [[polyphony]] closely, which accounts for some of the melodic and harmonic content of his music. This interest is exemplified in his ''[[Tre Motetter]]'' (Three Motets, Op. 55).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bachtrack.com/sibelius-nielsen-choral-music-feature|title=National poetry and polyphony: Exploring the choral music of Sibelius and Nielsen|last=Toll\u00e5li|first=Aksel|publisher=Bachtrack|date=11 March 2015|accessdate=31 May 2015 |language=}}</ref> To non-Danish critics, Nielsen's music initially had a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classical]] sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]] called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen's music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies.{{sfn|Pankhurst|2008|pp=113, 165}} There is debate as to how much such elements owe to his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of [[acciaccatura]]s or [[appoggiatura]]s, or his frequent use of a [[flattened seventh]] and [[minor third]] in his works, as being typically Danish.{{sfn|White|Murphy|2001|p=129}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classical-music.com/topic/carl-nielsen|title=Carl Nielsen|last=Johnson|first=Stephen|publisher=Classical-music.com: Website of BBC Music Magazine|accessdate= |language=}}</ref> The composer himself wrote \"The [[interval (music)|intervals]], as I see it, are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music&nbsp;...

The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension.<ref name=\"BBC-Nielsen\" /> From its opening bars, [[Symphony No. 1 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 1]] (Op. 7, 1890\u201392), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In [[Symphony No. 2 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 2]] (Op. 16, 1901\u201302), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the [[four humours|four temperaments]] (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).{{sfn|Simpson|1979|p=25}}\n\nThe title of Symphony No. 3, ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Nielsen)|Sinfonia Espansiva]]'' (Op. 27, 1910\u201311), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \"outward growth of the mind's scope\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words.<ref name=\"BBC-Nielsen\" /> [[Symphony No. 4 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 4]], ''The Inextinguishable'' (Op. 29, 1914\u201316), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of [[timpani]] are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\".<ref>{{harvnb|Embassy of Denmark}}. Symphony No. 4.</ref>\n\nAlso frequently performed is the [[Symphony No. 5 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 5]] (Op. 50, 1921\u201322), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos.

''Saul and David'' received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 ''Masquerade'' was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Saul og David''|pp=xi\u2013xxx}}{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Maskarade''|pp=xi\u2013xxxvii}} Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many [[Strophic form|strophic]] songs, its dances and its underlying \"old Copenhagen\" atmosphere.{{sfn|Schepelern|1987|pp=346\u201351}}\n\nNielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed {{lang|la|Hymnus amoris}} (''Hymn of Love''), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style.  Writing in the newspaper ''Dannebrog'', Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \"a decisive victory\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of ''[[Nationaltidende]]'' welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the {{lang|da|[[Berlingske Tidende]]}} reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|p=xiii}} {{lang|da|[[S\u00f8vnen]]}} (''The Sleep''), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|p=xxi}} {{lang|da|[[Fynsk Foraar]]}} (''Springtime on Funen''), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|p=xxvii}}\n\n=== Concertos ===\nNielsen wrote three concertos: the Violin Concerto, Op. 33 is a middle-period work, from 1911, which lies within the tradition of European classicism, whereas the Flute Concerto (without opus number) of 1926 and the Clarinet Concerto, Op. 57 which followed in 1928 are late works, influenced by the modernism of the 1920s and, according to the Danish musicologist Herbert Rosenberg, the product of \"an extremely experienced composer who knows how to avoid inessentials.\"{{sfn|Rosenberg|1966|p=49}} Unlike Nielsen's later works, the Violin Concerto has a distinct, melody-oriented neo-classical structure. The Flute Concerto, in two movements, was written for the flautist [[Holger Gilbert-Jespersen]], a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet which had premiered Nielsen's Wind Quintet (1922).<ref name=\"CNS-ac\" /> In contrast to the rather traditional style of the Violin Concerto, it reflects the modernistic trends of the period. The first movement, for example, switches between [[D minor]], [[E-flat minor]] and [[F major]] before the flute comes to the fore with a [[cantabile]] theme in [[E major]].<ref name=\"CA-flute\" /> The Clarinet Concerto was also written for a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet, [[Aage Oxenvad]]. Nielsen stretches the capacities of instrument and player to the utmost; the concerto has just one continuous movement and contains a struggle between the soloist and the orchestra and between the two principal competing keys, F major and E major.<ref>{{harvnb|Reisig}}. Clarinet Concerto.</ref>\n\nThe wind concertos present many examples of what Nielsen called {{lang|da|objektivering}} (\"objectification\"). By this term he meant giving instrumentalists freedom of interpretation and performance within the bounds set out by the [[Sheet music|score]].{{sfn|Slattery|2015}}\n\n=== Orchestral music ===\nNielsen's earliest work composed specifically for orchestra was the immediately successful Suite for Strings (1888), which evoked Scandinavian Romanticism as expressed by Grieg and Svendsen.<ref name=\"Lawson-quartets\" /> The work marked an important milestone in Nielsen's career as it was not only his first real success but it was also the first of his pieces he conducted himself when it was played in Odense a month later.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Suite for String Orchestra''|p=vii}}\n\nThe ''[[Helios Overture]]'', Op. 17 (1903) stems from Nielsen's stay in Athens which inspired him to compose a work depicting the sun rising and setting over the [[Aegean Sea]].{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Helios''|p=vii}} The score is a showpiece for orchestra, and has been amongst Nielsen's most popular works.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodgetts}}. Helios Overture.</ref> {{lang|da|[[Saga-Dr\u00f8m]]}} (''Saga Dream''), Op. 39 (1907\u201308) is a [[symphonic poem|tone poem]] for orchestra based on the Icelandic [[Nj\u00e1l's saga|Njal's Saga]]. In Nielsen's words:{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Orchestral Works 2''|p=xi}}\n<blockquote>There are among other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely alongside one another, with no harmonic connection, and without my marking time. They are just like four streams of thought, each going its own way&nbsp;\u2013 differently and randomly for each performance&nbsp;\u2013 until they meet in a point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they are united.</blockquote>\n\n''[[At the Bier of a Young Artist]]'' ({{lang|da|Ved en ung Kunstners Baare}}) for string orchestra was written for the funeral of the Danish painter [[Oluf Hartmann]] in January 1910 and was also played at Nielsen's own funeral.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Orchestral Works 2''|p=xvii}} ''[[Pan and Syrinx]]'' ({{lang|da|Pan og Syrinx}}), a vigorous nine-minute symphonic poem inspired by [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', was premiered in 1911.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Orchestral Works 2''|p=xxi}} The Rhapsodic Overture, ''[[An Imaginary Trip to the Faroe Islands]]'' ({{lang|da|En Fantasirejse til F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}), draws on [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] folk tunes but also contains freely composed sections.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Orchestral Works 2''|p=xxvi}}\n\nAmong Nielsen's orchestral works for the stage are ''[[Aladdin (Nielsen)|Aladdin]]'' (1919) and {{lang|da|[[Moderen]]}} (The Mother), Op. 41 (1920). ''Aladdin'' was written to accompany a production of [[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]]'s fairy tale at The Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. The complete score, lasting over 80 minutes, is Nielsen's longest work apart from his operas, but a shorter orchestral suite consisting of the ''Oriental March'', ''Hindu Dance'' and ''Negro Dance'' is often performed.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Aladdin''|p=xi}} {{lang|da|Moderen}}, written to celebrate the reunification of [[Southern Jutland]] with Denmark, was first performed in 1921; it is a setting of patriotic verses written for the occasion.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Incidental Music 2''|pp=xi\u2013xxviii}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Chamber music ===\n\nNielsen composed several [[chamber music]] works, some of them still high on the international repertoire. The Wind Quintet, one of his most popular pieces, was composed in 1922 specifically for the Copenhagen Wind Quintet. Simpson, explaining that Nielsen's fondness of wind instruments was closely related to his love of nature, writes: \"He was also intensely interested in human character, and in the Wind Quintet composed deliberately for five friends; each part is cunningly made to suit the individuality of each player.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Sierra Chamber Society}}.

The [[String Quartet No. 1 (Nielsen)|First String Quartet No. 1 in G minor]], Op. 13 (1889, revised 1900) contains a \"R\u00e9sum\u00e9\" section in the finale, bringing together themes from the first, third and fourth movements.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Piano and Organ Works''|p=xiv}}  The [[String Quartet No. 2 (Nielsen)|Second String Quartet No. 2 in F minor]], Op. 5 appeared in 1890 and the [[String Quartet No. 3 (Nielsen)|Third String Quartet in E-flat major]], Op. 14 in 1898. The music historian Jan Smaczny suggests that in this work \"the handling of texture is confident and far less derivative than in earlier works ... [the quartet] prompts the most regret that Nielsen did not pursue the genre further ... to parallel his later symphonic development\".{{sfn|Smaczny|2003|p=274}} The [[String Quartet No. 4 (Nielsen)|Fourth String Quartet in F major]] (1904) initially received a mixed reception, with critics uncertain about its reserved style. Nielsen revised it several times, the final version in 1919 being listed as his Op. 44.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Chamber Music 1''|p=xi}}\n\nThe violin was Nielsen's own instrument and he composed four large-scale chamber works for it. The departures from standard procedures in the First Sonata, Op. 9 (1895), including its often sudden [[modulation (music)|modulations]] and its terse thematic material, disconcerted Danish critics at its first performance. The Second Sonata, Op.&nbsp;35 of 1912 was written for the violinist [[Peder M\u00f8ller (violinist)|Peder M\u00f8ller]] who earlier that year had premiered the composer's Violin Concerto. The work is an example of the composer's progressive tonality since, although it is stated to be in the key of G minor, the first and final movements end in different keys. The critic [[Emilius Bangert]] wrote of the premiere (which was given by [[Axel Gade]]), \"The overall impression was of a beautiful, unbroken line&nbsp;\u2013 a flow of notes&nbsp;\u2013 where in particular a wonderful second subject in the first part and the pure, high sphere of the last part were captivating\". Two other works are for violin solo. The ''Prelude, Theme and Variations'', Op. 48 (1923) was written for Telm\u00e1nyi, and, like Nielsen's ''[[Chaconne (Nielsen)|Chaconne]]'' for piano, Op. 32, was inspired by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The ''Preludio e Presto'', Op. 52 (1928) was written as a tribute for the sixtieth birthday of the composer [[Fini Henriques]].{{sfn|Ketting|2007}}\n\n=== Keyboard works ===\nAlthough Nielsen came to compose mainly at the piano, he only composed directly for it occasionally over a period of 40 years, creating works often with a distinctive style which slowed their international acceptance.{{sfn|Skjold-Rasmussen|1966|p=57}} Nielsen's own piano technique, an echo of which is probably preserved in three [[wax cylinders]] marked \"Carl Nielsen\" at the State Archives in [[Aarhus]], seems to have been mediocre.{{sfn|Grimley|2005|p=203}} Reviewing the 1969 recording of works by the pianist [[John Ogdon]], John Horton commented on the early pieces: \"Nielsen's technical resources hardly measure up to the grandeur of his designs\", whilst characterising the later pieces as \"major works which can stand comparison with his symphonic music\".{{sfn|Horton|1969|p=499}} The anti-romantic tone of the ''Symphonic Suite'', Op. 8 (1894) was described by a later critic as \"nothing less than a clenched fist straight in the face of all established musical convention\".<ref>T\u00f8rsleff, Hans. Cited in {{harvnb|Grimley|2005|p=205}}.</ref> In Nielsen's words, the ''Chaconne'', Op. 32 (1917) was \"a really big piece, and I think effective\".{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Piano and Organ Works''|pp=xxiii\u2013xxvi}} It is not only inspired by the work of Bach, especially the [[Partita for Violin No. 2 (Bach)#The Ciaccona|chaconne for solo violin]], but also by the virtuoso piano arrangements of Bach's music by composers such as [[Robert Schumann]], Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni.{{sfn|Grimley|2005|pp=210\u201312}} Also on a large scale, and from the same year, is the ''Theme and Variations'', Op. 41, in which critics have discerned the influences of Brahms and also of [[Max Reger]], of whom Nielsen had earlier written to a friend \"I think that the public will be utterly unable to grasp Reger's work and yet I am a lot more sympathetic towards his efforts than towards&nbsp;... [[Richard Strauss]]\".{{sfn|Grimley|2005|pp=218\u201319}}\n\nAll Nielsen's organ works were late compositions. The Danish organist [[Finn Vider\u00f8]] suggests that his interest was prompted by the {{lang|de|Orgelbewegung}} ([[Organ reform movement]]), and the renewal of the front pipes of the [[Schnitger organ (Hamburg)|Schnitger organ]] in the [[St. Jacobi, Hamburg|St. Jacobi Church]], Hamburg, from 1928 to 1930.{{sfn|Vider\u00f8|1966|p=69}} Nielsen's last major work&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|la|Commotio}}, Op. 58, a 22-minute piece for organ&nbsp;\u2013 was composed between June 1930 and February 1931, only a few months before his death.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Piano and Organ Works''|page=xlix}}\n\n=== Songs and hymns ===\n{{See also|List of songs composed by Carl Nielsen}}\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Forunderligt at sige, Carl Nielsen, Erik Damskier.ogg|title=''Forunderligt at sige'' (\"How wonderful to ponder\")|description=Christmas hymn played on piano, lyrics by [[N.

In {{harvnb|Reynolds|2010|p=8<!--unnumbered on the page, clear from contents list-->}}.</ref> In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:<blockquote>With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, [[Christian Winther]] or [[Holger Drachmann|Drachmann]], and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But it is also clear that a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is that brings us to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.{{sfn|Vesterg\u00e5rd|Vorre|2008|p=85}}</blockquote>\n\nOf great significance was Nielsen's contribution to the 1922 publication, '' Folkeh\u00f8jskolens Melodibog (The Folk High School Songbook)'', of which he was one of the editors together with [[Thomas Laub]], [[Oluf Ring]] and [[Thorvald Aagaard]]. The book contained about 600 melodies, of which about 200 were composed by the editors, and was intended to provide a repertoire for [[Sing-along|communal singing]], an integral part of Danish folk culture. The collection was extremely popular and became embedded in the Danish educational system. During the [[Denmark in World War II|German occupation of Denmark]] in World War II, mass song gatherings, using these melodies, were part of Denmark's \"spiritual re-armament\", and after the war in 1945 Nielsen's contributions were characterised by one writer as \"shining jewels in our treasure-chest of patriotic songs\". This remains a significant factor in Danish assessment of the composer.{{sfn|Vesterg\u00e5rd|Vorre|2008|pp=83\u201384}}\n\n=== Editions ===\nBetween 1994 and 2009 a complete new edition of Nielsen's works, the ''Carl Nielsen Edition'', was commissioned by the Danish Government (at a cost of over 40 million kroner).{{sfn|Krabbe|2012|pp=3\u20134}} For many of the works, including the operas ''Maskarade'' and ''Saul and David'', and the complete ''Aladdin'' music, this was their first printed publication, copies of manuscripts having previously been used in performances.{{sfn|Krabbe|2012|p=7}} The scores are now all available for download free of charge at the website of the Danish Royal Library (which also owns most of Nielsen's music manuscripts).<ref name=\"RDL-download\" />\n\n== Reception ==\nUnlike that of his contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's reputation abroad did not start to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started to become part of the world repertoire.<ref name=\"CNS-performances\" /> Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of ''Hymnus amoris'' that he received support from the critics,{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|pp=xi\u2013xiv}} to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of ''Masquerade''.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Maskarade''|p=xiii}}\n\nWithin two months of its successful premiere at the Odd Fellows Concert Hall in Copenhagen on 28 February 1912, the Third Symphony (''Espansiva)'' was in the repertoire of the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Amsterdam Concertgebouw]], and by 1913 it had seen performances in Stuttgart, Stockholm and Helsinki. The symphony was the most popular of all Nielsen's works during his lifetime and was also played in Berlin, Hamburg, London and Gothenburg.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Symphony 3 Preface''|p=xv}}{{sfn|Phillips|2014}} Other works caused some uncertainty, even in Denmark. After the premiere of the Fifth Symphony (1922) one critic wrote: \"The treasure of Danish symphonies and Carl Nielsen's own output have been enriched by a strange and highly original work.\" Another, however, described it as a \"bloody, clenched fist in the face of an unsuspecting snob audience\", also qualifying it as \"filthy music from trenches\".<ref name=\"CNS-pile\" />\n\nAt the end of the 1940s two major biographies of Nielsen appeared in Danish,<ref name=\"biographies-40s\" /> dominating opinion of the composer's life and work for several decades.{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|p=45}} Robert Simpson's book ''Carl Nielsen, Symphonist'' (first edition 1952) was the earliest large-scale study in English.{{sfn|Simpson|1979}}\n\nAn international breakthrough came in 1962 when Leonard Bernstein recorded the Fifth Symphony with the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for CBS. The recording helped Nielsen's music to achieve appreciation beyond his home country and is considered one of the finest recorded accounts of the symphony.{{sfn|Fanning|1997|p=92}}{{sfn|Burton|2006}} Nielsen's centenary in 1965 was widely celebrated, both in terms of performances and publications, and Bernstein was awarded the [[L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize|Sonning Prize]] for his recording of the Third Symphony.{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|p=47}} In 1988 Nielsen's diaries and his letters to Anne Marie were published, and these, together with a 1991 biography by J\u00f8rgen Jensen using this new material, led to a revised objective assessment of the composer's personality.{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|pp=47\u201348}} Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on the occasion of Nielsen's 125th anniversary in 1990, the music critic Andrew Pincus recalled that 25 years earlier Bernstein had believed the world was ready to accept the Dane as the equal of Jean Sibelius, speaking of \"his rough charm, his swing, his drive, his rhythmic surprises, his strange power of harmonic and tonal relationships&nbsp;\u2013 and especially his constant unpredictability\" (which Pincus believed was still a challenge for audiences).{{sfn|Pincus|1990}} Biographies and studies in English in the 1990s<ref name=\"biographies-90s\" /> helped to establish Nielsen's status worldwide,{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|pp=50\u201353}} to the point at which his music has become a regular feature of concert programming in Western countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storbritannien.um.dk/en/about%20great%20britain/carl-nielsen-150th-anniversary/|title=Carl Nielsen 150th Anniversary|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=1 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424143402/http://storbritannien.um.dk/en/about%20great%20britain/carl-nielsen-150th-anniversary/|archivedate=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 2008, the American music critic [[Alex Ross]] compares the \"brute strength\" of Nielsen's symphonies to [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'' and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]] but explains that only now were the Americans slowly beginning to appreciate the Danish composer.

As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark.{{sfn|Grimley|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mv6ZD7378CcC&pg=PA10 p.&nbsp;10 footnote]}} Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, [[Harald Agersnap]], both a conductor and orchestral composer, and [[J\u00f8rgen Bentzon]] who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (K\u00f8benhavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist [[Knud Jeppesen]], the pianist [[Herman David Koppel|Herman Koppel]], the academy professor and symphony composer [[Poul Schierbeck]], the organist Emilius Bangert who played at [[Roskilde Cathedral]], and [[Nancy Dalberg]], one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of ''Aladdin''. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster [[Mogens W\u00f6ldike]], remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and [[Rudolph Simonsen]], the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.{{sfn|Caron|2013}}\n\nThe Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Performances |publisher=Carl Nielsen Society |url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/performances/denmark-201415.php |accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>\nThe Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the [[Odense Symphony Orchestra]]. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued.

He initially played in a military band before attending the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his [[Opus number|Op]]. 1, ''[[Suite for String Orchestra (Nielsen)|Suite for Strings]]'', in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the [[Royal Danish Orchestra]] under the conductor [[Johan Svendsen]], during which he played in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' and ''[[Otello]]'' at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death.\n\nAlthough his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \"psychological\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor [[Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen|Anne Marie Brodersen]]. Nielsen is especially noted for his six [[symphony|symphonies]], his [[Wind Quintet (Nielsen)|Wind Quintet]] and his concertos for [[Violin Concerto (Nielsen)|violin]], [[Flute Concerto (Nielsen)|flute]] and [[Clarinet Concerto (Nielsen)|clarinet]]. In Denmark, his opera ''[[Maskarade]]'' and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]], but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with [[progressive tonality]] and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, [[Symphony No. 6 (Nielsen)|''Sinfonia semplice'']], was written in 1924\u201325. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in [[Vestre Cemetery]], Copenhagen.\n\nNielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through [[Leonard Bernstein]] and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when three of his compositions were [[Danish Culture Canon|listed by the Ministry of Culture]] amongst the twelve greatest pieces of Danish music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish [[Banknotes of Denmark, 1997 series|hundred-kroner banknote]]. The [[Carl Nielsen Museum]] in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the [[Royal Danish Library]], sponsored by the Danish government, completed the ''[[Carl Nielsen Edition]]'', freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all of Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early years ===\n[[File:20110101 Carl Nielsen home cropped.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph of a thatched country cottage|Nielsen's childhood home at [[Sortelung]] near N\u00f8rre Lyndelse]]\nNielsen was born on 9 June 1865, the seventh of twelve children in a poor peasant family, at [[Sortelung]] near N\u00f8rre Lyndelse, south of [[Odense]] on the island of Funen.<ref>{{cite book |first=S.

Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography {{lang|da|[[Min Fynske Barndom]]}} (''My Childhood on Funen''). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains,{{sfn|Lawson|1997|p=16}} while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837\u20131881), was a talented musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/biography/funen-childhood.php|title=Funen Childhood|publisher=Carl Nielsen Society|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Larsen|2015}}\n\nNielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: \"I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin.\"{{sfn|Nielsen|1953|p=23}} He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six.<ref name=earlyyears /> He studied violin and piano as a child, and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka that he mentions in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper in a nearby village when he was fourteen. The shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play [[brass instrument]]s, on 1 November 1879 he became a [[bugle (instrument)|bugler]] and [[Types of trombone#Alto trombone|alto trombonist]] in the band of the army's 16th Battalion in Odense.<ref name=\"mmio\" />\n\nNielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father.<ref name=\"mmio\" /> The army paid him three [[Danish krone|kroner]] and 45 [[\u00f8re]] and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances.<ref name=earlyyears>{{cite web |title=The Early Years |work=Carl Nielsen 2015 |url=http://www.carlnielsen.org/en/man-myth-and-music/the-early-years |accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Studies and early career ===\n[[File:Carl Nielsen - 1879.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=photograph of young Nielsen in band parade uniform with two brass instruments|Nielsen, aged about 14, in Odense]]\nIn 1881, Nielsen began to take his violin playing more seriously, studying privately under Carl Larsen, the [[Sexton (office)|sexton]] at [[Odense Cathedral]]. It is not known how much Nielsen composed during this period, but from his autobiography, it can be deduced that he wrote some trios and quartets for brass instruments, and that he had difficulty in coming to terms with the fact that brass instruments were tuned in different keys. Following an introduction to [[Niels Gade|Niels W. Gade]], the director of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, by whom he was well received, Nielsen obtained his release from the military band at short notice,<ref name=\"mmio\" /> and studied at the Academy from the beginning of 1884.{{sfn|Ahlgren Jensen|2008}}\n\nThough not an outstanding student and composing little, Nielsen progressed well in violin under [[Valdemar Tofte]] (1832\u20131907), and received a solid grounding in [[music theory]] from [[Orla Rosenhoff]] (1844\u20131905), who would remain a valued adviser during his early years as a professional composer.{{sfn|Ahlgren Jensen|2008}} He also studied composition under Gade, whom he liked as a friend but not for his music. Contacts with fellow students and cultured families in Copenhagen, some of whom would become lifelong friends, became equally important. The patchy education resulting from his country background left Nielsen insatiably curious about the arts, philosophy and aesthetics. But, in the opinion of the musicologist [[David Fanning (musicologist)|David Fanning]], it also left him \"with a highly personal, common man's point of view on those subjects\".{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=888}} He left the Academy at the end of 1886, after graduating with good but not outstanding marks in all subjects. He then went to stay with the retired Odense merchant Jens Georg Nielsen (1820\u20131901) and his wife at their apartment on Slagelsegade as he was not yet in a position to pay his own way.<ref name=studyyears>{{cite web |title=Study years |work=Carl Nielsen 2015 |url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/biography/study-years.php |accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> While there, he fell in love with their 14-year-old daughter Emilie Demant.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlnielsen.org/en/timeline |title=Timeline |publisher=Carl Nielsen Society |accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> The affair was to last for the next three years.{{sfn|Fellow|2005}}\n\nOn 17 September 1887, Nielsen played the violin in the [[Tivoli Concert Hall]] when his ''Andante tranquillo e Scherzo'' for strings was premiered. Shortly afterwards, on 25 January 1888, his String Quartet in F major was played at one of the private performances of the {{lang|da|Privat Kammermusikforening}} (Private Chamber Music Society).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/biography/young-and-promising.php|title=Young and promising|publisher=Carl Nielsen Society|accessdate=16 May 2015}}</ref> While Nielsen considered the Quartet in F to be his official debut as a professional composer, a far greater impression was made by his ''Suite for Strings''. Performed at [[Tivoli Gardens]], Copenhagen on 8 September 1888, it was designated by Nielsen as his Op. 1.{{sfn|Fanning|2001|pp=888\u201389}}\n\nBy September 1889 Nielsen had progressed well enough on the violin to gain a position with the second violins in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra which played at Copenhagen's [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]], then conducted by Johan Svendsen. In this position he experienced Giuseppe Verdi's ''Falstaff'' and ''Otello'' at their Danish premieres. Although this employment sometimes caused Nielsen considerable frustration, he continued to play there until 1905. After Svendsen's retirement in 1906, Nielsen increasingly served as conductor (being officially appointed assistant conductor in 1910).<ref name=timeline /><ref name=\"OCM-Layton\">{{harvnb|Layton}}.

Although he revered the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist [[Ferruccio Busoni]] in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years.{{sfn|Grimley|2005|pp=212\u201313}} Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor [[Anne Marie Brodersen]], who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in [[St Mark's English Church, Florence]], on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark.{{sfn|Lawson|1997|p=58}} According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \"love match\", but also a \"meeting of minds\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\".{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=889}} This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.<ref name=\"CNS-crisis\" />\n\nNielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \"psychological\" period.{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=889}} Fanning writes, \"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera ''[[Saul og David|Saul and David]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 2 (Nielsen)|Second Symphony (''The Four Temperaments'')]] and the cantatas {{lang|la|[[Hymnus amoris]]}} and {{lang|da|[[S\u00f8vnen]]}}\".{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=889}} Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start,{{sfn|Lawson|1997|p=104}} but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.<ref name=\"CNS-crisis\" />\n\nNielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate daughter was born&nbsp;\u2013 Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned.<ref name=\"CNS-crisis\" /> With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert M\u00f8ller (1893\u20131978), a medical doctor who became a professor at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and director of the [[polyclinic]] at the [[Rigshospitalet|National Hospital]]. The younger daughter [[Anne Marie Telm\u00e1nyi|Anne Marie]], who graduated from the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Copenhagen Academy of Arts]], married the Hungarian violinist [[Emil Telm\u00e1nyi]] (1892\u20131988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen's music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen's son, Hans B\u00f8rge, was handicapped as a result of [[meningitis]] and spent most of his life away from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956.<ref name=\"CNS-family\" />\n\n=== Mature composer ===\n[[File:Carl Nielsen family at Fuglsang, Lolland.jpg|thumb|alt=photo of Carl Nielsen and four members of his family|Nielsen and his family at [[Fuglsang Manor]], {{circa|1915}}]]\nAt first, Nielsen's works did not gain sufficient recognition for him to be able to support himself. During the concert which saw the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Nielsen)|First Symphony]] on 14 March 1894 conducted by Svendsen, Nielsen played in the second violin section. The symphony was a great success when played in Berlin in 1896, contributing significantly to his reputation. He was increasingly in demand to write [[incidental music]] for the theatre as well as cantatas for special occasions, both of which provided a welcome source of additional income. Fanning comments on the relationship which developed between his programmatic and symphonic works: \"Sometimes he would find stageworthy ideas in his supposedly pure orchestral music; sometimes a text or scenario forced him to invent vivid musical imagery which he could later turn to more abstract use.\"{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=889}}\n\nNielsen's [[cantata]] ''Hymnus amoris'' for soloists, chorus and orchestra was first performed at Copenhagen's [[Musikforeningen]] (The Music Society) on 27 April 1897. It was inspired by [[Titian]]'s painting ''[[Miracle of the Jealous Husband]]'' which Nielsen had seen on his honeymoon in Italy in 1891. On one of the copies, he wrote: \"To my own Marie! These tones in praise of love are nothing compared to the real thing.\"{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|pp=xi\u2013xiv}}<ref name=\"CNS-sym-op\" />\n\nBeginning in 1901, Nielsen received a modest state pension&nbsp;\u2013 initially 800 kroner per annum, growing to 7,500 kroner by 1927&nbsp;\u2013 to augment his violinist's salary. This allowed him to stop taking private pupils and left him more time to compose. From 1903, he also had an annual retainer from his principal publisher, {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Hansen Edition|da}}. Between 1905 and 1914 he served as second conductor at the Royal Theatre. For his son-in-law, Emil Telm\u00e1nyi, Nielsen wrote his Violin Concerto, Op. 33 (1911). From 1914 to 1926, he conducted the Musikforeningen orchestra. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen, and continued to work there until his death.<ref name=\"CNS-sym-op\" />\n[[File:Carl Nielsen 1917 adjusted.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nielsen in 1917|alt=Carl Nielsen, seated, facing right, smartly dressed in a suit and waistcoat]]\n\nThe strain of dual careers and constant separation from his wife led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916\u201322, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in [[Gothenburg]].<ref name=\"CNS-crisis\" /> The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his [[Symphony No. 4 (Nielsen)|Fourth]] (1914\u201316) and [[Symphony No. 5 (Nielsen)|Fifth symphonies]] (1921\u201322), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning.{{sfn|Fanning|2001|p=890}} The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication of many of his major works, including ''Aladdin'' and ''Pan and Syrinx''.<ref name=\"CNS-pile\" />\n\nThe sixth and final symphony, ''Sinfonia semplice'', was written in 1924\u201325. After suffering a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; in an article in ''[[Politiken]]'' on 9 November 1925 he wrote: <blockquote>If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end&nbsp;... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve.

Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air rarefied and bracing.\"<ref name=\"OCM-Layton\" /> Nielsen's last musical composition, the organ work ''[[Commotio (Nielsen)|Commotio]]'', was premiered posthumously in 1931.{{sfn|Gibbs|1963|p=208}}\n\nDuring his final years, Nielsen produced a short book of essays entitled ''Living Music'' (1925), followed in 1927 by his memoir ''Min Fynske Barndom''. In 1926 he wrote in his diary \"My home soil pulls me more and more like a long sucking kiss. Does it mean that I shall finally return and rest in the earth of Funen? Then it must be in the place where I was born: Sortelung, Frydenlands parish\".<ref>Cited in {{harvnb|Grimley|2005|p=218}}.</ref>\n\nThis was not to be. Nielsen was admitted to Copenhagen's National Hospital (Rigshospitalet) on 1 October 1931 following a series of [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]]. He died there at ten minutes past midnight on 3 October, surrounded by his family. His last words to them were \"You are standing here as if you were waiting for something\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.carlnielsen.dk/gb/bio/ |title=Carl Nielsen biografi |last=Ketting |first=Knud |website=Carl Nielsen Society |language=en-GB |access-date=1 October 2018 }}</ref>\n\nHe was buried in Copenhagen's Vestre Cemetery; all the music at his funeral, including the hymns, was the work of the composer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/biography/last-years.php|title=Last years|publisher=Carl Nielsen Society|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref> After his death, his wife was commissioned to sculpt a monument to him, to be erected in central Copenhagen. She wrote: \"I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was to sit there between the rushing wings blowing a reed pipe out over Copenhagen.\" Dispute about her design and a shortfall in funding meant that erection of the monument was delayed and that Anne Marie herself ended up subsidising it. The  [[Carl Nielsen Monument]] was finally unveiled in 1939.{{sfn|Holmen|1985|pp=29\u201331}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|List of compositions by Carl Nielsen}}\nNielsen's works are sometimes referred to by CNW numbers, based on the ''Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works'' (CNW) published online by the [[Danish Royal Library]] in 2015. The CNW catalogue is intended to replace the 1965 catalogue compiled by [[Dan Fog]] and [[Torben Schousboe]] (FS numbers).<ref>{{cite web |title=List of Works |publisher=Carl Nielsen Society |url=http://carlnielsen.dk/pages/list-of-works.php |accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Musical style ===\n[[File:Nielsen5 poster.jpg|thumb|alt=Poster advertising a concert programme at Musikforeningen with items by Beethoven, Bach, and lastly Nielsen's fifth Symphony, 1922|Poster for premiere of Carl Nielsen's Fifth Symphony, 1922]]In his ''Lives of the Great Composers'', the music critic [[Harold Schonberg]] emphasizes the breadth of Nielsen's compositions, his energetic rhythms, generous orchestration and his individuality. In comparing him with [[Jean Sibelius]], he considers he had \"just as much sweep, even more power, and a more universal message\".{{sfn|Schonberg|1997|p=94}} The [[Oxford University]] music professor Daniel M. Grimley qualifies Nielsen as \"one of the most playful, life-affirming, and awkward voices in twentieth-century music\" thanks to the \"melodic richness and harmonic vitality\" of his work.{{sfn|Grimley|2010|p=ix}} Anne-Marie Reynolds, author of ''Carl Nielsen's Voice: His Songs in Context'', cites Robert Simpson's view that \"all of his music is vocal in origin\", maintaining that song-writing strongly influenced Nielsen's development as a composer.{{sfn|Reynolds|2010|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nThe Danish sociologist Benedikte Brincker observes that the perception of Nielsen and his music in his home country is rather different from his international appreciation. His interest and background in folk music had special resonance for Danes, and this was intensified during the nationalistic movements of the 1930s and during World War II, when singing was an important basis for the Danes to distinguish themselves from their German enemies.{{sfn|Brincker|2008|p=684}} Nielsen's songs retain an important place in Danish culture and education. The musicologist Niels Krabbe describes the popular image of Nielsen in Denmark as being like \"the ugly duckling syndrome\" \u2013 a reference to the tale of the Danish writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]] \u2013  whereby \"a poor boy&nbsp;... passing through adversity and frugality&nbsp;... marches into Copenhagen and&nbsp;... comes to conquer the position as the uncrowned King\". Thus while outside Denmark Nielsen is largely thought of as the composer of orchestral music and the opera ''Maskarade'', in his own country he is more of a national symbol. These two sides were officially brought together in Denmark in 2006 when the Ministry of Culture issued a list of the twelve greatest Danish musical works, which included three by Nielsen \u2013 ''Maskarade'', the Fourth Symphony, and a pair of his Danish songs.{{sfn|Krabbe|2012|p=55}} Krabbe asks the rhetorical question: \"Can 'the national' in Nielsen be demonstrated in the music in the form of particular themes, harmonies, sounds, forms, etc., or is it a pure construct of reception history?\"{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|p=44}}\n\nNielsen himself was ambiguous about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He wrote to the Dutch composer [[Julius R\u00f6ntgen]] in 1909 \"I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What do you think about songs sung in [[unison]]? We must go back&nbsp;... to the pure and the clear.\"{{sfn|Brincker|2008|p=689}} On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 \"Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does&nbsp;... and it is impossible to deliver national music on request.\"{{sfn|Brincker|2008|p=684}}\n\nNielsen studied Renaissance [[polyphony]] closely, which accounts for some of the melodic and harmonic content of his music. This interest is exemplified in his ''[[Tre Motetter]]'' (Three Motets, Op. 55).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bachtrack.com/sibelius-nielsen-choral-music-feature|title=National poetry and polyphony: Exploring the choral music of Sibelius and Nielsen|last=Toll\u00e5li|first=Aksel|publisher=Bachtrack|date=11 March 2015|accessdate=31 May 2015 |language=}}</ref> To non-Danish critics, Nielsen's music initially had a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classical]] sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer [[Robert Simpson (composer)|Robert Simpson]] called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen's music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies.{{sfn|Pankhurst|2008|pp=113, 165}} There is debate as to how much such elements owe to his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of [[acciaccatura]]s or [[appoggiatura]]s, or his frequent use of a [[flattened seventh]] and [[minor third]] in his works, as being typically Danish.{{sfn|White|Murphy|2001|p=129}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classical-music.com/topic/carl-nielsen|title=Carl Nielsen|last=Johnson|first=Stephen|publisher=Classical-music.com: Website of BBC Music Magazine|accessdate= |language=}}</ref> The composer himself wrote \"The [[interval (music)|intervals]], as I see it, are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music&nbsp;... [I]t is intervals which surprise and delight us anew every time we hear the cuckoo in spring. Its appeal would be less if its call were all on one note.\"{{sfn|Brincker| 2008|p=694}}\n\nNielsen's philosophy of music style is perhaps summed up in his advice in a 1907 letter to the Norwegian composer Knut Harder: \"You have&nbsp;... fluency, so far, so good; but I advise you again and again, my dear Mr. Harder; ''Tonality, Clarity, Strength''.<ref>Cited in {{harvnb|Grimley|2005|p=216}}.</ref>\n\n=== Symphonies ===\n[[File:FVNP - Odd Fellow 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=photograph of a large three-story manor house with iron railings|[[Odd Fellows Mansion, Copenhagen|Odd Fellows Mansion]] in Copenhagen where many of Nielsen's compositions were premiered]]\nNielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension.<ref name=\"BBC-Nielsen\" /> From its opening bars, [[Symphony No. 1 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 1]] (Op. 7, 1890\u201392), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In [[Symphony No. 2 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 2]] (Op. 16, 1901\u201302), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the [[four humours|four temperaments]] (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).{{sfn|Simpson|1979|p=25}}\n\nThe title of Symphony No. 3, ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Nielsen)|Sinfonia Espansiva]]'' (Op. 27, 1910\u201311), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the \"outward growth of the mind's scope\". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words.<ref name=\"BBC-Nielsen\" /> [[Symphony No. 4 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 4]], ''The Inextinguishable'' (Op. 29, 1914\u201316), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of [[timpani]] are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as \"the life force, the unquenchable will to live\".<ref>{{harvnb|Embassy of Denmark}}. Symphony No. 4.</ref>\n\nAlso frequently performed is the [[Symphony No. 5 (Nielsen)|Symphony No. 5]] (Op. 50, 1921\u201322), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A [[snare drum]]mer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing {{Lang|la|[[ad libitum]]}} and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the [[Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Erik Tuxen]] at the 1950 [[Edinburgh International Festival]], it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia.<ref name=\"BBC-Nielsen\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Guildmusic}}.

''Saul and David'' received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 ''Masquerade'' was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Saul og David''|pp=xi\u2013xxx}}{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Maskarade''|pp=xi\u2013xxxvii}} Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many [[Strophic form|strophic]] songs, its dances and its underlying \"old Copenhagen\" atmosphere.{{sfn|Schepelern|1987|pp=346\u201351}}\n\nNielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed {{lang|la|Hymnus amoris}} (''Hymn of Love''), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style.  Writing in the newspaper ''Dannebrog'', Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as \"a decisive victory\" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of ''[[Nationaltidende]]'' welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the {{lang|da|[[Berlingske Tidende]]}} reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|p=xiii}} {{lang|da|[[S\u00f8vnen]]}} (''The Sleep''), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|p=xxi}} {{lang|da|[[Fynsk Foraar]]}} (''Springtime on Funen''), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|p=xxvii}}\n\n=== Concertos ===\nNielsen wrote three concertos: the Violin Concerto, Op. 33 is a middle-period work, from 1911, which lies within the tradition of European classicism, whereas the Flute Concerto (without opus number) of 1926 and the Clarinet Concerto, Op. 57 which followed in 1928 are late works, influenced by the modernism of the 1920s and, according to the Danish musicologist Herbert Rosenberg, the product of \"an extremely experienced composer who knows how to avoid inessentials.\"{{sfn|Rosenberg|1966|p=49}} Unlike Nielsen's later works, the Violin Concerto has a distinct, melody-oriented neo-classical structure. The Flute Concerto, in two movements, was written for the flautist [[Holger Gilbert-Jespersen]], a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet which had premiered Nielsen's Wind Quintet (1922).<ref name=\"CNS-ac\" /> In contrast to the rather traditional style of the Violin Concerto, it reflects the modernistic trends of the period. The first movement, for example, switches between [[D minor]], [[E-flat minor]] and [[F major]] before the flute comes to the fore with a [[cantabile]] theme in [[E major]].<ref name=\"CA-flute\" /> The Clarinet Concerto was also written for a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet, [[Aage Oxenvad]]. Nielsen stretches the capacities of instrument and player to the utmost; the concerto has just one continuous movement and contains a struggle between the soloist and the orchestra and between the two principal competing keys, F major and E major.<ref>{{harvnb|Reisig}}. Clarinet Concerto.</ref>\n\nThe wind concertos present many examples of what Nielsen called {{lang|da|objektivering}} (\"objectification\"). By this term he meant giving instrumentalists freedom of interpretation and performance within the bounds set out by the [[Sheet music|score]].{{sfn|Slattery|2015}}\n\n=== Orchestral music ===\nNielsen's earliest work composed specifically for orchestra was the immediately successful Suite for Strings (1888), which evoked Scandinavian Romanticism as expressed by Grieg and Svendsen.<ref name=\"Lawson-quartets\" /> The work marked an important milestone in Nielsen's career as it was not only his first real success but it was also the first of his pieces he conducted himself when it was played in Odense a month later.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Suite for String Orchestra''|p=vii}}\n\nThe ''[[Helios Overture]]'', Op. 17 (1903) stems from Nielsen's stay in Athens which inspired him to compose a work depicting the sun rising and setting over the [[Aegean Sea]].{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Helios''|p=vii}} The score is a showpiece for orchestra, and has been amongst Nielsen's most popular works.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodgetts}}. Helios Overture.</ref> {{lang|da|[[Saga-Dr\u00f8m]]}} (''Saga Dream''), Op. 39 (1907\u201308) is a [[symphonic poem|tone poem]] for orchestra based on the Icelandic [[Nj\u00e1l's saga|Njal's Saga]]. In Nielsen's words:{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Orchestral Works 2''|p=xi}}\n<blockquote>There are among other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely alongside one another, with no harmonic connection, and without my marking time. They are just like four streams of thought, each going its own way&nbsp;\u2013 differently and randomly for each performance&nbsp;\u2013 until they meet in a point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they are united.</blockquote>\n\n''[[At the Bier of a Young Artist]]'' ({{lang|da|Ved en ung Kunstners Baare}}) for string orchestra was written for the funeral of the Danish painter [[Oluf Hartmann]] in January 1910 and was also played at Nielsen's own funeral.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Orchestral Works 2''|p=xvii}} ''[[Pan and Syrinx]]'' ({{lang|da|Pan og Syrinx}}), a vigorous nine-minute symphonic poem inspired by [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', was premiered in 1911.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Orchestral Works 2''|p=xxi}} The Rhapsodic Overture, ''[[An Imaginary Trip to the Faroe Islands]]'' ({{lang|da|En Fantasirejse til F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}), draws on [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] folk tunes but also contains freely composed sections.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Orchestral Works 2''|p=xxvi}}\n\nAmong Nielsen's orchestral works for the stage are ''[[Aladdin (Nielsen)|Aladdin]]'' (1919) and {{lang|da|[[Moderen]]}} (The Mother), Op. 41 (1920). ''Aladdin'' was written to accompany a production of [[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]]'s fairy tale at The Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. The complete score, lasting over 80 minutes, is Nielsen's longest work apart from his operas, but a shorter orchestral suite consisting of the ''Oriental March'', ''Hindu Dance'' and ''Negro Dance'' is often performed.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Aladdin''|p=xi}} {{lang|da|Moderen}}, written to celebrate the reunification of [[Southern Jutland]] with Denmark, was first performed in 1921; it is a setting of patriotic verses written for the occasion.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Incidental Music 2''|pp=xi\u2013xxviii}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Chamber music ===\n\nNielsen composed several [[chamber music]] works, some of them still high on the international repertoire. The Wind Quintet, one of his most popular pieces, was composed in 1922 specifically for the Copenhagen Wind Quintet. Simpson, explaining that Nielsen's fondness of wind instruments was closely related to his love of nature, writes: \"He was also intensely interested in human character, and in the Wind Quintet composed deliberately for five friends; each part is cunningly made to suit the individuality of each player.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Sierra Chamber Society}}.

The [[String Quartet No. 1 (Nielsen)|First String Quartet No. 1 in G minor]], Op. 13 (1889, revised 1900) contains a \"R\u00e9sum\u00e9\" section in the finale, bringing together themes from the first, third and fourth movements.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Piano and Organ Works''|p=xiv}}  The [[String Quartet No. 2 (Nielsen)|Second String Quartet No. 2 in F minor]], Op. 5 appeared in 1890 and the [[String Quartet No. 3 (Nielsen)|Third String Quartet in E-flat major]], Op. 14 in 1898. The music historian Jan Smaczny suggests that in this work \"the handling of texture is confident and far less derivative than in earlier works ... [the quartet] prompts the most regret that Nielsen did not pursue the genre further ... to parallel his later symphonic development\".{{sfn|Smaczny|2003|p=274}} The [[String Quartet No. 4 (Nielsen)|Fourth String Quartet in F major]] (1904) initially received a mixed reception, with critics uncertain about its reserved style. Nielsen revised it several times, the final version in 1919 being listed as his Op. 44.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Chamber Music 1''|p=xi}}\n\nThe violin was Nielsen's own instrument and he composed four large-scale chamber works for it. The departures from standard procedures in the First Sonata, Op. 9 (1895), including its often sudden [[modulation (music)|modulations]] and its terse thematic material, disconcerted Danish critics at its first performance. The Second Sonata, Op.&nbsp;35 of 1912 was written for the violinist [[Peder M\u00f8ller (violinist)|Peder M\u00f8ller]] who earlier that year had premiered the composer's Violin Concerto. The work is an example of the composer's progressive tonality since, although it is stated to be in the key of G minor, the first and final movements end in different keys. The critic [[Emilius Bangert]] wrote of the premiere (which was given by [[Axel Gade]]), \"The overall impression was of a beautiful, unbroken line&nbsp;\u2013 a flow of notes&nbsp;\u2013 where in particular a wonderful second subject in the first part and the pure, high sphere of the last part were captivating\". Two other works are for violin solo. The ''Prelude, Theme and Variations'', Op. 48 (1923) was written for Telm\u00e1nyi, and, like Nielsen's ''[[Chaconne (Nielsen)|Chaconne]]'' for piano, Op. 32, was inspired by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The ''Preludio e Presto'', Op. 52 (1928) was written as a tribute for the sixtieth birthday of the composer [[Fini Henriques]].{{sfn|Ketting|2007}}\n\n=== Keyboard works ===\nAlthough Nielsen came to compose mainly at the piano, he only composed directly for it occasionally over a period of 40 years, creating works often with a distinctive style which slowed their international acceptance.{{sfn|Skjold-Rasmussen|1966|p=57}} Nielsen's own piano technique, an echo of which is probably preserved in three [[wax cylinders]] marked \"Carl Nielsen\" at the State Archives in [[Aarhus]], seems to have been mediocre.{{sfn|Grimley|2005|p=203}} Reviewing the 1969 recording of works by the pianist [[John Ogdon]], John Horton commented on the early pieces: \"Nielsen's technical resources hardly measure up to the grandeur of his designs\", whilst characterising the later pieces as \"major works which can stand comparison with his symphonic music\".{{sfn|Horton|1969|p=499}} The anti-romantic tone of the ''Symphonic Suite'', Op. 8 (1894) was described by a later critic as \"nothing less than a clenched fist straight in the face of all established musical convention\".<ref>T\u00f8rsleff, Hans. Cited in {{harvnb|Grimley|2005|p=205}}.</ref> In Nielsen's words, the ''Chaconne'', Op. 32 (1917) was \"a really big piece, and I think effective\".{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Piano and Organ Works''|pp=xxiii\u2013xxvi}} It is not only inspired by the work of Bach, especially the [[Partita for Violin No. 2 (Bach)#The Ciaccona|chaconne for solo violin]], but also by the virtuoso piano arrangements of Bach's music by composers such as [[Robert Schumann]], Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni.{{sfn|Grimley|2005|pp=210\u201312}} Also on a large scale, and from the same year, is the ''Theme and Variations'', Op. 41, in which critics have discerned the influences of Brahms and also of [[Max Reger]], of whom Nielsen had earlier written to a friend \"I think that the public will be utterly unable to grasp Reger's work and yet I am a lot more sympathetic towards his efforts than towards&nbsp;... [[Richard Strauss]]\".{{sfn|Grimley|2005|pp=218\u201319}}\n\nAll Nielsen's organ works were late compositions. The Danish organist [[Finn Vider\u00f8]] suggests that his interest was prompted by the {{lang|de|Orgelbewegung}} ([[Organ reform movement]]), and the renewal of the front pipes of the [[Schnitger organ (Hamburg)|Schnitger organ]] in the [[St. Jacobi, Hamburg|St. Jacobi Church]], Hamburg, from 1928 to 1930.{{sfn|Vider\u00f8|1966|p=69}} Nielsen's last major work&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|la|Commotio}}, Op. 58, a 22-minute piece for organ&nbsp;\u2013 was composed between June 1930 and February 1931, only a few months before his death.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Piano and Organ Works''|page=xlix}}\n\n=== Songs and hymns ===\n{{See also|List of songs composed by Carl Nielsen}}\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Forunderligt at sige, Carl Nielsen, Erik Damskier.ogg|title=''Forunderligt at sige'' (\"How wonderful to ponder\")|description=Christmas hymn played on piano, lyrics by [[N.

In {{harvnb|Reynolds|2010|p=8<!--unnumbered on the page, clear from contents list-->}}.</ref> In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:<blockquote>With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, [[Christian Winther]] or [[Holger Drachmann|Drachmann]], and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But it is also clear that a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is that brings us to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.{{sfn|Vesterg\u00e5rd|Vorre|2008|p=85}}</blockquote>\n\nOf great significance was Nielsen's contribution to the 1922 publication, '' Folkeh\u00f8jskolens Melodibog (The Folk High School Songbook)'', of which he was one of the editors together with [[Thomas Laub]], [[Oluf Ring]] and [[Thorvald Aagaard]]. The book contained about 600 melodies, of which about 200 were composed by the editors, and was intended to provide a repertoire for [[Sing-along|communal singing]], an integral part of Danish folk culture. The collection was extremely popular and became embedded in the Danish educational system. During the [[Denmark in World War II|German occupation of Denmark]] in World War II, mass song gatherings, using these melodies, were part of Denmark's \"spiritual re-armament\", and after the war in 1945 Nielsen's contributions were characterised by one writer as \"shining jewels in our treasure-chest of patriotic songs\". This remains a significant factor in Danish assessment of the composer.{{sfn|Vesterg\u00e5rd|Vorre|2008|pp=83\u201384}}\n\n=== Editions ===\nBetween 1994 and 2009 a complete new edition of Nielsen's works, the ''Carl Nielsen Edition'', was commissioned by the Danish Government (at a cost of over 40 million kroner).{{sfn|Krabbe|2012|pp=3\u20134}} For many of the works, including the operas ''Maskarade'' and ''Saul and David'', and the complete ''Aladdin'' music, this was their first printed publication, copies of manuscripts having previously been used in performances.{{sfn|Krabbe|2012|p=7}} The scores are now all available for download free of charge at the website of the Danish Royal Library (which also owns most of Nielsen's music manuscripts).<ref name=\"RDL-download\" />\n\n== Reception ==\nUnlike that of his contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's reputation abroad did not start to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started to become part of the world repertoire.<ref name=\"CNS-performances\" /> Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of ''Hymnus amoris'' that he received support from the critics,{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Cantatas 1''|pp=xi\u2013xiv}} to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of ''Masquerade''.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Maskarade''|p=xiii}}\n\nWithin two months of its successful premiere at the Odd Fellows Concert Hall in Copenhagen on 28 February 1912, the Third Symphony (''Espansiva)'' was in the repertoire of the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Amsterdam Concertgebouw]], and by 1913 it had seen performances in Stuttgart, Stockholm and Helsinki. The symphony was the most popular of all Nielsen's works during his lifetime and was also played in Berlin, Hamburg, London and Gothenburg.{{sfn|''Carl Nielsen Edition: Symphony 3 Preface''|p=xv}}{{sfn|Phillips|2014}} Other works caused some uncertainty, even in Denmark. After the premiere of the Fifth Symphony (1922) one critic wrote: \"The treasure of Danish symphonies and Carl Nielsen's own output have been enriched by a strange and highly original work.\" Another, however, described it as a \"bloody, clenched fist in the face of an unsuspecting snob audience\", also qualifying it as \"filthy music from trenches\".<ref name=\"CNS-pile\" />\n\nAt the end of the 1940s two major biographies of Nielsen appeared in Danish,<ref name=\"biographies-40s\" /> dominating opinion of the composer's life and work for several decades.{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|p=45}} Robert Simpson's book ''Carl Nielsen, Symphonist'' (first edition 1952) was the earliest large-scale study in English.{{sfn|Simpson|1979}}\n\nAn international breakthrough came in 1962 when Leonard Bernstein recorded the Fifth Symphony with the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for CBS. The recording helped Nielsen's music to achieve appreciation beyond his home country and is considered one of the finest recorded accounts of the symphony.{{sfn|Fanning|1997|p=92}}{{sfn|Burton|2006}} Nielsen's centenary in 1965 was widely celebrated, both in terms of performances and publications, and Bernstein was awarded the [[L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize|Sonning Prize]] for his recording of the Third Symphony.{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|p=47}} In 1988 Nielsen's diaries and his letters to Anne Marie were published, and these, together with a 1991 biography by J\u00f8rgen Jensen using this new material, led to a revised objective assessment of the composer's personality.{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|pp=47\u201348}} Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on the occasion of Nielsen's 125th anniversary in 1990, the music critic Andrew Pincus recalled that 25 years earlier Bernstein had believed the world was ready to accept the Dane as the equal of Jean Sibelius, speaking of \"his rough charm, his swing, his drive, his rhythmic surprises, his strange power of harmonic and tonal relationships&nbsp;\u2013 and especially his constant unpredictability\" (which Pincus believed was still a challenge for audiences).{{sfn|Pincus|1990}} Biographies and studies in English in the 1990s<ref name=\"biographies-90s\" /> helped to establish Nielsen's status worldwide,{{sfn|Krabbe|2007|pp=50\u201353}} to the point at which his music has become a regular feature of concert programming in Western countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storbritannien.um.dk/en/about%20great%20britain/carl-nielsen-150th-anniversary/|title=Carl Nielsen 150th Anniversary|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=1 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424143402/http://storbritannien.um.dk/en/about%20great%20britain/carl-nielsen-150th-anniversary/|archivedate=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 2008, the American music critic [[Alex Ross]] compares the \"brute strength\" of Nielsen's symphonies to [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'' and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]] but explains that only now were the Americans slowly beginning to appreciate the Danish composer. In particular, he compliments [[Alan Gilbert (conductor)|Alan Gilbert]] on his understanding and interpretations of the Nielsen symphonies.{{sfn|Ross|2008}}\n\nNielsen did not record any of his works.<ref name=\"Musicweb-vol-1\" /> However, three younger contemporary conductors who had worked with him, [[Thomas Jensen]], [[Launy Gr\u00f8ndahl]], and Erik Tuxen, did record his symphonies and other orchestral works with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra between 1946 and 1952. Jensen also made the first [[LP record]]ing of the Fifth Symphony in 1954.{{sfn|Cane|2014|pp=12\u201318}} Work carried out by the recently published complete ''Carl Nielsen Edition'' has revealed that the scores used in these recordings often differ from the composer's original intentions and thus the supposed authenticity of these recordings is now debatable.{{sfn|Krabbe|2012|pp=6\u20137}}\n\nThere are now numerous recordings of all Nielsen's major works, including complete cycles of the symphonies conducted by, amongst others, [[Colin Davis|Sir Colin Davis]], [[Herbert Blomstedt]] and [[Sakari Oramo]].

He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark.{{sfn|Grimley|2010|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mv6ZD7378CcC&pg=PA10 p.&nbsp;10 footnote]}} Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, [[Harald Agersnap]], both a conductor and orchestral composer, and [[J\u00f8rgen Bentzon]] who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (K\u00f8benhavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist [[Knud Jeppesen]], the pianist [[Herman David Koppel|Herman Koppel]], the academy professor and symphony composer [[Poul Schierbeck]], the organist Emilius Bangert who played at [[Roskilde Cathedral]], and [[Nancy Dalberg]], one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of ''Aladdin''.

Madero was notable for challenging long-time Mexican President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] for the presidency in 1910 and being instrumental in sparking the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nBorn into an extremely wealthy family in [[Coahuila]], northern Mexico, Madero was an unusual politician, who until he ran for president in the 1910 elections, had never held office. In his 1908 book entitled ''The Presidential Succession in 1910'', Madero called on voters to prevent the sixth reelection of Porfirio D\u00edaz, which Madero considered anti-democratic. His vision would lay the foundation for a democratic, twentieth-century Mexico, but without polarizing the social classes. To that effect, he bankrolled the opposition Anti-Reelectionist Party and urged Mexicans to oust D\u00edaz in the 1910 election. Madero's candidacy against D\u00edaz garnered widespread support in Mexico. He was possessed of independent financial means, ideological determination, and the bravery to oppose D\u00edaz when it was dangerous to do so.<ref>Cumberland, Charles C. ''Mexican Revolution: Genesis Under Madero''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1952, p. 70.</ref> D\u00edaz had Madero arrested before the elections, which were then seen as fraudulent.  Madero escaped from prison and issued the [[Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed]] from the United States. For the first time, he called for an armed uprising against the illegitimately-elected D\u00edaz, and outlined a  program of reform. The armed phase of the Mexican Revolution dates to his plan.\n\nUprisings in Morelos under [[Emiliano Zapata]] and in Mexico's north by [[Pascual Orozco]], [[Pancho Villa]] and others and the inability of Mexican [[Federal Army]] to suppress them forced D\u00edaz's resignation on 25 May 1911, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], Madero was enormously popular among many sectors, but he did not assume the presidency.  An interim president was installed and elections were scheduled for fall 1911. Madero was elected president on 15 October 1911 by almost 90% of the vote. Sworn into office on 6 November 1911, he became one of Mexico's youngest elected presidents, having just turned 38.\n\nMadero's administration soon encountered opposition both from more radical revolutionaries and from conservatives. He did not move quickly on land reform, which was a key demand of many of his supporters. Former supporters Emiliano Zapata declared himself in rebellion against Madero in the [[Plan of Ayala]] as Pascual Orozco did in his Plan Orozquista.  These were significant challenges to Madero's presidency. Labor also became disillusioned by his moderate policies. Foreign entrepreneurs were concerned that Madero was unable to maintain political stability that would keep their investments safe. Foreign governments were concerned that a destabilized Mexico would threaten the international order.\n\nIn February 1913, a military coup took place in the Mexican capital led by General [[Victoriano Huerta]], the military commander of the city, and supported by the United States ambassador. Madero was arrested and a short time later assassinated along with his Vice-President, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]], on 22 February 1913, following the series of events known as the [[Ten Tragic Days]] (la ''Decena Tr\u00e1gica''). In death, Madero became a unifying force of disparate elements in Mexico opposed to the regime of Huerta.  In the north, governor of Coahuila [[Venustiano Carranza]] led what became the [[Constitutionalist Army]] against Huerta, while Zapata continued in his rebellion under the Plan of Ayala. Once Huerta was ousted in July 1914, the opposition coalition held together by Madero's memory dissolved and Mexico entered a new stage of civil war.\n\n==Early Years (1873\u20131903)==\n===Family background===\nMadero was born in the [[hacienda]] of El Rosario, in [[Parras de la Fuente]], [[Coahuila]], the first son of Francisco Ignacio Madero Hern\u00e1ndez and Mercedes Gonz\u00e1lez Trevi\u00f1o, and the first grandson of family patriarch, Evaristo Madero, governor of Coahuila. He was sickly as a child, and was small in stature as an adult.<ref>Krauze, Enrique. ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, pp. 245\u201346.</ref> It is widely believed that Madero's middle initial, I, stood for Indalecio, but according to his birth certificate it stood for Ignacio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/acces/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=264:revolucion--francisco-i-madero-con-qiq-de-ignacio-por-alejandro-rosas&catid=3:revolucion&Itemid=13|title=Revoluci\u00f3n / Francisco I. Madero: con \"I\" de Ignacio, por Alejandro Rosas|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.bicentenario.gob.mx|accessdate=15 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nHis family has been described as one of the five wealthiest families in Mexico. His grandfather, Evaristo Madero, began as a founder of a regional carting business, but he took advantage of economic opportunity and transported cotton from the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to Mexican ports during the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861\u201365). Having built a diversified fortune, but before his real success, Evaristo first married Rafaela Hern\u00e1ndez Lombra\u00f1a, half-sister of the powerful miner and banker Antonio V. Hern\u00e1ndez. Alongside his brother-in-law, and other of his new political family's relations, he founded the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Industrial de Parras'', initially involved in commercial vineyards, cotton, and textiles, and later also in mining, cotton mills, ranching, banking, coal, [[guayule]] rubber, and foundries in the later part of the nineteenth century. For many years, the family prospered during [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]'s regime, and by 1910 the family was one of the richest in Mexico, worth 30 million pesos ($15&nbsp;million U.S. dollars<ref>Ross, Stanley R. ''Francisco I. Madero, Apostle of Democracy''. New York: Columbia University Press 1955, 3.</ref> of the day, and almost $500 million U.S. dollars in today's money). Much of this wealth arose from the diversification of Madero lands during the 1890s into the production of ''guayule'' rubber plants.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/110 110]|title=The Mexican Revolution Volume 1. Porfirians, Liberals and Peasants|ISBN=0-8032-7770-9|url=https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/110}}</ref>\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, and having built his success, Evaristo Madero remarried to Do\u00f1a Manuela de Far\u00edas Benavides, member of one of northern Mexico's most aristocratic families, daughter of Don Juan Francisco de Far\u00edas, mayor of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]]. Evaristo Madero also served as governor of Coahuila from 1880 to 1884,<ref>Ross, ''Francisco I. Madero'', p. 4.</ref> during the four-year [[interregnum]] of Porfirio D\u00edaz's rule. Afterwards, Evaristo was permanently sidelined from political office when D\u00edaz returned to the presidency in 1884 and served until 1911. Evaristo Madero's two marriages were fruitful, with a total of 18 children, 14 of whom would survive until adulthood, and whose descendants make up some of Mexico's most influential families until this day. Thus, young Francisco was a member of a huge and powerful northern Mexican clan with a focus on commercial rather than political interests.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/55 55]|title=The Mexican Revolution Volume 1.

Madero.]]\nFrancisco and his brother [[Gustavo A. Madero]] attended the [[Jesuit]] college in [[Saltillo]], but his early Catholic education had little lasting impact. As a young man, his father sent him to carry out preparatory studies at the [[Culver Academies]] in the [[United States]] and later at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Hoche]] in [[Versailles]], [[France]], where he completed the [[classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles]] program. Soon after, he was admitted to study business at the prestigious [[HEC Paris|\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Paris]] (HEC).\n\nHis father's subscription to the magazine ''Revue Spirite'' awakened in the young Madero an interest in [[Spiritism]], an offshoot of [[Spiritualism]]. During his time in Paris, Madero made a pilgrimage to the tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], the founder of Spiritism, and became a passionate advocate of the belief, soon coming to believe he was a [[Mediumship|medium]].\n\nFollowing [[business school]], Madero traveled to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to study agricultural techniques and to improve his English. During his time there, he was influenced by the [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophist]] ideas of [[Annie Besant]], which were prominent at nearby [[Stanford University]].<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 247\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 247.</ref>\n\n===Return to Mexico===\n[[File:Mr and Mrs Francisco Indalecio Madero cph.3b47072.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco I.

He embarked on a lifelong commitment to philanthropy. His employees were well paid and received regular medical exams; he built schools, hospitals, and community kitchens; and he paid to support orphans and award scholarships. He also taught himself [[homeopathy]] and offered medical treatments to his employees. Francisco became increasingly engaged with Spiritism and in 1901 was convinced that the spirit of his brother Ra\u00fal, who had died at age 4, was communicating with him, urging him to do charity work and practice self-discipline and self-abnegation. Madero became a vegetarian and stopped drinking alcohol and smoking.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 248.</ref>\n\nAlready well-connected to a wealthy family and now well-educated in business, he had built a personal fortune of over 500,000 pesos<ref name=\"Knight 56\"/> by 1899.<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 247\"/> The family was organized on patriarchal principles, so that even though young Francisco was wealthy in his own right, his father and especially his grandfather Evaristo viewed him as someone who should be under the authority of his elders.

Madero was deeply moved and, believing himself to be receiving advice from the [[spirit]] of his late brother Ra\u00fal, he decided to act.<ref>Madero had another brother, also named Ra\u00fal, who survived to adulthood and participated in the Mexican Revolution. Ross, ''Madero'', p. 15.</ref> The spirit of Ra\u00fal told him, \"Aspire to do good for your fellow citizens...working for a lofty ideal that will raise the moral level of society, that will succeed in liberating it from oppression, slavery, and fanaticism.\"<ref>quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 248, and 820, footnote 10 who cites a Madero manuscript in a private collection.</ref> Madero founded the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] Democratic Club and ran for municipal office in 1904, though he lost the election narrowly. In addition to his political activities, Madero continued his interest in Spiritualism, publishing a number of articles under the pseudonym of [[Arjuna]] (a prince from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'').<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 249.</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Madero became increasingly involved in opposition to the D\u00edaz government. He organized political clubs and founded a political newspaper (''El Dem\u00f3crata'') and a satirical periodical (''El Mosco'', \"The Fly\"). Madero's preferred candidate, Frumencio Fuentes, was defeated by that of Porfirio D\u00edaz in Coahuila's 1905 gubernatorial elections. D\u00edaz considered jailing Madero, but Bernardo Reyes suggested that Francisco's father be asked to control his increasingly political son.<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\"/>\n\n===Leader of the Anti-Re-election Movement (1908\u20131909)===\n[[File:Creelman04.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Photo of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (1830\u20131915) that accompanied the [[James Creelman|Creelman]] interview in ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'' (1908).]]\nIn an interview with journalist [[James Creelman]] published in 17 February 1908 issue of ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', President D\u00edaz said that Mexico was ready for a democracy and that the 1910 presidential election would be a free election.\n\nMadero spent the bulk of 1908 writing a book, which he believed was at the direction of spirits, now including that of Benito Ju\u00e1rez himself.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 251\u2013253.</ref> This book, published in January 1909, was titled ''La sucesi\u00f3n presidencial en 1910'' (''The Presidential Succession of 1910''). The book quickly became a bestseller in Mexico. The book proclaimed that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one man \u2013 Porfirio D\u00edaz \u2013 for so long had made Mexico sick. Madero pointed out the irony that in 1871, Porfirio D\u00edaz's political slogan had been \"No Re-election\". Madero acknowledged that Porfirio D\u00edaz had brought peace and a measure of economic growth to Mexico.  However, Madero argued that this was counterbalanced by the dramatic loss of freedom, including the brutal treatment of the [[Yaqui people]], the repression of workers in [[Cananea]], excessive concessions to the United States, and an unhealthy centralization of politics around the person of the president. Madero called for a return of the Liberal [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]]. To achieve this, Madero proposed organizing a Democratic Party under the slogan ''Sufragio efectivo, no reelecci\u00f3n'' (\"Effective Suffrage. No Re-election\"). Porfirio D\u00edaz could either run in a free election or retire.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 252\u2013253.</ref>\n\n[[File:AntireelecionistaPosadaDF.JPG|thumb|right|\"Manifestaci\u00f3n antireeleccionista\" by [[Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada]].]]\n\nMadero's book was well received, and widely read. Many people began to call Madero ''[[the Apostle of Democracy]]''. Madero sold off much of his property \u2013 often at a considerable loss \u2013 in order to finance anti-re-election activities throughout Mexico. He founded the Anti-Re-election Center in [[Mexico City]] in May 1909, and soon thereafter lent his backing to the periodical ''[[El Antirreeleccionista]]'', which was run by the young lawyer/philosopher [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] and another intellectual, [[Luis Cabrera Lobato]].<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 253\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 253.</ref> In Puebla, [[Aquiles Serd\u00e1n]], from a politically engaged family, contacted Madero and as a result, formed an Anti-Re-electionist Club to organize particularly among working class Mexicans for the 1910 elections.<ref>LaFrance, David G. \"Aquiles Serd\u00e1n\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1341.

In a show of U.S. support, D\u00edaz and [[William Howard Taft]] planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, for 16 October 1909, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico.<ref name=\"Harris2009\">{{cite book |last1=Harris|first1=Charles H.

Only the candidate and the president were present for the meeting, so the only account of it is Madero's own in correspondence.

Resentful of the \"peaceful invasion\" from the United States \"which came to control 90 percent of Mexico's mineral resources, its national railroad, its oil industry and, increasingly, its land,\" Mexico's poor and middle-class overwhelmingly showed their support for Madero.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Zeit |first=Joshua |date=4 February 2017 |title=The Last Time the U.S. Invaded Mexico |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/the-last-time-the-us-invaded-mexico-214738 |magazine=Politico Magazine |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Politico]] |access-date=5 February 2017}}</ref> Fearful of a dramatic change in direction, on 6 June 1910, the Porfirian regime arrested Madero in [[Monterrey]] and sent him to a prison in [[San Luis Potos\u00ed City|San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. Approximately 5,000 other members of the Anti-Re-electionist movement were also jailed. [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez]] took over the nomination, but during Madero's time in jail, a fraudulent election was held on 21 June 1910 that gave D\u00edaz an unbelievably large margin of victory.\n\nMadero's father used his influence with the state governor and posted bond to give Madero the right to move about the city on horseback during the day. On 4th October 1910, Madero galloped away from his guards and took refuge with sympathizers in a nearby village. Three days later he was smuggled across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S. border]], hidden in a baggage car by sympathetic railway workers.\n\n===Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed and rebellion===\n{{Main|Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed}}\n[[File:Roque Gonzalez y Madero.jpg|thumb|Madero (center) in San Antonio, Texas while in exile]]\n[[File:Madero (and) Pascual Orozco.

The plan proclaimed the elections of 1910 null and void, and called for an armed revolution to begin at 6&nbsp;pm on 20 November 1910, against the \"illegitimate presidency/dictatorship of D\u00edaz\". At that point, Madero declared himself provisional President of Mexico, and called for a general refusal to acknowledge the central government, restitution of land to villages and Indian communities, and freedom for political prisoners. Madero's policies painted him as a leader of each of the different castes in Mexican society at the time. He was a member of the upper class; the middle class saw that he sought to gain entry into political processes; the lower class saw that he promised fairer politics and a much more substantial, equitable economic system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Mexican Revolution: A Brief History with Documents|last=Wasserman|first=Mark|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2012|isbn=978-0-312-53504-9|location=Boston, MA|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nThe family drew on its financial resources to make regime change possible, with Madero's brother [[Gustavo A.

However, his uncle arrived late and brought only ten men. Madero decided to postpone the revolution. Instead, he and his brother Ra\u00fal (who had been given the same name as his late brother) traveled incognito to New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nIn February 1911, Madero entered Chihuahua and led 130 men in an attack on [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]]. Madero was reported wounded in the fighting, but was saved by his personal bodyguard and Revolutionary general [[M\u00e1ximo Castillo]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=M\u00e1ximo Castillo and the Mexican Revolution|last=Castillo|first=M\u00e1ximo|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0807163887|editor-last=Vald\u00e9s|editor-first=Jes\u00fas Vargas|location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana|pages=154|translator-last=Aliaga-Buchenau|translator-first=Ana-Isabel}}</ref> He spent the next several months as the head of the Mexican Revolution. Madero successfully imported arms from the United States, with the American government under [[William Howard Taft]] doing little to halt the flow of arms to the Mexican revolutionaries.  By April the Revolution had spread to eighteen [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|states]], including [[Morelos]] where the leader was [[Emiliano Zapata]].\n\nOn 1 April 1911, Porfirio D\u00edaz claimed that he had heard the voice of the people of Mexico, replaced his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President D\u00edaz and Vice-President [[Ram\u00f3n Corral]]. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders&nbsp;\u2013 they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with D\u00edaz if possible. In May, Madero wanted a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries [[Pascual Orozco]] and [[Pancho Villa|Francisco Villa]] disagreed and went ahead with an attack on [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively, making it clear that D\u00edaz could no longer retain power.  On 21 May 1911, the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] was signed.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, D\u00edaz and Corral agreed to resign by the end of May 1911, with D\u00edaz's [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]], becoming interim president solely for the purpose of calling general elections.\n\nThis first phase of the Mexican Revolution thus ended with D\u00edaz leaving for exile in Europe at the end of May 1911, escorted into exile by General [[Victoriano Huerta]]. On 7 June 1911, Madero entered [[Mexico City]] in triumph where he was greeted with huge crowds shouting \"''\u00a1Viva Madero!''\"\n\n===Interim Presidency of De la Barra (May\u2013November 1911)===\n[[File:Francisco Leon de la Barra.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]] (1863\u20131939), whose interim presidency in 1911 gave Madero's enemies time to organize.]]\n[[File:Madero en Cuernavaca.jpg|thumb|right|Francisco I.

Zapata rebelled in 1911, because of President Madero's slowness to implement land reform.|alt=|261x261px]]\n\nAlthough Madero and his supporters had forced Porfirio D\u00edaz from power, he did not assume the presidency in June 1911. Instead, following the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, he was a candidate for president and had no formal role in the Interim Presidency of [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]], a diplomat and lawyer. Left in place was the [[Congress of Mexico]], which was full of candidates whom D\u00edaz had handpicked for the 1910 election. By doing this, Madero was true to his ideological commitment to constitutional democracy, but with members of the D\u00edaz regime still in power, he was caused difficulties in the short and long term. The German ambassador to Mexico, [[Paul von Hintze]], who associated with the Interim President, said of him that \"De la Barra wants to accommodate himself with dignity to the inevitable advance of the ex-revolutionary influence, while accelerating the widespread collapse of the Madero party....\"<ref>quoted in [[Friedrich Katz]], ''The Secret War in Mexico''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1981, pp. 40-41.</ref> Madero sought to be a moderate democrat and follow the course outlined in treaty bringing about exile of D\u00edaz, but by calling for the disarming anddemobilization of his revolutionary base, he undermined his support. The Mexican Federal Army, just defeated by the revolutionaries, was to continue as the armed force of the Mexican state.  Madero argued that the revolutionaries should henceforth proceed solely by peaceful means. In the south, revolutionary leader [[Emiliano Zapata]] was skeptical about disbanding his troops, especially since the Federal Army from the D\u00edaz era remained essentially intact. However, Madero traveled south to meet with Zapata at [[Cuernavaca]] and [[Cuautla, Morelos]]. Madero assured Zapata that the land redistribution promised in the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed would be carried out when Madero became president.\n\nWith Madero now campaigning for the presidency, which he was expected to win, several landowners from Zapata's state of [[Morelos]] took advantage of his not being head of state and appealed to President De la Barra and the Congress to restore their lands which had been seized by Zapatista revolutionaries. They spread exaggerated stories of atrocities committed by Zapata's irregulars, calling Zapata the \"[[Attila]] of the South\". De la Barra and the Congress, therefore, decided to send regular troops under [[Victoriano Huerta]] to suppress Zapata's revolutionaries. Madero once again traveled south to urge Zapata to disband his supporters peacefully, but Zapata refused on the grounds that Huerta's troops were advancing on [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]]. Zapata's suspicions proved accurate as Huerta's Federal soldiers moved violently into Yautepec. Madero wrote to De la Barra, saying that Huerta's actions were unjustified and recommending that Zapata's demands be met. However, when he left the south, he had achieved nothing. Nevertheless, he promised the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] that once he became president, things would change. Most Zapatistas had grown suspicious of Madero, however.\n\n===Madero presidency (November 1911 \u2013 February 1913)===\n[[File:Presidente_Francisco_I._Madero.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Francisco I.

A curious fact is that almost immediately after taking office in November, Madero became the first head of state in the world to fly in an airplane, which the Mexican press was later to mock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1171-did-you-know-the-world-s-first-aerial-bombing-the-battle-of-topolobampo-mexico|title=Did You Know?

Conservatives in the Senate refused to pass the reforms he advocated. At the same time, several of Madero's allies denounced him for being overly conciliatory with the Porfirians and with not moving aggressively forward with reforms.\n\nAfter years of censorship, Mexican newspapers took advantage of their newly found [[freedom of the press]] to harshly criticize Madero's performance as president. [[Gustavo A. Madero]], the president's brother, remarked that \"the newspapers bite the hand that took off their muzzle.\"  President Madero refused the recommendation of some of his advisors that he bring back censorship. The press was particularly critical of Madero's handling of rebellions that broke out against his rule shortly after he became president.\n\nDespite internal and external opposition, the Madero administration had a number of important accomplishments, including freedom of the press. He freed political prisoners and abolished the death penalty. He did away with the practice of the D\u00edaz government, which appointed local political bosses (''jefes pol\u00edticos''), and instead set up a system of independent municipal authorities. State elections were free and fair. He was concerned about the improvement of education, establishing new schools and workshops. An important step was the creation of a federal department of labor, limited the workday to 10 hours, and set in place regulations on women's and children's labor.  Unions were granted the right to freely organize. The ''[[Casa del Obrero Mundial]]'' (\"House of the World Worker\"), an organization with [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] was founded during his presidency.<ref>Tortolero Cervantes,. \"Francisco I. Madero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 766-67.</ref>\n\nMadero alienated a number of his political supporters when he created a new political party, the Constitutionalist Progressive party, which replaced the Anti-Reelectionist Party. He ousted leftist Emilio V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez from his cabinet, brother of Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez, whom Madero had replaced as his vice presidential candidate with Pino Su\u00e1rez.<ref>LaFrance, David. \"Francisco I. Madero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 3. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996, p. 488.</ref>\n\n====Rebellions====\nMadero retained the Mexican Federal Army and ordered the demobilization of revolutionary forces.  For revolutionaries who considered themselves the reason that D\u00edaz resigned, this was a hard course to follow. Since Madero did not implement immediate, radical reforms that many of those had supported him had expected, he lost control of those areas in Morelos and Chihuahua.  A series of internal rebellions challenged Madero's presidency before the February 1913 coup that deposed him.\n\n=====Zapatista rebellion=====\nIn Morelos, [[Emiliano Zapata]] proclaimed the [[Plan of Ayala]] on 25 November 1911, which excoriated Madero's slowness on land reform. Zapata's plan recognized Pascual Orozco as fellow revolutionary, although Orozco was for the moment loyal to Madero, until 1912.\n\n=====Reyes rebellion=====\nIn December 1911, [[Bernardo Reyes]] (the popular general whom Porfirio D\u00edaz had sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission because D\u00edaz worried that Reyes was going to challenge him for the presidency) launched a rebellion in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], where he had previously served as governor. Reyes's rebellion lasted only eleven days before Reyes surrendered at [[Linares, Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and was sent to the Santiago Tlatelolco prison in [[Mexico City]].\n[[File:V Huerta.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Victoriano Huerta]] (1850\u20131916), general who fought the [[Liberation Army of the South]] in 1911 and [[Pascual Orozco]] in 1912.

F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz would later conspire with [[Victoriano Huerta]] during the ''[[Decena tr\u00e1gica]]''.]]\n\n=====Orozco rebellion=====\nIn March 1912, Madero's former general [[Pascual Orozco]], who was personally resentful of how President Madero had treated him once he was in office, launched a rebellion in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] with the financial backing of [[Luis Terrazas]], a former [[Governor of Chihuahua]] who was the largest landowner in Mexico. Madero dispatched troops under General Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Salas to put down the rebellion, but they were initially defeated by Orozco's troops. Gonz\u00e1lez Salas committed suicide and General [[Victoriano Huerta]] assumed control of the federalist forces.  Huerta was more successful, defeating Orozco's troops in three major battles and forcing Orozco to flee to the United States in September 1912.\n\nRelations between Huerta and Madero grew strained during the course of this campaign when [[Pancho Villa]], the commander of the ''[[Divisi\u00f3n del Norte]]'', refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa's execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912.<ref>Heribert von Feilitzsch, ''In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914'', Henselstone Verlag LLC, 2012, p. 212</ref> Angry at Madero's commutation of Villa's sentence, Huerta, after a long night of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico's Minister of War learned of General Huerta's comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.\n\n=====F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz rebellion=====\nOctober 1912, [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]] (nephew of Porfirio D\u00edaz) launched a rebellion in [[Veracruz]], \"to reclaim the honor of the army trampled by Madero.\" This rebellion was quickly crushed and F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz was imprisoned. Madero was prepared to have F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz executed, but the [[Supreme Court of Mexico]] declared that F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz would be imprisoned, but not executed.\n\n==Ten Tragic Days and death of Madero==\n{{Main|Ten Tragic Days}}\n[[File:Madero_1913.png|thumb|250px|President Madero riding the streets near the Palace, acclaimed by his supporters, a few days before his tragic end.]]\n[[File:Dead outside National Palace during one of the outbreaks, Mexico City.jpg|280px|thumbnail|The National Palace, the target of the rebel artillery fire from the nearby arsenal.

Now known in Mexican history as the [[Ten Tragic Days]], from 9 February to 19 February events in the capital led to the overthrow and murder of Madero and his vice president. Rebel forces bombarded the National Palace and downtown Mexico City from the military arsenal (''ciudadela''). Madero's loyalists initially held their ground, but Madero's commander, General [[Victoriano Huerta]] secretly switched sides to support the rebels. Madero's decision to appoint General [[Victoriano Huerta]] as commander of forces in Mexico City was one \"for which he would pay for with his life.\"<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 96.</ref> Madero and his vice president were arrested.  Under pressure Madero resigned the presidency, with the expectation that he would go into exile, as had President D\u00edaz in May 1911. Madero's brother and advisor [[Gustavo A. Madero]] was kidnapped off the street, tortured, and killed. Following Huerta's coup d'\u00e9tat on 18 February 1913, Madero was forced to resign. After a 45-minute term of office, [[Pedro Lascur\u00e1in]] was replaced by Huerta, who took over the presidency later that day.<ref>Krauze, Enrique. ''Madero Vivo''. Mexico City: Clio, pp. 119-21</ref>\n\nFollowing his forced resignation, Madero and his Vice-President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]] were kept under guard in the National Palace. On the evening of 22 February, they were told that they were to be transferred to the main city penitentiary, where they would be safer. At 11:15&nbsp;pm, reporters waiting outside the National Palace saw two cars containing Madero and Su\u00e1rez emerge from the main gate under a heavy escort commanded by Major Francisco C\u00e1rdenas, an officer of the [[rurales]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/489 489]|title=The Mexican Revolution.

The correspondent for the ''New York World'' was approaching the prison when he heard a volley of shots. Behind the building, he found the two cars with the bodies of Madero and Su\u00e1rez nearby, surrounded by soldiers and gendarmes. Major C\u00e1rdenas subsequently told reporters that the cars and their escort had been fired on by a group, as they neared the penitentiary. The two prisoners had leapt from the vehicles and ran towards their presumed rescuers. They had however been killed in the cross-fire.<ref>Aitken, Ronald. ''Revolution!

Among elites in Mexico, Madero's death was a cause of rejoicing, seeing the time since D\u00edaz's resignation as one of political instability and economic uncertainty. Ordinary Mexicans in the capital, however, were dismayed by the coup, since many considered Madero a friend, but their feelings did not translate into concrete action against the Huerta regime.<ref>[[Alan Knight (historian)|Knight, Alan]]. ''The Mexican Revolution'', vol. 2. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986, pp. 1-2.</ref> In northern Mexico, Madero's overthrow and martyrdom united forces against Huerta's usurpation of power. Governor of Coahuila, [[Venustiano Carranza]] refused to support the new regime although most state governors had. He brought together a coalition of revolutionaries under the banner of the Mexican Constitution, so that the [[Constitutionalist Army]] fought for the principles of constitutional democracry that Madero embraced. In southern Mexico, Zapata had been in rebellion against the Madero government for its slow action on land reform and continued in rebellion against the Huerta regime.  However, Zapata repudiated his former high opinion of fellow revolutionary Pascual Orozco, who had also rebelled against Madero, when Orozco allied with Huerta. Madero's anti-reelectionist movement had mobilized revolutionary action that led to the resignation of D\u00edaz.  Madero's overthrow and murder during the Ten Tragic Days was a prelude to further years of civil war.\n\n==Historical memory and popular culture==\n[[File:Corrido de Madero.png|thumb|left|150px|''[[Corrido]]'' [[sheet music]] celebrating the entry of Francisco Madero into [[Mexico City]] in 1911.]]\n[[File:Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n Mexico.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City, final resting place of Madero and other revolutionaries]]\n[[File:Francisco I.

Austin: University of Texas Press 2000, p. 50</ref>\n\nDespite Madero's importance as a historical figure, there are relatively few memorials or monuments to him. It was not until the [[Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n|Monument to the Revolution]] was completed in 1938 that Madero had a public resting place.  He had been interred in the French cemetery in Mexico City. After his death. His tomb had been an informal pilgrimage site on the anniversary of his murder (February 22) and the proclamation of his Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed (November 20), which launched the Mexican Revolution.<ref>Benjamin,  ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', p. 124</ref> Initially, the monument to the Revolution held the remains of Madero, Carranza, and Villa and was planned as a collective commemoration of the Revolution, not individual revolutionaries.  Although it was completed on 20 November 1938, there was no inaugural ceremony.<ref>Benjamin, ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', pp. 131-32.</ref>\n\nThe date of Madero's Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed, November 20, was a fixed official holiday in Mexico, [[Revolution Day (Mexico)|Revolution Day]], but a 2005 change in the law makes the third Monday in November the day of commemoration. During the Presidency of Venustiano Carranza, he ignored November 20 and commemorated March 26, the anniversary of his [[Plan de Guadalupe]].<ref>Benjamin, ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', p. 59</ref>\n\n[[File:Street sign Mexico city - FCO I Madero - 3.jpg|thumbnail|Modern street sign and plaque with the former name of the section, ''Calle de Plateros''.]]\nThe [[Mexico City Metro]] has a stop named for Madero's vice president, [[Metro Pino Su\u00e1rez]], but not one to Madero.

One contemporaneous honor by General Pancho Villa remains in Mexico City. On the morning of 8 December 1914, he declared that the street leading from the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City towards the [[Paseo de la Reforma]] would be named for Madero. Still officially called [[Francisco I. Madero Avenue]], but commonly known simply as Madero street, it is one of the most popular and historically significant streets in the city.

Madero was notable for challenging long-time Mexican President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] for the presidency in 1910 and being instrumental in sparking the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\nBorn into an extremely wealthy family in [[Coahuila]], northern Mexico, Madero was an unusual politician, who until he ran for president in the 1910 elections, had never held office. In his 1908 book entitled ''The Presidential Succession in 1910'', Madero called on voters to prevent the sixth reelection of Porfirio D\u00edaz, which Madero considered anti-democratic. His vision would lay the foundation for a democratic, twentieth-century Mexico, but without polarizing the social classes. To that effect, he bankrolled the opposition Anti-Reelectionist Party and urged Mexicans to oust D\u00edaz in the 1910 election. Madero's candidacy against D\u00edaz garnered widespread support in Mexico. He was possessed of independent financial means, ideological determination, and the bravery to oppose D\u00edaz when it was dangerous to do so.<ref>Cumberland, Charles C. ''Mexican Revolution: Genesis Under Madero''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1952, p. 70.</ref> D\u00edaz had Madero arrested before the elections, which were then seen as fraudulent.  Madero escaped from prison and issued the [[Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed]] from the United States. For the first time, he called for an armed uprising against the illegitimately-elected D\u00edaz, and outlined a  program of reform. The armed phase of the Mexican Revolution dates to his plan.\n\nUprisings in Morelos under [[Emiliano Zapata]] and in Mexico's north by [[Pascual Orozco]], [[Pancho Villa]] and others and the inability of Mexican [[Federal Army]] to suppress them forced D\u00edaz's resignation on 25 May 1911, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], Madero was enormously popular among many sectors, but he did not assume the presidency.  An interim president was installed and elections were scheduled for fall 1911. Madero was elected president on 15 October 1911 by almost 90% of the vote. Sworn into office on 6 November 1911, he became one of Mexico's youngest elected presidents, having just turned 38.\n\nMadero's administration soon encountered opposition both from more radical revolutionaries and from conservatives. He did not move quickly on land reform, which was a key demand of many of his supporters. Former supporters Emiliano Zapata declared himself in rebellion against Madero in the [[Plan of Ayala]] as Pascual Orozco did in his Plan Orozquista.  These were significant challenges to Madero's presidency. Labor also became disillusioned by his moderate policies. Foreign entrepreneurs were concerned that Madero was unable to maintain political stability that would keep their investments safe. Foreign governments were concerned that a destabilized Mexico would threaten the international order.\n\nIn February 1913, a military coup took place in the Mexican capital led by General [[Victoriano Huerta]], the military commander of the city, and supported by the United States ambassador. Madero was arrested and a short time later assassinated along with his Vice-President, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]], on 22 February 1913, following the series of events known as the [[Ten Tragic Days]] (la ''Decena Tr\u00e1gica''). In death, Madero became a unifying force of disparate elements in Mexico opposed to the regime of Huerta.  In the north, governor of Coahuila [[Venustiano Carranza]] led what became the [[Constitutionalist Army]] against Huerta, while Zapata continued in his rebellion under the Plan of Ayala. Once Huerta was ousted in July 1914, the opposition coalition held together by Madero's memory dissolved and Mexico entered a new stage of civil war.\n\n==Early Years (1873\u20131903)==\n===Family background===\nMadero was born in the [[hacienda]] of El Rosario, in [[Parras de la Fuente]], [[Coahuila]], the first son of Francisco Ignacio Madero Hern\u00e1ndez and Mercedes Gonz\u00e1lez Trevi\u00f1o, and the first grandson of family patriarch, Evaristo Madero, governor of Coahuila. He was sickly as a child, and was small in stature as an adult.<ref>Krauze, Enrique. ''Mexico: Biography of Power''. New York: HarperCollins 1997, pp. 245\u201346.</ref> It is widely believed that Madero's middle initial, I, stood for Indalecio, but according to his birth certificate it stood for Ignacio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/acces/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=264:revolucion--francisco-i-madero-con-qiq-de-ignacio-por-alejandro-rosas&catid=3:revolucion&Itemid=13|title=Revoluci\u00f3n / Francisco I.

His grandfather, Evaristo Madero, began as a founder of a regional carting business, but he took advantage of economic opportunity and transported cotton from the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to Mexican ports during the [[U.S. Civil War]] (1861\u201365). Having built a diversified fortune, but before his real success, Evaristo first married Rafaela Hern\u00e1ndez Lombra\u00f1a, half-sister of the powerful miner and banker Antonio V. Hern\u00e1ndez. Alongside his brother-in-law, and other of his new political family's relations, he founded the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Industrial de Parras'', initially involved in commercial vineyards, cotton, and textiles, and later also in mining, cotton mills, ranching, banking, coal, [[guayule]] rubber, and foundries in the later part of the nineteenth century. For many years, the family prospered during [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]'s regime, and by 1910 the family was one of the richest in Mexico, worth 30 million pesos ($15&nbsp;million U.S. dollars<ref>Ross, Stanley R.

Afterwards, Evaristo was permanently sidelined from political office when D\u00edaz returned to the presidency in 1884 and served until 1911. Evaristo Madero's two marriages were fruitful, with a total of 18 children, 14 of whom would survive until adulthood, and whose descendants make up some of Mexico's most influential families until this day. Thus, young Francisco was a member of a huge and powerful northern Mexican clan with a focus on commercial rather than political interests.<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/55 55]|title=The Mexican Revolution Volume 1.

As a young man, his father sent him to carry out preparatory studies at the [[Culver Academies]] in the [[United States]] and later at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Hoche]] in [[Versailles]], [[France]], where he completed the [[classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles]] program. Soon after, he was admitted to study business at the prestigious [[HEC Paris|\u00c9cole des Hautes \u00c9tudes Commerciales de Paris]] (HEC).\n\nHis father's subscription to the magazine ''Revue Spirite'' awakened in the young Madero an interest in [[Spiritism]], an offshoot of [[Spiritualism]]. During his time in Paris, Madero made a pilgrimage to the tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], the founder of Spiritism, and became a passionate advocate of the belief, soon coming to believe he was a [[Mediumship|medium]].\n\nFollowing [[business school]], Madero traveled to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to study agricultural techniques and to improve his English. During his time there, he was influenced by the [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophist]] ideas of [[Annie Besant]], which were prominent at nearby [[Stanford University]].<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 247\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 247.</ref>\n\n===Return to Mexico===\n[[File:Mr and Mrs Francisco Indalecio Madero cph.3b47072.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco I.

He embarked on a lifelong commitment to philanthropy. His employees were well paid and received regular medical exams; he built schools, hospitals, and community kitchens; and he paid to support orphans and award scholarships. He also taught himself [[homeopathy]] and offered medical treatments to his employees. Francisco became increasingly engaged with Spiritism and in 1901 was convinced that the spirit of his brother Ra\u00fal, who had died at age 4, was communicating with him, urging him to do charity work and practice self-discipline and self-abnegation. Madero became a vegetarian and stopped drinking alcohol and smoking.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 248.</ref>\n\nAlready well-connected to a wealthy family and now well-educated in business, he had built a personal fortune of over 500,000 pesos<ref name=\"Knight 56\"/> by 1899.<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 247\"/> The family was organized on patriarchal principles, so that even though young Francisco was wealthy in his own right, his father and especially his grandfather Evaristo viewed him as someone who should be under the authority of his elders.

Madero was deeply moved and, believing himself to be receiving advice from the [[spirit]] of his late brother Ra\u00fal, he decided to act.<ref>Madero had another brother, also named Ra\u00fal, who survived to adulthood and participated in the Mexican Revolution. Ross, ''Madero'', p. 15.</ref> The spirit of Ra\u00fal told him, \"Aspire to do good for your fellow citizens...working for a lofty ideal that will raise the moral level of society, that will succeed in liberating it from oppression, slavery, and fanaticism.\"<ref>quoted in Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 248, and 820, footnote 10 who cites a Madero manuscript in a private collection.</ref> Madero founded the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] Democratic Club and ran for municipal office in 1904, though he lost the election narrowly. In addition to his political activities, Madero continued his interest in Spiritualism, publishing a number of articles under the pseudonym of [[Arjuna]] (a prince from the ''[[Mahabharata]]'').<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 249.</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Madero became increasingly involved in opposition to the D\u00edaz government. He organized political clubs and founded a political newspaper (''El Dem\u00f3crata'') and a satirical periodical (''El Mosco'', \"The Fly\"). Madero's preferred candidate, Frumencio Fuentes, was defeated by that of Porfirio D\u00edaz in Coahuila\u2019s 1905 gubernatorial elections. D\u00edaz considered jailing Madero, but Bernardo Reyes suggested that Francisco's father be asked to control his increasingly political son.<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 249\"/>\n\n===Leader of the Anti-Re-election Movement (1908\u20131909)===\n[[File:Creelman04.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Photo of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (1830\u20131915) that accompanied the [[James Creelman|Creelman]] interview in ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'' (1908).]]\nIn an interview with journalist [[James Creelman]] published in 17 February 1908 issue of ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', President D\u00edaz said that Mexico was ready for a democracy and that the 1910 presidential election would be a free election.\n\nMadero spent the bulk of 1908 writing a book, which he believed was at the direction of spirits, now including that of Benito Ju\u00e1rez himself.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 251\u2013253.</ref> This book, published in January 1909, was titled ''La sucesi\u00f3n presidencial en 1910'' (''The Presidential Succession of 1910''). The book quickly became a bestseller in Mexico. The book proclaimed that the concentration of absolute power in the hands of one man \u2013 Porfirio D\u00edaz \u2013 for so long had made Mexico sick. Madero pointed out the irony that in 1871, Porfirio D\u00edaz's political slogan had been \"No Re-election\". Madero acknowledged that Porfirio D\u00edaz had brought peace and a measure of economic growth to Mexico.  However, Madero argued that this was counterbalanced by the dramatic loss of freedom, including the brutal treatment of the [[Yaqui people]], the repression of workers in [[Cananea]], excessive concessions to the United States, and an unhealthy centralization of politics around the person of the president. Madero called for a return of the Liberal [[1857 Constitution of Mexico]]. To achieve this, Madero proposed organizing a Democratic Party under the slogan ''Sufragio efectivo, no reelecci\u00f3n'' (\"Effective Suffrage. No Re-election\"). Porfirio D\u00edaz could either run in a free election or retire.<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', pp. 252\u2013253.</ref>\n\n[[File:AntireelecionistaPosadaDF.JPG|thumb|right|\"Manifestaci\u00f3n antireeleccionista\" by [[Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada]].]]\n\nMadero's book was well received, and widely read. Many people began to call Madero ''[[the Apostle of Democracy]]''. Madero sold off much of his property \u2013 often at a considerable loss \u2013 in order to finance anti-re-election activities throughout Mexico. He founded the Anti-Re-election Center in [[Mexico City]] in May 1909, and soon thereafter lent his backing to the periodical ''[[El Antirreeleccionista]]'', which was run by the young lawyer/philosopher [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] and another intellectual, [[Luis Cabrera Lobato]].<ref name=\"Krauze, p. 253\">Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 253.</ref> In Puebla, [[Aquiles Serd\u00e1n]], from a politically engaged family, contacted Madero and as a result, formed an Anti-Re-electionist Club to organize particularly among working class Mexicans for the 1910 elections.<ref>LaFrance, David G. \"Aquiles Serd\u00e1n\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1341.

In a show of U.S. support, D\u00edaz and [[William Howard Taft]] planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, for 16 October 1909, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time a U.S. president would cross the border into Mexico.<ref name=\"Harris2009\">{{cite book |last1=Harris|first1=Charles H.

Approximately 5,000 other members of the Anti-Re-electionist movement were also jailed. [[Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez]] took over the nomination, but during Madero's time in jail, a fraudulent election was held on 21 June 1910 that gave D\u00edaz an unbelievably large margin of victory.\n\nMadero's father used his influence with the state governor and posted bond to give Madero the right to move about the city on horseback during the day. On 4th October 1910, Madero galloped away from his guards and took refuge with sympathizers in a nearby village. Three days later he was smuggled across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S. border]], hidden in a baggage car by sympathetic railway workers.\n\n===Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed and rebellion===\n{{Main|Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed}}\n[[File:Roque Gonzalez y Madero.jpg|thumb|Madero (center) in San Antonio, Texas while in exile]]\n[[File:Madero (and) Pascual Orozco.

The plan proclaimed the elections of 1910 null and void, and called for an armed revolution to begin at 6&nbsp;pm on 20 November 1910, against the \"illegitimate presidency/dictatorship of D\u00edaz\". At that point, Madero declared himself provisional President of Mexico, and called for a general refusal to acknowledge the central government, restitution of land to villages and Indian communities, and freedom for political prisoners. Madero's policies painted him as a leader of each of the different castes in Mexican society at the time. He was a member of the upper class; the middle class saw that he sought to gain entry into political processes; the lower class saw that he promised fairer politics and a much more substantial, equitable economic system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Mexican Revolution: A Brief History with Documents|last=Wasserman|first=Mark|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2012|isbn=978-0-312-53504-9|location=Boston, MA|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nThe family drew on its financial resources to make regime change possible, with Madero's brother [[Gustavo A.

However, his uncle arrived late and brought only ten men. Madero decided to postpone the revolution. Instead, he and his brother Ra\u00fal (who had been given the same name as his late brother) traveled incognito to New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nIn February 1911, Madero entered Chihuahua and led 130 men in an attack on [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]]. Madero was reported wounded in the fighting, but was saved by his personal bodyguard and Revolutionary general [[M\u00e1ximo Castillo]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=M\u00e1ximo Castillo and the Mexican Revolution|last=Castillo|first=M\u00e1ximo|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0807163887|editor-last=Vald\u00e9s|editor-first=Jes\u00fas Vargas|location=Baton Rouge, Louisiana|pages=154|translator-last=Aliaga-Buchenau|translator-first=Ana-Isabel}}</ref> He spent the next several months as the head of the Mexican Revolution. Madero successfully imported arms from the United States, with the American government under [[William Howard Taft]] doing little to halt the flow of arms to the Mexican revolutionaries.  By April the Revolution had spread to eighteen [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|states]], including [[Morelos]] where the leader was [[Emiliano Zapata]].\n\nOn 1 April 1911, Porfirio D\u00edaz claimed that he had heard the voice of the people of Mexico, replaced his cabinet, and agreed to restitution of the lands of the dispossessed. Madero did not believe this statement and instead demanded the resignation of President D\u00edaz and Vice-President [[Ram\u00f3n Corral]]. Madero then attended a meeting with the other revolutionary leaders&nbsp;\u2013 they agreed to a fourteen-point plan which called for pay for revolutionary soldiers; the release of political prisoners; and the right of the revolutionaries to name several members of cabinet. Madero was moderate, however. He believed that the revolutionaries should proceed cautiously so as to minimize bloodshed and should strike a deal with D\u00edaz if possible. In May, Madero wanted a ceasefire, but his fellow revolutionaries [[Pascual Orozco]] and [[Pancho Villa|Francisco Villa]] disagreed and went ahead with an attack on [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]. The revolutionaries won this battle decisively, making it clear that D\u00edaz could no longer retain power.  On 21 May 1911, the [[Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] was signed.\n\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, D\u00edaz and Corral agreed to resign by the end of May 1911, with D\u00edaz's [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]], becoming interim president solely for the purpose of calling general elections.\n\nThis first phase of the Mexican Revolution thus ended with D\u00edaz leaving for exile in Europe at the end of May 1911, escorted into exile by General [[Victoriano Huerta]]. On 7 June 1911, Madero entered [[Mexico City]] in triumph where he was greeted with huge crowds shouting \"''\u00a1Viva Madero!''\"\n\n===Interim Presidency of De la Barra (May\u2013November 1911)===\n[[File:Francisco Leon de la Barra.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]] (1863\u20131939), whose interim presidency in 1911 gave Madero's enemies time to organize.]]\n[[File:Madero en Cuernavaca.jpg|thumb|right|Francisco I. Madero campaigning in [[Cuernavaca]], June 1911 and meeting [[Emiliano Zapata]]. Zapata rebelled in 1911, because of President Madero's slowness to implement land reform.|alt=|261x261px]]\n\nAlthough Madero and his supporters had forced Porfirio D\u00edaz from power, he did not assume the presidency in June 1911. Instead, following the terms of the Treaty of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, he was a candidate for president and had no formal role in the Interim Presidency of [[Francisco Le\u00f3n de la Barra]], a diplomat and lawyer. Left in place was the [[Congress of Mexico]], which was full of candidates whom D\u00edaz had handpicked for the 1910 election. By doing this, Madero was true to his ideological commitment to constitutional democracy, but with members of the D\u00edaz regime still in power, he was caused difficulties in the short and long term. The German ambassador to Mexico, [[Paul von Hintze]], who associated with the Interim President, said of him that \"De la Barra wants to accommodate himself with dignity to the inevitable advance of the ex-revolutionary influence, while accelerating the widespread collapse of the Madero party....\"<ref>quoted in [[Friedrich Katz]], ''The Secret War in Mexico''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1981, pp. 40-41.</ref> Madero sought to be a moderate democrat and follow the course outlined in treaty bringing about exile of D\u00edaz, but by calling for the disarming anddemobilization of his revolutionary base, he undermined his support. The Mexican Federal Army, just defeated by the revolutionaries, was to continue as the armed force of the Mexican state.  Madero argued that the revolutionaries should henceforth proceed solely by peaceful means. In the south, revolutionary leader [[Emiliano Zapata]] was skeptical about disbanding his troops, especially since the Federal Army from the D\u00edaz era remained essentially intact. However, Madero traveled south to meet with Zapata at [[Cuernavaca]] and [[Cuautla, Morelos]]. Madero assured Zapata that the land redistribution promised in the Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed would be carried out when Madero became president.\n\nWith Madero now campaigning for the presidency, which he was expected to win, several landowners from Zapata's state of [[Morelos]] took advantage of his not being head of state and appealed to President De la Barra and the Congress to restore their lands which had been seized by Zapatista revolutionaries. They spread exaggerated stories of atrocities committed by Zapata's irregulars, calling Zapata the \"[[Attila]] of the South\". De la Barra and the Congress, therefore, decided to send regular troops under [[Victoriano Huerta]] to suppress Zapata's revolutionaries. Madero once again traveled south to urge Zapata to disband his supporters peacefully, but Zapata refused on the grounds that Huerta's troops were advancing on [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]]. Zapata's suspicions proved accurate as Huerta's Federal soldiers moved violently into Yautepec. Madero wrote to De la Barra, saying that Huerta's actions were unjustified and recommending that Zapata's demands be met. However, when he left the south, he had achieved nothing. Nevertheless, he promised the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] that once he became president, things would change. Most Zapatistas had grown suspicious of Madero, however.\n\n===Madero presidency (November 1911 \u2013 February 1913)===\n[[File:Presidente_Francisco_I._Madero.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Francisco I.

A curious fact is that almost immediately after taking office in November, Madero became the first head of state in the world to fly in an airplane, which the Mexican press was later to mock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1171-did-you-know-the-world-s-first-aerial-bombing-the-battle-of-topolobampo-mexico|title=Did You Know?

Conservatives in the Senate refused to pass the reforms he advocated. At the same time, several of Madero's allies denounced him for being overly conciliatory with the Porfirians and with not moving aggressively forward with reforms.\n\nAfter years of censorship, Mexican newspapers took advantage of their newly found [[freedom of the press]] to harshly criticize Madero's performance as president. [[Gustavo A. Madero]], the president's brother, remarked that \"the newspapers bite the hand that took off their muzzle.\"  President Madero refused the recommendation of some of his advisors that he bring back censorship. The press was particularly critical of Madero's handling of rebellions that broke out against his rule shortly after he became president.\n\nDespite internal and external opposition, the Madero administration had a number of important accomplishments, including freedom of the press. He freed political prisoners and abolished the death penalty. He did away with the practice of the D\u00edaz government, which appointed local political bosses (''jefes pol\u00edticos''), and instead set up a system of independent municipal authorities. State elections were free and fair. He was concerned about the improvement of education, establishing new schools and workshops. An important step was the creation of a federal department of labor, limited the workday to 10 hours, and set in place regulations on women's and children's labor.

The ''[[Casa del Obrero Mundial]]'' (\"House of the World Worker\"), an organization with [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] was founded during his presidency.<ref>Tortolero Cervantes,. \"Francisco I. Madero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 766-67.</ref>\n\nMadero alienated a number of his political supporters when he created a new political party, the Constitutionalist Progressive party, which replaced the Anti-Reelectionist Party. He ousted leftist Emilio V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez from his cabinet, brother of Francisco V\u00e1zquez G\u00f3mez, whom Madero had replaced as his vice presidential candidate with Pino Su\u00e1rez.<ref>LaFrance, David. \"Francisco I. Madero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 3. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996, p. 488.</ref>\n\n====Rebellions====\nMadero retained the Mexican Federal Army and ordered the demobilization of revolutionary forces.  For revolutionaries who considered themselves the reason that D\u00edaz resigned, this was a hard course to follow. Since Madero did not implement immediate, radical reforms that many of those had supported him had expected, he lost control of those areas in Morelos and Chihuahua.  A series of internal rebellions challenged Madero's presidency before the February 1913 coup that deposed him.\n\n=====Zapatista rebellion=====\nIn Morelos, [[Emiliano Zapata]] proclaimed the [[Plan of Ayala]] on 25 November 1911, which excoriated Madero's slowness on land reform. Zapata's plan recognized Pascual Orozco as fellow revolutionary, although Orozco was for the moment loyal to Madero, until 1912.\n\n=====Reyes rebellion=====\nIn December 1911, [[Bernardo Reyes]] (the popular general whom Porfirio D\u00edaz had sent to Europe on a diplomatic mission because D\u00edaz worried that Reyes was going to challenge him for the presidency) launched a rebellion in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], where he had previously served as governor. Reyes's rebellion lasted only eleven days before Reyes surrendered at [[Linares, Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and was sent to the Santiago Tlatelolco prison in [[Mexico City]].\n[[File:V Huerta.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Victoriano Huerta]] (1850\u20131916), general who fought the [[Liberation Army of the South]] in 1911 and [[Pascual Orozco]] in 1912.

F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz would later conspire with [[Victoriano Huerta]] during the ''[[Decena tr\u00e1gica]]''.]]\n\n=====Orozco rebellion=====\nIn March 1912, Madero's former general [[Pascual Orozco]], who was personally resentful of how President Madero had treated him once he was in office, launched a rebellion in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] with the financial backing of [[Luis Terrazas]], a former [[Governor of Chihuahua]] who was the largest landowner in Mexico. Madero dispatched troops under General Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Salas to put down the rebellion, but they were initially defeated by Orozco's troops. Gonz\u00e1lez Salas committed suicide and General [[Victoriano Huerta]] assumed control of the federalist forces.  Huerta was more successful, defeating Orozco's troops in three major battles and forcing Orozco to flee to the United States in September 1912.\n\nRelations between Huerta and Madero grew strained during the course of this campaign when [[Pancho Villa]], the commander of the ''[[Divisi\u00f3n del Norte]]'', refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa's execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912.<ref>Heribert von Feilitzsch, ''In Plain Sight: Felix A. Sommerfeld, Spymaster in Mexico, 1908 to 1914'', Henselstone Verlag LLC, 2012, p. 212</ref> Angry at Madero's commutation of Villa's sentence, Huerta, after a long night of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico's Minister of War learned of General Huerta's comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.\n\n=====F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz rebellion=====\nOctober 1912, [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]] (nephew of Porfirio D\u00edaz) launched a rebellion in [[Veracruz]], \"to reclaim the honor of the army trampled by Madero.\" This rebellion was quickly crushed and F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz was imprisoned. Madero was prepared to have F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz executed, but the [[Supreme Court of Mexico]] declared that F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz would be imprisoned, but not executed.\n\n==Ten Tragic Days and death of Madero==\n{{Main|Ten Tragic Days}}\n[[File:Madero_1913.png|thumb|250px|President Madero riding the streets near the Palace, acclaimed by his supporters, a few days before his tragic end.]]\n[[File:Dead outside National Palace during one of the outbreaks, Mexico City.jpg|280px|thumbnail|The National Palace, the target of the rebel artillery fire from the nearby arsenal.

Now known in Mexican history as the [[Ten Tragic Days]], from 9 February to 19 February events in the capital led to the overthrow and murder of Madero and his vice president. Rebel forces bombarded the National Palace and downtown Mexico City from the military arsenal (''ciudadela''). Madero's loyalists initially held their ground, but Madero's commander, General [[Victoriano Huerta]] secretly switched sides to support the rebels. Madero's decision to appoint General [[Victoriano Huerta]] as commander of forces in Mexico City was one \"for which he would pay for with his life.\"<ref>Katz, ''The Secret War in Mexico'', p. 96.</ref> Madero and his vice president were arrested.  Under pressure Madero resigned the presidency, with the expectation that he would go into exile, as had President D\u00edaz in May 1911. Madero's brother and advisor [[Gustavo A. Madero]] was kidnapped off the street, tortured, and killed. Following Huerta's coup d'\u00e9tat on 18 February 1913, Madero was forced to resign. After a 45-minute term of office, [[Pedro Lascur\u00e1in]] was replaced by Huerta, who took over the presidency later that day.<ref>Krauze, Enrique. ''Madero Vivo''. Mexico City: Clio, pp. 119-21</ref>\n\nFollowing his forced resignation, Madero and his Vice-President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]] were kept under guard in the National Palace. On the evening of 22 February, they were told that they were to be transferred to the main city penitentiary, where they would be safer. At 11:15&nbsp;pm, reporters waiting outside the National Palace saw two cars containing Madero and Su\u00e1rez emerge from the main gate under a heavy escort commanded by Major Francisco C\u00e1rdenas, an officer of the [[rurales]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Knight|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanrevolutio0000knig/page/489 489]|title=The Mexican Revolution.

The correspondent for the ''New York World'' was approaching the prison when he heard a volley of shots. Behind the building, he found the two cars with the bodies of Madero and Su\u00e1rez nearby, surrounded by soldiers and gendarmes. Major C\u00e1rdenas subsequently told reporters that the cars and their escort had been fired on by a group, as they neared the penitentiary. The two prisoners had leapt from the vehicles and ran towards their presumed rescuers. They had however been killed in the cross-fire.<ref>Aitken, Ronald. ''Revolution!

Among elites in Mexico, Madero's death was a cause of rejoicing, seeing the time since D\u00edaz's resignation as one of political instability and economic uncertainty. Ordinary Mexicans in the capital, however, were dismayed by the coup, since many considered Madero a friend, but their feelings did not translate into concrete action against the Huerta regime.<ref>[[Alan Knight (historian)|Knight, Alan]]. ''The Mexican Revolution'', vol. 2. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986, pp. 1-2.</ref> In northern Mexico, Madero's overthrow and martyrdom united forces against Huerta's usurpation of power. Governor of Coahuila, [[Venustiano Carranza]] refused to support the new regime although most state governors had. He brought together a coalition of revolutionaries under the banner of the Mexican Constitution, so that the [[Constitutionalist Army]] fought for the principles of constitutional democracry that Madero embraced. In southern Mexico, Zapata had been in rebellion against the Madero government for its slow action on land reform and continued in rebellion against the Huerta regime.  However, Zapata repudiated his former high opinion of fellow revolutionary Pascual Orozco, who had also rebelled against Madero, when Orozco allied with Huerta. Madero's anti-reelectionist movement had mobilized revolutionary action that led to the resignation of D\u00edaz.  Madero's overthrow and murder during the Ten Tragic Days was a prelude to further years of civil war.\n\n==Historical memory and popular culture==\n[[File:Corrido de Madero.png|thumb|left|150px|''[[Corrido]]'' [[sheet music]] celebrating the entry of Francisco Madero into [[Mexico City]] in 1911.]]\n[[File:Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n Mexico.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City, final resting place of Madero and other revolutionaries]]\n[[File:Francisco I.

Austin: University of Texas Press 2000, p. 50</ref>\n\nDespite Madero's importance as a historical figure, there are relatively few memorials or monuments to him. It was not until the [[Monumento a la Revoluci\u00f3n|Monument to the Revolution]] was completed in 1938 that Madero had a public resting place.  He had been interred in the French cemetery in Mexico City. After his death. His tomb had been an informal pilgrimage site on the anniversary of his murder (February 22) and the proclamation of his Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed (November 20), which launched the Mexican Revolution.<ref>Benjamin,  ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', p. 124</ref> Initially, the monument to the Revolution held the remains of Madero, Carranza, and Villa and was planned as a collective commemoration of the Revolution, not individual revolutionaries.  Although it was completed on 20 November 1938, there was no inaugural ceremony.<ref>Benjamin, ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', pp. 131-32.</ref>\n\nThe date of Madero's Plan of San Luis Potos\u00ed, November 20, was a fixed official holiday in Mexico, [[Revolution Day (Mexico)|Revolution Day]], but a 2005 change in the law makes the third Monday in November the day of commemoration. During the Presidency of Venustiano Carranza, he ignored November 20 and commemorated March 26, the anniversary of his [[Plan de Guadalupe]].<ref>Benjamin, ''La Revoluci\u00f3n'', p. 59</ref>\n\n[[File:Street sign Mexico city - FCO I Madero - 3.jpg|thumbnail|Modern street sign and plaque with the former name of the section, ''Calle de Plateros''.]]\nThe [[Mexico City Metro]] has a stop named for Madero's vice president, [[Metro Pino Su\u00e1rez]], but not one to Madero.

One contemporaneous honor by General Pancho Villa remains in Mexico City. On the morning of 8 December 1914, he declared that the street leading from the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City towards the [[Paseo de la Reforma]] would be named for Madero. Still officially called [[Francisco I. Madero Avenue]], but commonly known simply as Madero street, it is one of the most popular and historically significant streets in the city.

Initially, three modes were considered: a tramway, a light rail and a rapid transit. In October 1994, the Development Corporation chose a light rapid transit.<ref name=undervejs>{{cite journal|title=Metro undervejs |trans-title=Metro under way |last=Jensen |first=Tommy O. |year=2002 |issue=5 |journal=Jernbanen |pages=30\u201331 |language=Danish |url=http://www.jernbaneklub.dk/jernbanen/2002/blad5-2002bag-om-metroen-ny4.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124850/http://www.jernbaneklub.dk/jernbanen/2002/blad5-2002bag-om-metroen-ny4.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\nThe tram solution would have been a street tram, without any major infrastructure investments in the city centre, such as a dedicated right-of-way. Through \u00d8restad it would have had level crossings, except for a grade-separated crossing  with the [[European route E20|European Route E20]] and the [[\u00d8resund Railway|\u00d8resund Line]]. It would have had a driver and have operated at about a 150-second interval\u2014twice the cycle time of the city's traffic lights. Power would have been provided with [[overhead wire]]s. Stops were to be located about every {{convert|500|m|yd|abbr=on}} at street level.

The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger because it would have to accommodate overhead wires. The system would have the same frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest [[net present value]].<ref name=minimetro />\n\nThe decision to build stage 2, from N\u00f8rreport to Vanl\u00f8se, and stage 3, to the airport, was taken by Parliament on 21 December 1994.<ref name=history /> Stage 2 involved the establishment of the company Frederiksbergbaneselskabet I/S in February 1995, owned 70% by the \u00d8restad Development Corporation and 30% by Frederiksberg Municipality.

In October and November, the two [[tunnel boring machine]]s (TBM), christened Liva and Betty, were delivered. They started boring each barrel of the tunnel from [[Islands Brygge Station|Islands Brygge]] in February 1998. The same month, the [[Public Transport Authority (Denmark)|Public Transport Authority]] gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro.

In May, the first trains were delivered, and trial runs began at the depot. In December, the tunnels were completed to Strandlodsvej, and the TBMs were moved to Havnegade, where they started to grind towards Frederiksberg. From 1 January 2000, the S-train service from [[Fasanvej Station|Solbjerg]] to Vanl\u00f8se was terminated, and work commenced to rebuild the section to metro.

This project was abandoned, as the interchange chamber between any such line and the City Circle Line was scrapped as part of the City of Copenhagen's 2009 budget.

The southern extension of the M4 will run from [[Copenhagen Central Station]] through [[Sydhavn station|Sydhavn]] to [[Ny Ellebjerg station|Ny Ellebjerg]], where the M4 will link up with the [[S-train]] and regional train system. The [[Danish Transport Authority]] (Trafikstyrelsen) has suggested to convert the [[F (S-train)|F-line]] of the S-train network to metro standard as an M5 line. If the M5 line becomes reality, it will connect with existing lines at [[Flintholm Station]] (interchange with M1 and M2) and the future [[Ny Ellebjerg station]] (interchange with M4).\n\nThe fourth line, M4 or the Harbour line, shares the track with the M3 between [[Copenhagen Central Station]] and [[\u00d8sterport station]] (six stations shared). \nTwo additional extensions to the M4 are under construction, respectively servince the northern (Nordhavn) and southern (Sydhavn) harbour districts in Copenhagen.

In October and November, the two [[tunnel boring machine]]s (TBM), christened Liva and Betty, were delivered. They started boring each barrel of the tunnel from [[Islands Brygge Station|Islands Brygge]] in February 1998. The same month, the [[Public Transport Authority (Denmark)|Public Transport Authority]] gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro.

In May, the first trains were delivered, and trial runs began at the depot. In December, the tunnels were completed to Strandlodsvej, and the TBMs were moved to Havnegade, where they started to grind towards Frederiksberg. From 1 January 2000, the S-train service from [[Fasanvej Station|Solbjerg]] to Vanl\u00f8se was terminated, and work commenced to rebuild the section to metro.

They compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member team of the league's [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Toyota Center]], located in [[Downtown Houston]]. The Rockets have won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. The team was established in 1967 as the '''San Diego Rockets''', an [[expansion team]] originally based in [[San Diego]]. In 1971, the Rockets [[Relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Houston.\n\nThe Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the [[1968 NBA draft]], the Rockets were awarded the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] and selected power forward [[Elvin Hayes]], who would lead the team to its [[1969 NBA playoffs|first playoff appearance]] in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record for almost a decade until the 1976\u201377 season, when they traded for [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] center [[Moses Malone]]. Malone went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) award twice while playing with the Rockets and led Houston to the [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] in [[1976\u201377 NBA season|his first year]] with the team. During the [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980\u201381 season]], the Rockets finished the regular season with a 40\u201342 record. Despite their losing record, they qualified for the [[1981 NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Led by Malone, the Rockets stunned the entire league by making their first [[NBA Finals]] appearance in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]], becoming only the second team in NBA history to make the NBA Finals with a losing record. They would lose in six games to the 62\u201320 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]], [[Robert Parish]], and future Rockets' head coach [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]. {{As of|2019}}, the [[1980\u201381 Houston Rockets season|1980\u201381 Rockets]] are the last team since the [[1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers season|1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers]] to make it all the way to the NBA Finals with a losing record.\n\nIn the [[1984 NBA draft]], once again with the first overall pick, the Rockets drafted center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history. Paired with {{convert|7|ft|4|inch|m}} [[Ralph Sampson]], they formed one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the \"Twin Towers\", they led the team to the [[1986 NBA Finals]]\u2014the second NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014where Houston was again defeated by Larry Bird and the 67-win Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the first round for several years following a second round defeat to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in [[1987 NBA playoffs|1987]]. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] took over as head coach midway through the 1991\u201392 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. Led by Olajuwon, the Rockets dominated the 1993\u201394 season, setting a franchise record 58 wins and went to the [[1994 NBA Finals]]\u2014the third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014and won the franchise's first championship against [[Patrick Ewing]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. During the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], reinforced by another All-Star, [[Clyde Drexler]], the Rockets\u2014in their fourth NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014repeated as champions with a four-game [[Whitewash (sport)|sweep]] of the [[Orlando Magic]], who were led by a young [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]]. Houston, which finished the season with a 47\u201335 record and was seeded sixth in the Western Conference during the 1995 playoffs, became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title.\n\nThe Rockets acquired all-star [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Charles Barkley]] in 1996, but the presence of three of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|NBA's 50 greatest players of all-time]] (Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley) was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001. The Rockets of the early 2000s, led by superstars [[Tracy McGrady]] and [[Yao Ming]], followed the trend of consistent regular season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster. The acquisition of franchise player [[James Harden]] in 2012 has launched the Rockets back into championship contention in the mid-2010s.\n\n[[Moses Malone]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], and [[James Harden]] have been named the NBA's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the Rockets, for a total of four MVP awards. The Rockets, under general manager [[Daryl Morey]], are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to [[sabermetrics]] in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Houston Rockets}}\n\n===1967\u20131971: San Diego Rockets===\n[[File:Elvin Hayes.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Elvin Hayes]] was selected first overall by the San Diego Rockets in the 1968 NBA Draft.]]\nThe Rockets were founded in 1967 in [[San Diego]] by Robert Breitbard, who paid an entry fee of US$1.75&nbsp;million to join the NBA as an expansion team for the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]].<ref name=\"chronhistory\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Owners-fans-waited-years-before-Rockets-took-off-2045395.php|title=Owners, fans waited years before Rockets took off|work=Houston Chronicle|date=September 20, 2001|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name=uniforms>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |title=Going Retro: Houston Rockets |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119064025/http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |archive-date=November 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The NBA wanted to add more teams in the [[Western United States]], and chose San Diego based on the city's strong economic and population growth, along with the local success of an [[ice hockey]] team owned by Breitbard, the [[San Diego Gulls (1966\u201374)|San Diego Gulls]].

The Rockets' first logo featured a rocket streaking with a basketball surrounded by the team name.<ref name=breitbard/>\n\nUpon moving to Houston in 1971, the Rockets replaced green with red.<ref name=uniforms/> They kept the same design from their San Diego days, save for the change of color and city name.

The initial home uniforms, used until the 1975\u201376 season, features the city name, numbers and serifed player name in red with gold trim, while the away uniforms feature the city name (all capitalized except for the lower case 'T' and 'N'), numbers and serifed player name in gold with white trim.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nIn the 1976\u201377 season, the Rockets modified their uniforms, featuring a monotone look on the [[Cooper Black]] fonts and white lettering on the road uniforms. On the home shorts, the team logo is located on the right leg, while the away shorts feature the team name wordmark on the same location.

They compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member team of the league's [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Toyota Center]], located in [[Downtown Houston]]. The Rockets have won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. The team was established in 1967 as the '''San Diego Rockets''', an [[expansion team]] originally based in [[San Diego]]. In 1971, the Rockets [[Relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Houston.\n\nThe Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the [[1968 NBA draft]], the Rockets were awarded the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] and selected power forward [[Elvin Hayes]], who would lead the team to its [[1969 NBA playoffs|first playoff appearance]] in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record for almost a decade until the 1976\u201377 season, when they traded for [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] center [[Moses Malone]]. Malone went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) award twice while playing with the Rockets and led Houston to the [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] in [[1976\u201377 NBA season|his first year]] with the team. During the [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980\u201381 season]], the Rockets finished the regular season with a 40\u201342 record. Despite their losing record, they qualified for the [[1981 NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Led by Malone, the Rockets stunned the entire league by making their first [[NBA Finals]] appearance in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]], becoming only the second team in NBA history to make the NBA Finals with a losing record. They would lose in six games to the 62\u201320 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]], [[Robert Parish]], and future Rockets' head coach [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]. {{As of|2019}}, the [[1980\u201381 Houston Rockets season|1980\u201381 Rockets]] are the last team since the [[1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers season|1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers]] to make it all the way to the NBA Finals with a losing record.\n\nIn the [[1984 NBA draft]], once again with the first overall pick, the Rockets drafted center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history. Paired with {{convert|7|ft|4|inch|m}} [[Ralph Sampson]], they formed one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the \"Twin Towers\", they led the team to the [[1986 NBA Finals]]\u2014the second NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014where Houston was again defeated by Larry Bird and the 67-win Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the first round for several years following a second round defeat to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in [[1987 NBA playoffs|1987]]. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] took over as head coach midway through the 1991\u201392 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. Led by Olajuwon, the Rockets dominated the 1993\u201394 season, setting a franchise record 58 wins and went to the [[1994 NBA Finals]]\u2014the third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014and won the franchise's first championship against [[Patrick Ewing]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. During the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], reinforced by another All-Star, [[Clyde Drexler]], the Rockets\u2014in their fourth NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014repeated as champions with a four-game [[Whitewash (sport)|sweep]] of the [[Orlando Magic]], who were led by a young [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]]. Houston, which finished the season with a 47\u201335 record and was seeded sixth in the Western Conference during the 1995 playoffs, became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title.\n\nThe Rockets acquired all-star [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Charles Barkley]] in 1996, but the presence of three of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|NBA's 50 greatest players of all-time]] (Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley) was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001. The Rockets of the early 2000s, led by superstars [[Tracy McGrady]] and [[Yao Ming]], followed the trend of consistent regular season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster. The acquisition of franchise player [[James Harden]] in 2012 has launched the Rockets back into championship contention in the mid-2010s.\n\n[[Moses Malone]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], and [[James Harden]] have been named the NBA's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the Rockets, for a total of four MVP awards. The Rockets, under general manager [[Daryl Morey]], are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to [[sabermetrics]] in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Houston Rockets}}\n\n===1967\u20131971: San Diego Rockets===\n[[File:Elvin Hayes.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Elvin Hayes]] was selected first overall by the San Diego Rockets in the 1968 NBA Draft.]]\nThe Rockets were founded in 1967 in [[San Diego]] by Robert Breitbard, who paid an entry fee of US$1.75&nbsp;million to join the NBA as an expansion team for the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]].<ref name=\"chronhistory\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Owners-fans-waited-years-before-Rockets-took-off-2045395.php|title=Owners, fans waited years before Rockets took off|work=Houston Chronicle|date=September 20, 2001|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name=uniforms>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |title=Going Retro: Houston Rockets |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119064025/http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |archive-date=November 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The NBA wanted to add more teams in the [[Western United States]], and chose San Diego based on the city's strong economic and population growth, along with the local success of an [[ice hockey]] team owned by Breitbard, the [[San Diego Gulls (1966\u201374)|San Diego Gulls]].

Road uniforms featured the city name, while the home uniforms feature the team name, both in a serifed block lettering. This was the only uniform design the Rockets would use throughout their years in San Diego. The Rockets' first logo featured a rocket streaking with a basketball surrounded by the team name.<ref name=breitbard/>\n\nUpon moving to Houston in 1971, the Rockets replaced green with red.<ref name=uniforms/> They kept the same design from their San Diego days, save for the change of color and city name. The logo used is of a player with a spinning basketball launching upward, with boosters on his back, leaving a trail of red and gold flames and the words \"Houston Rockets\" below it.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nFor the 1972\u201373 season, the Rockets introduced the famous \"ketchup and mustard\" logo, so dubbed by fans, featuring a gold basketball surrounded by two red trails, with \"Houston\" atop the first red trail and \"Rockets\" (all [[capitalization|capitalized]] save for the lowercase 'E' and 'T') in black surrounding the basketball. The initial home uniforms, used until the 1975\u201376 season, features the city name, numbers and serifed player name in red with gold trim, while the away uniforms feature the city name (all capitalized except for the lower case 'T' and 'N'), numbers and serifed player name in gold with white trim.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nIn the 1976\u201377 season, the Rockets modified their uniforms, featuring a monotone look on the [[Cooper Black]] fonts and white lettering on the road uniforms. On the home shorts, the team logo is located on the right leg, while the away shorts feature the team name wordmark on the same location. With minor modifications in the number font, this version was used in all four of their NBA Finals appearances, including their {{nbafy|1994}} and {{nbafy|1995}} championships.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nFollowing the 1995 title, the Rockets opted to modernize their look. After a fan contest with over 5,000 entries, the team went with the idea of [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]] artist Thomas Nash of a rocket orbiting a basketball, which was then reworked by Houston designer Chris Hill.<ref name=\"Barron, David\"/> Nash would later sue the Rockets for [[breach of contract]], given they were using his idea despite not having paid the contest prizes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/06/27/Franchises/ROCKETS-WIN-LOGO-SUIT-BUT-STILL-MAY-HAVE-TO-PAY-ARTIST.aspx|title=Rockets Win Logo Suit But Still May Have to Pay Artist|date=June 27, 1997|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120061258/http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archivedate=November 20, 2015|title=Nash v.

Its restrictive trade regime and generally interventionist policies continue to have a negative effect on the economy. Substantial structural reform is needed, particularly in these areas: improving the investment climate for foreign investors, strengthening the banking system, and freeing the agricultural sector from state control. Remaining restrictions on [[currency]] conversion capacity and other government measures to control economic activity, including the implementation of severe import restrictions and sporadic closures of Uzbekistan's borders with neighboring [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Tajikistan]] have led international lending organizations to suspend or scale back credits.\n\nWorking closely with the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], the government has made considerable progress in reducing [[inflation]] and the [[budget deficit]]. The national currency was made convertible in 2003 as part of the IMF-engineered stabilization program, although some administrative restrictions remain. The agriculture and manufacturing industries contribute equally to the economy, each accounting for about one-quarter of the GDP.<ref name=uzstat/> Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of cotton, although the importance of this commodity has declined significantly since the country achieved independence.<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/187494/cotton-production-in-2010-2011-by-country/ Statistics on Cotton Production in 2010-2012], U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2012.</ref> Uzbekistan is also a big producer of gold, with the largest open-pit gold mine in the world.

It has shown robust growth, rising by 4% per year between 1998 and 2003, and accelerating thereafter to 7%-8% per year. In 2011 the growth rate came up to 9%.\n\nGiven the growing economy, the total number of people employed rose from 8.5 million in 1995 to 13.5 million in 2011.<ref name=uzstat/> This healthy increase of nearly 25% in the labor force lagged behind the increase in GDP during the same period (64%, see chart), which implies a significant increase in [[labor productivity]]. Official [[unemployment]] is very low: less than 30,000 job seekers were registered in government labor exchanges in 2005-2006 (0.3% of the labor force).<ref name=uzstat/> Underemployment, on the other hand, is believed to be quite high, especially in agriculture, which accounts for fully 28% of all employed, many of them working part-time on tiny household plots. However, no reliable figures are available due to the absence of credible labor surveys.\n\nThe minimum wage, public-sector wages, and old-age pensions are routinely raised twice a year to ensure that base income is not eroded by inflation. Although no statistics are published on average wages in Uzbekistan, pensions as a proxy for the average wage increased significantly between 1995 and 2006, both in real terms and in U.S. dollars. The monthly old-age pension increased in real (CPI-adjusted) sums by almost a factor of 5 between 1995 and 2006.<ref name=uzstat/> The monthly pension in U.S. dollars was around $20\u2013$25 until 2000, then dropped to $15\u2013$20 between 2001 and 2004, and now is $64. The minimum wage was raised to $34.31 in November 2011.<ref>[http://www.ferghana.ru/ Ferghana.Ru Information Agency], October 24, 2007</ref> Assuming that the average wages in the country are at a level of 3-4 times the monthly pension, we estimate the wages in 2006 at $100\u2013$250 per month, or $3\u2013$8 per day.\n\nAccording to the forecast by the Asian Development Bank, the GDP in Uzbekistan in 2009 is expected to grow by 7%.<ref name=gdp>{{Cite web |url=http://traveluzbekistan.info/index.php/uzbek-economy/60-uzbekistan-gdp-forecast-for-2009.html |title=Uzbekistan GDP forecast for 2009-2010 |access-date=2009-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810130052/http://traveluzbekistan.info/index.php/uzbek-economy/60-uzbekistan-gdp-forecast-for-2009.html |archive-date=2014-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Meanwhile, in 2010 the Uzbekistan GDP growth is predicted at 6,5%.<ref name=gdp/>\n\n== Labor ==\nLiteracy in Uzbekistan is almost universal, and workers are generally well-educated and trained accordingly in their respective fields. Most local technical and managerial training does not meet international business standards, but foreign companies engaged in production report that locally hired workers learn quickly and work effectively. The government emphasizes foreign education. Each year hundreds of students are sent to the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Japan]] for university degrees, after which they have a commitment to work for the government for 5 years. Reportedly, about 60% of students who study abroad find employment with foreign companies upon completing their degrees, despite their 5-year commitment to work in the government. Some American companies offer their local employees special training programs in the United States.\n\nIn addition, Uzbekistan subsidizes studies for students at [[Westminster International University in Tashkent]]&mdash;one of the few Western-style institutions in Uzbekistan. In 2002, the government \"Istedod\" Foundation (formerly as \"Umid\" Foundation) is paying for 98 out of 155 students studying at Westminster. For the next academic year, Westminster is expecting to admit 360 students, from which Istedod is expecting to pay for 160 students. The education at Westminster costs $5,200 per academic year. \nIn 2008 Management Development Institute of Singapore at Tashkent started its work. This university provides high quality education with international degree. Tuition fee was $5000 in 2012.\nIn 2009 Turin Polytechnik University was opened. It is the only university in Central Asia that prepares high quality employees for industries.\nWith the closing or downsizing of many foreign firms, it is relatively easy to find qualified employees, though salaries are very low by Western standards. Salary caps, which the government implements in an apparent attempt to prevent firms from circumventing restrictions on withdrawal of cash from banks, prevent many foreign firms from paying their workers as much as they would like. Labor market regulations in Uzbekistan are similar to those of the [[Soviet Union]], with all rights guaranteed but some rights unobserved. Unemployment is a growing problem, and the number of people looking for jobs in Russia, Kazakhstan, and [[Southeast Asia]] is increasing each year. Uzbekistan's Ministry of Labor does not publish information on Uzbek citizens working abroad, but Russia's Federal Migration Service reports 2.5 million Uzbek migrant workers in Russia. There are also indications of up to 1 million Uzbek migrants working illegally in Kazakhstan.<ref name=icg>[[International Crisis Group]], [http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5027&l=1 Uzbekistan: Stagnation and Uncertainty], Asia Briefing N\u00b067, 22 August 2007</ref> Uzbekistan's migrant workers may thus be around 3.5-4 million people, or a staggering 25% of its labor force of 14.8 million.<ref name=uzstat/> The U.S. Department of State also estimates that between three and five million Uzbek citizens of working age live outside Uzbekistan.<ref name=StateGov>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/u/81746.htm U.S. Department of State, Background Notes on Uzbekistan], March 2007</ref>\n\n== Prices and monetary policy ==\nUzbekistan experienced galloping [[inflation]] of around 1000% per year immediately after independence (1992\u20131994). Stabilization efforts implemented with active guidance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] rapidly paid off, as inflation rates were brought down to 50% in 1997 and then to 22% in 2002. Since 2003 annual inflation rates averaged less than 10%.<ref name=imf>[http://www.imf.org/external/data.htm IMF World Economic Outlook Database], October 2007</ref>\n\nThe severe inflationary pressures that characterized the early years of independence inevitably led to a dramatic depreciation of the national currency. The exchange rate of Uzbekistan's first currency, the \"notional\" ruble inherited from the Soviet period and its successor, the transient \"coupon som\" introduced in November 1993 in a ratio of 1:1 to the ruble, went up from 100 rubles/US$ in the early 1992 to 3627 rubles (or coupon soms) in mid-April 1994. On July 1, 1994 the \"coupon so\u02bbm\" was replaced with the permanent new [[Uzbekistani so\u02bbm|Uzbek so\u02bbm]] (UZS) in a ratio of 1000:1, and the starting exchange rate for the new national currency was set at 7 som/US$, implying an almost two-fold depreciation since mid-April. Within the first six months, between July and December 1994, the national currency depreciated further to 25 som/US$ and continued depreciating at a fast clip until December 2002, when the exchange rate had reached 969 som/US$, i.e., 138 times the starting exchange rate eight and a half years earlier or nearly 10,000 times the exchange rate in early 1992, soon after the declaration of independence.<ref name=bank>[http://finance.doda.uz Central Bank of Uzbekistan database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416115820/http://finance.doda.uz/ |date=2008-04-16 }}, February 2008</ref> Then the depreciation of the som virtually stopped in response to the government's stabilization program, which at the same time dramatically reduced the inflation rates. During the four years that followed (2003\u20132007) the exchange rate of the som to the US dollar increased only by a factor of 1.33, from 969 som to around 1865 som in May 2012.\n\nFrom 1996 until the spring of 2003, the official and so-called \"commercial\" exchange rate \u2013 both set administratively by the Central Bank \u2013 were highly overvalued. Many businesses and individuals were unable to buy dollars legally at these \"low\" rates, so a widespread black market developed to meet hard currency demand. The spread between the official exchange rate and the curb rate widened especially after the Russian financial crisis of August 1998: at the end of 1999 the curb rate stood at 550 som/US$ compared with the official rate of 140 som/US$, a gap by nearly a factor of 4 (up from a factor of \"only\" 2 in 1997 and the first half of 1998).<ref>IMF, ''Republic of Uzbekistan: Recent Economic Developments'', IMF Staff Country Report 00/36, March 2000</ref> By mid-2003, the government's stabilization and liberalization efforts had reduced the gap between the black market, official, and commercial rates to approximately 8% and it quickly disappeared as the som was made convertible after October 2003. Today, four foreign currencies\u2014the U.S. dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, and the yen\u2014are freely exchanged in commercial booths all around the cities, while other currencies, including the [[Russian ruble]] and the [[Kazakhstani tenge|Kazakh tenge]], are bought and sold by individual (\"black market\") money changers, who are allowed to operate openly without harassment. The foreign exchange regime since October 2003 is characterized as \"controlled floating rate\".<ref>''EBRD Transition Report 2007''</ref> Liberalization of the trade regime remains a prerequisite for Uzbekistan to proceed to an IMF-financed program. In 2012, \"black market\" rate is again significantly higher than official rate, 2850 som/US$ vs. 1865 som/US$ (as of mid-June 2011). This curb rate is often referred to as 'bazar rate', because money changers operate at or near 'bazars' - large farmer markets.\n\nTax collection rates remained high, due to the use of the banking system by the government as a collection agency. Technical assistance from the [[World Bank]], Office of Technical Assistance at the U.S. Treasury Department, and [[UNDP]] is being provided in reforming the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance into institutions capable of conducting market-oriented fiscal and monetary policy.\n\n== Agriculture ==\nAt the end of 2013, the government announced through the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan that it predicted agriculture as playing a major component of the country's economic development in the future.<ref>{{cite news\n| last         = Waits\n| first        = Douglas\n| date         = December 23, 2013\n| title        = Uzbekistan eyes improvements for farmer banking services\n| url          = http://cistranfinance.com/news/uzbekistan-eyes-improvements-for-farmer-banking-services/1163/\n| newspaper    = CISTRAN Finance\n| location     = Chicago, Ill.\n| publisher    = \n| accessdate   = January 3, 2014\n}}</ref>\n[[Agriculture in Uzbekistan]] employs 28% of labor force and contributes 24% of GDP (2006 data).<ref name=uzstat>[http://www.stat.uz/ State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on statistics] 2006 {{in lang|ru}}</ref> Another 8% of GDP is from processing of domestic agricultural output.<ref>IMF, ''Republic of Uzbekistan: Poverty Strategy Reduction Paper'', IMF Country Report 08/34, January 2008</ref> [[Cotton]], once Uzbekistan's star cash earner, has lost much its luster since independence as wheat began to gain prominence from considerations of food security for the rapidly growing population. Areas cropped to cotton were reduced by more than 25% from 2 million hectares in 1990 to less than 1.5 million hectares in 2006, while wheat cultivation jumped 60% from around 1 million hectares in 1990 to 1.6 million hectares in 2006. Cotton production dropped from 3 million tons annually in the pre-independence decade to around 1.2 million tons since 1995, but even at these reduced levels Uzbekistan produces 3 times as much cotton as all the other Central Asian countries and Azerbaijan combined. Cotton [[export]]s tumbled from highs of around 45% of Uzbekistan's total exports in the early 1990s to 17% in 2006. Uzbekistan is  the largest producer of jute in West Asia and it also produces significant quantities of [[silk]] (Uzbek [[ikat]]), [[fruit]], and [[vegetable]]s, with food products contributing nearly 8% of total exports in 2006. Virtually all agriculture requires [[irrigation]], but because of budgetary constraints there has been practically no expansion of irrigated area since independence: it remains static at 4.2 million hectares, the level reached by 1990 after rapid growth during the Soviet period.\n\nGovernment intervention in agriculture is reflected in the persistence of state orders for the two main cash crops, cotton and wheat. Farmers receive binding directives on the area to be cropped to these commodities and are obliged to surrender their harvest to designated marketers at state-fixed prices. The incomes of farmers and agricultural workers are substantially lower than the national average because the government pays them less than the world prices for their cotton and wheat, using the difference to subsidize capital intensive industrial concerns, such as factories producing [[automobile]]s, [[airplane]]s, and [[tractor]]s. Consequently, many farmers focus on production of [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s on their small household plots, because the prices of these commodities are determined by supply and demand, not by government decrees. Farmers also resort to smuggling cotton and especially wheat across the border with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in order to obtain higher prices.\n\nThe government's discriminatory pricing for the main cash crops, cotton and wheat, is apparently responsible for the exceptionally rapid growth of the cattle herd in recent years, as the prices of milk and meat, like those of fruits and vegetables, are also determined by market forces. The number of cattle increased from 4 million head in 1990 to 7 million head in 2006, and virtually all these animals are maintained by rural families with just 2-3 head per household.<ref name=uzstat/> Sales of own-produced milk, meat, and vegetables in town markets are an important source for augmenting rural family incomes.\n\nThe Soviet practice of using \"volunteer labor\" to help gathering the cotton harvest continues in Uzbekistan where schoolchildren, university students, medical professionals, and state employees are driven en masse out to the fields every year.<ref name=icg/> A recent article posted by a domestic news agency (admittedly with strong anti-government leanings) describes Uzbekistan's cotton as \"riches gathered by the hands of hungry children\".<ref>[http://ferghana.ru/article.php?id=5395 Uzbekistan's Cotton: Riches Gathered by the Hands of Hungry Children], October 11, 2007 (in Russian)</ref>\n\n== Natural resources and energy ==\n[[Mineral]]s and [[mining]] also are important to Uzbekistan's economy. [[Gold]], alongside cotton, is a major foreign exchange earner, unofficially estimated at around 20% of total exports.<ref name=StateGov/> Uzbekistan is the world's seventh-largest gold producer, mining about 80 tons per year, and holds the fourth-largest reserves in the world. Uzbekistan has an abundance of [[natural gas]], used both for domestic consumption and export; [[petroleum|oil]] used for domestic consumption; and significant reserves of [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[tungsten]], and [[uranium]]. Inefficiency in energy use is generally high, because the low controlled prices do not stimulate consumers to conserve [[energy]]. Uzbekistan is a partner country of the [[European Union|EU]] [[INOGATE]] energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing [[energy security]], \n[[wikt:convergence|convergence]] of member state [[energy market]]s on the basis of [[Internal energy market|EU internal energy market]] principles, \nsupporting [[sustainable energy]] development, and attracting [[investment]] for energy projects of common and regional interest.<ref>[http://www.inogate.org INOGATE website]</ref>\n\n== External trade and investment ==\n[[File:2006Uzbekistani exports.PNG|thumb|left|Uzbekistan exports in 2006]]\n[[File:Uzbekistan Export Treemap.png|thumb|left|200px|Graphical depiction of Uzbekistan's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]\nUzbekistan's foreign trade policy is based on import substitution.<ref name=StateGov/> The system of multiple exchange rates combined with the highly regulated trade regime caused both imports and exports to drop each from about US$4.5 billion in 1996 to less than US$3 billion in 2002.<ref name=uzstat/> The success of stabilization and currency liberalization in 2003 has led to significant increases in exports and imports in recent years, although imports have increased much less rapidly: while exports had more than doubled to US$15.5 by 2011, imports had risen to US$6.5 billion only, reflecting the impact of the government's import substitution policies designed to maintain hard currency reserves. Draconian tariffs, sporadic border closures, and border crossing \"fees\" have a negative effect on legal imports of both consumer products and capital equipment. Uzbek farmers are deprived of seasonal opportunities to sell legally their popular tomatoes and vegetables for good prices in Kazakhstan. Instead, they are forced to dump their produce at reduced prices on local markets or alternatively continue \"exporting\" by paying stiff bribes to border guards and customs officers.<ref>[http://www.uznews.net What Is Happening to Tomatoes?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409061051/http://www.uznews.net/ |date=2018-04-09 }}, June 26, 2007</ref> Uzbek consumers are deprived of access to low-cost Chinese goods that cross the border from Kyrgyzstan in normal times. Uzbekistan's traditional trade partners are the [[Commonwealth of independent States]] (CIS) countries, notably [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Kazakhstan]], which in aggregate account for over 40% of its exports and imports.<ref name=uzstat/> Non-CIS partners have been increasing in importance in recent years, with [[Turkey]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[South Korea]], and the [[European Union|EU]] being the most active. As of 2011, Russia remains the main foreign trade partner for Uzbekistan.\n\nUzbekistan is a member of the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]. It has observer status at the [[World Trade Organization]], is a member of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], and is a signatory to the ''[[Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States]]'', the ''[[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]]'', the ''[[Madrid Agreement]] on Trademarks Protection'', and the ''[[Patent Cooperation Treaty]]''. In 2002, Uzbekistan was again placed on the special \"301\" Watch List for lack of intellectual copyright protection.\n\n[[File:Daewoo_gentra_2013_(2).JPG|thumb|right|250px|Daewoo Gentra is currently a flagship of [[UzDaewooAuto]].]]\nAccording to [[EBRD]] transition indicators,<ref>[http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/factsh/country/uzbek.pdf EBRD Uzbekistan Country Factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012131235/http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/factsh/country/uzbek.pdf |date=2008-10-12 }}, 2007</ref> Uzbekistan's investment climate remains among the least favorable in the CIS, with only Belarus and Turkmenistan ranking lower. The unfavorable investment climate has caused foreign investment inflows to dwindle to a trickle. It is believed that Uzbekistan has the lowest level of [[foreign direct investment]] per capita in the CIS. Since Uzbekistan's independence, U.S. firms have invested roughly $500 million in the country, but due to declining investor confidence, harassment, and currency convertibility problems, numerous international investors have left the country or are considering leaving.<ref name=StateGov/> In 2005, the Central Bank has revoked the license of the nascent [[Biznes Bank]] citing unspecified violations of local currency exchange rules.  The revocation prompted immediate bankruptcy procedures, under which clients' deposits stay arrested for two month.  No interest was accrued during that two-month period.  In 2006, the Government of Uzbekistan forced out [[Newmont Mining Corporation]] (at the time the largest U.S. investor) from its gold mining joint venture in the [[Muruntau gold deposit|Muruntau gold mine]]. Newmont and the government resolved their dispute, but the action adversely affected Uzbekistan's image among foreign investors. The government attempted the same with British-owned Oxus Mining. Coscom, a U.S.-owned telecommunications company, involuntarily sold its stake in a joint venture to another foreign company. GM-DAT, a Korean subsidiary of [[General Motors|GM]], is the only known U.S. business to have entered Uzbekistan in over two years. It recently signed a joint-venture agreement with [[UzDaewooAuto]] to assemble Korean-manufactured cars for export and domestic sale.  Other large U.S. investors in Uzbekistan include [[Case IH]], manufacturing and servicing cotton harvesters and tractors; [[Coca-Cola]], with bottling plants in [[Tashkent]], [[Namangan]], and [[Samarkand]]; [[Texaco]], producing lubricants for sale in the Uzbek market; and [[Baker Hughes]], in oil and gas development.\n\n==Banking==\nUzbekistan's banks have demonstrated reasonably stable performance in a largely state-dominated local economy. Sector stability is currently supported by rapid economic growth, low exposure to external financial markets and the strong external and fiscal position of the sovereign. However, the sector remains vulnerable to possible economic shocks due to weak corporate governance and risk management, fast recent asset growth, significant directed lending and acquisitions of problem assets. Banks\u2019 foreign currency obligations, specifically those arising from trade finance, are particularly vulnerable due to existing foreign exchange constraints.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fitch: Uzbek Banks Benefit from Stable Macro Environment|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/fitch-uzbek-banks-benefit-from-stable-macro-environment/|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=17 August 2012|publisher=Satrapia}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], there are notable risks of asset quality deterioration in case of a reversal in economic trends. The funding base is mainly short-term, largely sourced from corporate current accounts, while retail funds account for only a small 25% of total deposits. Longer-term funding is provided by the Ministry of Finance and other state agencies, which comprise a notable proportion of sector liabilities. Foreign funding is small, estimated at about 10% of the total liabilities, and plans for further borrowings are moderate. Liquidity management is constrained be the lack of deep capital markets, and banks generally tend to hold substantial cash reserves on their balance sheets. The quality of capital is sometimes compromised by less conservative regulatory requirements for recognition of credit impairment and by investments in non-core assets.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{main|Tourism in Uzbekistan}}\nSilk road route's three important cities are located in Uzbekistan, namely [[Khiva]], [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]].

Its restrictive trade regime and generally interventionist policies continue to have a negative effect on the economy. Substantial structural reform is needed, particularly in these areas: improving the investment climate for foreign investors, strengthening the banking system, and freeing the agricultural sector from state control. Remaining restrictions on [[currency]] conversion capacity and other government measures to control economic activity, including the implementation of severe import restrictions and sporadic closures of Uzbekistan's borders with neighboring [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Tajikistan]] have led international lending organizations to suspend or scale back credits.\n\nWorking closely with the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], the government has made considerable progress in reducing [[inflation]] and the [[budget deficit]]. The national currency was made convertible in 2003 as part of the IMF-engineered stabilization program, although some administrative restrictions remain. The agriculture and manufacturing industries contribute equally to the economy, each accounting for about one-quarter of the GDP.<ref name=uzstat/> Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of cotton, although the importance of this commodity has declined significantly since the country achieved independence.<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/187494/cotton-production-in-2010-2011-by-country/ Statistics on Cotton Production in 2010-2012], U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2012.</ref> Uzbekistan is also a big producer of gold, with the largest open-pit gold mine in the world. The country has substantial deposits of Silver, strategic minerals, gas, and oil.\n\n== GDP and employment ==\nThis is a chart depicting the trend of the [[gross domestic product]] in Uzbekistan in constant prices of 1995, estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of [[Uzbekistani som|som]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G%3D2001 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611172746/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 |archivedate=2010-06-11 }}</ref> The chart also shows the [[consumer price index]](CPI) as a measure of inflation from the same source and the end-of-year U.S. dollar exchange rate from the Central Bank of the Uzbekistan database.<ref name=bank/> For purchasing power parity comparisons in 2006, the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] is exchanged at 340 som.<ref name=imf/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It has shown robust growth, rising by 4% per year between 1998 and 2003, and accelerating thereafter to 7%-8% per year. In 2011 the growth rate came up to 9%.\n\nGiven the growing economy, the total number of people employed rose from 8.5 million in 1995 to 13.5 million in 2011.<ref name=uzstat/> This healthy increase of nearly 25% in the labor force lagged behind the increase in GDP during the same period (64%, see chart), which implies a significant increase in [[labor productivity]]. Official [[unemployment]] is very low: less than 30,000 job seekers were registered in government labor exchanges in 2005-2006 (0.3% of the labor force).<ref name=uzstat/> Underemployment, on the other hand, is believed to be quite high, especially in agriculture, which accounts for fully 28% of all employed, many of them working part-time on tiny household plots. However, no reliable figures are available due to the absence of credible labor surveys.\n\nThe minimum wage, public-sector wages, and old-age pensions are routinely raised twice a year to ensure that base income is not eroded by inflation. Although no statistics are published on average wages in Uzbekistan, pensions as a proxy for the average wage increased significantly between 1995 and 2006, both in real terms and in U.S. dollars. The monthly old-age pension increased in real (CPI-adjusted) sums by almost a factor of 5 between 1995 and 2006.<ref name=uzstat/> The monthly pension in U.S. dollars was around $20\u2013$25 until 2000, then dropped to $15\u2013$20 between 2001 and 2004, and now is $64. The minimum wage was raised to $34.31 in November 2011.<ref>[http://www.ferghana.ru/ Ferghana.Ru Information Agency], October 24, 2007</ref> Assuming that the average wages in the country are at a level of 3-4 times the monthly pension, we estimate the wages in 2006 at $100\u2013$250 per month, or $3\u2013$8 per day.\n\nAccording to the forecast by the Asian Development Bank, the GDP in Uzbekistan in 2009 is expected to grow by 7%.<ref name=gdp>{{Cite web |url=http://traveluzbekistan.info/index.php/uzbek-economy/60-uzbekistan-gdp-forecast-for-2009.html |title=Uzbekistan GDP forecast for 2009-2010 |access-date=2009-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810130052/http://traveluzbekistan.info/index.php/uzbek-economy/60-uzbekistan-gdp-forecast-for-2009.html |archive-date=2014-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Meanwhile, in 2010 the Uzbekistan GDP growth is predicted at 6,5%.<ref name=gdp/>\n\n== Labor ==\nLiteracy in Uzbekistan is almost universal, and workers are generally well-educated and trained accordingly in their respective fields. Most local technical and managerial training does not meet international business standards, but foreign companies engaged in production report that locally hired workers learn quickly and work effectively. The government emphasizes foreign education. Each year hundreds of students are sent to the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Japan]] for university degrees, after which they have a commitment to work for the government for 5 years. Reportedly, about 60% of students who study abroad find employment with foreign companies upon completing their degrees, despite their 5-year commitment to work in the government. Some American companies offer their local employees special training programs in the United States.\n\nIn addition, Uzbekistan subsidizes studies for students at [[Westminster International University in Tashkent]]&mdash;one of the few Western-style institutions in Uzbekistan. In 2002, the government \"Istedod\" Foundation (formerly as \"Umid\" Foundation) is paying for 98 out of 155 students studying at Westminster. For the next academic year, Westminster is expecting to admit 360 students, from which Istedod is expecting to pay for 160 students. The education at Westminster costs $5,200 per academic year. \nIn 2008 Management Development Institute of Singapore at Tashkent started its work. This university provides high quality education with international degree. Tuition fee was $5000 in 2012.\nIn 2009 Turin Polytechnik University was opened. It is the only university in Central Asia that prepares high quality employees for industries.\nWith the closing or downsizing of many foreign firms, it is relatively easy to find qualified employees, though salaries are very low by Western standards. Salary caps, which the government implements in an apparent attempt to prevent firms from circumventing restrictions on withdrawal of cash from banks, prevent many foreign firms from paying their workers as much as they would like. Labor market regulations in Uzbekistan are similar to those of the [[Soviet Union]], with all rights guaranteed but some rights unobserved. Unemployment is a growing problem, and the number of people looking for jobs in Russia, Kazakhstan, and [[Southeast Asia]] is increasing each year. Uzbekistan's Ministry of Labor does not publish information on Uzbek citizens working abroad, but Russia's Federal Migration Service reports 2.5 million Uzbek migrant workers in Russia. There are also indications of up to 1 million Uzbek migrants working illegally in Kazakhstan.<ref name=icg>[[International Crisis Group]], [http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?id=5027&l=1 Uzbekistan: Stagnation and Uncertainty], Asia Briefing N\u00b067, 22 August 2007</ref> Uzbekistan's migrant workers may thus be around 3.5-4 million people, or a staggering 25% of its labor force of 14.8 million.<ref name=uzstat/> The U.S. Department of State also estimates that between three and five million Uzbek citizens of working age live outside Uzbekistan.<ref name=StateGov>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/u/81746.htm U.S. Department of State, Background Notes on Uzbekistan], March 2007</ref>\n\n== Prices and monetary policy ==\nUzbekistan experienced galloping [[inflation]] of around 1000% per year immediately after independence (1992\u20131994). Stabilization efforts implemented with active guidance from the [[International Monetary Fund]] rapidly paid off, as inflation rates were brought down to 50% in 1997 and then to 22% in 2002. Since 2003 annual inflation rates averaged less than 10%.<ref name=imf>[http://www.imf.org/external/data.htm IMF World Economic Outlook Database], October 2007</ref>\n\nThe severe inflationary pressures that characterized the early years of independence inevitably led to a dramatic depreciation of the national currency. The exchange rate of Uzbekistan\u2019s first currency, the \"notional\" ruble inherited from the Soviet period and its successor, the transient \"coupon som\" introduced in November 1993 in a ratio of 1:1 to the ruble, went up from 100 rubles/US$ in the early 1992 to 3627 rubles (or coupon soms) in mid-April 1994. On July 1, 1994 the \"coupon so\u02bbm\" was replaced with the permanent new [[Uzbekistani so\u02bbm|Uzbek so\u02bbm]] (UZS) in a ratio of 1000:1, and the starting exchange rate for the new national currency was set at 7 som/US$, implying an almost two-fold depreciation since mid-April. Within the first six months, between July and December 1994, the national currency depreciated further to 25 som/US$ and continued depreciating at a fast clip until December 2002, when the exchange rate had reached 969 som/US$, i.e., 138 times the starting exchange rate eight and a half years earlier or nearly 10,000 times the exchange rate in early 1992, soon after the declaration of independence.<ref name=bank>[http://finance.doda.uz Central Bank of Uzbekistan database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416115820/http://finance.doda.uz/ |date=2008-04-16 }}, February 2008</ref> Then the depreciation of the som virtually stopped in response to the government's stabilization program, which at the same time dramatically reduced the inflation rates. During the four years that followed (2003\u20132007) the exchange rate of the som to the US dollar increased only by a factor of 1.33, from 969 som to around 1865 som in May 2012.\n\nFrom 1996 until the spring of 2003, the official and so-called \"commercial\" exchange rate \u2013 both set administratively by the Central Bank \u2013 were highly overvalued. Many businesses and individuals were unable to buy dollars legally at these \"low\" rates, so a widespread black market developed to meet hard currency demand. The spread between the official exchange rate and the curb rate widened especially after the Russian financial crisis of August 1998: at the end of 1999 the curb rate stood at 550 som/US$ compared with the official rate of 140 som/US$, a gap by nearly a factor of 4 (up from a factor of \"only\" 2 in 1997 and the first half of 1998).<ref>IMF, ''Republic of Uzbekistan: Recent Economic Developments'', IMF Staff Country Report 00/36, March 2000</ref> By mid-2003, the government's stabilization and liberalization efforts had reduced the gap between the black market, official, and commercial rates to approximately 8% and it quickly disappeared as the som was made convertible after October 2003. Today, four foreign currencies\u2014the U.S. dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, and the yen\u2014are freely exchanged in commercial booths all around the cities, while other currencies, including the [[Russian ruble]] and the [[Kazakhstani tenge|Kazakh tenge]], are bought and sold by individual (\"black market\") money changers, who are allowed to operate openly without harassment. The foreign exchange regime since October 2003 is characterized as \"controlled floating rate\".<ref>''EBRD Transition Report 2007''</ref> Liberalization of the trade regime remains a prerequisite for Uzbekistan to proceed to an IMF-financed program. In 2012, \"black market\" rate is again significantly higher than official rate, 2850 som/US$ vs. 1865 som/US$ (as of mid-June 2011). This curb rate is often referred to as 'bazar rate', because money changers operate at or near 'bazars' - large farmer markets.\n\nTax collection rates remained high, due to the use of the banking system by the government as a collection agency. Technical assistance from the [[World Bank]], Office of Technical Assistance at the U.S. Treasury Department, and [[UNDP]] is being provided in reforming the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance into institutions capable of conducting market-oriented fiscal and monetary policy.\n\n== Agriculture ==\nAt the end of 2013, the government announced through the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan that it predicted agriculture as playing a major component of the country's economic development in the future.<ref>{{cite news\n| last         = Waits\n| first        = Douglas\n| date         = December 23, 2013\n| title        = Uzbekistan eyes improvements for farmer banking services\n| url          = http://cistranfinance.com/news/uzbekistan-eyes-improvements-for-farmer-banking-services/1163/\n| newspaper    = CISTRAN Finance\n| location     = Chicago, Ill.\n| publisher    = \n| accessdate   = January 3, 2014\n}}</ref>\n[[Agriculture in Uzbekistan]] employs 28% of labor force and contributes 24% of GDP (2006 data).<ref name=uzstat>[http://www.stat.uz/ State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on statistics] 2006 {{in lang|ru}}</ref> Another 8% of GDP is from processing of domestic agricultural output.<ref>IMF, ''Republic of Uzbekistan: Poverty Strategy Reduction Paper'', IMF Country Report 08/34, January 2008</ref> [[Cotton]], once Uzbekistan's star cash earner, has lost much its luster since independence as wheat began to gain prominence from considerations of food security for the rapidly growing population. Areas cropped to cotton were reduced by more than 25% from 2 million hectares in 1990 to less than 1.5 million hectares in 2006, while wheat cultivation jumped 60% from around 1 million hectares in 1990 to 1.6 million hectares in 2006. Cotton production dropped from 3 million tons annually in the pre-independence decade to around 1.2 million tons since 1995, but even at these reduced levels Uzbekistan produces 3 times as much cotton as all the other Central Asian countries and Azerbaijan combined. Cotton [[export]]s tumbled from highs of around 45% of Uzbekistan's total exports in the early 1990s to 17% in 2006. Uzbekistan is  the largest producer of jute in West Asia and it also produces significant quantities of [[silk]] (Uzbek [[ikat]]), [[fruit]], and [[vegetable]]s, with food products contributing nearly 8% of total exports in 2006. Virtually all agriculture requires [[irrigation]], but because of budgetary constraints there has been practically no expansion of irrigated area since independence: it remains static at 4.2 million hectares, the level reached by 1990 after rapid growth during the Soviet period.\n\nGovernment intervention in agriculture is reflected in the persistence of state orders for the two main cash crops, cotton and wheat. Farmers receive binding directives on the area to be cropped to these commodities and are obliged to surrender their harvest to designated marketers at state-fixed prices. The incomes of farmers and agricultural workers are substantially lower than the national average because the government pays them less than the world prices for their cotton and wheat, using the difference to subsidize capital intensive industrial concerns, such as factories producing [[automobile]]s, [[airplane]]s, and [[tractor]]s. Consequently, many farmers focus on production of [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s on their small household plots, because the prices of these commodities are determined by supply and demand, not by government decrees. Farmers also resort to smuggling cotton and especially wheat across the border with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in order to obtain higher prices.\n\nThe government's discriminatory pricing for the main cash crops, cotton and wheat, is apparently responsible for the exceptionally rapid growth of the cattle herd in recent years, as the prices of milk and meat, like those of fruits and vegetables, are also determined by market forces. The number of cattle increased from 4 million head in 1990 to 7 million head in 2006, and virtually all these animals are maintained by rural families with just 2-3 head per household.<ref name=uzstat/> Sales of own-produced milk, meat, and vegetables in town markets are an important source for augmenting rural family incomes.\n\nThe Soviet practice of using \"volunteer labor\" to help gathering the cotton harvest continues in Uzbekistan where schoolchildren, university students, medical professionals, and state employees are driven en masse out to the fields every year.<ref name=icg/> A recent article posted by a domestic news agency (admittedly with strong anti-government leanings) describes Uzbekistan's cotton as \"riches gathered by the hands of hungry children\".<ref>[http://ferghana.ru/article.php?id=5395 Uzbekistan's Cotton: Riches Gathered by the Hands of Hungry Children], October 11, 2007 (in Russian)</ref>\n\n== Natural resources and energy ==\n[[Mineral]]s and [[mining]] also are important to Uzbekistan's economy. [[Gold]], alongside cotton, is a major foreign exchange earner, unofficially estimated at around 20% of total exports.<ref name=StateGov/> Uzbekistan is the world's seventh-largest gold producer, mining about 80 tons per year, and holds the fourth-largest reserves in the world. Uzbekistan has an abundance of [[natural gas]], used both for domestic consumption and export; [[petroleum|oil]] used for domestic consumption; and significant reserves of [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[tungsten]], and [[uranium]]. Inefficiency in energy use is generally high, because the low controlled prices do not stimulate consumers to conserve [[energy]]. Uzbekistan is a partner country of the [[European Union|EU]] [[INOGATE]] energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing [[energy security]], \n[[wikt:convergence|convergence]] of member state [[energy market]]s on the basis of [[Internal energy market|EU internal energy market]] principles, \nsupporting [[sustainable energy]] development, and attracting [[investment]] for energy projects of common and regional interest.<ref>[http://www.inogate.org INOGATE website]</ref>\n\n== External trade and investment ==\n[[File:2006Uzbekistani exports.PNG|thumb|left|Uzbekistan exports in 2006]]\n[[File:Uzbekistan Export Treemap.png|thumb|left|200px|Graphical depiction of Uzbekistan's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]\nUzbekistan's foreign trade policy is based on import substitution.<ref name=StateGov/> The system of multiple exchange rates combined with the highly regulated trade regime caused both imports and exports to drop each from about US$4.5 billion in 1996 to less than US$3 billion in 2002.<ref name=uzstat/> The success of stabilization and currency liberalization in 2003 has led to significant increases in exports and imports in recent years, although imports have increased much less rapidly: while exports had more than doubled to US$15.5 by 2011, imports had risen to US$6.5 billion only, reflecting the impact of the government's import substitution policies designed to maintain hard currency reserves. Draconian tariffs, sporadic border closures, and border crossing \"fees\" have a negative effect on legal imports of both consumer products and capital equipment. Uzbek farmers are deprived of seasonal opportunities to sell legally their popular tomatoes and vegetables for good prices in Kazakhstan. Instead, they are forced to dump their produce at reduced prices on local markets or alternatively continue \"exporting\" by paying stiff bribes to border guards and customs officers.<ref>[http://www.uznews.net What Is Happening to Tomatoes?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409061051/http://www.uznews.net/ |date=2018-04-09 }}, June 26, 2007</ref> Uzbek consumers are deprived of access to low-cost Chinese goods that cross the border from Kyrgyzstan in normal times. Uzbekistan's traditional trade partners are the [[Commonwealth of independent States]] (CIS) countries, notably [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Kazakhstan]], which in aggregate account for over 40% of its exports and imports.<ref name=uzstat/> Non-CIS partners have been increasing in importance in recent years, with [[Turkey]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[South Korea]], and the [[European Union|EU]] being the most active. As of 2011, Russia remains the main foreign trade partner for Uzbekistan.\n\nUzbekistan is a member of the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]. It has observer status at the [[World Trade Organization]], is a member of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], and is a signatory to the ''[[Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States]]'', the ''[[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]]'', the ''[[Madrid Agreement]] on Trademarks Protection'', and the ''[[Patent Cooperation Treaty]]''. In 2002, Uzbekistan was again placed on the special \"301\" Watch List for lack of intellectual copyright protection.\n\n[[File:Daewoo_gentra_2013_(2).JPG|thumb|right|250px|Daewoo Gentra is currently a flagship of [[UzDaewooAuto]].]]\nAccording to [[EBRD]] transition indicators,<ref>[http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/factsh/country/uzbek.pdf EBRD Uzbekistan Country Factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012131235/http://www.ebrd.com/pubs/factsh/country/uzbek.pdf |date=2008-10-12 }}, 2007</ref> Uzbekistan's investment climate remains among the least favorable in the CIS, with only Belarus and Turkmenistan ranking lower. The unfavorable investment climate has caused foreign investment inflows to dwindle to a trickle. It is believed that Uzbekistan has the lowest level of [[foreign direct investment]] per capita in the CIS. Since Uzbekistan's independence, U.S. firms have invested roughly $500 million in the country, but due to declining investor confidence, harassment, and currency convertibility problems, numerous international investors have left the country or are considering leaving.<ref name=StateGov/> In 2005, the Central Bank has revoked the license of the nascent [[Biznes Bank]] citing unspecified violations of local currency exchange rules.  The revocation prompted immediate bankruptcy procedures, under which clients' deposits stay arrested for two month.  No interest was accrued during that two-month period.  In 2006, the Government of Uzbekistan forced out [[Newmont Mining Corporation]] (at the time the largest U.S. investor) from its gold mining joint venture in the [[Muruntau gold deposit|Muruntau gold mine]]. Newmont and the government resolved their dispute, but the action adversely affected Uzbekistan's image among foreign investors. The government attempted the same with British-owned Oxus Mining. Coscom, a U.S.-owned telecommunications company, involuntarily sold its stake in a joint venture to another foreign company. GM-DAT, a Korean subsidiary of [[General Motors|GM]], is the only known U.S. business to have entered Uzbekistan in over two years. It recently signed a joint-venture agreement with [[UzDaewooAuto]] to assemble Korean-manufactured cars for export and domestic sale.  Other large U.S. investors in Uzbekistan include [[Case IH]], manufacturing and servicing cotton harvesters and tractors; [[Coca-Cola]], with bottling plants in [[Tashkent]], [[Namangan]], and [[Samarkand]]; [[Texaco]], producing lubricants for sale in the Uzbek market; and [[Baker Hughes]], in oil and gas development.\n\n==Banking==\nUzbekistan\u2019s banks have demonstrated reasonably stable performance in a largely state-dominated local economy. Sector stability is currently supported by rapid economic growth, low exposure to external financial markets and the strong external and fiscal position of the sovereign. However, the sector remains vulnerable to possible economic shocks due to weak corporate governance and risk management, fast recent asset growth, significant directed lending and acquisitions of problem assets. Banks\u2019 foreign currency obligations, specifically those arising from trade finance, are particularly vulnerable due to existing foreign exchange constraints.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fitch: Uzbek Banks Benefit from Stable Macro Environment|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/fitch-uzbek-banks-benefit-from-stable-macro-environment/|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=17 August 2012|publisher=Satrapia}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], there are notable risks of asset quality deterioration in case of a reversal in economic trends. The funding base is mainly short-term, largely sourced from corporate current accounts, while retail funds account for only a small 25% of total deposits. Longer-term funding is provided by the Ministry of Finance and other state agencies, which comprise a notable proportion of sector liabilities. Foreign funding is small, estimated at about 10% of the total liabilities, and plans for further borrowings are moderate. Liquidity management is constrained be the lack of deep capital markets, and banks generally tend to hold substantial cash reserves on their balance sheets. The quality of capital is sometimes compromised by less conservative regulatory requirements for recognition of credit impairment and by investments in non-core assets.\n\n==Tourism==\n{{main|Tourism in Uzbekistan}}\nSilk road route's three important cities are located in Uzbekistan, namely [[Khiva]], [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarkand]].

Stefan Uro\u0161 (1240\u20131272) talks about the Vra\u017eda in his works. After Ottoman conquest of [[Serbia]], self-governing clans often feuded with each other. Families in Serbia abandoned the tradition as the bigger threats to family integrity was ethnic Albanians and Turks rather than of their own ethnic group.\n\nWhen a family member has been killed, the perpetrator's family (brotherhoods/clans ''Bratstva'') has a \"Blood debt\" (''krvni dug'') which can only be removed when the victim's family (an appointed member, ''osvetnik'') has had their revenge by killing the aggressor or any member of the murderer's family (Often a close male kinsman, preferably the brother, killing of children was not encouraged).

The first polio vaccine, developed by [[Jonas Salk]], is an ''inactivated [[poliovirus]] vaccine'' (IPV), consisting of a mixture of three wild, [[virulent]] strains of poliovirus, grown in a type of monkey [[kidney]] tissue culture ([[Vero cell]] line), and made noninfectious by [[formalin]] treatment. The second vaccine, an ''oral polio vaccine'' (OPV), is a live-[[attenuated vaccine]], produced by the passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-[[physiological]] temperature. The passage of virus produces mutations within the viral genome, and hinders the virus's ability to infect nervous tissue.<ref name=Kew_2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kew O, Sutter R, de Gourville E, Dowdle W, Pallansch M |title=Vaccine-derived polioviruses and the endgame strategy for global polio eradication |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=587\u2013635 |year=2005 |pmid=16153180 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123625|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1235033 }}</ref>\n\nBoth vaccines have been used for decades to induce [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to polio, and to stop the spread of the infection. However, OPV has several advantages; because the vaccine is introduced in the gastrointestinal tract, the primary site of poliovirus infection and replication, it closely mimics a natural infection. OPV also provides long lasting immunity, and stimulates the production of polio neutralizing [[antibody|antibodies]] in the [[pharynx]] and gut.<ref name = Pearce>{{cite journal |author=Pearce J |title=Salk and Sabin: poliomyelitis immunisation |url= http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/75/11/1552 |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=11 |pages=1552 |year=2004 |pmid = 15489385 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.028530 |pmc=1738787}}</ref> Hence, OPV not only prevents paralytic poliomyelitis, but also, when given in sufficient doses, can stop a threatening epidemic.

The second vaccine, an ''oral polio vaccine'' (OPV), is a live-[[attenuated vaccine]], produced by the passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-[[physiological]] temperature. The passage of virus produces mutations within the viral genome, and hinders the virus's ability to infect nervous tissue.<ref name=Kew_2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kew O, Sutter R, de Gourville E, Dowdle W, Pallansch M |title=Vaccine-derived polioviruses and the endgame strategy for global polio eradication |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=587\u2013635 |year=2005 |pmid=16153180 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123625|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1235033 }}</ref>\n\nBoth vaccines have been used for decades to induce [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to polio, and to stop the spread of the infection. However, OPV has several advantages; because the vaccine is introduced in the gastrointestinal tract, the primary site of poliovirus infection and replication, it closely mimics a natural infection.
