''[[Pixie Hollow (video game)|Pixie Hollow]]'', and ''Club Penguin'', with ''[[The World of Cars Online|World of Cars]]'' set to follow soon. Lane Merrifield assured GlobalToyNews at the time that \"it's a lot of worlds to manage, but we have really strong teams.\" Merrifield's role changed from taking a backseat in daily game design to focusing on overall branding and quality control of the virtual gaming properties. One of his roles was to merge the ''Club Penguin'' studio New Horizon Interactive in Kelowna (renamed to Disneyland Studios Canada) with Disneyland Studios LA. Disneyland Studios Canada focused its efforts on one product (with such features as multilingual versions), while Disneyland Studios LA focused on customer products and franchises of a wide selection of games.

Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in October 2017. While waiting for dinner, he observed the other patrons staring at a television while an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night telling him he needed to come in the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend. After successfully pitching the show to Wade, the series began development in November,<ref name=\"TVF Apr 2019\"/><ref name=\"THR Jan 2\">{{cite web|last=Bentley|first=Jean|title=''The Masked Singer'': How the Fox Reality Show Scored Top Talent (and Kept It Secret)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/masked-singer-ep-explains-how-his-insane-reality-competition-made-it-air-1171775|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713155810/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/masked-singer-ep-explains-how-his-insane-reality-competition-made-it-air-1171775|archive-date=July 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=Peter|url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/fox-remaking-asian-singing-contest-the-masked-singer-1202206986/|title=Fox Developing Remake of Asian Talent Competition ''The Masked Singer''|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521062138/https://deadline.com/2017/11/fox-remaking-asian-singing-contest-the-masked-singer-1202206986/|archive-date=May 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"TBI Apr 5\">{{cite web|last=Ravindran|first=Manori|title=How ''Masked Singer'' is reviving costume-led formats|url=https://tbivision.com/2019/04/05/costume-drama/|website=Television Business International|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190407120916/https://tbivision.com/2019/04/05/costume-drama/|archive-date=April 7, 2019|date=April 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and was officially ordered by Fox in August 2018.<ref name=\"VAR Aug 2\"/>\n\n[[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], the rightsholder of the ''Masked Singer'' format, lacked the ability to produce the series.

Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than being able to create a comedic tone for the show as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear. Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on to the series due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg, Thicke, and Scherzinger.<ref name=\"E!

Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in October 2017. While waiting for dinner, he observed the other patrons staring at a television while an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]].

Doyle cited the series as an example of a cultural shift in the United States away from the competitive and often exploitative nature of shows such as ''[[American Idol]]'' towards a higher level of positivity among reality television series.<ref>{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=John|author-link=John Doyle (critic)|title=Dumb simplicity: Why The Masked Singer is a massive TV hit|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-dumb-simplicity-why-the-masked-singer-is-a-massive-tv-hit/|website=[[The Globe and Mail]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218163655/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/article-dumb-simplicity-why-the-masked-singer-is-a-massive-tv-hit/|archive-date=December 18, 2019|date=November 4, 2019|url-status=live|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Likewise, Daniel D'Addario of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the show as relaxing and refreshing, calling it a return to form for television as the series possesses the now-rare ability to uplift and unite people.

The producers of the [[The Masked Singer (British TV series)|British series]] said they were inspired to adapt the format after watching the American version.<ref name=\"THR Jan 2\"/><ref name=\"GH Feb 6\"/> Rob Wade, the President of Fox Alternative Entertainment, has described a shift in the way new shows are [[sales presentation|pitched]] since the series premiered, noting there is an increased openness to new ideas. Wade also said the heads of almost all television networks thanked him for the series giving them a \"[[blank cheque|carte blanche]]\" to take new programming risks.<ref name=\"VAR Feb 19\"/> \n\nMichael Schneider of ''Variety'' said the show's success has revitalized reality television in the United States. The revivals of ''[[Paradise Hotel]]'' and ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]'' by Fox and [[USA Network]], respectively, have been credited to the show's success, as have the American adaptations of ''[[Love Island (American TV series)|Love Island]]'' and ''[[I Can See Your Voice (American game show)|I Can See Your Voice]]''.<ref name=\"VAR Feb 19\"/> The show has also been credited with reinvigorating the costume genre of television.

The concept was revived by economists as a monetary policy proposal in the early 2000s following Japan's [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]]. In November 2002, [[Ben Bernanke]], then [[Federal Reserve]] Board governor, and later chairman suggested that helicopter money could always be used to prevent deflation.\n\n== Origins ==\nAlthough very similar concepts have been previously defended by various people including [[Major Douglas]] and the [[Social Credit Movement]], Nobel winning economist [[Milton Friedman]] is known to be the one who coined the term 'helicopter money' in the now famous paper \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FwA7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14&hl=ru&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3 The Optimum Quantity of Money]\" (1969), where he included the following parable:\n\n<blockquote>Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated.</blockquote>\n\nOriginally used by Friedman to illustrate the effects of monetary policy on inflation and the costs of holding money, rather than an actual policy proposal, the concept has since then been increasingly discussed by economists as a serious alternative to monetary policy instruments such as [[quantitative easing]]. According to its proponents, helicopter money would be a more efficient way to increase aggregate demand, especially in a situation of [[liquidity trap]], when central banks have reached the so-called '[[zero lower bound]]'.\n\nFriedman himself refers to financing transfer payments with base money as evidence that monetary policy still has power when conventional policies have failed, in his discussion of the [[Pigou effect]], in his 1968 AER Presidential address.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/journals/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf |title=The Role of Monetary Policy|journal=American Economic Review|author=[[Milton Friedman]]|volume=58|issue=1|date=March 1968|pp=1\u201317|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160605050134/https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/journals/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-05}}</ref> Specifically, Friedman argues that \"[the] revival of belief in the potency of money policy ... was strongly fostered among economists by the theoretical developments initiated by Haberler but named for Pigou that pointed out a channel \u2013 namely changes in wealth \u2013 whereby changes in the real quantity of money can affect aggregate demand even if they do not alter interest rates.\" Friedman is clear that money must be produced \"in other ways\" than open-market operations, which \u2013 like QE \u2013 involve \"simply substituting money for other assets without changing total wealth.\" Friedman references a paper by Gottfried Haberler written in 1952, where Haberler says, \"Suppose the quantity of money is increased by tax reductions or government transfer payments, and the resulting deficit is financed by borrowing from the central bank or simply printing money\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haberler|first=Gottfried |date=1952-01-01|title=The Pigou Effect Once More|jstor=1826454|journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=60|issue=3|pages=240\u2013246 |doi=10.1086/257211}}</ref>\n\nIt is noteworthy in light of more recent debates over the separation between monetary and fiscal policy, that Friedman viewed these policies as evidence of the potency of monetary policy. In the same AER address, he is highly critical of the timeliness and efficacy of fiscal measures to stabilize demand.\n\nThe idea of helicopter drops was revived as a serious policy proposal in the early 2000s by economists considering the lessons from Japan. [[Ben Bernanke]] famously delivered a speech on preventing deflation in November 2002 as a Federal Reserve Board governor, where he says that Keynes \"once semi-seriously proposed, as an anti-deflationary measure, that the government fill bottles with currency and bury them in mine shafts to be dug up by the public.\" In that speech, Bernanke himself says, \"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm#f8 |title=Speech, Bernanke --Deflation-- November 21, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In a footnote to that speech, Bernanke also references an important paper by Gauti Eggertson which emphasizes the importance of a commitment from the central bank to keep the money supply at a higher level in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2003/wp0364.pdf |title=How to Fight Deflation in a Liquidity Trap: Committing to Being Irresponsible|work=IMF|type=Working Paper|author=Gauti B.

In 2013, the chairman of the UK's [[Financial Services Authority]] (FCA), [[Adair Turner]], who had been considered a serious candidate to succeed [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]] as Governor of the Bank of England, argued that deficit monetization is the fastest way to recover from the financial crisis in a speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/debt-money-and-mephistopheles-speech |title=Debt, Money, and Mephistopheles: How do we get out of this mess? - Speech|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Implementation ==\nAlthough the original definition of helicopter money describes a situation where central banks distribute cash directly to individuals, more modern use of the term refer to other possibilities, such as granting a universal tax rebate to all households, financed by the central bank. This is, for example, what the United States did with the [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008]]. The use of tax rebates explains why some consider helicopter money as a fiscal stimulus as opposed to a monetary policy tool. Helicopter money, however, is not meant to be permanent, and is therefore a different policy option than universal basic income.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://basicincome.org/news/2017/03/helicopter-money-basic-income-friends-or-foes/ |title=Helicopter money and basic income: friends or foes? {{!}} Basic Income News|last=|first= |date=2017-03-25|work=Basic Income News|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nUnder a strict definition, where helicopter drops are simply transfers from the central bank to the private sector financed with base money a number of economists have argued that they are already occurring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/17/central-banks-are-already-doing-the-unthinkable---you-just-dont/ |title=Central banks are already doing the unthinkable - you just don't know it|author=Mehreen Khan|date=19 March 2016|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In 2016, the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) launched a [[TLTRO]] programme lending money to banks at negative interest rates, which amounts to a transfer to banks. Also, the use of differential interest rates on tiered reserves to support commercial banks' profitability in the face of negative interest rates, opens up another source of helicopter drop - albeit intermediated by banks.<ref>{{cite web|quote=Central banks have ways to drop money into ailing economies. |title=Free lunch: Helicopter engineering, published on 16 February 29 2016|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3/914fae3e-dec6-11e5-b072-006d8d362ba3.html#axzz45kZzwC6m }}</ref>\n\nIn the case of the Eurozone, the use of [http://bruegel.org/2014/09/t-ltro-variation-on-a-ecbs-theme/ TLTROs] is believed by some economists to provide a legal and administratively tractable means of introducing transfers to households.<ref name=\"bruegel.org\">{{cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2016/03/helicopter-drops-reloaded/ |title=Helicopter drops reloaded|publisher=breugel.org|author1=H\u00fcttl, Pia |author2=Alvaro Leandro |date=March 14, 2016|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> The economist, Eric Lonergan, argued in 2016 that legal helicopter drops in the Eurozone could be structured via zero coupon, perpetual loans, which all European adult citizens would be eligible to receive. The loans could be administered by eligible commercial banks, and under certain conditions the loans would be net interest income positive to the central bank.<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal helicopter drops in the Eurozone, published on February 24 2016|url=https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/legal-helicopter-drops-in-the-eurozone/}}</ref> This idea was revived in 2019 by [[Frances Coppola]], in her book, The Case for People\u2019s Quantitative Easing, and also by researchers at [[BlackRock]], including Stanley Fischer, and also by the French economist Jean Pisani-Ferry.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nMany economists would argue that helicopter money, in the form of cash transfers to households, should not be seen as a substitute for fiscal policy. Given the government's borrowing costs are extremely low at close to zero interest rates, conventional fiscal stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending should work. From this perspective, helicopter money is really an insurance policy against the failure of fiscal policy for political, legal or institutional reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/two-related-confusions-about-helicopter.html |title=mainly macro|author=Mainly Macro|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016|date=March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Differences from quantitative easing===\nLike all expansionary [[monetary policy|monetary policies]] in general, [[quantitative easing]] (QE) and helicopter money involves money creation by central banks to expand the money supply. However, the effect on the central bank's balance sheet of helicopter money is different than with QE. Under QE, central banks create reserves by purchasing bonds or other financial assets, conducting an '[[asset swap]]'.<ref name=Grenville2013>{{cite web |last1=Grenville |first1=Stephen |title=Helicopter money |url=https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money |website=VoxEU.org  |publisher=[[Centre for Economic Policy Research]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190920074154/https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money |archivedate=20 September 2019 |date=24 February 2013 |url-status=live |quote=Central banks have no mandate to give money away (they can only exchange one asset for another, as they do in quantitative easing)}}</ref> The swap is reversible. By contrast, with helicopter money, central banks give away the money created, without increasing assets on their balance sheet.\n\nEconomists argue that the effect on expectations is different because helicopter money created would be perceived as 'permanent' \u2013 that is, more irreversible than QE. Economists have pointed out that the effect is not different from a combination of expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy conducted at the same time.\n\n===Implications for central bank balance sheets===\nOne of the main concerns with transfers from the central bank directly to the private sector is that in contrast to conventional [[open-market operations]] the central bank does not have an asset corresponding to the base money created. This has implications for the measured equity of the central bank because base money is typically treated as a liability, but it could also constrain the central bank's ability to set interest rates in the future. The accounting treatment of central banks' balance sheets is controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/economistsforum/2012/06/governments-can-borrow-without-increasing-their-debt/ |title=Governments can borrow without increasing their debt|work=Financial Times|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> Most economists now recognize that the 'capital' of the central bank is not really important.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp392.pdf?e7bba27cdd7b653529fc35400ff0a3c0 | title=The Role of Central Bank Capital Revisited | publisher=European Central Bank | date=September 2004 | author=Ulrich Bindseil|author2=Andres Manzanares|author3=Benedict Weller | issn=1725-2806}}</ref> What matters is can whether expansion of base money be reversed in the future, or are there other means to raise interest rates. Various options have been proposed. Oxford professor, Simon Wren-Lewis has suggested that the government pre-commit to providing the Bank of England with bonds if needed.

The concept was revived by economists as a monetary policy proposal in the early 2000s following Japan's [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]]. In November 2002, [[Ben Bernanke]], then [[Federal Reserve]] Board governor, and later chairman suggested that helicopter money could always be used to prevent deflation.\n\n== Origins ==\nAlthough very similar concepts have been previously defended by various people including [[Major Douglas]] and the [[Social Credit Movement]], Nobel winning economist [[Milton Friedman]] is known to be the one who coined the term 'helicopter money' in the now famous paper \"[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FwA7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14&hl=ru&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3 The Optimum Quantity of Money]\" (1969), where he included the following parable:\n\n<blockquote>Let us suppose now that one day a helicopter flies over this community and drops an additional $1,000 in bills from the sky, which is, of course, hastily collected by members of the community. Let us suppose further that everyone is convinced that this is a unique event which will never be repeated.</blockquote>\n\nOriginally used by Friedman to illustrate the effects of monetary policy on inflation and the costs of holding money, rather than an actual policy proposal, the concept has since then been increasingly discussed by economists as a serious alternative to monetary policy instruments such as [[quantitative easing]]. According to its proponents, helicopter money would be a more efficient way to increase aggregate demand, especially in a situation of [[liquidity trap]], when central banks have reached the so-called '[[zero lower bound]]'.\n\nFriedman himself refers to financing transfer payments with base money as evidence that monetary policy still has power when conventional policies have failed, in his discussion of the [[Pigou effect]], in his 1968 AER Presidential address.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/journals/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf |title=The Role of Monetary Policy|journal=American Economic Review|author=[[Milton Friedman]]|volume=58|issue=1|date=March 1968|pp=1\u201317|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160605050134/https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/journals/aer/top20/58.1.1-17.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-05}}</ref> Specifically, Friedman argues that \"[the] revival of belief in the potency of money policy ... was strongly fostered among economists by the theoretical developments initiated by Haberler but named for Pigou that pointed out a channel \u2013 namely changes in wealth \u2013 whereby changes in the real quantity of money can affect aggregate demand even if they do not alter interest rates.\" Friedman is clear that money must be produced \"in other ways\" than open-market operations, which \u2013 like QE \u2013 involve \"simply substituting money for other assets without changing total wealth.\" Friedman references a paper by Gottfried Haberler written in 1952, where Haberler says, \"Suppose the quantity of money is increased by tax reductions or government transfer payments, and the resulting deficit is financed by borrowing from the central bank or simply printing money\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haberler|first=Gottfried |date=1952-01-01|title=The Pigou Effect Once More|jstor=1826454|journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=60|issue=3|pages=240\u2013246 |doi=10.1086/257211}}</ref>\n\nIt is noteworthy in light of more recent debates over the separation between monetary and fiscal policy, that Friedman viewed these policies as evidence of the potency of monetary policy. In the same AER address, he is highly critical of the timeliness and efficacy of fiscal measures to stabilize demand.\n\nThe idea of helicopter drops was revived as a serious policy proposal in the early 2000s by economists considering the lessons from Japan. [[Ben Bernanke]] famously delivered a speech on preventing deflation in November 2002 as a Federal Reserve Board governor, where he says that Keynes \"once semi-seriously proposed, as an anti-deflationary measure, that the government fill bottles with currency and bury them in mine shafts to be dug up by the public.\" In that speech, Bernanke himself says, \"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm#f8 |title=Speech, Bernanke --Deflation-- November 21, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In a footnote to that speech, Bernanke also references an important paper by Gauti Eggertson which emphasizes the importance of a commitment from the central bank to keep the money supply at a higher level in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2003/wp0364.pdf |title=How to Fight Deflation in a Liquidity Trap: Committing to Being Irresponsible|work=IMF|type=Working Paper|author=Gauti B.

In 2013, the chairman of the UK's [[Financial Services Authority]] (FCA), [[Adair Turner]], who had been considered a serious candidate to succeed [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]] as Governor of the Bank of England, argued that deficit monetization is the fastest way to recover from the financial crisis in a speech.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/debt-money-and-mephistopheles-speech |title=Debt, Money, and Mephistopheles: How do we get out of this mess? - Speech|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Implementation ==\nAlthough the original definition of helicopter money describes a situation where central banks distribute cash directly to individuals, more modern use of the term refer to other possibilities, such as granting a universal tax rebate to all households, financed by the central bank. This is, for example, what the United States did with the [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008]]. The use of tax rebates explains why some consider helicopter money as a fiscal stimulus as opposed to a monetary policy tool. Helicopter money, however, is not meant to be permanent, and is therefore a different policy option than universal basic income.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://basicincome.org/news/2017/03/helicopter-money-basic-income-friends-or-foes/ |title=Helicopter money and basic income: friends or foes? {{!}} Basic Income News|last=|first= |date=2017-03-25|work=Basic Income News|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nUnder a strict definition, where helicopter drops are simply transfers from the central bank to the private sector financed with base money a number of economists have argued that they are already occurring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/17/central-banks-are-already-doing-the-unthinkable---you-just-dont/ |title=Central banks are already doing the unthinkable - you just don't know it|author=Mehreen Khan|date=19 March 2016|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In 2016, the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) launched a [[TLTRO]] programme lending money to banks at negative interest rates, which amounts to a transfer to banks.

The loans could be administered by eligible commercial banks, and under certain conditions the loans would be net interest income positive to the central bank.<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal helicopter drops in the Eurozone, published on February 24 2016|url=https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/legal-helicopter-drops-in-the-eurozone/}}</ref> This idea was revived in 2019 by [[Frances Coppola]], in her book, The Case for People\u2019s Quantitative Easing, and also by researchers at [[BlackRock]], including Stanley Fischer, and also by the French economist Jean Pisani-Ferry.\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nMany economists would argue that helicopter money, in the form of cash transfers to households, should not be seen as a substitute for fiscal policy. Given the government's borrowing costs are extremely low at close to zero interest rates, conventional fiscal stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending should work. From this perspective, helicopter money is really an insurance policy against the failure of fiscal policy for political, legal or institutional reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2016/03/two-related-confusions-about-helicopter.html |title=mainly macro|author=Mainly Macro|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016|date=March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Differences from quantitative easing===\nLike all expansionary [[monetary policy|monetary policies]] in general, [[quantitative easing]] (QE) and helicopter money involves money creation by central banks to expand the money supply. However, the effect on the central bank's balance sheet of helicopter money is different than with QE. Under QE, central banks create reserves by purchasing bonds or other financial assets, conducting an '[[asset swap]]'.<ref name=Grenville2013>{{cite web |last1=Grenville |first1=Stephen |title=Helicopter money |url=https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money |website=VoxEU.org  |publisher=[[Centre for Economic Policy Research]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190920074154/https://voxeu.org/article/helicopter-money |archivedate=20 September 2019 |date=24 February 2013 |url-status=live |quote=Central banks have no mandate to give money away (they can only exchange one asset for another, as they do in quantitative easing)}}</ref> The swap is reversible. By contrast, with helicopter money, central banks give away the money created, without increasing assets on their balance sheet.\n\nEconomists argue that the effect on expectations is different because helicopter money created would be perceived as 'permanent' \u2013 that is, more irreversible than QE. Economists have pointed out that the effect is not different from a combination of expansionary fiscal policy and expansionary monetary policy conducted at the same time.\n\n===Implications for central bank balance sheets===\nOne of the main concerns with transfers from the central bank directly to the private sector is that in contrast to conventional [[open-market operations]] the central bank does not have an asset corresponding to the base money created. This has implications for the measured equity of the central bank because base money is typically treated as a liability, but it could also constrain the central bank's ability to set interest rates in the future. The accounting treatment of central banks' balance sheets is controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/economistsforum/2012/06/governments-can-borrow-without-increasing-their-debt/ |title=Governments can borrow without increasing their debt|work=Financial Times|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> Most economists now recognize that the 'capital' of the central bank is not really important.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecbwp392.pdf?e7bba27cdd7b653529fc35400ff0a3c0 | title=The Role of Central Bank Capital Revisited | publisher=European Central Bank | date=September 2004 | author=Ulrich Bindseil|author2=Andres Manzanares|author3=Benedict Weller | issn=1725-2806}}</ref> What matters is can whether expansion of base money be reversed in the future, or are there other means to raise interest rates. Various options have been proposed. Oxford professor, Simon Wren-Lewis has suggested that the government pre-commit to providing the Bank of England with bonds if needed. The European Central Bank can, in fact, mandate an increase in its capital, and the introduction of [[tiered reserves]] and [[interest on reserves]] gives central banks an array of tools to protect their own net income and the demand for reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophyofmoney.net/does-the-central-banks-balance-sheet-matter/ |title=Does the central bank's balance sheet matter?|author=Eric Lonergan|work=Philosophy of Money|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Supporters ==\nFormer chairman of the Federal Reserve [[Ben Bernanke]] is known to be one of the proponents of helicopter money when he gave a speech in November 2002 arguing, in the case of Japan, that \"a money-financed tax cut is essentially equivalent to Milton Friedman's famous 'helicopter drop' of money.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/Speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm |title=Speech, Bernanke --Deflation-- November 21, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> In April 2016, Ben Bernanke wrote a blog post arguing that \"such programs may be the best available alternative.

His loyal second-in-command [[Zoe Washburne|Zoe]] was by his side for most of the war, surviving many dangerous conflicts with him. The show mentions three such battles, including the Battle of Du-Khang in 2510 (featured in \"[[The Message (Firefly)|The Message]]\") and a long winter campaign in New Kashmir (as told by Zoe in \"[[War Stories (Firefly episode)|War Stories]]\") where he commanded a platoon. Mal was also involved in the ground campaign during the Battle of Sturges (as seen in the comic book ''[[Serenity: Those Left Behind]]''), which according to [[List of minor characters in Firefly#Badger|Badger]] was the \"bloodiest and shortest battle in all the war\", although Mal considers it a distant second. Mal fought in many more battles, but the turning point for him and the Independents came with their physical and emotional defeat at the ''Battle of Serenity Valley'' on the planet [[List of Firefly planets and moons#Hera|Hera]]. On-screen information in ''Serenity'' shows him to have been attached to the 57th Overlanders Brigade; in the series pilot, Badger calls it the \"Balls and Bayonets Brigade\", though it is unclear whether this was a disparaging nickname coined by Badger himself or the actual unit [[sobriquet]] (a deleted scene in ''Serenity'' marks it as the actual unit nickname.  It is unknown if the deleted scene can be considered canon or not).\n\nAfter the war, Mal acquired his own ship, a derelict 03-K64 ''Firefly''-class transport. Mal named the ship ''Serenity'' after the Battle of Serenity Valley, the decisive battle of the Unification War. Flashbacks in the episode, \"[[Out of Gas (Firefly episode)|Out of Gas]]\", indicate that Mal immediately recruited Zoe as his first mate, followed shortly by Wash and (temporary) engineer, Bester. While Wash would remain with the crew and eventually pursue Zoe romantically, Mal fires Bester for incompetence and inappropriate behavior, as he caught Bester having sex with a woman (Kaylee Frye) in the Engine room; however, after she correctly identified the problem and fixed the ship, Mal offered Bester's job to her instead. Kaylee accepted the offer and became a central member of the crew. At an unspecified time later, Mal encountered Jayne Cobb while working a job; after assessing his tracking abilities and willingness to work less-than-legal jobs (at gunpoint), Mal offers Jayne a cut of their take to switch sides, which he promptly does by betraying his former comrades. Inara Serra responds to Mal's advertisement for having an open shuttle for rent, and the two agree to a partnership, allowing Inara privacy and mobility, while Mal receives rent and some respectability from her presence.\n\n==Reception==\nFillion won the \"Cinescape Genre Face of the Future Award&nbsp;\u2014 Male\" award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA for his role as Malcolm Reynolds.

His loyal second-in-command [[Zoe Washburne|Zoe]] was by his side for most of the war, surviving many dangerous conflicts with him. The show mentions three such battles, including the Battle of Du-Khang in 2510 (featured in \"[[The Message (Firefly)|The Message]]\") and a long winter campaign in New Kashmir (as told by Zoe in \"[[War Stories (Firefly episode)|War Stories]]\") where he commanded a platoon. Mal was also involved in the ground campaign during the Battle of Sturges (as seen in the comic book ''[[Serenity: Those Left Behind]]''), which according to [[List of minor characters in Firefly#Badger|Badger]] was the \"bloodiest and shortest battle in all the war\", although Mal considers it a distant second. Mal fought in many more battles, but the turning point for him and the Independents came with their physical and emotional defeat at the ''Battle of Serenity Valley'' on the planet [[List of Firefly planets and moons#Hera|Hera]]. On-screen information in ''Serenity'' shows him to have been attached to the 57th Overlanders Brigade; in the series pilot, Badger calls it the \"Balls and Bayonets Brigade\", though it is unclear whether this was a disparaging nickname coined by Badger himself or the actual unit [[sobriquet]] (a deleted scene in ''Serenity'' marks it as the actual unit nickname.  It is unknown if the deleted scene can be considered canon or not).\n\nAfter the war, Mal acquired his own ship, a derelict 03-K64 ''Firefly''-class transport. Mal named the ship ''Serenity'' after the Battle of Serenity Valley, the decisive battle of the Unification War.\n\n==Reception==\nFillion won the \"Cinescape Genre Face of the Future Award&nbsp;\u2014 Male\" award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA for his role as Malcolm Reynolds.
