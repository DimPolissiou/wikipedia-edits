However, no batting practice show appeared for reasons that were not explained.

While trying to give all of the teams national exposure, ABC ended up with a surplus of games involving games between either small-market teams and/or teams with losing records.\n\nIn [[1989 in baseball|1989]] (the final year of ABC's contract with Major League Baseball), ABC moved the baseball telecasts to Thursday nights in hopes of getting a leg up against NBC's ''[[The Cosby Show|Cosby Show]]''. The network also aired some late-season games on Sunday afternoons.\n\nThe [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] cable channel aired Monday night games in [[1997 in baseball|1997]]. The series returned in [[2002 in baseball|2002]] as [[ESPN]] (which, like ABC by that point, was owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]]) created a package under its deal for national cable rights.\n\n====ABC's ''MNB'' announcers====\n\n=====Play-by-play=====\n*[[Gary Bender]] (1987&ndash;1988)\n*[[Don Drysdale]] (1978&ndash;1986)\n*[[Keith Jackson]] (1977&ndash;1982, 1986)\n*[[Jim Lampley]] (1977&ndash;1979)\n*[[Al Michaels]] (1976&ndash;1989)\n*[[Bob Prince]] (1976)\n*[[Gary Thorne]] (1989)\n*[[Bob Uecker]] (1976&ndash;1982)\n\n======Color commentary======\n*[[Lou Brock]] (1980)\n*[[Norm Cash]] (1976)\n*[[Howard Cosell]] (1977&ndash;1985)\n*[[Don Drysdale]] (1978&ndash;1986)\n*[[Bob Gibson]] (1976&ndash;1977)\n*[[Tim McCarver]] (1984&ndash;1989)\n*[[Joe Morgan]] (1988&ndash;1989)\n*[[Jim Palmer]] (1984&ndash;1989)\n*[[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]] (1982&ndash;1983)\n*[[Bob Uecker]] (1976&ndash;1982)\n*[[Earl Weaver]] (1983&ndash;1984)\n*[[Bill White (first baseman)|Bill White]] (1976&ndash;1979)\n*[[Warner Wolf]] (1976&ndash;1977)\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]''\n*''[[Wednesday Night Baseball]]''\n*''[[MLB Network Showcase]]''\n*''[[Fox Major League Baseball]]''\n*''[[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio]]''\n*[[ESPN Major League Baseball broadcasters]]\n*[[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio broadcasters]]\n*[[List of current Major League Baseball broadcasters]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=sbd.main&requesttimeout=500&storyid=SBD2006121925 Sports Business Daily]\n*[http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/latestreleases.html Press Release: ESPN\u2019s Signature MLB Franchises Return - Sunday, Monday and Wednesday Night Baseball]\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0756562}}\n* [http://sports.espn.go.com/espntv/espnTopics?topic=Baseball Baseball on ESPN.tv]\n* [http://sports-ak.espn.go.com/mlb/index MLB on ESPN.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190216094409/http://sabrmedia.org/databases/network-tv-broadcasts/searchable-network-tv-broadcasts/ Searchable Network TV Broadcasts]\n\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{ESPN}}\n{{Major League Baseball on national television}}\n{{Major League Baseball on ABC}}\n{{ESPN Major League Baseball}}\n{{Major League Baseball on NBC}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:1967 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1970s American television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American television series]]\n[[Category:ESPN original programming]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball on television]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball on NBC]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:ABC Sports]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe NBC years (1966-1975):Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 6-5 \u2192 6\u20135", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Baseball"}

Traditionally a fishing port, Monastir is now a major tourist resort. Its population is about 93,306.  It is the capital of [[Monastir Governorate]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:MonastirRibat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ribat of Monastir|The Ribat in Monastir]]]]\n\nMonastir was founded on the ruins of the [[Punic]]\u2013[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of [[Ruspina]]. The city features a well-preserved [[Ribat of Monastir]] that was used to scan the sea for hostile ships and as a defence against the attacks of the Byzantine fleet. Several [[ulema]] came to stay in the ''ribat'' of this peaceful city for contemplation. The ribat was, in the 1970s, also one of the filming locations for both the [[miniseries]] ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' and [[Monty Python]]'s ''[[Life of Brian]]''.\n\n==Transportation==\n\nThe city is on the electrified, metre-gauge [[Sahel Metro]] line with trains serving [[Sousse]] and [[Mahdia]]. Other services run to Tunis.\n\n[[Monastir \u2013 Habib Bourguiba International Airport]] has flights from most Western European countries. It is run by [[Tepe Akfen Ventures]] Airport Holding (TAV).\n\n==Climate==\nMonastir enjoys a dry [[Mediterranean climate]] with hot summers, extremely mild winters, lots of sunshine and low rainfall year-round. The city sits in the northeast of Tunisia, on its central coast. It is milder than inland areas of Tunisia, forty percent of which is part of the Sahara. In the summer, while humidity is low, the soaring heat can still be hard to handle. The average high temperature of {{convert|29|\u00b0C}} in June skips past the {{convert|30|\u00b0C}} mark in the middle of the month and climbs up to {{convert|33|\u00b0C}} in July and August.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|width = auto\n|location = Monastir, Tunisia (1981\u20132010, extremes 1968\u20132017)\n|Jan record high C = 27.0\n|Feb record high C

Traditionally a fishing port, Monastir is now a major tourist resort. Its population is about 93,306.  It is the capital of [[Monastir Governorate]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:MonastirRibat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ribat of Monastir|The Ribat in Monastir]]]]\n\nMonastir was founded on the ruins of the [[Punic]]\u2013[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of [[Ruspina]]. The city features a well-preserved [[Ribat of Monastir]] that was used to scan the sea for hostile ships and as a defence against the attacks of the Byzantine fleet. Several [[ulema]] came to stay in the ''ribat'' of this peaceful city for contemplation. The ribat was, in the 1970s, also one of the filming locations for both the [[miniseries]] ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' and [[Monty Python]]'s ''[[Life of Brian]]''.\n\n==Transportation==\n\nThe city is on the electrified, metre-gauge [[Sahel Metro]] line with trains serving [[Sousse]] and [[Mahdia]]. Other services run to Tunis.\n\n[[Monastir \u2013 Habib Bourguiba International Airport]] has flights from most Western European countries. It is run by [[Tepe Akfen Ventures]] Airport Holding (TAV).\n\n==Climate==\nMonastir enjoys a dry [[Mediterranean climate]] with hot summers, extremely mild winters, lots of sunshine and low rainfall year-round. The city sits in the northeast of Tunisia, on its central coast. It is milder than inland areas of Tunisia, forty percent of which is part of the Sahara. In the summer, while humidity is low, the soaring heat can still be hard to handle. The average high temperature of {{convert|29|\u00b0C}} in June skips past the {{convert|30|\u00b0C}} mark in the middle of the month and climbs up to {{convert|33|\u00b0C}} in July and
