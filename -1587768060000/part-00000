Ancient game enjoys continued popularity|url=http://thecourier.com/life-news/2016/06/23/mahjong/|work=The Courier}}</ref> Similar to the Western card game [[rummy]], Mahjong is a [[game of skill]], strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.\n\nThe game is played with a set of 144 [[Mahjong tiles|tiles]] based on [[Chinese characters]] and [[chinese culture|symbols]], although some regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four [[#Melds|melds]] (or sets) and a pair (eye). A player can also win with a small class of special hands. There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, how a piece is robbed from another player, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and Honors (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Despite these similarities, there are many regional variations to the rules including rather different scoring systems, criteria for legal winning hands, and even private table rules which distinguish some variations as notably different styles of mahjong.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn Chinese, the game was originally called {{lang|zh|\u9ebb\u96c0}} ({{zh|hp=m\u00e1qu\u00e8}}){{mdash}}meaning [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]{{mdash}}which is still used in some southern dialects. It is said that the clacking of tiles during shuffling resembles the chattering of sparrows. It has also been suggested that the name came from an evolution of an earlier card game called [[Madiao]] which mahjong tiles were adapted from.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete book of Mah-Jongg|last=Millington|first=A. D.|date=1977|publisher=A. Barker|isbn=0213166224|location=London|oclc=3069655}}</ref> Most [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin-speaking]] Chinese now call the game {{lang|zh|\u9ebb\u5c07|}} (''m\u00e1ji\u00e0ng''). Its name is similar in other languages, except in [[Thai language|Thai]], where it is called \u0e44\u0e1e\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e01 (''phai nok krachok''), a [[calque]] meaning \"sparrow cards.\"<ref>https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/28815/1/10672983.pdf</ref>\n\n== General rules ==\n[[File:Mahjong tiles on angle.jpg|thumb|A set of Mahjong tiles]]\n\nWhile mahjong itself has many variants, various game rules and mechanics are generally \"universal\".  Variations between mahjong forms rests on which game features are used or not.  Players of one form of mahjong may be able to learn another without too much difficulty, compared to an individual who has never played.\n\n=== Game pieces and accessories ===\n{{Main|Mahjong tiles}}\n\nOld Hong Kong Mahjong is played with a standard set of Mahjong tiles (though cards may be used). Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal), and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to hold the tiles, especially if they are larger or smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape.\n\nA set of Mahjong tiles usually has at least 136 tiles (most commonly 144); however, sets originating from the United States or Southeast Asia will probably have more. Mahjong tiles are split into 3 categories: Suits, Honors, and Bonuses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Mahjong tile count per set\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n!

The dots suit is also known as the \"wheels\", \"circles\", \"balls\", \"stones\", '\"marbles\" or \"coins\" suit. The characters suit is also known as the \"cracks\" or \"numbers\" suit since the top characters are numbers in the Chinese orthography, and the bottom characters (in [[traditional Chinese characters]]) are the Chinese orthography of \"ten thousand\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.righto.com/chart.html |title=Mah Jongg Tiles and Names |author=Shirriff, Ken |publisher=righto.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Honors tiles ====\nThere are two different sets of Honors tiles: Winds and Dragons. The Winds are East, South, West, and North. In Mahjong, East (not North) is the beginning. The Dragons are Red, Green, and White. The white dragon has a blue or black frame on the face of the piece or in some sets is entirely blank and are typically known as \u767d\u677f (b\u00e1ib\u0103n) \"whiteboard\". These tiles have no numerical sequence like the simples (for example the bamboo pieces number 1 to 9). Like the simples, there are four identical copies of each Honors tile, for a total of 28 Honors tiles.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Winds\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n|-\n|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|width=\"50%\"|\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dragons\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n|-\n|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Bonus tiles ====\nThere are two sets of Bonus tiles: Flowers and Seasons. The flower and season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game. When drawn, the Bonus tile is not added into a player's hand but are instead set aside and kept near the player's other tiles for scoring purposes should they win the hand, and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the Bonus tile.\n\nIn addition, unlike the Simple and Honors tiles, there is only a single tile of each Bonus tile, so there are a total of four flower and four season tiles in the set. The tiles have a different artistic rendering of a specific type of flower or season.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flowers\n! No !!

There is no relation between the bonus tile \"bamboo\" flower and the bamboo suit of simple tiles (ex. 2 bamboo). In traditional Chinese culture, the [[Four Gentlemen]] are the plum (winter), orchid (spring), bamboo (summer), and chrysanthemum (autumn) which are regarded as the representative plants of those seasons, but people regard it as plum blossom (spring), orchid (summer), chrysanthemum (autumn) and bamboo (winter) now.\n\n=== Choosing table positions and first dealer ===\n[[File:Chinese dice.jpg|thumb|Chinese dice]]\nThe dealer is chosen by various means. For example, each player throws dice with the highest count taking the dealer position, second-highest taking south etc. Or one player may place one tile of each wind face down and shuffle them. Each player randomly select one of these tiles and these tiles dictate their wind position. Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) at the table in positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South, across is West, and the left is North. The order of play is traditionally counter-clockwise.\n\n=== Hands, rounds, and matches ===\n[[File:Tion-Mahjong.JPG|thumb|right|Cubic dealer and prevailing wind marker.]]\nA match consists of four rounds, each representing a \"prevailing wind,\" starting with East. Once the first round is completed, a second round begins with South as the prevailing wind, and so on. Wind position is significant in that it affects the scoring of the game. A Mahjong set with Winds in play will usually include a separate prevailing wind marker (typically a die marked with the Wind characters in a holder).\n\nIn each round at least four hands are played, with each player taking the position of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counterclockwise (though players do not physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.)\n\nWhenever a player in the East position (dealer) wins a hand, or if there is no winner (a draw or \"goulash hand\"), an extra hand is played with the same seating positions and prevailing wind as in the previous hand. This means that a match may potentially have no limit to the number of hands played (though some players will set a limit of three consecutive hands allowed with the same seat positions and prevailing wind).\n\nExample of games:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of a standard 16 hand game with two extra hands played<br/>(per no-winner-hand (goulash) and per east winning hand)\n!

By convention all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down as soon as possible to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.\n\n====Stacking tiles====\n[[File:Mahjong table.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Walls with slight diagonal offset and player positions marked with cardinal directions, including the dealer (E), along with counting order]]\n\nEach player then stacks a row of 18 tiles, two tiles high in front of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then push each side of their stack together to form a square wall.\n\nRegular players usually place their stacks in a slightly diagonal position (about 20 to 30 degrees anti-clockwise); the right end of their stack is pushed slightly further in to the centre of the table to meet almost the middle of the stack of the player on the right. This creates a smaller square wall the length of about half of each stack, with walls extended away from each corner of the square. The diagonally positioned stacks and a smaller square creates a bigger space for players' tiles and also makes an ergonomic position for drawing tiles from the stack.\n\n====Drawing tiles====\n\nThe dealer throws three dice in the square wall and sums up the total. Counting anti-clockwise so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to increase randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.\n\nUsing the same total on the dice (or the total of the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend to the left side player's stack.) This determines the location where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in anti-clockwise order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand.\n\nDealing does not have to be strictly this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may flip over when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the dealer penalised points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player who the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must take it as his/her 14th piece) or other house rules.\n\nEach player now sets aside any Flowers or Seasons they may have drawn and takes turns to draw replacement piece(s) from the wall in the anti-clockwise direction. If a player gets any Flowers or Seasons tiles in the replacement draw, the players must wait for the next turn to draw replacement tiles.\n\n[[File:Mahjong 13th piece draw.svg|thumb|left|While drawing the 13th piece to complete the initial hand, the dealer (E) will typically also draw a 14th piece (both highlighted in blue) to initiate the game.]]\n\n====Game play starts====\nThe dealer draws a piece from the wall in clockwise direction, adding it to their hand. Typically, this draw is performed during the initial deal to speed up play. If this does not complete a legal hand, the dealer then discards a piece (throwing it into the middle of the wall with no particular order in mind).\n\n=== Rules ===\n[[File:Lanzhou-019.JPG|right|thumb|Local play on the street in [[Lanzhou]] ]]\n\nEach player in turn, in counterclockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall; as long as the tile drawn is not one of the Bonus tiles, the player proceeds to discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out \"Mahjong\" while revealing their hand.\n\nThere are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:\n#A Bonus tile (Flower or Season) is drawn\n#A meld (Pong, Kong, or Chow) is made from a discard\n#Going Mahjong (declaring a winning hand)\n#Robbing a Kong\n\nDuring play, each player's hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a Kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.\n\n==== Legal hand ====\nA winning hand consists of 14 tiles. Since players always have 13 tiles in their hand during play, they must win by either drawing a piece from the wall that completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning from the wall\") or claiming a discard from another player which completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning by discard\"). The winning hand is made of four ''melds'' (a specific pattern of three pieces) and the ''eyes'' (a pair of identical pieces). The exceptions to this rule are the special hands listed below.\n\nMost players play with a table minimum, meaning a winning hand must score a minimum number of points (which can be seen in the scoring section). In Hong Kong Mahjong the most common point set is three but can be higher or lower depending on house rules.\n\n==== Melds ====\n'''Melds''' are groups of tiles within the player's hand, consisting of either a ''Pong'' (three identical tiles), a ''Kong'' (four identical tiles), a ''Chow'' (three Simple tiles all of the same suit, in numerical sequence), or ''Eyes'' (two identical tiles needed in a winning hand). Melds may be formed by drawing a tile from the wall, or by seizing another player's discard. There are rules governing which player has priority for a discard, and whether the meld should be exposed (displayed to all players) or remain concealed, depending on the manner in which the meld is formed.\n\n* '''Pongs''' are a set of three identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]]\n\nYou may form a Pong with any Simple or Honors tile. Bonus tiles (Flowers or Seasons) cannot be used to form a Pong because they are set aside and there are not three identical bonus tiles in the set. The tiles must be identical (you cannot mix suits). A Pong may either be concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing another player's discard).\n* '''Kong''' is a complete set of four identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]]\n\nConsider a Kong the same as a Pong with an additional tile to make a complete set of four. There are three ways to form a Kong.\n:# ''Concealed Kong'' \u2013 If a player holds three matching tiles (concealed Pong) and upon drawing a tile completes a set of four they may declare a Kong. They do so by revealing the meld and placing two pieces in the middle face up and two pieces on the ends face down.\n:# ''Exposed Kong'' \u2013 If a player can use a discarded tile to complete three matching tiles (concealed Pong) in their hand, he can take the piece and reveal an \"exposed kong\" or \"melded kong\". The player reveals his three pieces face up and places the stolen discard on top of the middle tile, or face down next to the three other face up pieces.\n:# ''Exposed Kong from Exposed Pong'' \u2013 If a player already has a melded Pong and then later in the game draws the fourth piece from the wall, he may announce (then or later in the game) a Kong by placing the fourth tile on top of the middle piece of the melded Pong, or all four tiles placed face up in a row. If a Pong has been melded a player cannot steal the 4th piece if another player discards it, it must be drawn.\n\nWhenever a Kong is formed, that player must draw an extra tile from the end of the wall and then discard a tile. The fourth piece of a Kong is not considered as one of the 13 tiles a player must always have in their hand. A Kong may not be formed from Bonus tiles (Flowers/Seasons), since the set does not include four identical tiles. Kongs are worth collecting to score more points and deprive opponents of the opportunity to obtain specific tiles.\n* '''Chow''' is a meld of three suited tiles in sequence. For example:\n\n[[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]]\n\nThe meld must be in absolute numerical sequence and all in the same suit. Players cannot skip numbers or meld from the 8 or 9 to 1 or 2. Honors tiles cannot be used to make Chows because they have no numerical value, and Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons) also cannot be used to make a Chow.\n\nA player can steal a discard to form a Chow only from the player whose turn was immediately before theirs; however, a player forming a Chow from a seized piece has the lowest priority for that tile. Any other player who needs that tile to make a Pong, make a Kong, or to win may seize that piece instead. Like the Pong, the Chow is either concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing the prior player's discard).\n* '''Eyes''' (also known as a pair) are two identical tiles which are an essential part of a legal winning hand. A piece cannot be stolen (melded) to form a pair of eyes unless the player simultaneously completes a legal winning hand.<ref>Lo, Amy (2001). ''The Book of Mahjong: An Illustrated Guide''. North Clarendon, VT: [[Tuttle Publishing|Tuttle]], p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-8048-3302-8}}.</ref>\n\nFor example:\n\n[[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]] [[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]]\n\n[[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]]\n\n==== Interruption of play ====\nThe regular anti-clockwise order of turns may be interrupted for four events:\n\n===== 1. Flower or Season =====\nWhenever a player draws a flower or season, it is announced and then placed to the side (it is not considered a part of the 13-tile hand, but in the event that player wins, he may earn bonus points for them) and the last tile of the wall is drawn as a replacement tile so that the player has the 14 pieces needed before their discard. This may happen successively in a player's turn.\n\n===== 2. Melding another player's discard =====\nWhen a player discards a tile, other players may steal the tile to complete a meld. Stealing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages (being forced to reveal part of one's hand to other players and not being able to change the meld once declared).\n\nWhen a meld (''Pong'', ''Kong,'' or ''Chow'') is declared through a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and expose the meld by placing the three (or four) tiles face up. The player must then discard a tile, and play continues to the right. If the player who melds a discard is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues anti-clockwise from the player who declared the meld.\n\nIf multiple players call for a discarded tile, priority for the discard depends on the declared action of the player stealing the discard.\n\n* # Highest priority goes to the player who needs the discarded tile to win the hand. A player may take the tile to win the hand from any other player.\n\n* # Next priority goes to the player who declares a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' using the discard. A player who calls for a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' may take the discard from any other player. Only one player can be in this position because there are only four of any tile in a Mahjong set.\n\n* # Last priority goes to the player who declares a Chow using the discard. Players may only call for a ''Chow'' from the discard of the player immediately prior to them, unless the tile is the final one required to complete the hand.\n\n===== 3. Winning a hand =====\nThe act of winning a hand interrupts play to assess the validity of the hand won.  Upon confirmation, the player is awarded the hand's value per the specific game's rule.\n\n======From a discard======\nIf at any point in the game a player can use another player's discard to complete a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they declare a win and reveal their winning hand. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If more than one player can use a discard to win the hand, multiple ways can handle the situation based on agreed table rules: Either the players count the points they would win with the discard and the winner is the one with the higher score, the winner is simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn, or multiple players may be granted the win simultaneously.\n\n======From the wall======\nAlternatively, a player may also win by drawing a tile that completes a legal hand. This is called \"winning from the wall\". In Hong Kong mahjong, winning from the wall doubles the number of base points each loser must pay.\n\n======False Mahjong======\nTechnically, the declaration for winning a hand may be done at anytime.  However, the player must have a complete and legal hand.  Otherwise, the win declaration is penalized.  The penalty depends on table rules. The player may forfeit points to the other players. Another potential penalty is the player who called out the false mahjong must play the rest of the hand with their tiles face up on the table so other players can see them (open hand).  Some methods apply the penalty at the end of the entire game.  Again, the table rules dictate the enforcement of the penalty.\n\n===== 4. Robbing a Kong =====\nA rarely occurring and high-scoring feature of Hong Kong Mahjong is a move called robbing the Kong. If a player declares a Kong (either by melding it or adding a fourth piece to a Pong to form a Kong or declaring a concealed Kong) but another player can use that piece to complete a hand, the completing player takes priority to go Mahjong (win the hand) and may steal that piece from the player who intended to declare the Kong.\n\n==== Examples of winning hands ====\nBelow are two examples of winning hands. A winning hand must consist of four melds (Pongs, Kongs, or Chows) and a pair (eyes) and must also score the agreed table minimum.\n\n: [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] \u2013 [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n''Hand formed with four Pongs and the eyes (pair) of East wind.

Hand is made of Chows, Pongs and the eyes of circles.''\n\nMost players include table variations in their games, of which some non-standard are included. The hands of ''seven different pairs'' and ''13 orphans'' are examples which do not have four melds and the eyes. They are described in more detail below.\n\n==== Repeated hands ====\n\nIf the dealer wins the hand, he will remain the dealer and an extra hand is played in addition to the minimum 16 hands in a match.\n\nAn extra hand is also played if there is no winner by the time all the tiles in the wall have been drawn. When there is no winner it is known as a \"goulash hand\". Depending on table rules, the winner of the next game may take an agreed number of points from each player, carrying over the points from the non-winning hand to the winning one. If there are two or three goulash hands in a row then the winner would collect a considerable number of points from each player on top of their scoring hand. Because extra hands may be played every time a dealer wins or if there is a goulash hand, a match of 16 hands can easily become a match of 20 or even much more.\n\nAs table rules add a large amount of flexibility for players, they can choose to disregard the rule of extra hands and pass on the dealership regardless of who wins or if it results in a goulash hand. This puts a maximum estimated limit on the game duration and provides some amount of predictability.\n\n====Rhythm of play====\nPlayers may agree on table rules if the pace of the game is brisk or leisurely. For brisk games players may agree that a couple seconds after a discard are allowed for a \"window of opportunity\" before the next player picks up from the wall. Usually it is agreed once the next player has waited the duration of the \"window of opportunity\" and draws a tile from the wall, the previous discard is lost and cannot be claimed.\n\n=== Scoring ===\n{{Main|Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules}}\n\nOld Hong Kong scoring is relatively simple. There is only one winner (or if there is a draw the hand is replayed). The winner must have a legal hand that meets the minimum faan points agreed to in advance (not including any bonus points). Only the winner scores, the other players pay the winner various sums. After each hand ends, the winner counts all of his or her faan points.\n* faan points depend on:\n** the composition of the entire hand\n** how the hand was won\n** bonus tiles\n** special patterns\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum faan value agreed in advance (often 3). Bonus tiles and a few other elements are not included in the minimum faan value a player needs to form a legal winning hand. (i.e. in a three faan minimum game, if a player has two faan points and one bonus point, the player has not met the proper requirements to win and will need to gain another faan point before calling mahjong. Though the bonus points cannot be included in the minimum points needed to win, they are included in the overall score after a player wins\n* The other players do not score their hand. Once the winner has added his or her points (faan points plus bonus points) they must be converted into base points (the chart is below). These base points represent how much the opponents pay to the winner\n* Players then pay the winner (in money or when not gambling with \"chips or points\") based on three factors:\n** the base points (faan points and bonus points converted into a payment unit)\n** if the player won from the wall (doubles the points)\n** if the player was the dealer (doubles the points)\n\n==== Concealed vs. revealed meld and hand====\n\nA concealed meld is one that contains no tiles stolen from another players discard. A concealed hand is one made up of only concealed melds. Many variations distinguish between a concealed hand (winning from the wall) and a semi concealed hand (the last tile is a stolen discard). In most mahjong variations having a concealed hand can be valuable in scoring. Hong Kong mahjong doesn't award concealed melds/hands as generously as others. Concealed hands only the case with a few limit hands or half-limit hands (thirteen orphans, heavenly gates, four concealed pongs) as well as a complete hand (seven pairs) and over several melds (three concealed pongs).\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|+Meld summary\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Meld Type !! rowspan=2 | Quantity !! colspan=3 | Eligible tiles !! colspan=2 | When completed by ...\n|-\n!

How points are reckoned is agreed by players beforehand. For example, they can keep a tally, exchange chips or pay one another with money. The faan value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the points the losers pay the winner. The table is progressive, doubling the number of base points when reaching a certain faan point target. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table, for other tables see [[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Base points (Old Hong Kong Simplified) \n! faan points !!

If a player has 3 faan then his hand is worth one base point. A winning hand with 9 faan is worth four base points. Losing players must give the winning player the value of these base points. The following special cases result in doubled base points:\n* If the winner wins from the wall his base points are doubled\n* If the hand was won by discard, the discarder doubles the amount he owes the winner\n* If the winner is east all losers double the basepoints\n* If east player is a losing player he pays double the points to the winner.\n\nIf two of these criteria apply to any player, he must double and then redouble the points owed to the winner.\n\n===== Examples =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n!Hand !!

These are exceptional hands, difficult to obtain and are very valuable in point scoring. As many table rules put a limit on the number of points a winners hand can score, full limit hands score that maximum. Table rules dictate if these rare and special hands are allowed, which ones, and the limit for scoring. A common scoring limit is 64 points, which is the highest base points doubled twice. A winner receives the scoring limit from each player without any doubling.\n\nSome limit hands by necessity must be completely concealed (not discards used) or semi-concealed (the only discard used is the one needed to go mahjong). This includes the 13 orphans, 4 concealed pongs, heavenly hand and earthly hand. It is usually expected that the heavenly gates hand be concealed or semi-concealed. As for the dragon limit hands and the great winds, table rules dictate if the hand must be concealed or not. Some table rules claim that a semi-concealed hand (winning from a discard) scores a half-limit.\n\nSome groups also play with the \"great Flowers\" rule. If a player picks up all four Flowers and all four Seasons during their hand, they instantly win the hand and receive the maximum points from all of the players. This is exceptionally rare.\n\nIn all the hands that require pongs, each pong can be replaced by the corresponding kong.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Limit Hands (Maximum number of fan agreed)\n! width=10% | Hand !! width=90% | Explanation with example\n|-\n!

In mainland China alone, there are over thirty variants.<ref name=\"Games and Culture\">{{cite arxiv |last1=Wang |first1=Xianwen |last2=Mao |first2=Wenli |last3=Liu |first3=Chen |title=Games and Culture: Using Online-gaming Data to Cluster Chinese Regional Cultures |ref=Games and Culture|eprint=1310.0621 |class=cs.CY |year=2013 }}</ref> Many variations today differ only by scoring:\n\n* '''[[Chinese classical Mahjong]]''' is the oldest surviving variety of Mahjong and was the version introduced to America in the 1920s under various names. It has a small, loyal following in the West, although few play it in Asia. All players score and it is possible to score higher than the winner.\n* '''[[Hong Kong Mahjong]]''' or '''Cantonese Mahjong''' is a more common form of Mahjong, differing in minor scoring details from the Chinese Classical variety. It does not allow multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Competition Mahjong scoring rules|Competition Mahjong]]''' is an international standard founded by All-China Sports Federation in July 1998 that some Mahjong societies have adopted for competition play and in some cases for all play.\n* '''Sichuan Mahjong''' is a growing variety, particularly in southern China, disallowing chi melds, and using only the suited tiles. Play continues until a loser is decided or a draw. It can be played very quickly.\n* '''Wuhan Mahjong''' is growing rapidly and become popular in southern China. It is different from other parts of China such that it has a tile that can be used as everything called Laizi ({{lang|zh|\u8d56\u5b50}}), and the player has to have a set of special two tiles, namely two, five, eight, as prerequisite for winning. Another variation has become the new trend, and is called {{lang|zh|\u7ea2\u4e2d\u8d56\u5b50\u6760}}. Special tiles need to be discarded.\n* '''Changsha Mahjong''' is widely played in [[Hunan]] Province. Like Wuhan Mahjong, players need to obtain special Jong consisting of only tiles of two, five or eight. Changsha Mahjong forbids using winds and some special tiles, those tiles are first drawn out from the table when playing. Winners each round get a special drawing session for bonuses, usually doubling the score.\n* '''Tianjin Mahjong''' using normally seven jokers, with special scoring such as ''joker-free'', ''joker-waiting-pair'', ''catch-5'', ''dragon'', ''joker-suited-dragon''.\n* '''Shenyang Mahjong''' using 13 hands in a game, and Shenyang Mahjong has a really fast speed on playing, which allegedly might be said in some regard to perhaps match the personality of north-east people in China. Also in Shenyang Mahjong, the player must to have Bamboos, Characters, Circles and number one or nine in his hand. In addition, the players have to Pong before they Chow, so there is no chance to win even if some players win at the first time they have their hands in hand.\n* '''[[Taiwanese Mahjong]]''' is the variety prevalent in Taiwan and involves hands of sixteen tiles (as opposed to the thirteen-tile hands in other versions), features bonuses for dealers and recurring dealerships, and allows multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Filipino Mahjong]]''', sixteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. Honors are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Fujian Mahjong''', thirteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. No dragons. Winds are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Taiyuan Lisi Mahjong''', or ''Lisi'' (Raise 4; {{lang|zh|[[:zh:\u592a\u539f\u7acb\u56db\u9ebb\u5c06]]}}), the players must win with the first four blocks drawn which are placed separately in front of other. These four blocks cannot be touched until the player has a ready hand.\n* '''[[Singaporean mahjong|Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong]]''' are two similar variants with much in common with Hong Kong mahjong. Unique elements of Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong are the use of four animal bonus tiles (cat, mouse, cockerel, and centipede) as well as certain alternatives in the scoring rules, which allow payouts midway through the game if certain conditions (such as a ''kong'') are met. Melds may also be presented in a form different to most other variations.\n* '''South African Mahjong''' is a variant of Cantonese Mahjong. It is very similar in terms of game play and follows most of the rules and regulations of Cantonese Mahjong. However, there are some minor differences in scoring, e.g. the limit on the maximum points a hand can be rewarded is three or four ''fan'' depending on the ''house'' rules. A chicken hand (gai wu) is normally considered a value hand. Depending on the ''house'' rules ''Flowers'' may also be used to boost scoring.\n* '''Thai Mahjong''' has eight specialized jokers with eight extra flowers and eight animals for a total of 168 tiles.\n* '''Vietnamese Mahjong''' has the same eight specialized jokers but with only eight different extra flowers for a total of 160 tiles. Modern variant triplicates or quadruplicates the jokers for a total of 176 or 184 tiles.\n* '''Japanese classical Mahjong''' is still used in tournaments. It is closer to the Chinese classical scoring system but only the winner scores. \n* '''[[Japanese Mahjong]]''' is a standardized form of Mahjong in Japan and is also found prevalently in video games. In addition to scoring changes, the rules of ''[[Japanese Mahjong#R\u012bchi|r\u012bchi]]'' (ready hand) and ''[[Japanese Mahjong scoring rules#Dora|dora]]'' (bonus tiles) are unique highlights of this variant. In addition, tile discards are specifically arranged in front of each player by discard order, to take discarded tiles into account during play. Some rules replace some number 5 tiles with red tiles so that they can eventually get more value.<!--A standard rule set for Japanese mahjong was designed in 2008 by the European Mahjong Association,<ref>[http://gamenoodle.blogspot.com/2012/09/mahjongs.html European Mahjong Association]</ref> in cooperation with the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, in order to organize the first European Riichi Mahjong Championship in Hanover, Germany, June 2008. Danish player Thomas Kragh was the winner.<ref>[http://www.mahjongnews.com/en/index.php/ec-riichi/54-ec-2008/104-rmc2008.html]</ref>-->\n* '''Korean Mahjong''' is unique in many ways and is an excellent version for three players. One suit is omitted completely (usually the Bamboo set or 2\u20138 of bamboo) as well as the Seasons. The scoring is simpler and the play is faster. No melded chows are allowed and concealed hands are common. Riichi (much like its Japanese cousin) is an integral part of the game as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:korean-overview|title=Korean Mahjong Rules - Mahjong Wiki (\u9ebb\u5c06\u7ef4\u57fa)|website=mahjong.wikidot.com}}</ref>\n* '''Pussers bones''' is a fast-moving variant developed by sailors in the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. It uses an alternative vocabulary, such as ''Eddie'', ''Sammy'', ''Wally'', and ''Normie'', instead of ''East'', ''South'', ''West'', and ''North'' respectively.\n* '''Western classical Mahjong''' is a descendant of the version of Mahjong introduced by Babcock to America in the 1920s. Today, this term largely refers to the \"[[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson]]\" rules, used in the U.S. military, and other similar American-made variants that are closer to the Babcock rules.\n* '''[[American mahjong|American Mahjong]]''' is a form of Mahjong standardized by the National Mah Jongg League<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org |title=National Mahjjong League |publisher=Nationalmahjonggleague.org |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> and the American Mah-Jongg Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amja.net/|title=The American Mah-Jongg Association \u2013 news, products and tournaments \u2013 Join us for our next American Mah-Jongg tournament or cruise!.}}</ref> It uses joker tiles, the Charleston, plus melds of five or more tiles, treats bonus tiles as Honors, and eschews the Chow and the notion of a standard hand. Legal hands are changed annually. Purists claim that this makes American Mahjong a separate game. In addition, the NMJL and AMJA variations, which have minor scoring differences, are commonly referred to as ''Mahjongg'' or ''mah-jongg'' (with 2 Gs, often hyphenated).\n\n'''[[Three player mahjong|Three-player Mahjong]]''' (or 3-''ka'') is a simplified three-person Mahjong that involves hands of 13 tiles (with a total of 84 tiles on the table) and may use jokers depending on the variation. Any rule set can be adapted for three players; however, this is far more common and accepted in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. It usually eliminates one suit entirely, or tiles 2\u20138 in one suit leaving only the terminals. It needs fewer people to start a game and the turnaround time of a game is short\u2014hence, it is considered a fast game. In some versions there is a jackpot for winning in which whoever accumulates a point of 10 is considered to hit the jackpot or whoever scores three hidden hands first. The Malaysian and Korean versions drop one wind and may include a seat dragon.<ref>The Mahjong Wiki.[http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:three-player Three-player mahjong].

The edges are raised to prevent tiles from sliding off and the surface is covered in felt to limit wear on the tiles. Automatic dealing tables, often used for high stakes playing and tournaments, are able to shuffle tiles, build walls, and randomize dice. It is an elaborate device built into a table which uses two alternating sets of tiles. It prepares one wall while the players play one hand. After the hand is finished the tiles are dropped into the table and a new wall raises upwards. In theory the table should avoid cheating (by stacking the deck and or using loaded dice).\n\n====Tiles====\nThe following chart shows the most generic set of tiles \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=11|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!colspan=2|8\n!colspan=2|9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Suits\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=4|Honors/Bonus\n!colspan=4|Winds\n!colspan=3|Dragons\n!colspan=4|Bonus\n|-\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n!colspan=2|Seasons\n!colspan=2|Flowers\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJh1-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh2-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh5-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh6-.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|[[File:MJh3-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh4-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh7-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh8-.svg|25px]]\n|}\n\nThere are variations that feature specific use of tiles. Some three-player versions remove the North Wind and one Chinese provincial version has no Honors. Korean Mahjong removes the bamboo suit or at least its numbers 2\u20138 so that terminals can be used. Japanese Mahjong rarely uses Flowers or Seasons. The Seasons are removed in Korean Mahjong, while many Southeast Asian sets have more flower series.\n\n==== Wild cards and jokers ====\n\nSome mahjong variants accept wildcard tiles. The wildcard tiles are decided at the beginning of the game by choosing one random tile. The wild card could be the immediately following tile on the wall, after distributing tiles to all players, or it could also be separately decided by a dice throw. Wildcard tiles can't be discarded and can only replace tiles in Chows. Wildcard tiles cannot replace tiles in Pongs and Kongs. For example, if a character 4 is chosen, then character 4 and the next sequential tile, character 5, can be used as wild cards in this round. (When the wildcard indicator is chosen and exposed, only 3 tiles remain of the same denomination, so the next tile in the suit will also be used as a wildcard, adding to 7 wildcard tiles for 4 players.) Also, if a tile numbered 9 is the indicator, the suits circle back to 1, after 9. Thus, the number 9 and 1 are wild cards.\n\nAlso, if the chosen tile is not in the suited tiles, the wild cards are decided in rules:\n[[File:Joker-vietnammj.JPG|right|thumb|Top eight are Vietnamese jokers. Bottom four are Chinese.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Wild card tile chosen !! Another wildcard\n|-\n| East || South\n|-\n| South || West\n|-\n| West || North\n|-\n| North || East\n|-\n| Red Dragon || Green Dragon\n|-\n| Green Dragon || White Dragon\n|-\n| White Dragon || Red Dragon\n|}\n\nThe bonus tiles are not available for wild cards.\n\nA feature of several variations of Mahjong, most notably in American mahjong, is the notion of some number of Joker tiles. They may be used as a wild card: a substitute for any tile in a hand, or, in some variations, only tiles in melds. Another variation is that the Joker tile may ''not'' be used for melding. Depending on the variation, a player may replace a Joker tile that is part of an exposed meld belonging to any player with the tile it represents.\n\nRules governing discarding Joker tiles also exist; some variations permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of any tile, and others only permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of the previously discarded tile (or the absence of a tile, if it is the first discard).\n\nJoker tiles may or may not affect scoring, depending on the variation. Some special hands may require the use of Joker tiles (for example, to represent a \"fifth tile\" of a certain suited or honor tile).\n\nIn American Mahjong, it is illegal to pass Jokers during the Charleston.\n\n===== Flowers =====\nJapanese rule sets discourage the use of Flowers and Seasons. Korean rules and three-player Mahjong in the Korean/Japanese tradition use only Flowers. In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of four animals are used. The rule set includes a unique function in that players who get two specific animals get a one-time immediate payout from all players. In Taiwanese Mahjong, getting all eight Flowers and Seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.\n\nFour of the flower tiles represent the [[Four Gentlemen|four noble plants]] of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] reckoning:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc22 }}[[Prunus mume|plum]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc23 }}[[orchid]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc25 }}[[chrysanthemum]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc24 }}[[bamboo]].\n\n[[File:MJh5-.svg|50px|Plum]] [[File:MJh6-.svg|50px|Orchid]] [[File:MJh7-.svg|50px|Chrysanthemum]] [[File:MJh8-.svg|50px|Bamboo]]\n\nThe other 4 flower tiles (or season tiles) represent Seasons:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc26 }} [[spring (season)|spring]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc27 }} [[summer]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc28 }} [[autumn]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc29 }}[[winter]].\n\n[[File:MJh1-.svg|50px|Spring]] [[File:MJh2-.svg|50px|Summer]] [[File:MJh3-.svg|50px|Autumn]] [[File:MJh4-.svg|50px|Winter]]\n\nThese animal tiles are used in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and local variations. They represent the [[cat]], [[mouse]], [[rooster]] and [[centipede]]. Like flower tiles, they also function as bonus tiles. However, as they have no corresponding seat position, any player who draws one of these gets a bonus point.\n\n[[File:MJat1-.svg|50px|Cat]] [[File:MJat2-.svg|50px|Mouse]] [[File:MJat3-.svg|50px|Rooster]] [[File:MJat4-.svg|50px|Centipede]]\n\n===== Walls =====\nAll tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Each player then stacks a row of tiles two tiles high in front of him, the length of the row depending on the number of tiles in use:\n* 136 tiles: 17 stacks for each player\n** Suits of circles, bamboos, and characters + winds + dragons\n* 144 tiles: 18 stacks for each player\n* 148 tiles: 19 stacks for dealer and player opposite, 18 for rest\n* 152 tiles: 19 stacks for each player\n\n====Dice, markers, and counting pieces====\n[[File:Mahjong fiches.jpg|thumb|right|Mahjong counting sticks: Left are Chinese while the right are Japanese]]\nDepending on the variation, two or three [[dice]] are usually used to decide what part of the wall to start dealing from. They are six-sided dice, traditionally but not necessarily Chinese dice with red one and four pips.\n\nThe dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places to the side to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto), a cube with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can be placed in a hollow square (the dealer holds onto it), or a cylinder locked into frame which can be rolled to expose the wind on the top. Japanese mahjong, especially in a gambling environment, may optionally use four yakitori markers to indicate which players have not won a hand yet and has to pay a penalty.\n\nThere are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries. They range from Chinese or Japanese counting sticks (thin sticks with various dots on them to represent various points), [[jeton]]s, [[play money]], paper and pencil, or various apps on touchscreen devices used to calculate and keep scores.\n\n=== Rules ===\nJapanese and Korean Mahjong have some special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already discarded that piece, where players' discards are kept in neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.\nTaiwanese Mahjong adds three tiles to a hand requiring a 5th set to be formed, making a clean hand or all Pong hand very difficult to procure.\nAmerican Mahjong has distinctive game mechanics and the article on [[American mahjong|American Mahjong]] details these. Some differences include many special patterns, a different scoring system and the use of jokers and five-of-a-kind.\n\n==== Charleston ====\nIn the American variations it is required that, before each hand begins, a Charleston be enacted. In the first exchange, three tiles are passed to the player on one's right; in the next exchange, the tiles are passed to the player opposite, followed by three tiles passed to the left. If all players are in agreement, a second Charleston is performed; however, any player may decide to stop passing after the first Charleston is complete. The Charleston is followed by an optional pass to the player across of one, two, or three tiles. The Charleston, a distinctive feature of American Mahjong, may have been borrowed from card games such as [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].\n\n=== Hands ===\nMany variations have specific hands, some of which are common while some are optional depending on regions and players. One example is the Pure Green hand made of chows or Pongs using 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of bamboo and green dragon.\n\n==== Ready hands ====\nWhen a hand is one tile short of winning (for example: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], waiting for: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]], [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]], or [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], as [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] can be the eyes), the hand is said to be a ready hand, or more figuratively, \"on the pot\". The player holding a ready hand is said to be ''waiting'' for certain tiles. It is common to be waiting for two or three tiles, and some variations award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile Mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'', or ''13 orphans'', a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of Mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.\n\nSome variations of Mahjong, most notably Japanese and Korean ones, allow a player to declare {{nihongo||\u7acb\u76f4|r\u012bchi|sometimes known as ''reach'', as it is phonetically similar}}. A declaration of ''r\u012bchi'' is a promise that any tile drawn by the player is immediately discarded unless it constitutes a win. Standard requirements for ''r\u012bchi'' are that the hand be ''closed'' or have no melds declared (other than a concealed Kong) and that players already have points for declaration of ''r\u012bchi''. A player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and wins usually receives a point bonus for their hand directly, and a player who won with ''r\u012bchi'' also has the advantage to open the inner {{nihongo||\u30c9\u30e9|dora|from \"dra\"gon}} which leads to higher possibilities to match such a card, thus has more chance to grant additional bonus. However, a player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and loses is usually penalised in some fashion. Declaring a nonexistent ''r\u012bchi'' is also penalised in some way.\n\nIn some variations, a situation in which all four players declare a ''r\u012bchi'' is an automatic drawn game, as it reduces the game down to pure luck, i.e., who gets their needed tile first.\n\n=== Draws ===\nIf only the dead wall remains (or if no dead wall exists and the wall is depleted) and no one has won, the hand is drawn (\u6d41\u5c40 ''li\u00fa j\u00fa'', \u9ec3\u838a ''hu\u00e1ng zhu\u0101ng'', Japanese \u6d41\u5c40 ''ry\u016bkyoku''), or \"[[goulash]]ed\". A new hand begins, and depending on the variant, the Game Wind may change. For example, in most playing circles in Singapore, if there is at least one Kong when the hand is a draw, the following player of the dealer becomes the next dealer; otherwise, the dealer remains dealer.\n\nJapanese Mahjong has a special rule called {{nihongo||\u4e09\u5bb6\u548c|''sanchah\u014d''}}, which is, if three players claim the same discard in order to win, the hand is drawn. One reason for this is that there are cases in which bars of 1,000 points for declaring ''r\u012bchi'' cannot be divided by three. The rule is treated the same as \"abortive draws\".\n\n==== Abortive draws ====\nIn Japanese Mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:\n* {{nihongo||\u4e5d\u7a2e\u4e5d\u724c|Ky\u016bshu Ky\u016bhai}}: On a player's first turn when no meld has been declared yet, if a player has nine different terminal (also known as major<ref>{{cite web|last=Gregory |first=Peter |url=http://mahjongbritishrules.com/scoring/index.html |title=Tile Classification |publisher=Mahjongbritishrules.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>) or honor tiles, the player may declare the hand to be drawn (for example, [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs6-.svg|25px|6 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJw1-.svg|25px|1 Character]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf3-.svg|25px|West Wind]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]], but could also go for the nonstandard ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'' hand as well).\n* {{nihongo|Four Winds' barrier|\u56db\u98a8\u5b50\u9023\u6253|S\u016bfontsu rent\u0101}}: On the first turn without any meld declarations, if all 4 players discard the same Wind tile, the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo||\u56db\u4eba\u7acb\u76f4|Yonin r\u012bchi}}: If all four players declare ''r\u012bchi'', the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo|Four Kongs' abort|\u56db\u69d3\u6563\u4e86|S\u016bkan sanra}}: The hand is drawn when the fourth Kong is declared, unless all four Kongs were declared by a single player. Still, the hand is drawn when another player declares a fifth Kong.\n\n===Scoring===\nScoring in Mahjong involves points, with a monetary value for points agreed upon by players. Although in many variations scoreless hands are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the hand.\n\nWhile the basic rules are more or less the same throughout Mahjong, the greatest divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems. Like the rules, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese base their roots. American Mahjong generally has greatly divergent scoring rules, as well as greatly divergent general rules.\n\nBecause of the large differences between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often agree on particular scoring rules before a game.\n\n====Points====\nPoints (terminology of which differs from variation to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into scores for each player using some (typically [[exponential function|exponential]]) functions. Some criteria may be also in terms of both points and score.\n\nIn many variations the dealer receives no scoring bonus and does not maintain his turn by winning or a dead hand.\n\nIn classical Mahjong all players score points. Points are given for sets and hand composition and winning bonuses, doubled and redoubled for basic patterns. Sometimes a loser may score more points than a winner. Japanese Mahjong has a complex scoring system with several stages of scoring, rules and exceptions, evening out scores and bonus points at the end of a match. Korean Mahjong has a simple scoring system where only winner scores without any form of doubling.\n\nSome variations give points for concealed hands, in which case no melds are made except by winning on a discard.\n\nIn Old Hong Kong Mahjong:\n* Only the winner scores points.\n* Winning hands are scored by totaling the point value of each element in the hand. Points are distinct from the actual payment received from each player.\n* The winner receives points (also known as faan among some players) for:\n** individual melds,\n** the composition of the entire hand,\n** how the hand was won,\n** bonus tiles,\n** special patterns,\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum points agreed in advance (often 3).\n* Bonus points are separate from the minimum points a player needs to win.\n* If a player goes Mahjong with a legal and minimum hand, his hand is scored by adding his points and bonus points together.\n* The payment received from each player depends on three factors:\n** the point value of the hand,\n** if the player won from a discard or from the wall, and\n** if the player was the dealer or not.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Mahjong Variations\n!

The game is entirely unrelated to mahjong or its variations and is a recent invention. A two player version was published by [[Nintendo]]. The game involves stacking tiles face up in various elaborate patterns and removing uncovered matching tiles at the end of rows.\n\n== Competition ==\n[[File:wk-mahjong2002.jpg|thumb|The top 3 in the [[World Mahjong Championship]] in [[Tokyo]], October 2002. Left: John J. O'Connor (2nd place) In the middle: world champion Mai Hatsune, from Japan Right: Yuichi Ikeya (3rd place)]]\n\nIn 1998, in the interest of dissociating illegal gambling from Mahjong, the [[China State Sports Commission]] published a new set of rules, now generally referred to as Chinese Official rules or International Tournament rules (see [[Guobiao Majiang]]). The principles of the new, wholesome Mahjong are no gambling, no drinking, and no smoking. In international tournaments, players are often grouped in teams to emphasize that Mahjong from now on is considered a sport.\n\nThe new rules are highly pattern-based. The rulebook contains 81 combinations, based on patterns and scoring elements popular in classic and modern regional Chinese variants; some table practices of Japan have also been adopted. Points for flower tiles (each flower is worth one point) may not be added until the player has scored eight points. The winner of a game receives the score from the player who discards the winning tile, plus eight basic points from each player; in the case of ''zimo'' (self-drawn win), he receives the value of this round plus eight points from all players.\n\nThe new rules were first used in an international tournament in [[Tokyo]], where, in 2002, the [[2002 World Championship in Mahjong|first global tournament in Mahjong]] was organized by the Mahjong Museum, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, and the city council of Ningbo, China. One hundred players participated, mainly from Japan and China, but also from Europe and the United States. Mai Hatsune, from Japan, became the first world champion. The following year saw the first annual China Mahjong Championship, held in Hainan; the next two annual tournaments were held in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most players were Chinese; players from other nations attended as well.\n\nIn 2005, the first [[Open European Mahjong Championship]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |title=The Independent Internet Mahjong Newspaper |publisher=Mahjongnews.com |accessdate=7 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145919/http://mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |archive-date=12 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> was held in the Netherlands, with 108 players.

There were 152 participants.\n\nIn 2006, the [[World Mahjong Organization]] (WMO) was founded in [[Beijing]], China, with the cooperation of, amongst others, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee (JMOC) and the European Mahjong Association (EMA). This organization held its first [[World Mahjong Championship]] in November 2007 in the Chinese town of [[Chengdu]], attended by 144 participants from all over the world. It was won by Li Li, a Chinese student at [[Tsinghua University]]. The next World Championship took place in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the Netherlands, 27 to 29 August 2010.\n\nOther major international tournaments include the [[Mahjong International League]]'s [[World Mahjong Sports Games]] and the privately sponsored [[World Series Of Mahjong]].\n\n[[American mahjong]] tournaments are held in virtually every state\u2014the largest is in Las Vegas, Nevada twice a year, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by Mah Jongg Madness; and the annual cruise hosted by the National Mah Jongg League and Mah Jongg Madness (MJM). MJM tournaments host between 150 and 500 participants at these larger events; and there are several smaller scale, but equally successful tournaments held annually by other hosts. Prize pools are based on the number participating. Rules are based on the National Mah Jongg League standard rules.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:\u6cad\u967d\u7d19\u724c.png|thumb|Money-suited cards]]\nMahjong is based on draw-and-discard [[card games]] that were popular in 18th and 19th century China, some of which are still popular today.<ref name=Lo>{{cite book|last1=Lo|first1=Andrew|title='China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong'.

Each deck is divided into three suits of '''[[Cash (Chinese coin)|Cash]]''' or coins, '''[[String of cash coins (currency unit)|Strings]]''' of cash, and '''[[Myriad]]s''' of strings. There are nine ranks in each suit. In addition, there are three [[Wild card (card games)|wild cards]]: '''Red flower''', '''White flower''', and '''Old thousand'''. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.\n\nGames scholar [[David Parlett]] has written that the Western card games [[Conquian]] and [[Rummy]] share a common origin with Mahjong.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|year=1978|isbn=978-0-14-103787-5}}</ref> All these games involve players drawing and discarding tiles or cards to make [[Meld (cards)|melds]]. [[Khanhoo]] is an early example of such a game. The most likely ancestor to Mahjong was ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' ([[:zh:\u78b0\u548c|\u78b0\u548c]]) which was played with 120 or 150 cards.<ref name=Lo/> During the late 19th century, ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' was used interchangeably with ''m\u00e1qu\u00e8'' in both card and tile form.\n\nIt is not known when the conversion from cards to tiles took place precisely but it most likely occurred in the middle of the 19th century. The earliest surviving tile sets date to around 1870 and were acquired in [[Fuzhou]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Ningbo]].<ref name=Lo/><ref name=\"Stanwick1\">{{cite journal|last1=Stanwick|first1=Michael|title=Mahjong(g) Before Mahjong(g): Part 1|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2004|volume=32|issue=4|pages=153\u2013162|ref=Stanwick1}}</ref><ref>Sloper, Tom.

The game itself was banned during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u20131976).<ref name=\"Lo\"/> Today, it is a favorite pastime in China<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.winmahjong.com/mahjong-in-china/ |title=Mahjong in China |publisher=Win Mahjong |accessdate=29 December 2014 }}</ref> and other Chinese-speaking communities.\n\n=== Mahjong in the West ===\n[[File:28.779 SL1 s.jpg|thumb|200px|Mahjong tiles of late 19th century, a gift of [[George B.

He did not explain the dialect of the originator or region specific etymology of this information.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilkinson, W.H.|title=Chinese Origin Of Playing Cards|journal=The American Anthropologist|year=1895|volume=viii|pages=61\u201378|doi=10.1525/aa.1895.8.1.02a00070|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448960}}</ref> By 1910, there were written accounts in many languages, including [[French language|French]] and Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe game was imported to the United States in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Recalling the Craze for a Game of Chance |first=Steven |last=Heller |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 March 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/arts/artsspecial/18MAH.html?ex=1285473600&en=37c8a4976aafc929&ei=5087&WT.mc_id=AR-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M143-ROS-0410-L2&WT.mc_ev=click}}</ref> The first Mahjong sets sold in the U.S. were sold by [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] starting in 1920. It became a success in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the co-owner of the company, [[Ezra Fitch]], sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every Mahjong set they could find. Abercrombie & Fitch sold a total of 12,000 Mahjong sets.\n\nAlso in 1920, [[Joseph Park Babcock]] published his book ''Rules of Mah-Jongg'', also known as the \"red book\". This was the earliest version of Mahjong known in America. Babcock had learned Mahjong while living in China. His rules simplified the game to make it easier for Americans to take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock's simplifications were abandoned.\n\nThe game has taken on a number of trademarked names, such as \"Pung Chow\" and the \"Game of Thousand Intelligences\". Mahjong nights in America often involved dressing and decorating rooms in Chinese style.<ref>[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[Made in America (book)|Made in America]]''. Harper, 1996, ch. 16.</ref> Several hit songs were recorded during the Mahjong fad, most notably \"Since Ma Is Playing Mah Jong\" by [[Eddie Cantor]].<ref name=slope/>\n\nMany variants of Mahjong developed during this period. By the 1930s, many revisions of the rules developed that were substantially different from Babcock's classical version (including some that were considered fundamentals in other variants, such as the notion of a standard hand). The most common form, which eventually became \"American Mahjong\", was most popular among [[American Jews|Jewish]] women.<ref name=slope/> Standardization came with the formation of the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937, along with the first American Mahjong rulebook, ''Maajh: The American Version of the Ancient Chinese Game'', written by NMJL's first president and co-founder, Viola L. Cecil.<ref>Tom Sloper, ''The Red Dragon & The West Wind: The Winning Guide to Official Chinese & American Mah-Jongg'', HarperCollins, 2007.''</ref>\n\nMany consider the modern American version a Jewish remake,<ref name=slope>{{cite web |url=http://www.sloperama.com/mjfaq/mjfaq19.html#t |title=Why are so many players of American mah-jongg Jewish? |publisher=Sloperama.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> as many American Mahjong players are of Jewish descent. The NMJL was founded by Jewish players and is considered a Jewish organization. In 1986, the National Mah Jongg League conducted their first Mah Jongg Cruise Tournament, in conjunction with Mah Jongg Madness. In 2010, this large scale seagoing event hosted its 25th Silver Anniversary Cruise, with players from all over the States and Canada participating.\n\nIn 1999, a second organization was formed, the American Mah Jongg Association. The AMJA currently hosts tournaments all across North America, with their signature event being at the [[Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort]] in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] before it went bankrupt and closed on October 10, 2016.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, British author Alan D. Millington revived the Chinese classical game of the 1920s with his book ''The Complete Book of Mah-jongg'' (1977). This handbook includes a formal rules set for the game.\n\n=== Current development ===\n[[File:Schoolkidsmahjong.jpg|thumb|200px|Students in the United States learning how to play Mahjong]]\nThere are many governing bodies which often host exhibition games and tournaments for modern and traditional Mahjong gaming.\n\nMahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan.<ref>Pakarnian, John, \"Game Boy:  Glossary of Japanese Gambling Games\", ''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', 22 January 2010, p. 15.</ref> As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million Mahjong players in Japan and an estimated 8,900 Mahjong parlors did \u00a5300 billion in sales.<ref>Matsutani, Minoru, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100615i1.html Mah-jongg ancient, progressive]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 15 June 2010, p. 3.</ref> Many devotees there believe the game is losing popularity and have taken efforts to revive it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} There are several [[manga]] and [[anime]] (e.g. [[Saki (manga)|Saki]] and [[Akagi (manga)|Akagi]]) devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving Mahjong.<ref>Schodt, Frederik, ''Manga!

Newer units can connect with other arcade machines across the Internet.\n\n[[Mahjong culture]] is still deeply ingrained in the Chinese community. [[Sam Hui]] wrote [[Cantopop|Cantopop songs]] using Mahjong as their themes, and [[Hong Kong]] movies have often included scenes of Mahjong games. Many gambling movies have been filmed in Hong Kong, and a recent subgenre is the Mahjong movie.\nAlthough the popularity of the game in China is still big, since 1949, Mahjong was frown upon by the government because is seen as a means of [[Gambling in China|gambling]] addiction, an issue that the government always sought to tackle.<ref>{{Cite web|title = China unveils restrictive new video game content guidelines|url = https://www.theburnin.com/lifestyle/china-video-game-censorship/|website = The Burn-In|access-date = 2019-08-05}}</ref>\n\nProlonged playing of Mahjong may trigger [[epilepsy|epileptic seizures]] according to a 2007 study.<ref>{{citation | title = Mah-jong\u2013induced seizures: case reports and review of twenty-three patients | url = http://www.hkmj.org/article_pdfs/hkm0708p314.pdf |author1=Richard S.K.

For example, players will try to find seats with the best [[Feng Shui]] or wear their lucky clothing or trinkets. Some believe that specific pieces (one dot for example) bode bad luck if received in their opening hand<ref>{{cite web|last=Lam|first=Desmond|title=Chinese Gambling Superstitions and Taboos|url=http://www.urbino.net/articles.cfm?specificArticle=Chinese%20Gambling%20Superstitions%20and%20Taboos}}</ref>\n\nMore elaborated superstitions in Mahjong range from those found in the game poker, like not counting one's wins and losses, to the comical, like changing one's undergarments after a loss.

It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Southeast Asia]]). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have also become popular in Western countries.

Ancient game enjoys continued popularity|url=http://thecourier.com/life-news/2016/06/23/mahjong/|work=The Courier}}</ref> Similar to the Western card game [[rummy]], Mahjong is a [[game of skill]], strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.\n\nThe game is played with a set of 144 [[Mahjong tiles|tiles]] based on [[Chinese characters]] and [[chinese culture|symbols]], although some regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four [[#Melds|melds]] (or sets) and a pair (eye). A player can also win with a small class of special hands. There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, how a piece is robbed from another player, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and Honors (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Despite these similarities, there are many regional variations to the rules including rather different scoring systems, criteria for legal winning hands, and even private table rules which distinguish some variations as notably different styles of mahjong.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn Chinese, the game was originally called {{lang|zh|\u9ebb\u96c0}} ({{zh|hp=m\u00e1qu\u00e8}}){{mdash}}meaning [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]{{mdash}}which is still used in some southern dialects. It is said that the clacking of tiles during shuffling resembles the chattering of sparrows. It has also been suggested that the name came from an evolution of an earlier card game called [[Madiao]] which mahjong tiles were adapted from.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete book of Mah-Jongg|last=Millington|first=A. D.|date=1977|publisher=A. Barker|isbn=0213166224|location=London|oclc=3069655}}</ref> Most [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin-speaking]] Chinese now call the game {{lang|zh|\u9ebb\u5c07|}} (''m\u00e1ji\u00e0ng''). Its name is similar in other languages, except in [[Thai language|Thai]], where it is called \u0e44\u0e1e\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e01 (''phai nok krachok''), a [[calque]] meaning \"sparrow cards.\"<ref>https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/28815/1/10672983.pdf</ref>\n\n== General rules ==\n[[File:Mahjong tiles on angle.jpg|thumb|A set of Mahjong tiles]]\n\nWhile mahjong itself has many variants, various game rules and mechanics are generally \"universal\".  Variations between mahjong forms rests on which game features are used or not.  Players of one form of mahjong may be able to learn another without too much difficulty, compared to an individual who has never played.\n\n=== Game pieces and accessories ===\n{{Main|Mahjong tiles}}\n\nOld Hong Kong Mahjong is played with a standard set of Mahjong tiles (though cards may be used). Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal), and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to hold the tiles, especially if they are larger or smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape.\n\nA set of Mahjong tiles usually has at least 136 tiles (most commonly 144); however, sets originating from the United States or Southeast Asia will probably have more. Mahjong tiles are split into 3 categories: Suits, Honors, and Bonuses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Mahjong tile count per set\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n!

The suits are bamboos, dots, and characters. There are 4 identical copies of each simples tile totaling 108 simples tiles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=9|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Simples\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|}\nThe bamboo suit is also known as \"sticks\" or \"bams\" suit; the first tile usually has a bird (traditionally, a peacock or sparrow) instead of a single bamboo. The dots suit is also known as the \"wheels\", \"circles\", \"balls\", \"stones\", '\"marbles\" or \"coins\" suit. The characters suit is also known as the \"cracks\" or \"numbers\" suit since the top characters are numbers in the Chinese orthography, and the bottom characters (in [[traditional Chinese characters]]) are the Chinese orthography of \"ten thousand\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.righto.com/chart.html |title=Mah Jongg Tiles and Names |author=Shirriff, Ken |publisher=righto.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Honors tiles ====\nThere are two different sets of Honors tiles: Winds and Dragons. The Winds are East, South, West, and North. In Mahjong, East (not North) is the beginning. The Dragons are Red, Green, and White. The white dragon has a blue or black frame on the face of the piece or in some sets is entirely blank and are typically known as \u767d\u677f (b\u00e1ib\u0103n) \"whiteboard\". These tiles have no numerical sequence like the simples (for example the bamboo pieces number 1 to 9). Like the simples, there are four identical copies of each Honors tile, for a total of 28 Honors tiles.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Winds\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n|-\n|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|width=\"50%\"|\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dragons\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n|-\n|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Bonus tiles ====\nThere are two sets of Bonus tiles: Flowers and Seasons. The flower and season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game. When drawn, the Bonus tile is not added into a player's hand but are instead set aside and kept near the player's other tiles for scoring purposes should they win the hand, and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the Bonus tile.\n\nIn addition, unlike the Simple and Honors tiles, there is only a single tile of each Bonus tile, so there are a total of four flower and four season tiles in the set. The tiles have a different artistic rendering of a specific type of flower or season.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flowers\n! No !!

There is no relation between the bonus tile \"bamboo\" flower and the bamboo suit of simple tiles (ex. 2 bamboo). In traditional Chinese culture, the [[Four Gentlemen]] are the plum (winter), orchid (spring), bamboo (summer), and chrysanthemum (autumn) which are regarded as the representative plants of those seasons, but people regard it as plum blossom (spring), orchid (summer), chrysanthemum (autumn) and bamboo (winter) now.\n\n=== Choosing table positions and first dealer ===\n[[File:Chinese dice.jpg|thumb|Chinese dice]]\nThe dealer is chosen by various means. For example, each player throws dice with the highest count taking the dealer position, second-highest taking south etc. Or one player may place one tile of each wind face down and shuffle them. Each player randomly select one of these tiles and these tiles dictate their wind position. Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) at the table in positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South, across is West, and the left is North. The order of play is traditionally counter-clockwise.\n\n=== Hands, rounds, and matches ===\n[[File:Tion-Mahjong.JPG|thumb|right|Cubic dealer and prevailing wind marker.]]\nA match consists of four rounds, each representing a \"prevailing wind,\" starting with East. Once the first round is completed, a second round begins with South as the prevailing wind, and so on. Wind position is significant in that it affects the scoring of the game. A Mahjong set with Winds in play will usually include a separate prevailing wind marker (typically a die marked with the Wind characters in a holder).\n\nIn each round at least four hands are played, with each player taking the position of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counterclockwise (though players do not physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.)\n\nWhenever a player in the East position (dealer) wins a hand, or if there is no winner (a draw or \"goulash hand\"), an extra hand is played with the same seating positions and prevailing wind as in the previous hand. This means that a match may potentially have no limit to the number of hands played (though some players will set a limit of three consecutive hands allowed with the same seat positions and prevailing wind).\n\nExample of games:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of a standard 16 hand game with two extra hands played<br/>(per no-winner-hand (goulash) and per east winning hand)\n!

By convention all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down as soon as possible to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.\n\n====Stacking tiles====\n\nEach player then stacks a row of 18 tiles, two tiles high in front of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then push each side of their stack together to form a square wall.\n\n[[File:Mahjong table.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Walls with slight diagonal offset and player positions marked with cardinal directions, including the dealer (E), along with counting order]]\nRegular players usually place their stacks in a slightly diagonal position (about 20 to 30 degrees anti-clockwise); the right end of their stack is pushed slightly further in to the centre of the table to meet almost the middle of the stack of the player on the right. This creates a smaller square wall the length of about half of each stack, with walls extended away from each corner of the square. The diagonally positioned stacks and a smaller square creates a bigger space for players' tiles and also makes an ergonomic position for drawing tiles from the stack.\n\n====Drawing tiles====\n\nThe dealer throws three dice in the square wall and sums up the total. Counting anti-clockwise so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to increase randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.\n\nUsing the same total on the dice (or the total of the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend to the left side player's stack.) This determines the location where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in anti-clockwise order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand.\n\nDealing does not have to be strictly this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may flip over when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the dealer penalised points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player who the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must take it as his/her 14th piece) or other house rules.\n\nEach player now sets aside any Flowers or Seasons they may have drawn and takes turns to draw replacement piece(s) from the wall in the anti-clockwise direction. If a player gets any Flowers or Seasons tiles in the replacement draw, the players must wait for the next turn to draw replacement tiles.\n\n[[File:Mahjong 13th piece draw.svg|thumb|left|While drawing the 13th piece to complete the initial hand, the dealer (E) will typically also draw a 14th piece (both highlighted in blue) to initiate the game.]]\n\n====Game play starts====\nThe dealer draws a piece from the wall in clockwise direction, adding it to their hand. Typically, this draw is performed during the initial deal to speed up play. If this does not complete a legal hand, the dealer then discards a piece (throwing it into the middle of the wall with no particular order in mind).\n\n=== Rules ===\n[[File:Lanzhou-019.JPG|right|thumb|Local play on the street in [[Lanzhou]] ]]\n\nEach player in turn, in counterclockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall; as long as the tile drawn is not one of the Bonus tiles, the player proceeds to discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out \"Mahjong\" while revealing their hand.\n\nThere are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:\n#A Bonus tile (Flower or Season) is drawn\n#A meld (Pong, Kong, or Chow) is made from a discard\n#Going Mahjong (declaring a winning hand)\n#Robbing a Kong\n\nDuring play, each player's hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a Kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.\n\n==== Legal hand ====\nA winning hand consists of 14 tiles. Since players always have 13 tiles in their hand during play, they must win by either drawing a piece from the wall that completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning from the wall\") or claiming a discard from another player which completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning by discard\"). The winning hand is made of four ''melds'' (a specific pattern of three pieces) and the ''eyes'' (a pair of identical pieces). The exceptions to this rule are the special hands listed below.\n\nMost players play with a table minimum, meaning a winning hand must score a minimum number of points (which can be seen in the scoring section). In Hong Kong Mahjong the most common point set is three but can be higher or lower depending on house rules.\n\n==== Melds ====\n'''Melds''' are groups of tiles within the player's hand, consisting of either a ''Pong'' (three identical tiles), a ''Kong'' (four identical tiles), a ''Chow'' (three Simple tiles all of the same suit, in numerical sequence), or ''Eyes'' (two identical tiles needed in a winning hand). Melds may be formed by drawing a tile from the wall, or by seizing another player's discard. There are rules governing which player has priority for a discard, and whether the meld should be exposed (displayed to all players) or remain concealed, depending on the manner in which the meld is formed.\n\n* '''Pongs''' are a set of three identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]]\n\nYou may form a Pong with any Simple or Honors tile. Bonus tiles (Flowers or Seasons) cannot be used to form a Pong because they are set aside and there are not three identical bonus tiles in the set. The tiles must be identical (you cannot mix suits). A Pong may either be concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing another player's discard).\n* '''Kong''' is a complete set of four identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]]\n\nConsider a Kong the same as a Pong with an additional tile to make a complete set of four. There are three ways to form a Kong.\n:# ''Concealed Kong'' \u2013 If a player holds three matching tiles (concealed Pong) and upon drawing a tile completes a set of four they may declare a Kong. They do so by revealing the meld and placing two pieces in the middle face up and two pieces on the ends face down.\n:# ''Exposed Kong'' \u2013 If a player can use a discarded tile to complete three matching tiles (concealed Pong) in their hand, he can take the piece and reveal an \"exposed kong\" or \"melded kong\". The player reveals his three pieces face up and places the stolen discard on top of the middle tile, or face down next to the three other face up pieces.\n:# ''Exposed Kong from Exposed Pong'' \u2013 If a player already has a melded Pong and then later in the game draws the fourth piece from the wall, he may announce (then or later in the game) a Kong by placing the fourth tile on top of the middle piece of the melded Pong, or all four tiles placed face up in a row. If a Pong has been melded a player cannot steal the 4th piece if another player discards it, it must be drawn.\n\nWhenever a Kong is formed, that player must draw an extra tile from the end of the wall and then discard a tile. The fourth piece of a Kong is not considered as one of the 13 tiles a player must always have in their hand. A Kong may not be formed from Bonus tiles (Flowers/Seasons), since the set does not include four identical tiles. Kongs are worth collecting to score more points and deprive opponents of the opportunity to obtain specific tiles.\n* '''Chow''' is a meld of three suited tiles in sequence. For example:\n\n[[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]]\n\nThe meld must be in absolute numerical sequence and all in the same suit. Players cannot skip numbers or meld from the 8 or 9 to 1 or 2. Honors tiles cannot be used to make Chows because they have no numerical value, and Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons) also cannot be used to make a Chow.\n\nA player can steal a discard to form a Chow only from the player whose turn was immediately before theirs; however, a player forming a Chow from a seized piece has the lowest priority for that tile. Any other player who needs that tile to make a Pong, make a Kong, or to win may seize that piece instead. Like the Pong, the Chow is either concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing the prior player's discard).\n* '''Eyes''' (also known as a pair) are two identical tiles which are an essential part of a legal winning hand. A piece cannot be stolen (melded) to form a pair of eyes unless the player simultaneously completes a legal winning hand.<ref>Lo, Amy (2001). ''The Book of Mahjong: An Illustrated Guide''. North Clarendon, VT: [[Tuttle Publishing|Tuttle]], p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-8048-3302-8}}.</ref>\n\nFor example:\n\n[[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]] [[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]]\n\n[[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]]\n\n==== Interruption of play ====\nThe regular anti-clockwise order of turns may be interrupted for four events:\n\n===== 1. Flower or Season =====\nWhenever a player draws a flower or season, it is announced and then placed to the side (it is not considered a part of the 13-tile hand, but in the event that player wins, he may earn bonus points for them) and the last tile of the wall is drawn as a replacement tile so that the player has the 14 pieces needed before their discard. This may happen successively in a player's turn.\n\n===== 2. Melding another player's discard =====\nWhen a player discards a tile, other players may steal the tile to complete a meld. Stealing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages (being forced to reveal part of one's hand to other players and not being able to change the meld once declared).\n\nWhen a meld (''Pong'', ''Kong,'' or ''Chow'') is declared through a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and expose the meld by placing the three (or four) tiles face up. The player must then discard a tile, and play continues to the right. If the player who melds a discard is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues anti-clockwise from the player who declared the meld.\n\nIf multiple players call for a discarded tile, priority for the discard depends on the declared action of the player stealing the discard.\n\n* # Highest priority goes to the player who needs the discarded tile to win the hand. A player may take the tile to win the hand from any other player.\n\n* # Next priority goes to the player who declares a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' using the discard. A player who calls for a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' may take the discard from any other player. Only one player can be in this position because there are only four of any tile in a Mahjong set.\n\n* # Last priority goes to the player who declares a Chow using the discard. Players may only call for a ''Chow'' from the discard of the player immediately prior to them, unless the tile is the final one required to complete the hand.\n\n===== 3. Winning a hand =====\nThe act of winning a hand interrupts play to assess the validity of the hand won.  Upon confirmation, the player is awarded the hand's value per the specific game's rule.\n\n======From a discard======\nIf at any point in the game a player can use another player's discard to complete a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they declare a win and reveal their winning hand. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If more than one player can use a discard to win the hand, multiple ways can handle the situation based on agreed table rules: Either the players count the points they would win with the discard and the winner is the one with the higher score, the winner is simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn, or multiple players may be granted the win simultaneously.\n\n======From the wall======\nAlternatively, a player may also win by drawing a tile that completes a legal hand. This is called \"winning from the wall\". In Hong Kong mahjong, winning from the wall doubles the number of base points each loser must pay.\n\n======False Mahjong======\nTechnically, the declaration for winning a hand may be done at anytime.  However, the player must have a complete and legal hand.  Otherwise, the win declaration is penalized.  The penalty depends on table rules. The player may forfeit points to the other players. Another potential penalty is the player who called out the false mahjong must play the rest of the hand with their tiles face up on the table so other players can see them (open hand).  Some methods apply the penalty at the end of the entire game.  Again, the table rules dictate the enforcement of the penalty.\n\n===== 4. Robbing a Kong =====\nA rarely occurring and high-scoring feature of Hong Kong Mahjong is a move called robbing the Kong. If a player declares a Kong (either by melding it or adding a fourth piece to a Pong to form a Kong or declaring a concealed Kong) but another player can use that piece to complete a hand, the completing player takes priority to go Mahjong (win the hand) and may steal that piece from the player who intended to declare the Kong.\n\n==== Examples of winning hands ====\nBelow are two examples of winning hands. A winning hand must consist of four melds (Pongs, Kongs, or Chows) and a pair (eyes) and must also score the agreed table minimum.\n\n: [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] \u2013 [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n''Hand formed with four Pongs and the eyes (pair) of East wind. Only bamboo is used (no other simples), scoring extra points (clean hand). No chows are used (an all Pong/Kong hand scores extra points).''\n\n: [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt2-.svg|25px|2 Circle]] [[File:MJt3-.svg|25px|3 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]] [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]]\n''A high-scoring hand formed using only circles, known as a pure hand. Hand is made of Chows, Pongs and the eyes of circles.''\n\nMost players include table variations in their games, of which some non-standard are included. The hands of ''seven different pairs'' and ''13 orphans'' are examples which do not have four melds and the eyes. They are described in more detail below.\n\n==== Repeated hands ====\n\nIf the dealer wins the hand, he will remain the dealer and an extra hand is played in addition to the minimum 16 hands in a match.\n\nAn extra hand is also played if there is no winner by the time all the tiles in the wall have been drawn. When there is no winner it is known as a \"goulash hand\". Depending on table rules, the winner of the next game may take an agreed number of points from each player, carrying over the points from the non-winning hand to the winning one. If there are two or three goulash hands in a row then the winner would collect a considerable number of points from each player on top of their scoring hand. Because extra hands may be played every time a dealer wins or if there is a goulash hand, a match of 16 hands can easily become a match of 20 or even much more.\n\nAs table rules add a large amount of flexibility for players, they can choose to disregard the rule of extra hands and pass on the dealership regardless of who wins or if it results in a goulash hand. This puts a maximum estimated limit on the game duration and provides some amount of predictability.\n\n====Rhythm of play====\nPlayers may agree on table rules if the pace of the game is brisk or leisurely. For brisk games players may agree that a couple seconds after a discard are allowed for a \"window of opportunity\" before the next player picks up from the wall. Usually it is agreed once the next player has waited the duration of the \"window of opportunity\" and draws a tile from the wall, the previous discard is lost and cannot be claimed.\n\n=== Scoring ===\n{{Main|Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules}}\n\nOld Hong Kong scoring is relatively simple. There is only one winner (or if there is a draw the hand is replayed). The winner must have a legal hand that meets the minimum faan points agreed to in advance (not including any bonus points). Only the winner scores, the other players pay the winner various sums. After each hand ends, the winner counts all of his or her faan points.\n* faan points depend on:\n** the composition of the entire hand\n** how the hand was won\n** bonus tiles\n** special patterns\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum faan value agreed in advance (often 3). Bonus tiles and a few other elements are not included in the minimum faan value a player needs to form a legal winning hand. (i.e. in a three faan minimum game, if a player has two faan points and one bonus point, the player has not met the proper requirements to win and will need to gain another faan point before calling mahjong. Though the bonus points cannot be included in the minimum points needed to win, they are included in the overall score after a player wins\n* The other players do not score their hand. Once the winner has added his or her points (faan points plus bonus points) they must be converted into base points (the chart is below). These base points represent how much the opponents pay to the winner\n* Players then pay the winner (in money or when not gambling with \"chips or points\") based on three factors:\n** the base points (faan points and bonus points converted into a payment unit)\n** if the player won from the wall (doubles the points)\n** if the player was the dealer (doubles the points)\n\n==== Concealed vs. revealed meld and hand====\n\nA concealed meld is one that contains no tiles stolen from another players discard. A concealed hand is one made up of only concealed melds. Many variations distinguish between a concealed hand (winning from the wall) and a semi concealed hand (the last tile is a stolen discard). In most mahjong variations having a concealed hand can be valuable in scoring. Hong Kong mahjong doesn't award concealed melds/hands as generously as others. Concealed hands only the case with a few limit hands or half-limit hands (thirteen orphans, heavenly gates, four concealed pongs) as well as a complete hand (seven pairs) and over several melds (three concealed pongs).\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|+Meld summary\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Meld Type !! rowspan=2 | Quantity !! colspan=3 | Eligible tiles !! colspan=2 | When completed by ...\n|-\n!

Some examples of scoring include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sample faan scoring\n! Type !!

How points are reckoned is agreed by players beforehand. For example, they can keep a tally, exchange chips or pay one another with money. The faan value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the points the losers pay the winner. The table is progressive, doubling the number of base points when reaching a certain faan point target. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table, for other tables see [[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Base points (Old Hong Kong Simplified) \n! faan points !!  Base points\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 3 || 1 \n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3;\"\n| 4 || rowspan=3 | 2\n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3;\"\n| 5\n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3;\"\n| 6\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 7 || rowspan=3 | 4\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 8\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 9\n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3\"\n| 10+ || 8 (limit)\n|}\n\nThis table is based on play where 3 faan is the minimum needed in order to win with a legal hand. If a player has 3 faan then his hand is worth one base point. A winning hand with 9 faan is worth four base points. Losing players must give the winning player the value of these base points. The following special cases result in doubled base points:\n* If the winner wins from the wall his base points are doubled\n* If the hand was won by discard, the discarder doubles the amount he owes the winner\n* If the winner is east all losers double the basepoints\n* If east player is a losing player he pays double the points to the winner.\n\nIf two of these criteria apply to any player, he must double and then redouble the points owed to the winner.\n\n===== Examples =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n!Hand !!

These are exceptional hands, difficult to obtain and are very valuable in point scoring. As many table rules put a limit on the number of points a winners hand can score, full limit hands score that maximum. Table rules dictate if these rare and special hands are allowed, which ones, and the limit for scoring. A common scoring limit is 64 points, which is the highest base points doubled twice. A winner receives the scoring limit from each player without any doubling.\n\nSome limit hands by necessity must be completely concealed (not discards used) or semi-concealed (the only discard used is the one needed to go mahjong). This includes the 13 orphans, 4 concealed pongs, heavenly hand and earthly hand. It is usually expected that the heavenly gates hand be concealed or semi-concealed. As for the dragon limit hands and the great winds, table rules dictate if the hand must be concealed or not. Some table rules claim that a semi-concealed hand (winning from a discard) scores a half-limit.\n\nSome groups also play with the \"great Flowers\" rule. If a player picks up all four Flowers and all four Seasons during their hand, they instantly win the hand and receive the maximum points from all of the players. This is exceptionally rare.\n\nIn all the hands that require pongs, each pong can be replaced by the corresponding kong.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Limit Hands (Maximum number of fan agreed)\n! width=10% | Hand !! width=90% | Explanation with example\n|-\n!

It does not allow multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Competition Mahjong scoring rules|Competition Mahjong]]''' is an international standard founded by All-China Sports Federation in July 1998 that some Mahjong societies have adopted for competition play and in some cases for all play.\n* '''Sichuan Mahjong''' is a growing variety, particularly in southern China, disallowing chi melds, and using only the suited tiles. Play continues until a loser is decided or a draw. It can be played very quickly.\n* '''Wuhan Mahjong''' is growing rapidly and become popular in southern China. It is different from other parts of China such that it has a tile that can be used as everything called Laizi ({{lang|zh|\u8d56\u5b50}}), and the player has to have a set of special two tiles, namely two, five, eight, as prerequisite for winning. Another variation has become the new trend, and is called {{lang|zh|\u7ea2\u4e2d\u8d56\u5b50\u6760}}. Special tiles need to be discarded.\n* '''Changsha Mahjong''' is widely played in [[Hunan]] Province. Like Wuhan Mahjong, players need to obtain special Jong consisting of only tiles of two, five or eight. Changsha Mahjong forbids using winds and some special tiles, those tiles are first drawn out from the table when playing. Winners each round get a special drawing session for bonuses, usually doubling the score.\n* '''Tianjin Mahjong''' using normally seven jokers, with special scoring such as ''joker-free'', ''joker-waiting-pair'', ''catch-5'', ''dragon'', ''joker-suited-dragon''.\n* '''Shenyang Mahjong''' using 13 hands in a game, and Shenyang Mahjong has a really fast speed on playing, which allegedly might be said in some regard to perhaps match the personality of north-east people in China. Also in Shenyang Mahjong, the player must to have Bamboos, Characters, Circles and number one or nine in his hand. In addition, the players have to Pong before they Chow, so there is no chance to win even if some players win at the first time they have their hands in hand.\n* '''[[Taiwanese Mahjong]]''' is the variety prevalent in Taiwan and involves hands of sixteen tiles (as opposed to the thirteen-tile hands in other versions), features bonuses for dealers and recurring dealerships, and allows multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Filipino Mahjong]]''', sixteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. Honors are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Fujian Mahjong''', thirteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. No dragons. Winds are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Taiyuan Lisi Mahjong''', or ''Lisi'' (Raise 4; {{lang|zh|[[:zh:\u592a\u539f\u7acb\u56db\u9ebb\u5c06]]}}), the players must win with the first four blocks drawn which are placed separately in front of other. These four blocks cannot be touched until the player has a ready hand.\n* '''[[Singaporean mahjong|Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong]]''' are two similar variants with much in common with Hong Kong mahjong. Unique elements of Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong are the use of four animal bonus tiles (cat, mouse, cockerel, and centipede) as well as certain alternatives in the scoring rules, which allow payouts midway through the game if certain conditions (such as a ''kong'') are met. Melds may also be presented in a form different to most other variations.\n* '''South African Mahjong''' is a variant of Cantonese Mahjong. It is very similar in terms of game play and follows most of the rules and regulations of Cantonese Mahjong. However, there are some minor differences in scoring, e.g. the limit on the maximum points a hand can be rewarded is three or four ''fan'' depending on the ''house'' rules. A chicken hand (gai wu) is normally considered a value hand. Depending on the ''house'' rules ''Flowers'' may also be used to boost scoring.\n* '''Thai Mahjong''' has eight specialized jokers with eight extra flowers and eight animals for a total of 168 tiles.\n* '''Vietnamese Mahjong''' has the same eight specialized jokers but with only eight different extra flowers for a total of 160 tiles. Modern variant triplicates or quadruplicates the jokers for a total of 176 or 184 tiles.\n* '''Japanese classical Mahjong''' is still used in tournaments. It is closer to the Chinese classical scoring system but only the winner scores. \n* '''[[Japanese Mahjong]]''' is a standardized form of Mahjong in Japan and is also found prevalently in video games. In addition to scoring changes, the rules of ''[[Japanese Mahjong#R\u012bchi|r\u012bchi]]'' (ready hand) and ''[[Japanese Mahjong scoring rules#Dora|dora]]'' (bonus tiles) are unique highlights of this variant. In addition, tile discards are specifically arranged in front of each player by discard order, to take discarded tiles into account during play. Some rules replace some number 5 tiles with red tiles so that they can eventually get more value.<!--A standard rule set for Japanese mahjong was designed in 2008 by the European Mahjong Association,<ref>[http://gamenoodle.blogspot.com/2012/09/mahjongs.html European Mahjong Association]</ref> in cooperation with the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, in order to organize the first European Riichi Mahjong Championship in Hanover, Germany, June 2008. Danish player Thomas Kragh was the winner.<ref>[http://www.mahjongnews.com/en/index.php/ec-riichi/54-ec-2008/104-rmc2008.html]</ref>-->\n* '''Korean Mahjong''' is unique in many ways and is an excellent version for three players. One suit is omitted completely (usually the Bamboo set or 2\u20138 of bamboo) as well as the Seasons. The scoring is simpler and the play is faster. No melded chows are allowed and concealed hands are common. Riichi (much like its Japanese cousin) is an integral part of the game as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:korean-overview|title=Korean Mahjong Rules - Mahjong Wiki (\u9ebb\u5c06\u7ef4\u57fa)|website=mahjong.wikidot.com}}</ref>\n* '''Pussers bones''' is a fast-moving variant developed by sailors in the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. It uses an alternative vocabulary, such as ''Eddie'', ''Sammy'', ''Wally'', and ''Normie'', instead of ''East'', ''South'', ''West'', and ''North'' respectively.\n* '''Western classical Mahjong''' is a descendant of the version of Mahjong introduced by Babcock to America in the 1920s. Today, this term largely refers to the \"[[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson]]\" rules, used in the U.S. military, and other similar American-made variants that are closer to the Babcock rules.\n* '''[[American mahjong|American Mahjong]]''' is a form of Mahjong standardized by the National Mah Jongg League<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org |title=National Mahjjong League |publisher=Nationalmahjonggleague.org |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> and the American Mah-Jongg Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amja.net/|title=The American Mah-Jongg Association \u2013 news, products and tournaments \u2013 Join us for our next American Mah-Jongg tournament or cruise!.}}</ref> It uses joker tiles, the Charleston, plus melds of five or more tiles, treats bonus tiles as Honors, and eschews the Chow and the notion of a standard hand. Legal hands are changed annually. Purists claim that this makes American Mahjong a separate game. In addition, the NMJL and AMJA variations, which have minor scoring differences, are commonly referred to as ''Mahjongg'' or ''mah-jongg'' (with 2 Gs, often hyphenated).\n\n'''[[Three player mahjong|Three-player Mahjong]]''' (or 3-''ka'') is a simplified three-person Mahjong that involves hands of 13 tiles (with a total of 84 tiles on the table) and may use jokers depending on the variation. Any rule set can be adapted for three players; however, this is far more common and accepted in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. It usually eliminates one suit entirely, or tiles 2\u20138 in one suit leaving only the terminals. It needs fewer people to start a game and the turnaround time of a game is short\u2014hence, it is considered a fast game. In some versions there is a jackpot for winning in which whoever accumulates a point of 10 is considered to hit the jackpot or whoever scores three hidden hands first. The Malaysian and Korean versions drop one wind and may include a seat dragon.<ref>The Mahjong Wiki.[http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:three-player Three-player mahjong].

The edges are raised to prevent tiles from sliding off and the surface is covered in felt to limit wear on the tiles. Automatic dealing tables, often used for high stakes playing and tournaments, are able to shuffle tiles, build walls, and randomize dice. It is an elaborate device built into a table which uses two alternating sets of tiles. It prepares one wall while the players play one hand. After the hand is finished the tiles are dropped into the table and a new wall raises upwards. In theory the table should avoid cheating (by stacking the deck and or using loaded dice).\n\n====Tiles====\nThe following chart shows the most generic set of tiles \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=11|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!colspan=2|8\n!colspan=2|9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Suits\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=4|Honors/Bonus\n!colspan=4|Winds\n!colspan=3|Dragons\n!colspan=4|Bonus\n|-\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n!colspan=2|Seasons\n!colspan=2|Flowers\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJh1-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh2-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh5-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh6-.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|[[File:MJh3-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh4-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh7-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh8-.svg|25px]]\n|}\n\nThere are variations that feature specific use of tiles. Some three-player versions remove the North Wind and one Chinese provincial version has no Honors. Korean Mahjong removes the bamboo suit or at least its numbers 2\u20138 so that terminals can be used. Japanese Mahjong rarely uses Flowers or Seasons. The Seasons are removed in Korean Mahjong, while many Southeast Asian sets have more flower series.\n\n==== Wild cards and jokers ====\n\nSome mahjong variants accept wildcard tiles. The wildcard tiles are decided at the beginning of the game by choosing one random tile. The wild card could be the immediately following tile on the wall, after distributing tiles to all players, or it could also be separately decided by a dice throw. Wildcard tiles can't be discarded and can only replace tiles in Chows. Wildcard tiles cannot replace tiles in Pongs and Kongs. For example, if a character 4 is chosen, then character 4 and the next sequential tile, character 5, can be used as wild cards in this round. (When the wildcard indicator is chosen and exposed, only 3 tiles remain of the same denomination, so the next tile in the suit will also be used as a wildcard, adding to 7 wildcard tiles for 4 players.) Also, if a tile numbered 9 is the indicator, the suits circle back to 1, after 9. Thus, the number 9 and 1 are wild cards.\n\nAlso, if the chosen tile is not in the suited tiles, the wild cards are decided in rules:\n[[File:Joker-vietnammj.JPG|right|thumb|Top eight are Vietnamese jokers. Bottom four are Chinese.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Wild card tile chosen !! Another wildcard\n|-\n| East || South\n|-\n| South || West\n|-\n| West || North\n|-\n| North || East\n|-\n| Red Dragon || Green Dragon\n|-\n| Green Dragon || White Dragon\n|-\n| White Dragon || Red Dragon\n|}\n\nThe bonus tiles are not available for wild cards.\n\nA feature of several variations of Mahjong, most notably in American mahjong, is the notion of some number of Joker tiles. They may be used as a wild card: a substitute for any tile in a hand, or, in some variations, only tiles in melds. Another variation is that the Joker tile may ''not'' be used for melding. Depending on the variation, a player may replace a Joker tile that is part of an exposed meld belonging to any player with the tile it represents.\n\nRules governing discarding Joker tiles also exist; some variations permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of any tile, and others only permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of the previously discarded tile (or the absence of a tile, if it is the first discard).\n\nJoker tiles may or may not affect scoring, depending on the variation. Some special hands may require the use of Joker tiles (for example, to represent a \"fifth tile\" of a certain suited or honor tile).\n\nIn American Mahjong, it is illegal to pass Jokers during the Charleston.\n\n===== Flowers =====\nJapanese rule sets discourage the use of Flowers and Seasons. Korean rules and three-player Mahjong in the Korean/Japanese tradition use only Flowers. In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of four animals are used. The rule set includes a unique function in that players who get two specific animals get a one-time immediate payout from all players. In Taiwanese Mahjong, getting all eight Flowers and Seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.\n\nFour of the flower tiles represent the [[Four Gentlemen|four noble plants]] of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] reckoning:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc22 }}[[Prunus mume|plum]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc23 }}[[orchid]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc25 }}[[chrysanthemum]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc24 }}[[bamboo]].\n\n[[File:MJh5-.svg|50px|Plum]] [[File:MJh6-.svg|50px|Orchid]] [[File:MJh7-.svg|50px|Chrysanthemum]] [[File:MJh8-.svg|50px|Bamboo]]\n\nThe other 4 flower tiles (or season tiles) represent Seasons:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc26 }} [[spring (season)|spring]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc27 }} [[summer]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc28 }} [[autumn]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc29 }}[[winter]].\n\n[[File:MJh1-.svg|50px|Spring]] [[File:MJh2-.svg|50px|Summer]] [[File:MJh3-.svg|50px|Autumn]] [[File:MJh4-.svg|50px|Winter]]\n\nThese animal tiles are used in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and local variations. They represent the [[cat]], [[mouse]], [[rooster]] and [[centipede]]. Like flower tiles, they also function as bonus tiles. However, as they have no corresponding seat position, any player who draws one of these gets a bonus point.\n\n[[File:MJat1-.svg|50px|Cat]] [[File:MJat2-.svg|50px|Mouse]] [[File:MJat3-.svg|50px|Rooster]] [[File:MJat4-.svg|50px|Centipede]]\n\n===== Walls =====\nAll tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Each player then stacks a row of tiles two tiles high in front of him, the length of the row depending on the number of tiles in use:\n* 136 tiles: 17 stacks for each player\n** Suits of circles, bamboos, and characters + winds + dragons\n* 144 tiles: 18 stacks for each player\n* 148 tiles: 19 stacks for dealer and player opposite, 18 for rest\n* 152 tiles: 19 stacks for each player\n\n====Dice, markers, and counting pieces====\n[[File:Mahjong fiches.jpg|thumb|right|Mahjong counting sticks: Left are Chinese while the right are Japanese]]\nDepending on the variation, two or three [[dice]] are usually used to decide what part of the wall to start dealing from. They are six-sided dice, traditionally but not necessarily Chinese dice with red one and four pips.\n\nThe dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places to the side to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto), a cube with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can be placed in a hollow square (the dealer holds onto it), or a cylinder locked into frame which can be rolled to expose the wind on the top. Japanese mahjong, especially in a gambling environment, may optionally use four yakitori markers to indicate which players have not won a hand yet and has to pay a penalty.\n\nThere are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries. They range from Chinese or Japanese counting sticks (thin sticks with various dots on them to represent various points), [[jeton]]s, [[play money]], paper and pencil, or various apps on touchscreen devices used to calculate and keep scores.\n\n=== Rules ===\nJapanese and Korean Mahjong have some special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already discarded that piece, where players' discards are kept in neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.\nTaiwanese Mahjong adds three tiles to a hand requiring a 5th set to be formed, making a clean hand or all Pong hand very difficult to procure.\nAmerican Mahjong has distinctive game mechanics and the article on [[American mahjong|American Mahjong]] details these. Some differences include many special patterns, a different scoring system and the use of jokers and five-of-a-kind.\n\n==== Charleston ====\nIn the American variations it is required that, before each hand begins, a Charleston be enacted. In the first exchange, three tiles are passed to the player on one's right; in the next exchange, the tiles are passed to the player opposite, followed by three tiles passed to the left. If all players are in agreement, a second Charleston is performed; however, any player may decide to stop passing after the first Charleston is complete. The Charleston is followed by an optional pass to the player across of one, two, or three tiles. The Charleston, a distinctive feature of American Mahjong, may have been borrowed from card games such as [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].\n\n=== Hands ===\nMany variations have specific hands, some of which are common while some are optional depending on regions and players. One example is the Pure Green hand made of chows or Pongs using 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of bamboo and green dragon.\n\n==== Ready hands ====\nWhen a hand is one tile short of winning (for example: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], waiting for: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]], [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]], or [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], as [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] can be the eyes), the hand is said to be a ready hand, or more figuratively, \"on the pot\". The player holding a ready hand is said to be ''waiting'' for certain tiles. It is common to be waiting for two or three tiles, and some variations award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile Mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'', or ''13 orphans'', a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of Mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.\n\nSome variations of Mahjong, most notably Japanese and Korean ones, allow a player to declare {{nihongo||\u7acb\u76f4|r\u012bchi|sometimes known as ''reach'', as it is phonetically similar}}. A declaration of ''r\u012bchi'' is a promise that any tile drawn by the player is immediately discarded unless it constitutes a win. Standard requirements for ''r\u012bchi'' are that the hand be ''closed'' or have no melds declared (other than a concealed Kong) and that players already have points for declaration of ''r\u012bchi''. A player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and wins usually receives a point bonus for their hand directly, and a player who won with ''r\u012bchi'' also has the advantage to open the inner {{nihongo||\u30c9\u30e9|dora|from \"dra\"gon}} which leads to higher possibilities to match such a card, thus has more chance to grant additional bonus. However, a player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and loses is usually penalised in some fashion. Declaring a nonexistent ''r\u012bchi'' is also penalised in some way.\n\nIn some variations, a situation in which all four players declare a ''r\u012bchi'' is an automatic drawn game, as it reduces the game down to pure luck, i.e., who gets their needed tile first.\n\n=== Draws ===\nIf only the dead wall remains (or if no dead wall exists and the wall is depleted) and no one has won, the hand is drawn (\u6d41\u5c40 ''li\u00fa j\u00fa'', \u9ec3\u838a ''hu\u00e1ng zhu\u0101ng'', Japanese \u6d41\u5c40 ''ry\u016bkyoku''), or \"[[goulash]]ed\". A new hand begins, and depending on the variant, the Game Wind may change. For example, in most playing circles in Singapore, if there is at least one Kong when the hand is a draw, the following player of the dealer becomes the next dealer; otherwise, the dealer remains dealer.\n\nJapanese Mahjong has a special rule called {{nihongo||\u4e09\u5bb6\u548c|''sanchah\u014d''}}, which is, if three players claim the same discard in order to win, the hand is drawn. One reason for this is that there are cases in which bars of 1,000 points for declaring ''r\u012bchi'' cannot be divided by three. The rule is treated the same as \"abortive draws\".\n\n==== Abortive draws ====\nIn Japanese Mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:\n* {{nihongo||\u4e5d\u7a2e\u4e5d\u724c|Ky\u016bshu Ky\u016bhai}}: On a player's first turn when no meld has been declared yet, if a player has nine different terminal (also known as major<ref>{{cite web|last=Gregory |first=Peter |url=http://mahjongbritishrules.com/scoring/index.html |title=Tile Classification |publisher=Mahjongbritishrules.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>) or honor tiles, the player may declare the hand to be drawn (for example, [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs6-.svg|25px|6 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJw1-.svg|25px|1 Character]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf3-.svg|25px|West Wind]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]], but could also go for the nonstandard ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'' hand as well).\n* {{nihongo|Four Winds' barrier|\u56db\u98a8\u5b50\u9023\u6253|S\u016bfontsu rent\u0101}}: On the first turn without any meld declarations, if all 4 players discard the same Wind tile, the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo||\u56db\u4eba\u7acb\u76f4|Yonin r\u012bchi}}: If all four players declare ''r\u012bchi'', the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo|Four Kongs' abort|\u56db\u69d3\u6563\u4e86|S\u016bkan sanra}}: The hand is drawn when the fourth Kong is declared, unless all four Kongs were declared by a single player. Still, the hand is drawn when another player declares a fifth Kong.\n\n===Scoring===\nScoring in Mahjong involves points, with a monetary value for points agreed upon by players. Although in many variations scoreless hands are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the hand.\n\nWhile the basic rules are more or less the same throughout Mahjong, the greatest divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems. Like the rules, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese base their roots. American Mahjong generally has greatly divergent scoring rules, as well as greatly divergent general rules.\n\nBecause of the large differences between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often agree on particular scoring rules before a game.\n\n====Points====\nPoints (terminology of which differs from variation to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into scores for each player using some (typically [[exponential function|exponential]]) functions. Some criteria may be also in terms of both points and score.\n\nIn many variations the dealer receives no scoring bonus and does not maintain his turn by winning or a dead hand.\n\nIn classical Mahjong all players score points. Points are given for sets and hand composition and winning bonuses, doubled and redoubled for basic patterns. Sometimes a loser may score more points than a winner. Japanese Mahjong has a complex scoring system with several stages of scoring, rules and exceptions, evening out scores and bonus points at the end of a match. Korean Mahjong has a simple scoring system where only winner scores without any form of doubling.\n\nSome variations give points for concealed hands, in which case no melds are made except by winning on a discard.\n\nIn Old Hong Kong Mahjong:\n* Only the winner scores points.\n* Winning hands are scored by totaling the point value of each element in the hand. Points are distinct from the actual payment received from each player.\n* The winner receives points (also known as faan among some players) for:\n** individual melds,\n** the composition of the entire hand,\n** how the hand was won,\n** bonus tiles,\n** special patterns,\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum points agreed in advance (often 3).\n* Bonus points are separate from the minimum points a player needs to win.\n* If a player goes Mahjong with a legal and minimum hand, his hand is scored by adding his points and bonus points together.\n* The payment received from each player depends on three factors:\n** the point value of the hand,\n** if the player won from a discard or from the wall, and\n** if the player was the dealer or not.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Mahjong Variations\n!

The game is entirely unrelated to mahjong or its variations and is a recent invention. A two player version was published by [[Nintendo]]. The game involves stacking tiles face up in various elaborate patterns and removing uncovered matching tiles at the end of rows.\n\n== Competition ==\n[[File:wk-mahjong2002.jpg|thumb|The top 3 in the [[World Mahjong Championship]] in [[Tokyo]], October 2002. Left: John J. O'Connor (2nd place) In the middle: world champion Mai Hatsune, from Japan Right: Yuichi Ikeya (3rd place)]]\n\nIn 1998, in the interest of dissociating illegal gambling from Mahjong, the [[China State Sports Commission]] published a new set of rules, now generally referred to as Chinese Official rules or International Tournament rules (see [[Guobiao Majiang]]). The principles of the new, wholesome Mahjong are no gambling, no drinking, and no smoking. In international tournaments, players are often grouped in teams to emphasize that Mahjong from now on is considered a sport.\n\nThe new rules are highly pattern-based. The rulebook contains 81 combinations, based on patterns and scoring elements popular in classic and modern regional Chinese variants; some table practices of Japan have also been adopted. Points for flower tiles (each flower is worth one point) may not be added until the player has scored eight points. The winner of a game receives the score from the player who discards the winning tile, plus eight basic points from each player; in the case of ''zimo'' (self-drawn win), he receives the value of this round plus eight points from all players.\n\nThe new rules were first used in an international tournament in [[Tokyo]], where, in 2002, the [[2002 World Championship in Mahjong|first global tournament in Mahjong]] was organized by the Mahjong Museum, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, and the city council of Ningbo, China. One hundred players participated, mainly from Japan and China, but also from Europe and the United States. Mai Hatsune, from Japan, became the first world champion. The following year saw the first annual China Mahjong Championship, held in Hainan; the next two annual tournaments were held in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most players were Chinese; players from other nations attended as well.\n\nIn 2005, the first [[Open European Mahjong Championship]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |title=The Independent Internet Mahjong Newspaper |publisher=Mahjongnews.com |accessdate=7 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145919/http://mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |archive-date=12 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> was held in the Netherlands, with 108 players.

There were 152 participants.\n\nIn 2006, the [[World Mahjong Organization]] (WMO) was founded in [[Beijing]], China, with the cooperation of, amongst others, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee (JMOC) and the European Mahjong Association (EMA). This organization held its first [[World Mahjong Championship]] in November 2007 in the Chinese town of [[Chengdu]], attended by 144 participants from all over the world. It was won by Li Li, a Chinese student at [[Tsinghua University]]. The next World Championship took place in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the Netherlands, 27 to 29 August 2010.\n\nOther major international tournaments include the [[Mahjong International League]]'s [[World Mahjong Sports Games]] and the privately sponsored [[World Series Of Mahjong]].\n\n[[American mahjong]] tournaments are held in virtually every state\u2014the largest is in Las Vegas, Nevada twice a year, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by Mah Jongg Madness; and the annual cruise hosted by the National Mah Jongg League and Mah Jongg Madness (MJM). MJM tournaments host between 150 and 500 participants at these larger events; and there are several smaller scale, but equally successful tournaments held annually by other hosts. Prize pools are based on the number participating. Rules are based on the National Mah Jongg League standard rules.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:\u6cad\u967d\u7d19\u724c.png|thumb|Money-suited cards]]\nMahjong is based on draw-and-discard [[card games]] that were popular in 18th and 19th century China, some of which are still popular today.<ref name=Lo>{{cite book|last1=Lo|first1=Andrew|title='China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong'.

Each deck is divided into three suits of '''[[Cash (Chinese coin)|Cash]]''' or coins, '''[[String of cash coins (currency unit)|Strings]]''' of cash, and '''[[Myriad]]s''' of strings. There are nine ranks in each suit. In addition, there are three [[Wild card (card games)|wild cards]]: '''Red flower''', '''White flower''', and '''Old thousand'''. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.\n\nGames scholar [[David Parlett]] has written that the Western card games [[Conquian]] and [[Rummy]] share a common origin with Mahjong.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|year=1978|isbn=978-0-14-103787-5}}</ref> All these games involve players drawing and discarding tiles or cards to make [[Meld (cards)|melds]]. [[Khanhoo]] is an early example of such a game. The most likely ancestor to Mahjong was ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' ([[:zh:\u78b0\u548c|\u78b0\u548c]]) which was played with 120 or 150 cards.<ref name=Lo/> During the late 19th century, ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' was used interchangeably with ''m\u00e1qu\u00e8'' in both card and tile form.\n\nIt is not known when the conversion from cards to tiles took place precisely but it most likely occurred in the middle of the 19th century. The earliest surviving tile sets date to around 1870 and were acquired in [[Fuzhou]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Ningbo]].<ref name=Lo/><ref name=\"Stanwick1\">{{cite journal|last1=Stanwick|first1=Michael|title=Mahjong(g) Before Mahjong(g): Part 1|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2004|volume=32|issue=4|pages=153\u2013162|ref=Stanwick1}}</ref><ref>Sloper, Tom.

The game itself was banned during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u20131976).<ref name=\"Lo\"/> Today, it is a favorite pastime in China<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.winmahjong.com/mahjong-in-china/ |title=Mahjong in China |publisher=Win Mahjong |accessdate=29 December 2014 }}</ref> and other Chinese-speaking communities.\n\n=== Mahjong in the West ===\n[[File:28.779 SL1 s.jpg|thumb|200px|Mahjong tiles of late 19th century, a gift of [[George B.

He did not explain the dialect of the originator or region specific etymology of this information.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilkinson, W.H.|title=Chinese Origin Of Playing Cards|journal=The American Anthropologist|year=1895|volume=viii|pages=61\u201378|doi=10.1525/aa.1895.8.1.02a00070|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448960}}</ref> By 1910, there were written accounts in many languages, including [[French language|French]] and Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe game was imported to the United States in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Recalling the Craze for a Game of Chance |first=Steven |last=Heller |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 March 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/arts/artsspecial/18MAH.html?ex=1285473600&en=37c8a4976aafc929&ei=5087&WT.mc_id=AR-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M143-ROS-0410-L2&WT.mc_ev=click}}</ref> The first Mahjong sets sold in the U.S. were sold by [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] starting in 1920. It became a success in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the co-owner of the company, [[Ezra Fitch]], sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every Mahjong set they could find. Abercrombie & Fitch sold a total of 12,000 Mahjong sets.\n\nAlso in 1920, [[Joseph Park Babcock]] published his book ''Rules of Mah-Jongg'', also known as the \"red book\". This was the earliest version of Mahjong known in America. Babcock had learned Mahjong while living in China. His rules simplified the game to make it easier for Americans to take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock's simplifications were abandoned.\n\nThe game has taken on a number of trademarked names, such as \"Pung Chow\" and the \"Game of Thousand Intelligences\". Mahjong nights in America often involved dressing and decorating rooms in Chinese style.<ref>[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[Made in America (book)|Made in America]]''. Harper, 1996, ch. 16.</ref> Several hit songs were recorded during the Mahjong fad, most notably \"Since Ma Is Playing Mah Jong\" by [[Eddie Cantor]].<ref name=slope/>\n\nMany variants of Mahjong developed during this period. By the 1930s, many revisions of the rules developed that were substantially different from Babcock's classical version (including some that were considered fundamentals in other variants, such as the notion of a standard hand). The most common form, which eventually became \"American Mahjong\", was most popular among [[American Jews|Jewish]] women.<ref name=slope/> Standardization came with the formation of the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937, along with the first American Mahjong rulebook, ''Maajh: The American Version of the Ancient Chinese Game'', written by NMJL's first president and co-founder, Viola L. Cecil.<ref>Tom Sloper, ''The Red Dragon & The West Wind: The Winning Guide to Official Chinese & American Mah-Jongg'', HarperCollins, 2007.''</ref>\n\nMany consider the modern American version a Jewish remake,<ref name=slope>{{cite web |url=http://www.sloperama.com/mjfaq/mjfaq19.html#t |title=Why are so many players of American mah-jongg Jewish? |publisher=Sloperama.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> as many American Mahjong players are of Jewish descent. The NMJL was founded by Jewish players and is considered a Jewish organization. In 1986, the National Mah Jongg League conducted their first Mah Jongg Cruise Tournament, in conjunction with Mah Jongg Madness. In 2010, this large scale seagoing event hosted its 25th Silver Anniversary Cruise, with players from all over the States and Canada participating.\n\nIn 1999, a second organization was formed, the American Mah Jongg Association. The AMJA currently hosts tournaments all across North America, with their signature event being at the [[Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort]] in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] before it went bankrupt and closed on October 10, 2016.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, British author Alan D. Millington revived the Chinese classical game of the 1920s with his book ''The Complete Book of Mah-jongg'' (1977). This handbook includes a formal rules set for the game.\n\n=== Current development ===\n[[File:Schoolkidsmahjong.jpg|thumb|200px|Students in the United States learning how to play Mahjong]]\nThere are many governing bodies which often host exhibition games and tournaments for modern and traditional Mahjong gaming.\n\nMahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan.<ref>Pakarnian, John, \"Game Boy:  Glossary of Japanese Gambling Games\", ''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', 22 January 2010, p. 15.</ref> As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million Mahjong players in Japan and an estimated 8,900 Mahjong parlors did \u00a5300 billion in sales.<ref>Matsutani, Minoru, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100615i1.html Mah-jongg ancient, progressive]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 15 June 2010, p. 3.</ref> Many devotees there believe the game is losing popularity and have taken efforts to revive it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} There are several [[manga]] and [[anime]] (e.g. [[Saki (manga)|Saki]] and [[Akagi (manga)|Akagi]]) devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving Mahjong.<ref>Schodt, Frederik, ''Manga!

Newer units can connect with other arcade machines across the Internet.\n\n[[Mahjong culture]] is still deeply ingrained in the Chinese community. [[Sam Hui]] wrote [[Cantopop|Cantopop songs]] using Mahjong as their themes, and [[Hong Kong]] movies have often included scenes of Mahjong games. Many gambling movies have been filmed in Hong Kong, and a recent subgenre is the Mahjong movie.\nAlthough the popularity of the game in China is still big, since 1949, Mahjong was frown upon by the government because is seen as a means of [[Gambling in China|gambling]] addiction, an issue that the government always sought to tackle.<ref>{{Cite web|title = China unveils restrictive new video game content guidelines|url = https://www.theburnin.com/lifestyle/china-video-game-censorship/|website = The Burn-In|access-date = 2019-08-05}}</ref>\n\nProlonged playing of Mahjong may trigger [[epilepsy|epileptic seizures]] according to a 2007 study.<ref>{{citation | title = Mah-jong\u2013induced seizures: case reports and review of twenty-three patients | url = http://www.hkmj.org/article_pdfs/hkm0708p314.pdf |author1=Richard S.K.

For example, players will try to find seats with the best [[Feng Shui]] or wear their lucky clothing or trinkets. Some believe that specific pieces (one dot for example) bode bad luck if received in their opening hand<ref>{{cite web|last=Lam|first=Desmond|title=Chinese Gambling Superstitions and Taboos|url=http://www.urbino.net/articles.cfm?specificArticle=Chinese%20Gambling%20Superstitions%20and%20Taboos}}</ref>\n\nMore elaborated superstitions in Mahjong range from those found in the game poker, like not counting one's wins and losses, to the comical, like changing one's undergarments after a loss.

Like the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]], the Build engine represents its world on a [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] grid using closed 2D shapes called sectors, and uses simple flat objects called [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] to populate the world geometry with objects.\n\nThe Build engine is generally considered to be a [[2.5D]] engine since the basic world geometry is two-dimensional with an added height component, allowing each sector to have a different ceiling height and floor height.  Playing the game shows that some floors can be lower and some can be higher; same with ceilings (in relation to each other). Floors and ceilings can hinge along one of the sector's walls, resulting in a slope. With this information, the Build engine renders the world in a way that looks [[3-D computer graphics|three-dimensional]], unlike modern game engines that create actual 3D environments.\n\nThough the Build engine achieved most of its fame as a result of powering the [[1996 in video gaming|1996]] [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', it was also used for many other games. The \"Big Three\" Build engine games are generally considered to be ''Duke Nukem 3D'', ''[[Shadow Warrior (1997 video game)|Shadow Warrior]]'', and ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Hamish|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-big-three-build-engine-games-on-gog.5491|title=The Big Three Build Engine Games On GOG|publisher=[[GamingOnLinux]]|date=23 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Technical features ==\n\n=== Sectors ===\nSectors are the building blocks of a level's layout, consisting of a two-dimensional [[polygonal]] outline when viewed from above, with the top and bottom [[face (geometry)|faces]] of the sector given separate [[altitude]]s to create a three-dimensional space. Hence, all walls are perfectly vertical\u2014anything appearing otherwise is technically a sloped floor or ceiling. The word ''room'' can be used as a loose substitute to aid understanding, though one room in the game world can consist of many sectors, and [[parallax]]ed skies can give the illusion of being outdoors. Sectors can be manipulated in real-time; ''all'' of their attributes such as shape, height, and slope could be modified \"on-the-fly\" by games, unlike the earlier [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]]. This allowed games to have destructible environments, such as those seen in ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]''. This technique is similar to the use of push walls in the earlier [[Apogee Software]] title ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' which featured similar dynamic environments.\n\nDevelopers of games based on the engine used special reserved \"sprites\" (game objects), often called \"sector effectors\" <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, that, when given special tags (numbers with defined meanings), would allow the level designer to construct a dynamic world; similar tag information could be given to the sector walls and floor area to give a sector special characteristics. For example, a particular sector effector may let players fall through the floor if they walk over it and teleport them to another sector; in practice, this could be used to create the effect of falling down a hole to a bigger room or creating a body of water that could be jumped into to explore underwater. A sector could be given a tag that made it behave like an elevator or lift.\n\nSectors could overlap one another, provided they could not be seen at the same time (if two overlapping sectors were seen at the same time, a corrupted display resulted). This allowed the designers to create, for instance, air ducts that appeared to extend across the top of another room (however, doing so could be tricky for designers due to the 2D viewpoint used for much of the editing process). This allowed the designers to create worlds that would be physically impossible (e.g. a doorway of a small building could lead into a network of rooms larger than the building itself). While all these made the games using the engine appear to be 3D, it wouldn't be until later first-person shooters, such as ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', which used the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], that the engine actually stored the world geometry as true 3D information, making the creation of one area stacked atop another area in a single map very feasible.\n\n=== Voxels ===\nLater versions of Ken Silverman's Build engine allowed game selected art tiles to be replaced by 3D objects made of [[voxel]]s. This feature appeared too late to be used in ''Duke Nukem 3D'', but was seen in some of the later Build engine games. ''Blood'' uses voxels for weapon and ammo pickups, power-ups, and eye-candy (such as the tombstones in the \"Cradle to Grave\" level, some chairs, and a [[crystal ball]] in \"Dark Carnival\"). ''Shadow Warrior'' makes even more advanced use of the technology, with voxels that can be placed on walls (all of the game's switches and buttons are voxels).\n\nFor several years, Ken worked on a modern engine based entirely on voxels, known as ''[[Voxlap]]''.\n\n=== Room over room ===\nOne limitation of the Build engine is that its level geometry is only capable of representing one connection between sectors for any given wall. Due to this, a structure as simple as a shelf with space both above and below it is impossible, though sometimes sprites or voxels can be substituted. Buildings with several floors are technically possible, but it is not possible for such a building to contain an external window directly above or below another window. In addition, some liberties will need to be taken with the staircases, elevators, and other methods of access for each floor.\n\nSeveral Build engine games (namely ''Shadow Warrior'', ''Blood'', and ''Redneck Rampage'') worked around this by displaying a \"viewport\" to another sector through an additional rendering pass. This technique, called ''[[room-over-room]]'' (ROR), appears seamless to the player. In addition to an expanded range of vertical construction, ROR was often used to give bodies of water [[translucent]] surfaces. ROR was never a feature of the Build engine itself, but rather a \"trick\" that was created by game developers. A trick used in ''Duke Nukem 3D'' to get around this, as in the case of its opaque underwater sections, was to simply transport the player quickly to another region of the map made to mimic it, similar to the elevators from ''[[Rise of the Triad]]''.\n\nIn 2011, a feature was added to EDuke32 called ''true room over room'' (TROR), which allows multiple sectors to be stacked vertically so that each sector's wall has its own connection, enabling vertically-unrestricted structures. The difference between ROR and TROR is that TROR sectors physically overlap in the map data and editor (allowing for easy creation and visualization), rather than being drawn from separate locations using view portals, hence ''true'' room over room.

(Both ''Duke Nukem 3D'' and ''EDuke'' were still closed-source at this point.)\n\nWith the 2.1 private [[Software release life cycle|betas]], Saettler worked towards integrating Silverman's build source into the Duke source code, but the project fizzled out before producing anything more than some very buggy private betas. A few total conversion teams for Build games decided to work from Silverman's Build code directly, and an enhanced version of the Build editor known as Mapster was also developed.\n\nIt was claimed at the time by many on the 3D Realms forums that it would be impossible to port Build to a multitasking OS, as it needed a large contiguous block of memory that wouldn't be available in a multitasking environment. This statement did not hold up to scrutiny, as all modern operating systems use [[virtual memory]] which allows apps to get contiguous logical memory without using contiguous physical memory, but conventional wisdom of the time was that porting Build to such an OS was unfeasible.\n\n=== ''Duke Nukem 3D'' source release ===\nOn April 1, 2003, after several years of claims to the contrary, 3D Realms released the source code to ''Duke Nukem 3D''. Not long afterwards, both [[Ryan C. Gordon]] and Jonathon Fowler created and released source ports of the game, including the Build engine. It was possible to play ''Duke Nukem 3D'' well on the NT line of Windows (including Windows 2000/XP) and on [[Linux]] and other [[Unix]] operating systems, and interest in the source ports soared.\n\n=== icculus.org port ===\n[[Ryan C. Gordon]] (icculus), with the help of others, made the first port of the engine using [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]]. The port was first to [[Linux]], then to [[Cygwin]], and finally to a native Windows build using the [[Watcom C/C++ compiler|Watcom C++]] compiler, which was the compiler used for the original DOS build (despite being compiled with Watcom C++, Build is plain C.) There was some talk of Matt Saettler using this to port ''EDuke'' to Windows, but nothing came of it.\n\n=== JonoF port ===\nA second source port was made to Windows, and later to Linux and Mac OS X, by Jonathon Fowler (JonoF). This port, JFDuke3D, initially did not have network game support, though this was added later in development.\n\n==== Polymost ====<!-- This section is linked from [[Duke Nukem 3D]] -->\nThe task of updating the Build engine to a true 3D renderer was taken on by Silverman himself. In the [http://static.jonof.id.au/modsuppt/jfduke3d/releasenotes.html release notes] for JFDuke3D, he wrote:\n<blockquote>''\"When 3D Realms released the Duke Nukem 3D source code, I thought somebody would do a OpenGL or Direct3D port. Well, after a few months passed, I saw no sign of somebody working on a true hardware-accelerated port of Build, just people saying it wasn't possible. Eventually, I realized the only way this was going to happen was for me to do it myself.\"''</blockquote>\n\nThe Polymost renderer allowed for 3D hardware-accelerated graphics using [[OpenGL]].  It also introduced \"hightile\", a feature that made it possible to replace the game's original textures with high-resolution replacements in a variety of formats. Polymost has been utilized in Jonathon Fowler's JFBuild, JFDuke3D, JFShadowWarrior, and source ports derived from their code bases.\n\n=== EDuke32 ===\nThe source for EDuke 2.0 was later released, followed by the source for the last private beta of ''EDuke'' 2.1 (which never made it to a release version). Richard Gobeille (TerminX) merged the EDuke 2.0 source with JFDuke3D to make ''EDuke32''. Another port, ''Wineduke'', based on the icculus code, has since died off, leaving EDuke32 the only EDuke port still in development.\n\nEDuke32 also supports the games ''NAM'' and ''WWII GI'', as EDuke was based on the code to those games.\n\n==== Polymer ====\nOn April 1, 2009, an OpenGL shader model 3.0 renderer was revealed to have been developed for EDuke32, named ''Polymer'' to distinguish from Ken Silverman's ''Polymost''. At first it was thought to be an April Fools' joke, but the renderer was later made public. It allows for more modern effects such as real-time dynamic colored lighting and shadow mapping, specular and [[normal mapping]], and other shader-based features in addition to most of the features added to Polymost over the years. Although Polymer is completely usable, it is technically incomplete and unoptimised, and is still in development. The developers of EDuke32 have stated that once Polymer has been rewritten for speed, it will supplant Polymost completely, as it is a superior renderer, and can be made to look identical to Polymost.\n\n=== Other game ports ===\n{{Infobox software\n| name = BuildGDX\n| logo =\n| screenshot = \n| caption = \n| developer = Alexander \"[M210]\" Makarov\n| released ={{Start date and age|2018|01|12}}\n| latest_release_version = 1.04\n| latest_release_date ={{Start date and age|2019|09|13}}\n| latest_preview_version =\n| latest_preview_date =\n| operating_system = \n| platform = [[Java (software platform)|Java]]\n| genre = [[Game engine]]\n| license = Custom license (free for non-commercial use)\n| website = {{URL|https://m210.duke4.net/}}\n| repo = {{URL|https://gitlab.com/m210/BuildEngine}}\n}}\n\nThe ''Shadow Warrior'' source code was released on April 1, 2005, and JonoF released a source port of it, JFShadowWarrior, on April 2, 2005.

The legal status of these, however, is unclear. The full source code to an alpha version of ''Blood'' was also leaked, and was used as a reference for an otherwise [[reverse engineered]] port to [[Java (programming language)|Java]] using [[LibGDX]] called ''BloodGDX'' in May 2017.

He used this work - now called '''Build 2''' - while teaching 3D game programming to children at a summer camp from 2007 until 2009, and work continued until 2011 when he lost interest in the project. It features a more advanced lighting system, voxel rendering for entities and true room-over-room 3D spaces, and at least in part retained backwards compatibility with the original Build.

Like the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]], the Build engine represents its world on a [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] grid using closed 2D shapes called sectors, and uses simple flat objects called [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] to populate the world geometry with objects.\n\nThe Build engine is generally considered to be a [[2.5D]] engine since the basic world geometry is two-dimensional with an added height component, allowing each sector to have a different ceiling height and floor height.  Playing the game shows that some floors can be lower and some can be higher; same with ceilings (in relation to each other). Floors and ceilings can hinge along one of the sector's walls, resulting in a slope. With this information, the Build engine renders the world in a way that looks [[3-D computer graphics|three-dimensional]], unlike modern game engines that create actual 3D environments.\n\nThough the Build engine achieved most of its fame as a result of powering the [[1996 in video gaming|1996]] [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', it was also used for many other games. The \"Big Three\" Build engine games are generally considered to be ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', ''[[Shadow Warrior (1997 video game)|Shadow Warrior]]'', and ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]''.<ref name=\"GamingOnLinux\">{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Hamish|url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-big-three-build-engine-games-on-gog.5491|title=The Big Three Build Engine Games On GOG|publisher=[[GamingOnLinux]]|date=23 June 2015|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Technical features ==\n\n=== Sectors ===\nSectors are the building blocks of a level's layout, consisting of a two-dimensional [[polygonal]] outline when viewed from above, with the top and bottom [[face (geometry)|faces]] of the sector given separate [[altitude]]s to create a three-dimensional space. Hence, all walls are perfectly vertical\u2014anything appearing otherwise is technically a sloped floor or ceiling. The word ''room'' can be used as a loose substitute to aid understanding, though one room in the game world can consist of many sectors, and [[parallax]]ed skies can give the illusion of being outdoors. Sectors can be manipulated in real-time; ''all'' of their attributes such as shape, height, and slope could be modified \"on-the-fly\" by games, unlike the earlier [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]]. This allowed games to have destructible environments, such as those seen in ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]''. This technique is similar to the use of push walls in the earlier [[Apogee Software]] title ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' which featured similar dynamic environments.\n\nDevelopers of games based on the engine used special reserved \"sprites\" (game objects), often called \"sector effectors\" <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, that, when given special tags (numbers with defined meanings), would allow the level designer to construct a dynamic world; similar tag information could be given to the sector walls and floor area to give a sector special characteristics. For example, a particular sector effector may let players fall through the floor if they walk over it and teleport them to another sector; in practice, this could be used to create the effect of falling down a hole to a bigger room or creating a body of water that could be jumped into to explore underwater. A sector could be given a tag that made it behave like an elevator or lift.\n\nSectors could overlap one another, provided they could not be seen at the same time (if two overlapping sectors were seen at the same time, a corrupted display resulted). This allowed the designers to create, for instance, air ducts that appeared to extend across the top of another room (however, doing so could be tricky for designers due to the 2D viewpoint used for much of the editing process). This allowed the designers to create worlds that would be physically impossible (e.g. a doorway of a small building could lead into a network of rooms larger than the building itself). While all these made the games using the engine appear to be 3D, it wouldn't be until later first-person shooters, such as ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', which used the [[Quake engine|''Quake'' engine]], that the engine actually stored the world geometry as true 3D information, making the creation of one area stacked atop another area in a single map very feasible.\n\n=== Voxels ===\nLater versions of Ken Silverman's Build engine allowed game selected art tiles to be replaced by 3D objects made of [[voxel]]s. This feature appeared too late to be used in ''Duke Nukem 3D'', but was seen in some of the later Build engine games. ''Blood'' uses voxels for weapon and ammo pickups, power-ups, and eye-candy (such as the tombstones in the \"Cradle to Grave\" level, some chairs, and a [[crystal ball]] in \"Dark Carnival\"). ''Shadow Warrior'' makes even more advanced use of the technology, with voxels that can be placed on walls (all of the game's switches and buttons are voxels).\n\nFor several years, Ken worked on a modern engine based entirely on voxels, known as ''[[Voxlap]]''.\n\n=== Room over room ===\nOne limitation of the Build engine is that its level geometry is only capable of representing one connection between sectors for any given wall. Due to this, a structure as simple as a shelf with space both above and below it is impossible, though sometimes sprites or voxels can be substituted. Buildings with several floors are technically possible, but it is not possible for such a building to contain an external window directly above or below another window. In addition, some liberties will need to be taken with the staircases, elevators, and other methods of access for each floor.\n\nSeveral Build engine games (namely ''Shadow Warrior'', ''Blood'', and ''Redneck Rampage'') worked around this by displaying a \"viewport\" to another sector through an additional rendering pass. This technique, called ''[[room-over-room]]'' (ROR), appears seamless to the player. In addition to an expanded range of vertical construction, ROR was often used to give bodies of water [[translucent]] surfaces. ROR was never a feature of the Build engine itself, but rather a \"trick\" that was created by game developers. A trick used in ''Duke Nukem 3D'' to get around this, as in the case of its opaque underwater sections, was to simply transport the player quickly to another region of the map made to mimic it, similar to the elevators from ''[[Rise of the Triad]]''.\n\nIn 2011, a feature was added to EDuke32 called ''true room over room'' (TROR), which allows multiple sectors to be stacked vertically so that each sector's wall has its own connection, enabling vertically-unrestricted structures. The difference between ROR and TROR is that TROR sectors physically overlap in the map data and editor (allowing for easy creation and visualization), rather than being drawn from separate locations using view portals, hence ''true'' room over room. TROR is a feature of the EDuke32 source port, not a game feature or trick.\n\n== Build engine games ==\n; Games that are built directly on the Build engine\n* ''Legend of the Seven Paladins'' (1994) (completed but only released locally, a leaked copy exists on the Internet, illegally used an early version of the Build engine)<ref>{{cite web |title=TWIM |department=A History of Korean Gaming |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/korea/part2/company-twim.htm#imkkeokjeong |accessdate=2017-07-01}}</ref><ref name=\"MG\">{{MobyGames |id=/euijeok-im-kkeokjeong |name=''Euijeok: Im Kkeokjeong'' for DOS (1994)}}</ref>\n* ''[[Witchaven]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[William Shatner's TekWar]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]''<ref name=\"NGen10\">{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=3D Realms|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=10|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=October 1995|pages=99\u2013102}}</ref> (1996)\n* ''[[Witchaven II: Blood Vengeance]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[PowerSlave]]'' (PC version) (1996)\n* ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]''<ref name=\"NGen10\"/> (1997)\n* ''[[Shadow Warrior (1997 video game)|Shadow Warrior]]''<ref name=\"NGen10\"/> (1997)\n\n; Games that are based on the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' code\n* ''[[Redneck Rampage]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Redneck Rampage|Redneck Rampage Rides Again]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Redneck Rampage|Redneck Deer Huntin']]'' (1998)\n* ''[[NAM (video game)|NAM]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Extreme Paintbrawl]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[World War II GI]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Ion Fury]]'' (2019) (via ''EDuke32'')\n\n; Unreleased Build engine games\n* ''[[Corridor 7: Alien Invasion#Sequel|Corridor 8: Galactic Wars]]'' (not completed, source code is available)\n* ''Fate (not completed, only a demo exists)\n\n== Source release and further developments==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2007}}\n\nOn June 20, 2000 (according to his website) Ken Silverman released the Build engine [[source code]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advsys.net/ken/buildsrc/default.htm|title=Ken Silverman's Build Engine Source Code Page|access-date=July 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Early days ===\nVersion 2.0 of Matt Saettler's '''EDuke''', a project to improve ''Duke Nukem 3D'' for [[modding|modders]], was sent to 3D Realms for packaging shortly after the release of the Build source, leaving Duke Nukem 3D the pre-built libraries that 3D Realms had used with the original Duke.

The current governor-equivalent of D.C. is the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]].}} As such, [[governor]]s are responsible for implementing state laws and overseeing the operation of the state [[Executive (government)|executive branch]]. As state leaders, governors advance and pursue new and revised policies and programs using a variety of tools, among them executive orders, executive budgets, and legislative proposals and vetoes. Governors carry out their management and leadership responsibilities and objectives with the support and assistance of department and agency heads, many of whom they are empowered to appoint. A majority of governors have the authority to appoint state court judges as well, in most cases from a list of names submitted by a nominations committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governors' Powers and Authority|url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/management-resources/governors-powers-and-authority.html|website=Nga.org|publisher=[[National Governors Association]]|location=Washington, D.C.|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nAll but five states ([[Arizona]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oregon]], and [[Wyoming]]) have a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]]. The lieutenant governor succeeds to the gubernatorial office (the powers and duties but not the office, in [[Massachusetts]] and [[West Virginia]]), if vacated by the removal from office, death, or resignation of the previous governor. Lieutenant governors also serve as unofficial acting state governors in case the incumbent governors are unable to fulfill their duties, and they often serve as presiding officers of the upper houses of state legislatures. But in such cases, they cannot participate in political debates, and they have no vote whenever these houses are not equally divided.\n\n==Role and powers==\nStates are semi-sovereign republics under the [[federal government]] of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the [[United States Constitution]], such as regulating intrastate commerce, holding [[Elections in the United States|elections]], creating [[Local government in the United States|local governments]], and ratifying [[Constitutional amendment#United States|constitutional amendments]]. Each state has its own [[State constitution (United States)|constitution]], grounded in [[Republicanism in the United States|republican principles]], and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/faq/faqtoc.aspx?subject=1 | title=Frequently Asked Questions About the Minnesota Legislature | publisher=[[Minnesota State Legislature]]}}</ref> Also, due to the shared [[sovereignty]] between each state and the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]], [[Americans]] are [[Citizenship in the United States|citizens]] of both the [[federal republic]] and of the state in which they [[Domicile (law)|reside]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Erler|first1=Edward|title=Essays on Amendment XIV: Citizenship|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/14/essays/167/citizenship|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\nThe governor heads the government's executive branch in each state or territory and, depending on the individual jurisdiction, may have considerable control over government budgeting, the power of appointment of many officials (including many judges), and a considerable role in legislation. The governor may also have additional roles, such as that of [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] (when not federalized) and of that state's respective [[State defense force|defense force]] (which is not subject to federalization). In many states and territories the governor also has partial or absolute power to [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] or [[pardon]] a [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]. All U.S. governors serve four-year terms except those in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]], who serve two-year terms.\n\nIn all states, the governor is directly elected, and in most cases has considerable practical powers, though this may be moderated by the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] and in some cases by other elected executive officials. In the five extant U.S. territories, all governors are now directly elected as well, though in the past many territorial governors were historically appointed by the President of the United States. Governors can [[veto]] state bills, and in all but seven states they have the power of the [[line-item veto]] on appropriations bills (a power the President does not have). In some cases legislatures can override a gubernatorial veto by a two-thirds vote, in others by three-fifths.\n\nIn [[Alabama]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]], the governor's veto can be overridden by a [[majority|simple majority]] vote, making it virtually useless.  In [[Governor of Arkansas|Arkansas]], a gubernatorial veto may be overridden by an [[absolute majority]]. The [[Governor of North Carolina]] had no veto power until a 1996 referendum. In 47 of the 50 states, whenever there is a vacancy of one of the state's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats, that state's governor has the power to appoint someone to fill the vacancy until a [[special election]] is held; the governors of [[Oregon]], [[Alaska]], and [[Wisconsin]] do not have this power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Vacancies.pdf|format=PDF|title=CRS Report for Congress|date=January 22, 2003|website=Senate.gov|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nA state governor may give an annual [[State of the State address]] in order to satisfy a constitutional stipulation that a governor must report annually (or in older constitutions described as being \"from time to time\") on the state or condition of the state. Governors of states may also perform ceremonial roles, such as greeting dignitaries, conferring state decorations, issuing symbolic proclamations or attending the [[state fair]]. The governor may also have an [[official residence]] (see [[List of governors' mansions in the United States|Governor's Mansion]]).\n\nIn a ranking of the power of the governorship in all 50 states, University of North Carolina political scientist Thad Beyle makes the distinction between \"personal powers\" of governors, which are factors that vary from person to person, season to season - and the \"institutional powers\" that are set in place by law. Examples of measurable personal factors are how large a governor's margin of victory was on election day, and where he or she stands in public opinion polls. Whether a governor has strong budget controls, appointment authority, and [[veto power]]s are examples of institutional powers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-09-02/news/0109020193_1_governors-veto-power |title=Governors' powers ranked |first=Stevenson |last=Swanson |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=September 2, 2001 |accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\nIn colonial North America, governors were chosen in a variety of ways, depending on how the colony was organized.  In the [[crown colony|crown colonies]] of Great Britain, France, and Spain, the governor was chosen by the ruling monarch of the colonizing power, or his designees; in British colonies, the [[Board of Trade]] was often the primary decision maker.  Colonies based on a corporate charter, such as the [[Connecticut Colony]] and the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], elected their own governors based on rules spelled out in the charter or other colonial legislation.  In [[Proprietary colony|proprietary colonies]], such as the [[Province of Carolina]] before it became a crown colony (and was divided into [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South]]), governors were chosen by the [[Lords Proprietor]] who controlled the colony.  In the early years of the [[American Revolutionary War]], eleven of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] evicted (with varying levels of violence) royal and proprietary governors. The other two colonies ([[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]]) had corporate charters; Connecticut Governor [[Jonathan Trumbull]] was governor before and during the war period, while in Rhode Island, Governor [[Joseph Wanton]] was removed from office in 1775 for failing to support the rebel war effort.\n\nBefore achieving statehood, many of the 50 states were [[Territories of the United States|territories]] or parts of territories. Administered by the federal government, they had governors who were appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] rather than elected by the resident population.  Election of territorial governors began in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1948.  The last appointed territorial governor, [[Hyrum Rex Lee]] in [[American Samoa]], left office in 1978.\n\n==Demographics==\n===Party===\n[[File:United States Governors map.svg|thumb|'''Party affiliation of current United States Governors:'''<br>\n{{legend|#3333FF|Democratic}}\n{{legend|#161687|New Progressive/Republican}}\n{{legend|#FF3333|Republican}}\n]]\nThere are currently 26 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and 24 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Four Democrats (including the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]]), one Republican, and one [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive]] also occupy territorial governorships. No independent and other third parties currently hold a Governorship.\n\n===Tenure===\n[[File:United States gubernatorial term limits.svg|thumb|Governors' terms by state{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{{legend|#ffee00|No limit}}\n{{legend|#995500|No limit, two-year terms}}\n{{legend|#000000|One; re-eligible after 4 years}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{{legend|#eeeeee|Two; re-eligible after 4 years}}\n{{legend|#ccddff|Two; eligible 8 out of 12 years}}\n{{legend|#22aaff|Two; eligible 8 out of 16 years}}\n{{legend|#0022dd|Two, absolute}}\n{{Col-end}}]]\nFor each term, governors serve four years in office. The exceptions are [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]] where tenures are two years long.\n\nThe longest-serving current governor is [[Gary Herbert]] of [[Utah]], who was elected to his second full term in 2016, having ascended to the governorship in 2009 after [[Jon Huntsman Jr.|Jon Huntsman, Jr.]] resigned after being appointed [[United States Ambassador to China|Ambassador to China]]. \n\nThe longest-serving governor of all time is [[Terry Branstad]] of [[Iowa]], who was elected to his sixth non-consecutive term in [[2014 Iowa gubernatorial election|2014]]. On December 14, 2015, he became the longest serving governor in US history, breaking the record held by [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], who served 21 years from 1777 to 1795, and from 1801 to 1804. Governor Branstad resigned on May 24, 2017, to become the United States Ambassador to China.\n\nIn the majority of states, [[Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits|term limits]] cap a governor's tenure.\n\n===Age===\nThe oldest current governor is [[Kay Ivey]] of [[Alabama]], born on {{birth date and age|1944|10|15}}.  The youngest current state Governor is [[Ron DeSantis]] of [[Florida]] who was born on {{birth date and age|1978|9|14}}.  Among territorial governors, [[Ralph Torres]] of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] is youngest, born on {{birth date and age|1979|8|6}}.\n\nThe youngest person to ever serve as a governor in the United States was [[Stevens T. Mason]] of the [[Michigan Territory]], elected in 1835 having just turned 24. Mason would later become the first governor of the state of [[Michigan]] when it was admitted to the Union in January 1837, when he was 25. Mason was re-elected in November 1837, then age 26.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-17451_18670_18793-52864--,00.html|title=\"Stevens Thomson Mason - Background Reading\"|website=Michigan.gov|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe second youngest governor ever elected was [[J. Neely Johnson]] of [[California]], when he was elected in 1855 at the age of 30, and the third youngest governor was [[Harold Stassen]] of [[Minnesota]], when he was elected in 1938 at age 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/136stassen.htm|title=LibGuides: Harold E.

Oklahoma is the only state with an older age, 31. Some states require the governor to be a qualified elector/voter, implying a minimum age of 18. Vermont requires candidates to be residents of the state for at least four years as of Election Day, which would preclude small children from running, but has no other implicit or explicit age limit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/|title=Candidates|website=Vermont Secretary of State|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> Kansas has no explicit or implicit age or residency requirements whatsoever.\n\n===Gender===\n{{Main|List of female state governors in the United States}}\n[[File:United States Governor gender map.svg|thumb|State and territorial governors by gender]]\nT\n\n\nThirty-eight women have been or are currently serving as the governor, including two in an acting capacity.\n\nThe first female governor was [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]] of [[Wyoming]] (widow of the late Wyoming Governor [[William B. Ross]]) who was elected on November 4, 1924 and sworn in on January 5, 1925 succeeding [[Frank Lucas (Wyoming politician)|Frank Lucas]]. Also elected on November 4, 1924 was [[Miriam A. Ferguson]] of [[Texas]] (wife of former Texas Governor [[James E. Ferguson]]), succeeding  [[Pat Morris Neff]] on January 21, 1925. The first female governor elected without being the wife or widow of a past state governor was [[Ella T. Grasso]] of [[Connecticut]], elected in 1974 and sworn in on January 8, 1975.\n\n[[Connecticut]], [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] are the only three states to have elected female governors from both major parties. [[New Hampshire]] has also had female governors from two parties, but Republican [[Vesta M. Roy]] served only in the acting capacity for a short time. Arizona was the first state where a woman followed another woman as governor (they were from different parties). Arizona also has had the most female governors with a total of four, and is the first state to have three women in a row serve as governor.  [[Washington (state)|Washington]] was the first state to have both a female governor and female U.S. Senators serving at the same time ([[Christine Gregoire]]; [[Patty Murray]]; [[Maria Cantwell]], respectively). [[New Hampshire]] was the first and currently only state to have a female governor and entirely female Congressional delegation serving at the same time.\n\nNine women have been serving as chief executive of their states since January 5, 2019, when [[Kristi Noem]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[South Dakota]]. This ties the record previously set on two different occasions: first, between December 4, 2006, when [[Sarah Palin]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[Alaska]], and January 14, 2008, when [[Kathleen Blanco]] left office as governor of [[Louisiana]]; and second, between January 10, 2009, when [[Beverly Perdue]] was inaugurated as governor of [[North Carolina]], and January 20, 2009, when [[Ruth Ann Minner]] retired as governor of [[Delaware]].\n\n===LGBT Status===\nThere are currently two governors who identify as LGBT: [[Jared Polis]] of Colorado, who identifies as gay, and [[Kate Brown]] of Oregon, who identifies as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/style/jared-polis-gay-governor.html|title=Colorado\u2019s Got a Gay Governor.

Sununu and Stitt are [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] while Grisham and Ige are [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].\n\nAmong the five U.S. territories, one Hispanic ([[Wanda V\u00e1zquez]] of [[Puerto Rico]]), one Black ([[Albert Bryan (politician)|Albert Bryan]] of the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]), and three [[Pacific Islander American]]s ([[Lou Leon Guerrero]] of [[Guam]], [[Lolo Letalu Matalasi Moliga]] of [[American Samoa]], and [[Ralph Torres]] of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]) currently serve as governor. African-American [[Muriel Bowser]] is the current [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]], an office equivalent to a governor.\n\nIn 1990, [[Douglas Wilder]] of [[Virginia]] became the first African-American governor of any state since the [[Reconstruction era]].\n\n===Birthplace===\n14 of the current state governors were born outside the state they are serving: [[Mike Dunleavy (politician)|Mike Dunleavy]] of Alaska (born in Pennsylvania), [[Doug Ducey]] of Arizona (born in Ohio), [[Ned Lamont]] of Connecticut (born in Washington, D.C.), [[J.

There is some ambiguity in some state constitutions if a governor must be a citizen or just a resident.\n\n===Physical disability===\nTwo legally blind governors have served: [[Bob C. Riley]], who was acting governor of Arkansas for eleven days in January 1975, and [[David Paterson]], who was governor of New York from 2008 until 2010.\n\nThe current governor of Texas, [[Greg Abbott]], has been paraplegic since an accident in 1984; he has used a wheelchair ever since. Governor of New York [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was [[paraplegic]]; he later became the first wheelchair-using president.\n\n==Salary==\nThe average salary of a state governor in 2009 was $124,398. The highest salary currently being accepted is that of California Governor [[Gavin Newsom]] at $202,000. The lowest salaries are those of Maine Governor [[Janet Mills]]  and of Puerto Rico [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]] at $70,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2013/06/25/governors-salaries-range-from-70000-to-187256|title=Governors\u2019 Salaries Range From $70,000 to $187,256|website=Pewtrusts.org|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> \n\nThere have been several instances where the governor of a state has either refused their salary in its entirety or instead only taken $1.00 per year. Alabama Governor [[Robert J. Bentley]] refused his yearly salary of $119,950.00 until the state reached full employment. Michigan Governor [[Rick Snyder]] took a $1.00 yearly salary. Texas Governor [[Greg Abbott]] has returned his salary to the state during each year he has held office. During his tenure as [[Governor of California]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] also did not accept his salary of $170,000.00 per year.\nHowever, several governors instead have decided to take a reduction in their salary instead of refusing it entirely. New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] took a 5 percent reduction in his salary in 2015, and Kentucky Governor [[Steve Beshear]] reduced his salary by 10 percent during the same year.\n\nOnly seven states (Massachusetts<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cthrupayroll.mass.gov |title=Statewide Payroll |access-date=June 5, 2019}}</ref>, California, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia) currently offer their governors a higher salary than the $174,000 paid to members of Congress. In many states, the governor is not the highest-paid state employee; most often, that distinction is held by the head [[College football|football]] or men's [[basketball]] coach at a major state university.\n\n==Gubernatorial election timeline schedule==\nAll states except Louisiana hold gubernatorial elections on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November. The earliest possible date for the election is therefore November 2 (if that date falls on a Tuesday), and the latest possible date is November 8 (if November 1 falls on a Tuesday). Louisiana holds its gubernatorial primary on the third or fourth Saturday of October and the general election (commonly referred to as the runoff within the state) on the third Saturday of November,  but the general election is cancelled if one candidate wins the primary outright (see primary section below).\n* '''Two states hold their gubernatorial elections every even numbered year'''. Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2010|2010]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2012|2012]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2014|2014]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2016|2016]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2018|2018]].\n:New Hampshire and Vermont\n\nThe other 48 states hold gubernatorial elections every four years.\n* '''Thirty-four states and three territories hold their gubernatorial elections during a midterm election year.''' Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2002|2002]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2006|2006]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2010|2010]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2014|2014]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2018|2018]].\n:Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, Wyoming and Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands.\n* '''Nine states and two territories hold their gubernatorial elections during a presidential election year.''' (although Puerto Rico and American Samoa do not hold an election for President). Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2004|2004]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2008|2008]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2012|2012]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2016|2016]].\n:Delaware, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico.\n* '''Three states hold their gubernatorial elections the year before a presidential election year.''' Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2003|2003]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2007|2007]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2011|2011]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2015|2015]].\n:Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi\n* '''Two states hold their gubernatorial elections the year after a presidential election year.'''

In California, Louisiana, and Washington, all the candidates run in a [[blanket primary]] against each other. Regardless of political party, the top two candidates move on to the general election. In Louisiana, the general election occurs between the top two candidates if no candidate obtains more than 50% of the votes cast, and is cancelled if one of the candidates receives more than 50%. In California and Washington, the top two vote getters proceed to the general election regardless of how many votes the top vote getter received in the primary, and California prohibits [[write-in]] candidates from competing in the general election.\n\n==Term limits==\n{{See|Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits}}\n{{empty section|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Relationship with lieutenant governor==\nThe type of relationship between the governor and the lieutenant governor greatly varies by state. In some states the governor and lieutenant governor are completely independent of each other, while in others the governor gets to choose (prior to the election) who would be his or her lieutenant governor.\n* '''Five states [[List of current United States lieutenant governors#States which do not have lieutenant governors|do not have a lieutenant governor]]'''. In those states, a different [[State constitutional officer|constitutional officer]] assumes the office of the governor should there be a vacancy in the office. Those states are Arizona (Sec. of State), Maine (Pres. of Senate), New Hampshire (Pres. of Senate), Oregon (Sec. of State), and Wyoming (Sec. of State).\n* '''Seventeen states have separate elections for the governor and the lieutenant governor''', which may lead to the governor and the lieutenant governor being from different parties. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.\n* '''Two states have the State Senate appoint the lieutenant governor''', which may mean that the governor and the lieutenant governor may be from different parties. Those states are Tennessee and West Virginia.\n* '''Eight states have the governor and lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket, but the governor does not get to choose his/her running mate'''. In those states, the primaries for governor and lieutenant governor are held separately, and the winners run together as joint tickets in the general election. The governor and lieutenant governor would therefore be from the same party, but not necessarily political allies. Those states are Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n* '''Eighteen states have the governor and lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket''' similar to the President and Vice President of the United States, where a candidate for governor selects a would-be lieutenant governor. Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, and Utah have gubernatorial candidates pick their running mates before the primaries, while in Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, South Carolina, and South Dakota, the running mate is chosen after the primary. The latter system allows the nominee to potentially select a defeated primary competitor.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* The [[Flags of governors of the U.S. states|flags]] and [[Seals of governors of the U.S. states|seals]] of governors of the U.S. states\n* [[Governor]] and [[lieutenant governor]]\n* Governors of inhabited U.S. territories:\n** [[List of Governors of American Samoa]]\n** [[List of Governors of Guam]]\n** [[Governors of Puerto Rico]]\n** [[List of Governors of the Northern Mariana Islands]]\n** [[List of Governors of the United States Virgin Islands]]\n* [[List of female governors in the United States]]\n* [[List of minority governors and lieutenant governors in the United States]]\n* [[List of oldest living United States governors]]\n* [[List of United States governors]]\n* [[List of U.S. state governors born outside the United States]]\n* [[List of current state governors in Mexico|Mexican state governors]]\n* [[Premier (Canada)]] {{ndash}} similar position of provincial/territorial government in [[Canada]]\n* [[State constitutional officer]]\n* [[State legislature (United States)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100304170455/http://governors.rutgers.edu/index.htm  Rutgers Program on the Governor]\n\n{{US Chief Executives}}\n{{Current U.S. governors}}\n{{U.S. state cabinets}}\n{{United States topics}}\n\n[[Category:Government occupations]]\n[[Category:Gubernatorial titles]]\n[[Category:State government in the United States]]\n[[Category:State governors of the United States| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{merge from|State Constitution Gubernatorial Qualifications in the United States|discuss=Talk:Governor (United States)#Proposed merge with State Constitution Gubernatorial Qualifications in the United States|date=March 2019}}\n{{update|date=January 2019}}{{See also|List of United States governors}}{{Politics of the United States}}\nIn the United States, a '''governor''' serves as the [[chief executive officer]] and [[commander-in-chief]] in each of the fifty [[U.S. state|states]] and in the five permanently inhabited [[Territories of the United States|territories]], functioning as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] therein.{{refn|group=nb|The [[federal district]] of [[Washington, D.C.]] has been led by [[List of mayors of Washington, D.C.|a chief executive officer of varying titles]], including governor. The current governor-equivalent of D.C. is the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]].}} As such, [[governor]]s are responsible for implementing state laws and overseeing the operation of the state [[Executive (government)|executive branch]]. As state leaders, governors advance and pursue new and revised policies and programs using a variety of tools, among them executive orders, executive budgets, and legislative proposals and vetoes. Governors carry out their management and leadership responsibilities and objectives with the support and assistance of department and agency heads, many of whom they are empowered to appoint. A majority of governors have the authority to appoint state court judges as well, in most cases from a list of names submitted by a nominations committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governors' Powers and Authority|url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/management-resources/governors-powers-and-authority.html|website=Nga.org|publisher=[[National Governors Association]]|location=Washington, D.C.|date=2011}}</ref>\n\nAll but five states ([[Arizona]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oregon]], and [[Wyoming]]) have a [[Lieutenant governor (United States)|lieutenant governor]]. The lieutenant governor succeeds to the gubernatorial office (the powers and duties but not the office, in [[Massachusetts]] and [[West Virginia]]), if vacated by the removal from office, death, or resignation of the previous governor. Lieutenant governors also serve as unofficial acting state governors in case the incumbent governors are unable to fulfill their duties, and they often serve as presiding officers of the upper houses of state legislatures. But in such cases, they cannot participate in political debates, and they have no vote whenever these houses are not equally divided.\n\n==Role and powers==\nStates are semi-sovereign republics under the [[federal government]] of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the [[United States Constitution]], such as regulating intrastate commerce, holding [[Elections in the United States|elections]], creating [[Local government in the United States|local governments]], and ratifying [[Constitutional amendment#United States|constitutional amendments]]. Each state has its own [[State constitution (United States)|constitution]], grounded in [[Republicanism in the United States|republican principles]], and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/faq/faqtoc.aspx?subject=1 | title=Frequently Asked Questions About the Minnesota Legislature | publisher=[[Minnesota State Legislature]]}}</ref> Also, due to the shared [[sovereignty]] between each state and the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]], [[Americans]] are [[Citizenship in the United States|citizens]] of both the [[federal republic]] and of the state in which they [[Domicile (law)|reside]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Erler|first1=Edward|title=Essays on Amendment XIV: Citizenship|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/14/essays/167/citizenship|publisher=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref>\n\nThe governor heads the government's executive branch in each state or territory and, depending on the individual jurisdiction, may have considerable control over government budgeting, the power of appointment of many officials (including many judges), and a considerable role in legislation. The governor may also have additional roles, such as that of [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] (when not federalized) and of that state's respective [[State defense force|defense force]] (which is not subject to federalization). In many states and territories the governor also has partial or absolute power to [[Commutation of sentence|commute]] or [[pardon]] a [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]. All U.S. governors serve four-year terms except those in [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]], who serve two-year terms.\n\nIn all states, the governor is directly elected, and in most cases has considerable practical powers, though this may be moderated by the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] and in some cases by other elected executive officials. In the five extant U.S. territories, all governors are now directly elected as well, though in the past many territorial governors were historically appointed by the President of the United States. Governors can [[veto]] state bills, and in all but seven states they have the power of the [[line-item veto]] on appropriations bills (a power the President does not have). In some cases legislatures can override a gubernatorial veto by a two-thirds vote, in others by three-fifths.\n\nIn [[Alabama]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]], the governor's veto can be overridden by a [[majority|simple majority]] vote, making it virtually useless.  In [[Governor of Arkansas|Arkansas]], a gubernatorial veto may be overridden by an [[absolute majority]]. The [[Governor of North Carolina]] had no veto power until a 1996 referendum. In 47 of the 50 states, whenever there is a vacancy of one of the state's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats, that state's governor has the power to appoint someone to fill the vacancy until a [[special election]] is held; the governors of [[Oregon]], [[Alaska]], and [[Wisconsin]] do not have this power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Vacancies.pdf|format=PDF|title=CRS Report for Congress|date=January 22, 2003|website=Senate.gov|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nA state governor may give an annual [[State of the State address]] in order to satisfy a constitutional stipulation that a governor must report annually (or in older constitutions described as being \"from time to time\") on the state or condition of the state. Governors of states may also perform ceremonial roles, such as greeting dignitaries, conferring state decorations, issuing symbolic proclamations or attending the [[state fair]]. The governor may also have an [[official residence]] (see [[List of governors' mansions in the United States|Governor's Mansion]]).\n\nIn a ranking of the power of the governorship in all 50 states, University of North Carolina political scientist Thad Beyle makes the distinction between \"personal powers\" of governors, which are factors that vary from person to person, season to season - and the \"institutional powers\" that are set in place by law. Examples of measurable personal factors are how large a governor's margin of victory was on election day, and where he or she stands in public opinion polls. Whether a governor has strong budget controls, appointment authority, and [[veto power]]s are examples of institutional powers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-09-02/news/0109020193_1_governors-veto-power |title=Governors' powers ranked |first=Stevenson |last=Swanson |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=September 2, 2001 |accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\nIn colonial North America, governors were chosen in a variety of ways, depending on how the colony was organized.  In the [[crown colony|crown colonies]] of Great Britain, France, and Spain, the governor was chosen by the ruling monarch of the colonizing power, or his designees; in British colonies, the [[Board of Trade]] was often the primary decision maker.  Colonies based on a corporate charter, such as the [[Connecticut Colony]] and the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], elected their own governors based on rules spelled out in the charter or other colonial legislation.  In [[Proprietary colony|proprietary colonies]], such as the [[Province of Carolina]] before it became a crown colony (and was divided into [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South]]), governors were chosen by the [[Lords Proprietor]] who controlled the colony.  In the early years of the [[American Revolutionary War]], eleven of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] evicted (with varying levels of violence) royal and proprietary governors. The other two colonies ([[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]]) had corporate charters; Connecticut Governor [[Jonathan Trumbull]] was governor before and during the war period, while in Rhode Island, Governor [[Joseph Wanton]] was removed from office in 1775 for failing to support the rebel war effort.\n\nBefore achieving statehood, many of the 50 states were [[Territories of the United States|territories]] or parts of territories. Administered by the federal government, they had governors who were appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] rather than elected by the resident population.  Election of territorial governors began in [[Puerto Rico]] in 1948.  The last appointed territorial governor, [[Hyrum Rex Lee]] in [[American Samoa]], left office in 1978.\n\n==Demographics==\n===Party===\n[[File:United States Governors map.svg|thumb|'''Party affiliation of current United States Governors:'''<br>\n{{legend|#3333FF|Democratic}}\n{{legend|#161687|New Progressive/Republican}}\n{{legend|#FF3333|Republican}}\n]]\nThere are currently 26 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and 24 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Four Democrats (including the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]]), one Republican, and one [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive]] also occupy territorial governorships.

The exceptions are [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]] where tenures are two years long.\n\nThe longest-serving current governor is [[Gary Herbert]] of [[Utah]], who was elected to his second full term in 2016, having ascended to the governorship in 2009 after [[Jon Huntsman Jr.|Jon Huntsman, Jr.]] resigned after being appointed [[United States Ambassador to China|Ambassador to China]]. \n\nThe longest-serving governor of all time is [[Terry Branstad]] of [[Iowa]], who was elected to his sixth non-consecutive term in [[2014 Iowa gubernatorial election|2014]]. On December 14, 2015, he became the longest serving governor in US history, breaking the record held by [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], who served 21 years from 1777 to 1795, and from 1801 to 1804. Governor Branstad resigned on May 24, 2017, to become the United States Ambassador to China.\n\nIn the majority of states, [[Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits|term limits]] cap a governor's tenure.\n\n===Age===\nThe oldest current governor is [[Kay Ivey]] of [[Alabama]], born on {{birth date and age|1944|10|15}}.

Among territorial governors, [[Ralph Torres]] of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] is youngest, born on {{birth date and age|1979|8|6}}.\n\nThe youngest person to ever serve as a governor in the United States was [[Stevens T. Mason]] of the [[Michigan Territory]], elected in 1835 having just turned 24. Mason would later become the first governor of the state of [[Michigan]] when it was admitted to the Union in January 1837, when he was 25.

Oklahoma is the only state with an older age, 31. Some states require the governor to be a qualified elector/voter, implying a minimum age of 18. Vermont requires candidates to be residents of the state for at least four years as of Election Day, which would preclude small children from running, but has no other implicit or explicit age limit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/|title=Candidates|website=Vermont Secretary of State|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref> Kansas has no explicit or implicit age or residency requirements whatsoever.\n\n===Gender===\n{{Main|List of female state governors in the United States}}\n[[File:United States Governor gender map.svg|thumb|State and territorial governors by gender]]\nThere are currently 50 state governors.\n\nFour territorial governors are male; one territorial governor and the mayor of Washington, D.C. are female.\n\nThirty-eight women have been or are currently serving as the governor, including two in an acting capacity.\n\nThe first female governor was [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]] of [[Wyoming]] (widow of the late Wyoming Governor [[William B. Ross]]) who was elected on November 4, 1924 and sworn in on January 5, 1925 succeeding [[Frank Lucas (Wyoming politician)|Frank Lucas]]. Also elected on November 4, 1924 was [[Miriam A. Ferguson]] of [[Texas]] (wife of former Texas Governor [[James E. Ferguson]]), succeeding  [[Pat Morris Neff]] on January 21, 1925.

Grasso]] of [[Connecticut]], elected in 1974 and sworn in on January 8, 1975.\n\n[[Connecticut]], [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]] are the only three states to have elected female governors from both major parties. [[New Hampshire]] has also had female governors from two parties, but Republican [[Vesta M. Roy]] served only in the acting capacity for a short time. Arizona was the first state where a woman followed another woman as governor (they were from different parties). Arizona also has had the most female governors with a total of four, and is the first state to have three women in a row serve as governor.  [[Washington (state)|Washington]] was the first state to have both a female governor and female U.S. Senators serving at the same time ([[Christine Gregoire]]; [[Patty Murray]]; [[Maria Cantwell]], respectively). [[New Hampshire]] was the first and currently only state to have a female governor and entirely female Congressional delegation serving at the same time.\n\nNine women have been serving as chief executive of their states since January 5, 2019, when [[Kristi Noem]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[South Dakota]]. This ties the record previously set on two different occasions: first, between December 4, 2006, when [[Sarah Palin]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[Alaska]], and January 14, 2008, when [[Kathleen Blanco]] left office as governor of [[Louisiana]]; and second, between January 10, 2009, when [[Beverly Perdue]] was inaugurated as governor of [[North Carolina]], and January 20, 2009, when [[Ruth Ann Minner]] retired as governor of [[Delaware]].\n\n===LGBT Status===\nThere are currently two governors who identify as LGBT: [[Jared Polis]] of Colorado, who identifies as gay, and [[Kate Brown]] of Oregon, who identifies as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/style/jared-polis-gay-governor.html|title=Colorado\u2019s Got a Gay Governor.

Governor of New York [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was [[paraplegic]]; he later became the first wheelchair-using president.\n\n==Salary==\nThe average salary of a state governor in 2009 was $124,398. The highest salary currently being accepted is that of California Governor [[Gavin Newsom]] at $202,000.

Alabama Governor [[Robert J. Bentley]] refused his yearly salary of $119,950.00 until the state reached full employment. Michigan Governor [[Rick Snyder]] took a $1.00 yearly salary. Texas Governor [[Greg Abbott]] has returned his salary to the state during each year he has held office. During his tenure as [[Governor of California]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] also did not accept his salary of $170,000.00 per year.\nHowever, several governors instead have decided to take a reduction in their salary instead of refusing it entirely. New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] took a 5 percent reduction in his salary in 2015, and Kentucky Governor [[Steve Beshear]] reduced his salary by 10 percent during the same year.\n\nOnly seven states (Massachusetts<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cthrupayroll.mass.gov |title=Statewide Payroll |access-date=June 5, 2019}}</ref>, California, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia) currently offer their governors a higher salary than the $174,000 paid to members of Congress. In many states, the governor is not the highest-paid state employee; most often, that distinction is held by the head [[College football|football]] or men's [[basketball]] coach at a major state university.\n\n==Gubernatorial election timeline schedule==\nAll states except Louisiana hold gubernatorial elections on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November. The earliest possible date for the election is therefore November 2 (if that date falls on a Tuesday), and the latest possible date is November 8 (if November 1 falls on a Tuesday). Louisiana holds its gubernatorial primary on the third or fourth Saturday of October and the general election (commonly referred to as the runoff within the state) on the third Saturday of November,  but the general election is cancelled if one candidate wins the primary outright (see primary section below).\n* '''Two states hold their gubernatorial elections every even numbered year'''. Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2010|2010]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2012|2012]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2014|2014]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2016|2016]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2018|2018]].\n:New Hampshire and Vermont\n\nThe other 48 states hold gubernatorial elections every four years.\n* '''Thirty-four states and three territories hold their gubernatorial elections during a midterm election year.''' Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2002|2002]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2006|2006]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2010|2010]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2014|2014]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2018|2018]].\n:Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, Wyoming and Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands.\n* '''Nine states and two territories hold their gubernatorial elections during a presidential election year.''' (although Puerto Rico and American Samoa do not hold an election for President). Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2004|2004]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2008|2008]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2012|2012]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2016|2016]].\n:Delaware, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico.\n* '''Three states hold their gubernatorial elections the year before a presidential election year.''' Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2003|2003]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2007|2007]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2011|2011]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2015|2015]].\n:Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi\n* '''Two states hold their gubernatorial elections the year after a presidential election year.''' Recent years are [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2001|2001]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2005|2005]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2009|2009]], [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2013|2013]], and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2017|2017]].\n:New Jersey and Virginia\n\n===Gubernatorial primaries===\nAll states, except for California, Louisiana, and Washington, hold primaries in which each political party holds a primary election, and the winner of the primary election moves on to compete in a general election. In California, Louisiana, and Washington, all the candidates run in a [[blanket primary]] against each other. Regardless of political party, the top two candidates move on to the general election. In Louisiana, the general election occurs between the top two candidates if no candidate obtains more than 50% of the votes cast, and is cancelled if one of the candidates receives more than 50%. In California and Washington, the top two vote getters proceed to the general election regardless of how many votes the top vote getter received in the primary, and California prohibits [[write-in]] candidates from competing in the general election.\n\n==Term limits==\n{{See|Term limits in the United States#Gubernatorial term limits}}\n{{empty section|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Relationship with lieutenant governor==\nThe type of relationship between the governor and the lieutenant governor greatly varies by state. In some states the governor and lieutenant governor are completely independent of each other, while in others the governor gets to choose (prior to the election) who would be his or her lieutenant governor.\n* '''Five states [[List of current United States lieutenant governors#States which do not have lieutenant governors|do not have a lieutenant governor]]'''. In those states, a different [[State constitutional officer|constitutional officer]] assumes the office of the governor should there be a vacancy in the office. Those states are Arizona (Sec. of State), Maine (Pres. of Senate), New Hampshire (Pres. of Senate), Oregon (Sec. of State), and Wyoming (Sec. of State).\n* '''Seventeen states have separate elections for the governor and the lieutenant governor''', which may lead to the governor and the lieutenant governor being from different parties. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.\n* '''Two states have the State Senate appoint the lieutenant governor''', which may mean that the governor and the lieutenant governor may be from different parties. Those states are Tennessee and West Virginia.\n* '''Eight states have the governor and lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket, but the governor does not get to choose his/her running mate'''. In those states, the primaries for governor and lieutenant governor are held separately, and the winners run together as joint tickets in the general election. The governor and lieutenant governor would therefore be from the same party, but not necessarily political allies. Those states are Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\n* '''Eighteen states have the governor and lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket''' similar to the President and Vice President of the United States, where a candidate for governor selects a would-be lieutenant governor. Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, and Utah have gubernatorial candidates pick their running mates before the primaries, while in Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, South Carolina, and South Dakota, the running mate is chosen after the primary. The latter system allows the nominee to potentially select a defeated primary competitor.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* The [[Flags of governors of the U.S. states|flags]] and [[Seals of governors of the U.S. states|seals]] of governors of the U.S. states\n* [[Governor]] and [[lieutenant governor]]\n* Governors of inhabited U.S. territories:\n** [[List of Governors of American Samoa]]\n** [[List of Governors of Guam]]\n** [[Governors of Puerto Rico]]\n** [[List of Governors of the Northern Mariana Islands]]\n** [[List of Governors of the United States Virgin Islands]]\n* [[List of female governors in the United States]]\n* [[List of minority governors and lieutenant governors in the United States]]\n* [[List of oldest living United States governors]]\n* [[List of United States governors]]\n* [[List of U.S. state governors born outside the United States]]\n* [[List of current state governors in Mexico|Mexican state governors]]\n* [[Premier (Canada)]] {{ndash}} similar position of provincial/territorial government in [[Canada]]\n* [[State constitutional officer]]\n* [[State legislature (United States)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100304170455/http://governors.rutgers.edu/index.htm  Rutgers Program on the Governor]\n\n{{US Chief Executives}}\n{{Current U.S. governors}}\n{{U.S. state cabinets}}\n{{United States topics}}\n\n[[Category:Government occupations]]\n[[Category:Gubernatorial titles]]\n[[Category:State government in the United States]]\n[[Category:State governors of the United States| ]]\n", "name_user": "Facts10082", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed irrelevant information once sexist information was removed.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)"}

[[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] created, wrote and starred in the program. The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with [[20th Century Fox Television]] and was taped at stage 7 at the [[Metromedia Square|Fox Television Center]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\nThe title of the series was inspired by the [[NBC]] announcement of broadcasts being presented \"[[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|in living color]]\" during the 1960s, prior to mainstream [[color television]]. It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast was [[Black people|black]], unlike other sketch comedy shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', whose casts are mostly [[White people|white]]. It was controversial due to the Wayans' decision to portray black humor from the [[ghetto]] in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans.\n\nOther members of the [[Wayans family]]\u2014[[Damon Wayans|Damon]], [[Kim Wayans|Kim]], [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]], and [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]]\u2014had regular roles, while brother [[Dwayne Wayans|Dwayne]] frequently appeared as an extra. The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors, including [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tommy Davidson]], [[David Alan Grier]], and [[T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h]]. The show introduced [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] as members of ''In Living Color''<nowiki/>'s dance troupe The Fly Girls, with actress [[Rosie Perez]] serving as choreographer. The show was immensely popular in its first two seasons, capturing more than a 10-point [[Nielsen rating]]; in the third and fourth seasons, ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with Fox network leadership over creative control and rights.\n\nThe series won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series]] in 1990. The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live, special episode as a [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogram]] for the halftime show of U.S. leader [[CBS]]'s live telecast of [[Super Bowl XXVI]], prompting the [[National Football League]] to book A-list acts for future game entertainment, starting with [[Michael Jackson]] the following year.<ref name=trib-goalofspectacle>{{cite news|title=Goal of spectacle colors NFL's thinking about Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-06/business/ct-biz-0206-rosenthal--20110206_1_super-halftime-party-doritos-zaptime-halftime-show|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=6 February 2011}}</ref> In 2018, a history of the show, ''Homey Don't Play That!'' by David Peisner, was released by [[37 INK]], an imprint of [[Simon & Schuster]].\n\n== Description and history ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nFollowing Keenen Ivory Wayans' success with ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' and ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] approached Wayans to offer him his own show.<ref name= pokes>{{cite news |title= New Fox Show Pokes Fun at Black Stereotypes |publisher= Greensboro News & Record |location= Greensboro, North Carolina |work= Associated Press |page= B6 |date= April 12, 1990 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EB191E9F73E3517&p_docnum=837&p_queryname=3 }}</ref> Wayans wanted to produce a variety show similar to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but with a cast of people of color that took chances with its content.<ref name= ready>{{cite news |title= Is prime time ready for rudeness?

It became renowned for [[parody]], especially of race relations in the [[United States]]. For instance, Carrey was frequently used to ridicule white musicians such as [[Snow (musician)|Snow]] and [[Vanilla Ice]], who performed in genres more commonly associated with black people. The Wayans themselves often played exaggerated black ghetto stereotypes for humor and effect. A sketch parodying ''[[Soul Train]]'' mocked the show as ''Old Train'', suggesting the show (along with its host, [[Don Cornelius]]) was out of touch and only appealed to the elderly and the dead. When asked about the show's use of stereotypes of black culture for comedy, Wayans said, \"Half of comedy is making fun of stereotypes. They only get critical when I do it. [[Woody Allen]] has been having fun with his culture for years, and no one says anything about it. [[Martin Scorsese]], his films basically deal with the Italian community, and no one ever says anything to him. [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], all of his films parody upscale white suburban life. Nobody says anything to him. When I do it, then all of a sudden it becomes a racial issue. You know what I mean? It's my culture, and I'm entitled to poke fun at the stereotypes that I didn't create in the first place. I don't even concern myself with that type of criticism, because it's racist in itself.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Humor is in 'Living Color': Writers Plan to Capitalize on Funny Cultural Stereotypes |work= Daily News of Los Angeles |date= April 15, 1990 |first= Yardena |last= Arar |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EF5BB34E44340CF&p_docnum=863&p_queryname=3 |page= L25 }}</ref>\n\nProminent skits:\n*  \"The Homeboy Shopping Network\", featuring Damon and Keenan as streetwise criminals operating an unlicensed, [[Home Shopping Network]]-style shopping network out of the back of their van to sell stolen goods.\n*  \"Fire Marshal Bill\", featuring Carrey as an incompetent, dangerously inept [[fire marshal]].\n*  \"[[Men on...|Men on Film]]\", featuring Damon and Grier as [[effeminate]] black film critics with exaggerated physical motions, such as \"two snaps up\".\n*  \"Homey D.

However, after the band [[Living Colour]] claimed in a lawsuit that the show stole the band's logo and name,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-08/entertainment/ca-455_1_group-living-colour |title=Living Colour band sues Fox |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 8, 1990 |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}</ref> the logo was changed to one with rather plain-type letters of three colors.  The show title itself is a homage to the [[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|NBC Peacock]] tag line, \"The following program is brought to you in living color\" from the 1960s when television was transitioning from black & white to color TV.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnvDVaiHXjM NBC Peacock clips] (posted to YouTube on Nov 4, 2011)</ref>\n\nIn the first two seasons, the opening sequence was set in a room covered with painters' tarps. Each cast member, wearing black-and-white, played with brightly colored paint in a different way (throwing paintballs at the camera by hand, [[spray painting]] the lens, using a roller to cover the camera lens, etc.). The sequence ended with a segue to a set built to resemble the rooftop of an apartment building, where the show's dancers performed a routine and opened a door to let Keenen Ivory Wayans greet a live audience.\n\nFor the third and fourth seasons, an animated sequence and different logo were used. Cast members were superimposed over pictures hanging in an art gallery and interacted with them in different ways (spinning the canvas to put it right-side up, swinging the frame out as if it were a door, etc.). The final image was of the logo on a black canvas, which shattered to begin the show. The fifth season retained the logo, but depicted the cast members on various signs and billboards around a city (either New York or Chicago), ending with the logo displayed on a theater marquee.\n\nThe [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] group [[Heavy D & the Boyz]] performed two different versions of the opening theme. One version was used for the first two seasons and remixed for the fifth, while the other was featured in the third and fourth seasons.\n\n=== Live musical performances ===\n''In Living Color'' was known for its live music performances, which started in Season 2 with [[Queen Latifah]] as their first performer (appearing again in the third season). Additional musical acts who appeared were [[Heavy D]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Kris Kross]], [[En Vogue]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Da Youngsta's]], [[Monie Love]], [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]], [[3rd Bass]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Jodeci]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Father MC]], [[Gang Starr]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[Simple E]], [[Us3]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], [[Nice & Smooth]], [[Wreckx-n-Effect]], [[A.D.O.R.]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Showbiz and A.G.]], [[Patra (singer)|Patra]], [[Naughty By Nature]], [[Lords of the Underground]], [[Prince Markie Dee]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and [[Leaders of the New School]].\n\n=== The Fly Girls ===\nThe show employed an in-house dance troupe known as the \"Fly Girls\". The original lineup consisted of [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] (who became a choreographer and judge on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''), Cari French, Deidre Lang, Lisa Marie Todd, Barbara Lumpkin and Michelle Whitney-Morrison. [[Rosie Perez]] was the choreographer for the first four seasons. The most notable former Fly Girl was future actress/singer [[Jennifer Lopez]], who joined the show in its third season.\n\nThroughout the show's run, the Fly Girls frequently performed a dance routine to lead into commercial breaks and/or during the closing credits. In the first two seasons, they also performed a routine that immediately followed the opening sequence. Music was provided by an in-house DJ - [[Shawn Wayans]] (credited as SW-1) in the first two seasons, then [[Leroy \"Twist\" Casey|DJ Twist]] from season 3 onward.\n\nThe Fly Girls would sometimes be used as extras in sketches, or as part of an opening gag. In one sketch, they were shown performing open-heart surgery (in the sketch, the girls are dancing in order to pay their way through medical school). Another routine featured the three original female cast members dancing off-beat during the introduction of the show, when it was revealed that the regular Fly Girls were all bound and gagged and breaking through the door where Keenan Ivory Wayans enters.\n\nThree of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season in 1997.\n\n==Controversies==\nKeenen Ivory Wayans stopped appearing in sketches in 1992 after the end of the third season, over disputes with Fox about the network [[censorship|censoring]] the show's content and rerunning early episodes without his consultation. Wayans feared that Fox would ultimately decrease the [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] value of ''In Living Color''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=2007-10-17|edition=9|page=661|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}</ref> \n\nDamon went on to pursue a movie career around the same time, though he made occasional return appearances in the fourth season.

In the early years of ''In Living Color'', Rock was parodied as being the only African American cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (despite ''SNL'' also having [[Tim Meadows]] at the time). In an ''SNL'' episode honoring [[Mother's Day]], Rock's mother states that she is disappointed in him for not trying out for ''In Living Color'', to which Rock states he is happy with his job on ''SNL''.\n\nOther recurring guest stars in the fifth season include [[Nick Bakay]] (for ''The Dirty Dozens'' sketches) and [[Peter Marshall (game show host)|Peter Marshall]] (for several editions of ''East [[Hollywood Squares]]''). Rapper [[Biz Markie]] also appeared in various roles as a guest star in the fifth season, such as being in drag as Wanda the Ugly Woman's sister or as \"Dirty Dozens\" contestant Damian \"Foosball\" Franklin. [[Ed O'Neill]] made a cameo appearance as [[Al Bundy]] in a \"Dirty Dozens\" segment.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of In Living Color episodes}}\n\n==Syndication==\nOriginally produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]] on Fox, the series was in reruns on local affiliates for a few years, but has since become a longstanding mainstay on Fox's sister cable networks [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[FXX]]. In syndication, the series is distributed by Twentieth Television.\n\nReruns of the show also aired on BET from 2005\u20132008, and returned in 2010. Reruns have also aired on [[MTV2]], [[VH1]], [[nuvoTV]], and on BET-owned [[BET Her|Centric]].\n\nUnlike past runs on FX and the [[Viacom Media Networks]], the FXX cut of episodes are mostly uncut and censored. The music video parodies and spoken references to licensed songs have been reinstated, but the \"Bolt 45\" sketch, the \"drop the soap\" line, and the \"Men on Football\" sketch with the adlibbed lines about Richard Gere's and Carl Lewis's alleged homosexuality are still edited (though the facial ejaculation shot on \"Men on Fitness\" was reinstated), along with a line from the season five sketch \"Fire Marshall Bill at the Magic Show\" that makes reference to the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] (the missing line is, \"That's what they said about the World Trade Center, son. But me and my friend Abdul and a couple of pounds of plastique explosives showed them different.\" Bill's laugh and his catchphrase \"Lemme show ya somethin'\" was also cut abruptly), due to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].\n\n''The Best of In Living Color'' aired on [[MyNetworkTV]] from April 16 to June 18, 2008. Hosted by David Alan Grier, it was a retrospective featuring classic sketches, along with cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. The show aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central, after MyNetworkTV's sitcom ''[[Under One Roof (2008 TV series)|Under One Roof]]''.\n\nIn 2017, the show began airing reruns on [[Fusion TV|Fusion]] and Aspire.\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n*1990\u201391: #58 (10.31 rating)\n*1991\u201392: #49 (10.37 rating)\n*1992\u201393: #62 (9.67 rating)\n*1993\u201394: #71 (7.98 rating)\nNote: Ratings data courtesy of TVTango.com\n\n== Crossovers ==\n*At the 2006 [[BET Awards]] when the show returned from one of its commercial breaks, the show's host Damon Wayans played a character very reminiscent to \"Men on ...\" critic Blaine Edwards.\n*''In Living Color'' alums Damon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and David Alan Grier reprised some of their ''In Living Color'' characters on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':\n**Damon Wayans, a featured player during that show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 11)|eleventh season]], hosted an episode from ''SNL'''s 20th season in 1995, where he brought on two of his famous ''In Living Color'' characters: homeless wino Anton Jackson and gay film critic Blaine Edwards.\n**Jim Carrey auditioned to be one of the repertory members on ''SNL'' 's ill-fated [[Saturday Night Live (Season 6)|1980\u20131981 season]], but was dropped in favor of [[Charles Rocket]] (who later appeared in the [[1988 in film|1988]] film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' and the [[1994 in film|1994]] film ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' with Carrey). Carrey also auditioned for the 1985\u20131986 season (season eleven), but backed out after seeing a man threatening to jump from 30 Rockefeller Center, believing that the stress of working on ''Saturday Night Live'' would drive Carrey to suicide. Carrey hosted the season finale of ''SNL'''s 21st season in 1996, where he impersonated [[Fire Marshal Bill]] during the monologue. Carrey's most recent hosting stint, in October 2014, involved a Carrey family reunion sketch in which [[Cecily Strong]] plays Carrey's aunt, who is modeled after Fire Marshal Bill.<ref>{{cite web |title= Did You Get Every Jim Carrey Reference In 'SNL's 'Family Reunion' Sketch? |first= Josh |last= Kurp |date= October 26, 2014 |work= Uproxx |url= http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/10/did-you-get-every-jim-carrey-reference-in-snls-family-reunion-sketch/ }}</ref>\n**David Alan Grier first hosted ''SNL'' during season 21 and reprised his ''In Living Color'' role as \"[[Men on...]]\" critic Antoine Merriweather, which the end of the sketch included a surprise on-set appearance from Damon Wayans as Blaine.

Due to music licensing issues, some sketches have been edited to remove any and all mention of licensed songs, from characters waxing lyrical to entire performances (including the music video parodies and some of the Fly Girl dancing [[Interstitial program|interstitials]]). Additionally, the \"Bolt 45\" sketch (which aired one-time only on May 5, 1990) was omitted, and the \"soap\" portion of the \"drop the soap\" line in the second \"Men on Film\" sketch has been muted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n|-\n| Season 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n| April 6, 2004\n|-\n| Season 2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| September 28, 2004\n|-\n| Season 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n| May 10, 2005\n|-\n| Season 4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n| October 25, 2005\n|-\n| Season 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| April 11, 2006\n|}\n\n==Attempted revival==\n[[Image:In Living Color 2012 Logo.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''In Living Color'' 2012 logo.|alt=In Living Color 2012 logo.]]\nIn 2011, there were plans to make a revival of the original series that featured a new cast, characters, and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Deadline.com|date=October 28, 2011|title=Fox to Reboot 'In Living Color' with Keenan Ivory Wayans|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/10/fox-to-reboot-in-living-color-with-keenan-ivory-wayans|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox44.com/news/hollywood-hookup/new-in-living-color-fly-girls|work=Fox44.com|date=February 29, 2012|title=New 'In Living Color' |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=official>{{cite web|work=Fox.com|url=http://www.fox.com/programming/shows/?sh=in-living-color|title='In Living Color'|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The [[Television pilot|pilot episodes]] were hosted and executive produced by original series creator and cast member [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]].

[[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] created, wrote and starred in the program. The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with [[20th Century Fox Television]] and was taped at stage 7 at the [[Metromedia Square|Fox Television Center]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].\n\nThe title of the series was inspired by the [[NBC]] announcement of broadcasts being presented \"[[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|in living color]]\" during the 1960s, prior to mainstream [[color television]]. It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast was [[Black people|black]], unlike other sketch comedy shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', whose casts are mostly [[White people|white]]. It was controversial due to the Wayans' decision to portray black humor from the [[ghetto]] in a time when mainstream American tastes regarding black comedy had been set by more upscale shows such as ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', causing an eventual feud for control between Fox executives and the Wayans.\n\nOther members of the [[Wayans family]]\u2014[[Damon Wayans|Damon]], [[Kim Wayans|Kim]], [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]], and [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]]\u2014had regular roles, while brother [[Dwayne Wayans|Dwayne]] frequently appeared as an extra. The show also starred several previously unknown comedians and actors, including [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tommy Davidson]], [[David Alan Grier]], and [[T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h]]. The show introduced [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] as members of ''In Living Color''<nowiki/>'s dance troupe The Fly Girls, with actress [[Rosie Perez]] serving as choreographer. The show was immensely popular in its first two seasons, capturing more than a 10-point [[Nielsen rating]]; in the third and fourth seasons, ratings faltered as the Wayans brothers fell out with Fox network leadership over creative control and rights.\n\nThe series won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series]] in 1990. The series gained international prominence for its bold move and its all-time high ratings gained by airing a live, special episode as a [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogram]] for the halftime show of U.S. leader [[CBS]]'s live telecast of [[Super Bowl XXVI]], prompting the [[National Football League]] to book A-list acts for future game entertainment, starting with [[Michael Jackson]] the following year.<ref name=trib-goalofspectacle>{{cite news|title=Goal of spectacle colors NFL's thinking about Super Bowl halftime show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-06/business/ct-biz-0206-rosenthal--20110206_1_super-halftime-party-doritos-zaptime-halftime-show|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=30 January 2013|date=6 February 2011}}</ref> In 2018, a history of the show, ''Homey Don't Play That!'' by David Peisner, was released by [[37 INK]], an imprint of [[Simon & Schuster]].\n\n== Description and history ==\n\n=== Early history ===\nFollowing Keenen Ivory Wayans' success with ''[[Hollywood Shuffle]]'' and ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] approached Wayans to offer him his own show.<ref name= pokes>{{cite news |title= New Fox Show Pokes Fun at Black Stereotypes |publisher= Greensboro News & Record |location= Greensboro, North Carolina |work= Associated Press |page= B6 |date= April 12, 1990 |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EB191E9F73E3517&p_docnum=837&p_queryname=3 }}</ref> Wayans wanted to produce a variety show similar to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', but with a cast of people of color that took chances with its content.<ref name= ready>{{cite news |title= Is prime time ready for rudeness?

It became renowned for [[parody]], especially of race relations in the [[United States]]. For instance, Carrey was frequently used to ridicule white musicians such as [[Snow (musician)|Snow]] and [[Vanilla Ice]], who performed in genres more commonly associated with black people. The Wayans themselves often played exaggerated black ghetto stereotypes for humor and effect. A sketch parodying ''[[Soul Train]]'' mocked the show as ''Old Train'', suggesting the show (along with its host, [[Don Cornelius]]) was out of touch and only appealed to the elderly and the dead. When asked about the show's use of stereotypes of black culture for comedy, Wayans said, \"Half of comedy is making fun of stereotypes. They only get critical when I do it. [[Woody Allen]] has been having fun with his culture for years, and no one says anything about it. [[Martin Scorsese]], his films basically deal with the Italian community, and no one ever says anything to him. [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]], all of his films parody upscale white suburban life. Nobody says anything to him. When I do it, then all of a sudden it becomes a racial issue. You know what I mean? It's my culture, and I'm entitled to poke fun at the stereotypes that I didn't create in the first place. I don't even concern myself with that type of criticism, because it's racist in itself.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Humor is in 'Living Color': Writers Plan to Capitalize on Funny Cultural Stereotypes |work= Daily News of Los Angeles |date= April 15, 1990 |first= Yardena |last= Arar |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=0EF5BB34E44340CF&p_docnum=863&p_queryname=3 |page= L25 }}</ref>\n\nProminent skits:\n*  \"The Homeboy Shopping Network\", featuring Damon and Keenan as streetwise criminals operating an unlicensed, [[Home Shopping Network]]-style shopping network out of the back of their van to sell stolen goods.\n*  \"Fire Marshal Bill\", featuring Carrey as an incompetent, dangerously inept [[fire marshal]].\n*  \"[[Men on...|Men on Film]]\", featuring Damon and Grier as [[effeminate]] black film critics with exaggerated physical motions, such as \"two snaps up\".\n*  \"Homey D.

However, after the band [[Living Colour]] claimed in a lawsuit that the show stole the band's logo and name,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-08/entertainment/ca-455_1_group-living-colour |title=Living Colour band sues Fox |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 8, 1990 |accessdate=September 3, 2010}}</ref> the logo was changed to one with rather plain-type letters of three colors.  The show title itself is a homage to the [[Logo_of_NBC#Introduction_of_the_Peacock_.281956.E2.80.931960.29|NBC Peacock]] tag line, \"The following program is brought to you in living color\" from the 1960s when television was transitioning from black & white to color TV.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnvDVaiHXjM NBC Peacock clips] (posted to YouTube on Nov 4, 2011)</ref>\n\nIn the first two seasons, the opening sequence was set in a room covered with painters' tarps. Each cast member, wearing black-and-white, played with brightly colored paint in a different way (throwing paintballs at the camera by hand, [[spray painting]] the lens, using a roller to cover the camera lens, etc.). The sequence ended with a segue to a set built to resemble the rooftop of an apartment building, where the show's dancers performed a routine and opened a door to let Keenen Ivory Wayans greet a live audience.\n\nFor the third and fourth seasons, an animated sequence and different logo were used. Cast members were superimposed over pictures hanging in an art gallery and interacted with them in different ways (spinning the canvas to put it right-side up, swinging the frame out as if it were a door, etc.). The final image was of the logo on a black canvas, which shattered to begin the show. The fifth season retained the logo, but depicted the cast members on various signs and billboards around a city (either New York or Chicago), ending with the logo displayed on a theater marquee.\n\nThe [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] group [[Heavy D & the Boyz]] performed two different versions of the opening theme. One version was used for the first two seasons and remixed for the fifth, while the other was featured in the third and fourth seasons.\n\n=== Live musical performances ===\n''In Living Color'' was known for its live music performances, which started in Season 2 with [[Queen Latifah]] as their first performer (appearing again in the third season). Additional musical acts who appeared were [[Heavy D]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Kris Kross]], [[En Vogue]], [[Eazy-E]], [[Da Youngsta's]], [[Monie Love]], [[Onyx (hip hop group)|Onyx]], [[3rd Bass]], [[MC Lyte]], [[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]], [[Jodeci]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Father MC]], [[Gang Starr]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[Simple E]], [[Us3]], [[Digable Planets]], [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]], [[Nice & Smooth]], [[Wreckx-n-Effect]], [[A.D.O.R.]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Showbiz and A.G.]], [[Patra (singer)|Patra]], [[Naughty By Nature]], [[Lords of the Underground]], [[Prince Markie Dee]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], and [[Leaders of the New School]].\n\n=== The Fly Girls ===\nThe show employed an in-house dance troupe known as the \"Fly Girls\". The original lineup consisted of [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] (who became a choreographer and judge on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''), Cari French, Deidre Lang, Lisa Marie Todd, Barbara Lumpkin and Michelle Whitney-Morrison. [[Rosie Perez]] was the choreographer for the first four seasons. The most notable former Fly Girl was future actress/singer [[Jennifer Lopez]], who joined the show in its third season.\n\nThroughout the show's run, the Fly Girls frequently performed a dance routine to lead into commercial breaks and/or during the closing credits. In the first two seasons, they also performed a routine that immediately followed the opening sequence. Music was provided by an in-house DJ - [[Shawn Wayans]] (credited as SW-1) in the first two seasons, then [[Leroy \"Twist\" Casey|DJ Twist]] from season 3 onward.\n\nThe Fly Girls would sometimes be used as extras in sketches, or as part of an opening gag. In one sketch, they were shown performing open-heart surgery (in the sketch, the girls are dancing in order to pay their way through medical school). Another routine featured the three original female cast members dancing off-beat during the introduction of the show, when it was revealed that the regular Fly Girls were all bound and gagged and breaking through the door where Keenan Ivory Wayans enters.\n\nThree of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season in 1997.\n\n==Controversies==\nKeenen Ivory Wayans stopped appearing in sketches in 1992 after the end of the third season, over disputes with Fox about the network [[censorship|censoring]] the show's content and rerunning early episodes without his consultation. Wayans feared that Fox would ultimately decrease the [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] value of ''In Living Color''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=2007-10-17|edition=9|page=661|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}</ref> \n\nDamon went on to pursue a movie career around the same time, though he made occasional return appearances in the fourth season.

In the early years of ''In Living Color'', Rock was parodied as being the only African American cast member on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (despite ''SNL'' also having [[Tim Meadows]] at the time). In an ''SNL'' episode honoring [[Mother's Day]], Rock's mother states that she is disappointed in him for not trying out for ''In Living Color'', to which Rock states he is happy with his job on ''SNL''.\n\nOther recurring guest stars in the fifth season include [[Nick Bakay]] (for ''The Dirty Dozens'' sketches) and [[Peter Marshall (game show host)|Peter Marshall]] (for several editions of ''East [[Hollywood Squares]]''). Rapper [[Biz Markie]] also appeared in various roles as a guest star in the fifth season, such as being in drag as Wanda the Ugly Woman's sister or as \"Dirty Dozens\" contestant Damian \"Foosball\" Franklin. [[Ed O'Neill]] made a cameo appearance as [[Al Bundy]] in a \"Dirty Dozens\" segment.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Main|List of In Living Color episodes}}\n\n==Syndication==\nOriginally produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]] on Fox, the series was in reruns on local affiliates for a few years, but has since become a longstanding mainstay on Fox's sister cable networks [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[FXX]]. In syndication, the series is distributed by Twentieth Television.\n\nReruns of the show also aired on BET from 2005\u20132008, and returned in 2010. Reruns have also aired on [[MTV2]], [[VH1]], [[nuvoTV]], and on BET-owned [[BET Her|Centric]].\n\nUnlike past runs on FX and the [[Viacom Media Networks]], the FXX cut of episodes are mostly uncut and censored. The music video parodies and spoken references to licensed songs have been reinstated, but the \"Bolt 45\" sketch, the \"drop the soap\" line, and the \"Men on Football\" sketch with the adlibbed lines about Richard Gere's and Carl Lewis's alleged homosexuality are still edited (though the facial ejaculation shot on \"Men on Fitness\" was reinstated), along with a line from the season five sketch \"Fire Marshall Bill at the Magic Show\" that makes reference to the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] (the missing line is, \"That's what they said about the World Trade Center, son. But me and my friend Abdul and a couple of pounds of plastique explosives showed them different.\" Bill's laugh and his catchphrase \"Lemme show ya somethin'\" was also cut abruptly), due to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].\n\n''The Best of In Living Color'' aired on [[MyNetworkTV]] from April 16 to June 18, 2008. Hosted by David Alan Grier, it was a retrospective featuring classic sketches, along with cast interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. The show aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm Eastern/7:30 pm Central, after MyNetworkTV's sitcom ''[[Under One Roof (2008 TV series)|Under One Roof]]''.\n\nIn 2017, the show began airing reruns on [[Fusion TV|Fusion]] and Aspire.\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n*1990\u201391: #58 (10.31 rating)\n*1991\u201392: #49 (10.37 rating)\n*1992\u201393: #62 (9.67 rating)\n*1993\u201394: #71 (7.98 rating)\nNote: Ratings data courtesy of TVTango.com\n\n== Crossovers ==\n*At the 2006 [[BET Awards]] when the show returned from one of its commercial breaks, the show's host Damon Wayans played a character very reminiscent to \"Men on ...\" critic Blaine Edwards.\n*''In Living Color'' alums Damon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and David Alan Grier reprised some of their ''In Living Color'' characters on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'':\n**Damon Wayans, a featured player during that show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 11)|eleventh season]], hosted an episode from ''SNL'''s 20th season in 1995, where he brought on two of his famous ''In Living Color'' characters: homeless wino Anton Jackson and gay film critic Blaine Edwards.\n**Jim Carrey auditioned to be one of the repertory members on ''SNL'' 's ill-fated [[Saturday Night Live (Season 6)|1980\u20131981 season]], but was dropped in favor of [[Charles Rocket]] (who later appeared in the [[1988 in film|1988]] film ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' and the [[1994 in film|1994]] film ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' with Carrey). Carrey also auditioned for the 1985\u20131986 season (season eleven), but backed out after seeing a man threatening to jump from 30 Rockefeller Center, believing that the stress of working on ''Saturday Night Live'' would drive Carrey to suicide. Carrey hosted the season finale of ''SNL'''s 21st season in 1996, where he impersonated [[Fire Marshal Bill]] during the monologue. Carrey's most recent hosting stint, in October 2014, involved a Carrey family reunion sketch in which [[Cecily Strong]] plays Carrey's aunt, who is modeled after Fire Marshal Bill.<ref>{{cite web |title= Did You Get Every Jim Carrey Reference In 'SNL's 'Family Reunion' Sketch? |first= Josh |last= Kurp |date= October 26, 2014 |work= Uproxx |url= http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/10/did-you-get-every-jim-carrey-reference-in-snls-family-reunion-sketch/ }}</ref>\n**David Alan Grier first hosted ''SNL'' during season 21 and reprised his ''In Living Color'' role as \"[[Men on...]]\" critic Antoine Merriweather, which the end of the sketch included a surprise on-set appearance from Damon Wayans as Blaine. Grier hosted ''SNL'' on December 9, 1995 (season 21) and March 18, 1997 (season 22).\n*Jamie Foxx reprised his role as Wanda in a short segment at the 2009 BET Awards.\n* In 1997, three of the Fly Girls also appeared in the eleventh episode of ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'''s second season.\n*In the 1997 film ''[[Liar Liar]]'', Jim Carrey reprised his \"Fire Marshal Bill\" character (albeit with no lines) in the background of one of the closing scenes.\n*The February 10, 2001 episode of ''Saturday Night Live'' hosted by Jennifer Lopez included a sketch where Lopez \"reunited\" with the Fly Girls (played by [[Rachel Dratch]], [[Jerry Minor]] and [[Tracy Morgan]]).\n\n==Home media==\n[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] has released all five seasons of ''In Living Color'' on DVD in Region 1. Due to music licensing issues, some sketches have been edited to remove any and all mention of licensed songs, from characters waxing lyrical to entire performances (including the music video parodies and some of the Fly Girl dancing [[Interstitial program|interstitials]]). Additionally, the \"Bolt 45\" sketch (which aired one-time only on May 5, 1990) was omitted, and the \"soap\" portion of the \"drop the soap\" line in the second \"Men on Film\" sketch has been muted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n|-\n| Season 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n| April 6, 2004\n|-\n| Season 2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| September 28, 2004\n|-\n| Season 3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28\n| May 10, 2005\n|-\n| Season 4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n| October 25, 2005\n|-\n| Season 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| April 11, 2006\n|}\n\n==Attempted revival==\n[[Image:In Living Color 2012 Logo.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''In Living Color'' 2012 logo.|alt=In Living Color 2012 logo.]]\nIn 2011, there were plans to make a revival of the original series that featured a new cast, characters, and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Deadline.com|date=October 28, 2011|title=Fox to Reboot 'In Living Color' with Keenan Ivory Wayans|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/10/fox-to-reboot-in-living-color-with-keenan-ivory-wayans|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox44.com/news/hollywood-hookup/new-in-living-color-fly-girls|work=Fox44.com|date=February 29, 2012|title=New 'In Living Color' |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=official>{{cite web|work=Fox.com|url=http://www.fox.com/programming/shows/?sh=in-living-color|title='In Living Color'|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The [[Television pilot|pilot episodes]] were hosted and executive produced by original series creator and cast member [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]].

Andy is assigned to the case of Ben Litkin, a classmate of Jacob's who is found stabbed to death in the park near their middle school. Despite concerns from Attorney General Lynn Canavan ([[Sakina Jaffrey]]) and Andy's colleage and rival Neal Logiudice ([[Liev Schreiber]]) that Andy's association with the school will cause a conflict of interest, he insists on prosecuting the case. Although Laurie and Andy are concerned of the effect Ben's death may have on Jacob, Jacob seems unperturbed and expresses to his parents that Ben was unlikeable. Andy and Detective Paula Duffy ([[Betty Gabriel]]) question students at the school, but are unable to figure out a motive for the murder. Duffy discovers a possible suspect, Leonard Patz ([[Daniel Henshall]]), a convicted sexual predator, but Andy is advised against bringing in him until they have solid evidence.
