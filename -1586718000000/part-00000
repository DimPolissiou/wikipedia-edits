His main concern was that without any women inhabitants their was no chance at continuing to populate the city, and if without the ability to maintain its population, the city may not last longer than a generation. On the advice of the senate the Romans then set out into the surrounding regions in the search for wives to establish families with. The Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with the all the peoples that they appealed to including the [[Sabines]], who populated the neighboring areas. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans. Consequently, the Romans devised a plan to abduct the Sabine women during the festival of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune Equester]]. They planned and announced a festival of games to attract people from all the nearby towns. According to [[Livy]], many people from Rome's neighboring towns including folk from the [[Caenina (Town)|Caeninenses]], [[Crustumerium|Crustumini]], and [[Antemnae|Antemnates]], attended the festival along with the Sabines, eager to see the newfound city for themselves. At the festival, Romulus gave a signal by \"rising and folding his cloak and then throwing it round him again,\" at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men.'''<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=1|title=Titus Livius (Livy), The History of Rome, Book 1, chapter pr|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref>''' In total, thirty Sabine women were abducted by the Romans at the festival.

Romulus and the Romans met the Caeninenses in battle, killed their king, and routed their army. Romulus later attacked Caenina and took it upon the first assault. Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as ''[[spolia opima]]''. According to the [[Roman triumph#The Fasti Triumphales|Fasti Triumphales]], Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 1.10]</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the ''Fasti Triumphales,'' Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates.\n\nThe Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town captured.\n\nRoman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonists]] subsequently were sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women).\n\nThe Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, [[Titus Tatius]]. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of [[Tarpeia]], daughter of [[Spurius Tarpeius]], Roman governor of the citadel on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for \"what they bore on their arms\", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was buried on or thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the [[Tarpeian Rock]].\n\nThe Romans [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|attacked]] the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by [[Hostus Hostilius]], the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. They retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men by promising to build a temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Stator]] on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning.\n\n[[File:Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld 004.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld]]]]\n\nAt this point in the story, however, the Sabine women intervened:\n\n{{bquote|[They], from the outrage on whom the war originated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity of their sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage to throw themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, to part the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring their fathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, \"that as fathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other with impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one their grandchildren, the other their children.

Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later.\n\nThe new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a33 1:33]</ref>\n\n== Historical Analysis ==\nThe motivation behind the abduction of the Sabine women is contested among ancient sources. Livy writes that Rome's motivation for abducting the Sabine women was solely to increase the cities population and claims that no direct sexual assault took place during the abduction. Livy says that Romulus offered the Sabine women free choice as well as civic and property rights. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to them each in person, declaring \"that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and \u2014dearest of all to human nature-would be the mothers of freemen.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=1|title=Titus Livius (Livy), The History of Rome, Book 1, chapter pr|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> Scholars like [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] argue that it was an attempt to secure an alliance with the Sabine's through the women's newly founded relationships with Roman men.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Robert|date=1995|title=Livy's Sabine Women and the Ideal of Concordia|url=|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association|volume=125|pages=291\u2013319|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Livy's account is reinforced in some ways through the works of [[Cicero]]. In Cicero's work De re publica, he reiterates Livy's view that the plan to abduct the Sabine women at the festival was done in order \"to strengthen the new state\" and \"safeguard the resources of his kingdom and people.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike Livy, Cicero, and Dionysius, [[Ovid]] looks at the abduction of the Sabine as an avenue for the men of Rome to fulfill their sexual desires rather than an attempt at taking wives to produce children for the city.<ref name=\":1\" /> While he does make note of the issue surrounding Rome's lack of women, he does not make it out to be a factor in the planning of the abduction.\n\n==Artistic representations==\nMany treatments of the legend combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-[[Nude (art)|nude figures]], in intensely passionate struggle.\n\nThe subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme.  It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian ''[[cassone|cassoni]]'' and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the [[New Testament]] was afforded by the theme of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].\n\n=== Edgar Degas ===\n[[Edgar Degas]] painted ''The Rape of the Sabines''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edgar-degas.org/The-Rape-of-the-Sabines.html|title=The Rape of the Sabines \u2013 Edgar Degas \u2013 www.edgar-degas.org|website=www.edgar-degas.org|access-date=2016-03-26}}</ref> (after [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]]), c. 1861\u20131862.\n\n\"The masters must be copied over and over again\", Degas said, \"and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature.\" Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen.

The respective rapes of [[Proserpina]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] were also mooted as possible themes. It was eventually decided that the sculpture was to be identified as one of the Sabine virgins.\n\nThe work is signed <small>OPVS IOANNIS BOLONII FLANDRI MDLXXXII</small> (\"The work of Johannes of Boulogne of [[Flanders]], 1582\"). An early preparatory [[bronze]] featuring only two figures is in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]]. Giambologna then revised the scheme, this time with a third figure, in two wax models now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. The artist's full-scale [[gesso]] for the finished sculpture, executed in 1582, is on display at the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in [[Florence]].\n\nThe woman and the kneeling man reference figures from the ancient sculpture ''[[Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/673 673] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/673 }}</ref>\n\nBronze reductions of the sculpture, produced in Giambologna's own studio and imitated by others, were a staple of connoisseurs' collections into the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Nicolas Poussin - L'Enl\u00e8vement des Sabines (1634-5).jpg|thumb|''The Abduction of the Sabine Women'', by [[Nicolas Poussin]], (1634\u20131635) ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\n[[File:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'', by Nicolas Poussin, Rome, 1637\u201338 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]\n\n===Nicolas Poussin===\n[[Nicolas Poussin]] produced two major versions of this subject.

His main concern was that without any women inhabitants their was no chance at continuing to populate the city, and if without the ability to maintain its population, the city may not last longer than a generation. On the advice of the senate the Romans then set out into the surrounding regions in the search for wives to establish families with. The Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with the all the peoples that they appealed to including the [[Sabines]], who populated the neighboring areas. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans. Consequently, the Romans devised a plan to abduct the Sabine women during the festival of [[Neptune (mythology)#Neptunus equestris|Neptune Equester]]. They planned and announced a festival of games to attract people from all the nearby towns. According to [[Livy]], many people from Rome's neighboring towns including folk from the [[Caenina (Town)|Caeninenses]], [[Crustumerium|Crustumini]], and [[Antemnae|Antemnates]], attended the festival along with the Sabines, eager to see the newfound city for themselves. At the festival, Romulus gave a signal by \"rising and folding his cloak and then throwing it round him again,\" at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men.'''<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=1|title=Titus Livius (Livy), The History of Rome, Book 1, chapter pr|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref>''' '''I'''n total, thirty Sabine women were abducted by the Romans at the festival.

Romulus and the Romans met the Caeninenses in battle, killed their king, and routed their army. Romulus later attacked Caenina and took it upon the first assault. Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to [[Feretrius|Jupiter Feretrius]] (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as ''[[spolia opima]]''. According to the [[Roman triumph#The Fasti Triumphales|Fasti Triumphales]], Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a10 1.10]</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the ''Fasti Triumphales,'' Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates.\n\nThe Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town captured.\n\nRoman [[Colonia (Roman)|colonists]] subsequently were sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women).\n\nThe Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, [[Titus Tatius]]. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of [[Tarpeia]], daughter of [[Spurius Tarpeius]], Roman governor of the citadel on the [[Capitoline Hill]]. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for \"what they bore on their arms\", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was buried on or thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the [[Tarpeian Rock]].\n\nThe Romans [[Battle of the Lacus Curtius|attacked]] the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by [[Hostus Hostilius]], the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. They retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men by promising to build a temple to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Stator]] on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning.\n\n[[File:Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld 004.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' by [[Johann Heinrich Sch\u00f6nfeld]]]]\n\nAt this point in the story, however, the Sabine women intervened:\n\n{{bquote|[They], from the outrage on whom the war originated, with hair dishevelled and garments rent, the timidity of their sex being overcome by such dreadful scenes, had the courage to throw themselves amid the flying weapons, and making a rush across, to part the incensed armies, and assuage their fury; imploring their fathers on the one side, their husbands on the other, \"that as fathers-in-law and sons-in-law they would not contaminate each other with impious blood, nor stain their offspring with parricide, the one their grandchildren, the other their children.

Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later.\n\nThe new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-h/19725-h.htm#a33 1:33]</ref>\n\n== Historical Analysis ==\nThe motivation behind the abduction of the Sabine women is contested among ancient sources. Livy writes that Rome's motivation for abducting the Sabine women was solely to increase the cities population and claims that no direct sexual assault took place during the abduction. Livy says that Romulus offered the Sabine women free choice as well as civic and property rights. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to them each in person, declaring \"that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and \u2014dearest of all to human nature-would be the mothers of freemen.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0026:book=1|title=Titus Livius (Livy), The History of Rome, Book 1, chapter pr|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> Scholars like [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] argue that it was an attempt to secure an alliance with the Sabine's through the women's newly founded relationships with Roman men.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Robert|date=1995|title=Livy's Sabine Women and the Ideal of Concordia|url=|journal=Transactions of the American Philological Association|volume=125|pages=291\u2013319|via=JSTOR}}</ref> Livy's account is reinforced in some ways through the works of [[Cicero]]. In Cicero's work De re publica, he reiterates Livy's view that the plan to abduct the Sabine women at the festival was done in order \"to strengthen the new state\" and \"safeguard the resources of his kingdom and people.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike Livy, Cicero, and Dionysius, [[Ovid]] looks at the abduction of the Sabine as an avenue for the men of Rome to fulfill their sexual desires rather than an attempt at taking wives to produce children for the city.<ref name=\":1\" /> While he does make note of the issue surrounding Rome's lack of women, he does not make it out to be a factor in the planning of the abduction.\n\n==Artistic representations==\nMany treatments of the legend combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-[[Nude (art)|nude figures]], in intensely passionate struggle.\n\nThe subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme.  It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian ''[[cassone|cassoni]]'' and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the [[New Testament]] was afforded by the theme of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].\n\n=== Edgar Degas ===\n[[Edgar Degas]] painted ''The Rape of the Sabines''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edgar-degas.org/The-Rape-of-the-Sabines.html|title=The Rape of the Sabines \u2013 Edgar Degas \u2013 www.edgar-degas.org|website=www.edgar-degas.org|access-date=2016-03-26}}</ref> (after [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]]), c. 1861\u20131862.\n\n\"The masters must be copied over and over again\", Degas said, \"and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature.\" Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen.

The respective rapes of [[Proserpina]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] were also mooted as possible themes. It was eventually decided that the sculpture was to be identified as one of the Sabine virgins.\n\nThe work is signed <small>OPVS IOANNIS BOLONII FLANDRI MDLXXXII</small> (\"The work of Johannes of Boulogne of [[Flanders]], 1582\"). An early preparatory [[bronze]] featuring only two figures is in the [[Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]]. Giambologna then revised the scheme, this time with a third figure, in two wax models now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London. The artist's full-scale [[gesso]] for the finished sculpture, executed in 1582, is on display at the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]] in [[Florence]].\n\nThe woman and the kneeling man reference figures from the ancient sculpture ''[[Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=De la Croix |first1=Horst |last2=Tansey |first2=Richard G. |last3=Kirkpatrick |first3=Diane |title=Gardner's Art Through the Ages |date=1991 |publisher=Thomson/Wadsworth |isbn=0-15-503769-2 |edition=9th |p=[https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/673 673] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gardnersartthrou00gard/page/673 }}</ref>\n\nBronze reductions of the sculpture, produced in Giambologna's own studio and imitated by others, were a staple of connoisseurs' collections into the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Nicolas Poussin - L'Enl\u00e8vement des Sabines (1634-5).jpg|thumb|''The Abduction of the Sabine Women'', by [[Nicolas Poussin]], (1634\u20131635) ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\n[[File:Poussin RapeSabineLouvre.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of the Sabine Women'', by Nicolas Poussin, Rome, 1637\u201338 ([[Louvre Museum]])]]\n\n===Nicolas Poussin===\n[[Nicolas Poussin]] produced two major versions of this subject.

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], and performed as a solo piece by McCartney. When discussing the song, McCartney has said that the lyrics were inspired by hearing the call of a [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] in [[Rishikesh|Rishikesh, India]], and alternatively by the unfortunate state of [[race relations]] in the United States in the 1960s.\n\n==Origins==\n{{listen|filename=Johann Sebastian Bach - Suite BWV 996, E Minor - V Bourr\u00e9e.ogg|title= Lute Suite No. 1 \u2013 BWV 996, E Minor \u2013 V Bourr\u00e9e|description=Performed on a [[lautenwerck]] by [[Martha Goldstein]]|format=[[Ogg]]|pos=left}}\nMcCartney explained on ''[[Chaos and Creation at Abbey Road]]'', aired in 2005, that the guitar accompaniment for \"Blackbird\" was inspired by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Bourr\u00e9e in E minor]]'', a well-known lute piece, often played on the classical guitar. As teenagers, he and [[George Harrison]] tried to learn ''Bourr\u00e9e'' as a \"show off\" piece. The ''Bourr\u00e9e'' is distinguished by melody and bass notes played simultaneously on the upper and lower strings. McCartney adapted a segment of the ''Bourr\u00e9e'' (reharmonised into the original's [[relative major]] key of [[G major|G]]) as the opening of \"Blackbird\", and carried the musical idea throughout the song.\n\nThe first night his future wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] stayed at his home, McCartney played \"Blackbird\" for the fans camped outside his house.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=256fn}} The [[fingerpicking]] technique that McCartney uses in the song was taught to him by folk singer [[Donovan]].\n\n==Meaning and interpretation==\nSince composing \"Blackbird\" in 1968, McCartney has given various statements regarding both his inspiration for the song and its meaning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/115751-re-meet-the-beatles-the-records-day-four-1968-1969/P1/ |title=The Records, Day Four: 1968\u20131969|date=11 November 2009|first=James|last=Flemming|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref> In one of these scenarios, he has said he was inspired by hearing the call of a [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] one morning when the Beatles were studying [[Transcendental Meditation]] in [[The Beatles in India|Rishikesh, India]].{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}} In another, he recalls writing it in Scotland as a response to racial tensions escalating in the United States during the spring of 1968.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=190}}\n\nIn May 2002, following a show in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], McCartney discussed the song with [[KCRW]] DJ [[Chris Douridas]], saying:\n\n<blockquote>I had been doing some [poetry readings] in the last year or so because I've got a poetry book out called ''Blackbird Singing'', and when I would read \"Blackbird\", I would always try and think of some explanation to tell the people \u2026 So, I was doing explanations, and I actually just remembered why I'd written \"Blackbird\", you know, that I'd been, I was in Scotland playing on my guitar, and I remembered this whole idea of \"you were only waiting for this moment to arise\" was about, you know, the black people's struggle in the southern states, and I was using the symbolism of a blackbird. It's not really about a blackbird whose wings are broken, you know, it's a bit more symbolic.<ref>Paul McCartney, Interview with KCRW's Chris Douridas, 25 May 2002 episode of New Ground (17:50\u201319:00)</ref><ref>KCRW, \"New Ground\" with Chris Douridas, 25 May 2002 (17:50\u201319:00), [http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/gz/gz020525paul_mccartney \"KCRW Archive\"], [http://www.kcrw.com/media-player/mediaPlayer2.html?type=audio&id=gz020525paul_mccartney \"Audio\"]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2018, McCartney further elaborated on the song's meaning, explaining that \"blackbird\" should be interpreted as \"black girl\",<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u97_inloBmY Paul McCartney, Interview with GQ, Sept 2018 (16:35\u201317:17)]</ref> in the context of the civil rights troubles in southern 1960s US.\n\nA third scenario came from the recollection of his stepmother, Angie McCartney.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}} She said that McCartney wrote it for her elderly mother, Edith Stopforth, who was staying at [[Jim and Mary McCartney|Jim McCartney]]'s house while recovering from a long illness. Angie recalled that McCartney visited the house and sat at Edith's bedside, where Edith told him that she would listen to a bird singing at night.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}}\n\nThe lyrics have invited similarly varied interpretations \u2013 as a nature song, a message in support of the [[Black Power movement]], or a love song.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=317}} Writing in the 1990s, [[Ian MacDonald]] dismissed the idea that \"Blackbird\" was intended as \"a metaphor for the black civil rights struggle\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=256fn}} Noting instead the composition's romantic qualities, MacDonald said that the early-morning bird song \"translates \u2026 into a succinct metaphor for awakening on a deeper level\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=256, 256fn}} However, during an informal rehearsal at EMI Studios on 22 November 1968, before he and Donovan took part in a [[Mary Hopkin]] recording session, McCartney played \"Blackbird\", telling Donovan that he wrote it after having \"read something in the paper about the riots\" and that he meant the black \"bird\" to symbolise a black woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VrcsjDUfGw#|title=Paul McCartney & Donovan \u2013 Postcard Sessions 1968|date=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlong with McCartney's \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\", \"Blackbird\" was one of several White Album songs that [[Charles Manson]] interpreted as the Beatles' prophecy of an apocalyptic race war that would lead to him and his \"[[Manson Family|Family]]\" of followers ruling the US on countercultural principles. Manson interpreted the lyrics' repetition of the word \"rise\" as a call to black Americans to wage war on their white counterparts, and instructed his followers to commit a series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969 to trigger such a conflict.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=489\u201390}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe song was recorded on 11 June 1968 at [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London,{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=255}} with [[George Martin]] as the [[record producer|producer]] and [[Geoff Emerick]] as the [[audio engineer]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=137}} It is a solo performance with McCartney playing a [[C.

McCartney also said the same in The Beatles' Anthology documentary. Emerick recalls as being mic'd up separately.<ref>''Recording the Beatles'', pg. 484</ref> Footage included in the bonus content on disc two of the 2009 remaster of the album shows McCartney tapping both his feet alternately while performing the song.\n\nThe mono version contains bird sounds different from the stereo recording, and was originally issued on a mono incarnation of ''The Beatles'' (it has since been issued worldwide as part of ''[[The Beatles in Mono]]'' CD box set).

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], and performed as a solo piece by McCartney. When discussing the song, McCartney has said that the lyrics were inspired by hearing the call of a [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] in [[Rishikesh|Rishikesh, India]], and alternatively by the unfortunate state of [[race relations]] in the United States in the 1960s.\n\n==Origins==\n{{listen|filename=Johann Sebastian Bach - Suite BWV 996, E Minor - V Bourr\u00e9e.ogg|title= Lute Suite No. 1 \u2013 BWV 996, E Minor \u2013 V Bourr\u00e9e|description=Performed on a [[lautenwerck]] by [[Martha Goldstein]]|format=[[Ogg]]|pos=left}}\nMcCartney explained on ''[[Chaos and Creation at Abbey Road]]'', aired in 2005, that the guitar accompaniment for \"Blackbird\" was inspired by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Bourr\u00e9e in E minor]]'', a well-known lute piece, often played on the classical guitar. As teenagers, he and [[George Harrison]] tried to learn ''Bourr\u00e9e'' as a \"show off\" piece. The ''Bourr\u00e9e'' is distinguished by melody and bass notes played simultaneously on the upper and lower strings. McCartney adapted a segment of the ''Bourr\u00e9e'' (reharmonised into the original's [[relative major]] key of [[G major|G]]) as the opening of \"Blackbird\", and carried the musical idea throughout the song.\n\nThe first night his future wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] stayed at his home, McCartney played \"Blackbird\" for the fans camped outside his house.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=256fn}} The [[fingerpicking]] technique that McCartney uses in the song was taught to him by folk singer [[Donovan]].\n\n==Meaning and interpretation==\nSince composing \"Blackbird\" in 1968, McCartney has given various statements regarding both his inspiration for the song and its meaning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/115751-re-meet-the-beatles-the-records-day-four-1968-1969/P1/ |title=The Records, Day Four: 1968\u20131969|date=11 November 2009|first=James|last=Flemming|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref> In one of these scenarios, he has said he was inspired by hearing the call of a [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] one morning when the Beatles were studying [[Transcendental Meditation]] in [[The Beatles in India|Rishikesh, India]].{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}} In another, he recalls writing it in Scotland as a response to racial tensions escalating in the United States during the spring of 1968.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=190}}\n\nIn May 2002, following a show in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], McCartney discussed the song with [[KCRW]] DJ [[Chris Douridas]], saying:\n\n<blockquote>I had been doing some [poetry readings] in the last year or so because I've got a poetry book out called ''Blackbird Singing'', and when I would read \"Blackbird\", I would always try and think of some explanation to tell the people \u2026 So, I was doing explanations, and I actually just remembered why I'd written \"Blackbird\", you know, that I'd been, I was in Scotland playing on my guitar, and I remembered this whole idea of \"you were only waiting for this moment to arise\" was about, you know, the black people's struggle in the southern states, and I was using the symbolism of a blackbird. It's not really about a blackbird whose wings are broken, you know, it's a bit more symbolic.<ref>Paul McCartney, Interview with KCRW's Chris Douridas, 25 May 2002 episode of New Ground (17:50\u201319:00)</ref><ref>KCRW, \"New Ground\" with Chris Douridas, 25 May 2002 (17:50\u201319:00), [http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/gz/gz020525paul_mccartney \"KCRW Archive\"], [http://www.kcrw.com/media-player/mediaPlayer2.html?type=audio&id=gz020525paul_mccartney \"Audio\"]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2018, McCartney further elaborated on the song's meaning, explaining that \"blackbird\" should be interpreted as \"black girl\" <ref>Paul McCartney, Interview with GQ, Sept 2018 (16:35\u201317:17), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u97_inloBmY]</ref>, in the context of the civil rights troubles in southern 1960s US.\n\nA third scenario came from the recollection of his stepmother, Angie McCartney.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}} She said that McCartney wrote it for her elderly mother, Edith Stopforth, who was staying at [[Jim and Mary McCartney|Jim McCartney]]'s house while recovering from a long illness. Angie recalled that McCartney visited the house and sat at Edith's bedside, where Edith told him that she would listen to a bird singing at night.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}}\n\nThe lyrics have invited similarly varied interpretations \u2013 as a nature song, a message in support of the [[Black Power movement]], or a love song.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=317}} Writing in the 1990s, [[Ian MacDonald]] dismissed the idea that \"Blackbird\" was intended as \"a metaphor for the black civil rights struggle\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=256fn}} Noting instead the composition's romantic qualities, MacDonald said that the early-morning bird song \"translates \u2026 into a succinct metaphor for awakening on a deeper level\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=256, 256fn}} However, during an informal rehearsal at EMI Studios on 22 November 1968, before he and Donovan took part in a [[Mary Hopkin]] recording session, McCartney played \"Blackbird\", telling Donovan that he wrote it after having \"read something in the paper about the riots\" and that he meant the black \"bird\" to symbolise a black woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VrcsjDUfGw#|title=Paul McCartney & Donovan \u2013 Postcard Sessions 1968|date=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlong with McCartney's \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\", \"Blackbird\" was one of several White Album songs that [[Charles Manson]] interpreted as the Beatles' prophecy of an apocalyptic race war that would lead to him and his \"[[Manson Family|Family]]\" of followers ruling the US on countercultural principles. Manson interpreted the lyrics' repetition of the word \"rise\" as a call to black Americans to wage war on their white counterparts, and instructed his followers to commit a series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969 to trigger such a conflict.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=489\u201390}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe song was recorded on 11 June 1968 at [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London,{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=255}} with [[George Martin]] as the [[record producer|producer]] and [[Geoff Emerick]] as the [[audio engineer]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=137}} It is a solo performance with McCartney playing a [[C.
