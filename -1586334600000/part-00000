She added that it is \"a disappointing comeback from an artist who has a track record in creating hits\", as it is \"one romp that never reaches climax\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> ''[[Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s David Smyth expressed his disappointment in the album's subject matter, but complimented its production: \"In fact, so single-minded is his [Bieber] approach this time that it feels like she's [Baldwin] his only intended audience\", and thus Bieber's audience at his tour \"are going to be underwhelmed by the unchanging, lounging pace of the new material, gently ticking beats and lack of memorable choruses\".<ref name=\"ES\" /> \n\nRating the album a 4.5 out of 10, Jayson Greene of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that \"''Changes'' settles into a middle-distance, stream-friendly murmur that is more sleepy than salacious\", adding that its songs \"are all cold angles and frictionless surfaces, devoid of intimacy and heat\".

He stated that the album emulates the early 2000s, but it \"doesn't do so reverentially, nor does it borrow from a sonic palette to make it new again\", resulting in an \"uninspired and confused\" record, that \"lacks the emotional maturity\" to translate Bieber's marriage. He described Bieber's treatment of sex on the album is \"instant, bountiful, in your face, but ultimately unrealistic and devoid of any eroticism\" like [[pornography]].

He described Bieber's treatment of sex on the album is \"instant, bountiful, in your face, but ultimately unrealistic and devoid of any eroticism\" like [[pornography]].

He is the lead singer and lyricist of the band [[Travis (band)|Travis]], having written nearly all of the songs on their first six studio albums, with the 7th and 8th being more of a co-written work. He is based in [[Berlin]]. Healy released his debut solo album titled ''[[Wreckorder]]'' in October 2010, which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass.\n\n==Early life==\nAlthough born in [[Stafford]], [[England]], Healy grew up in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] \u2013 his parents' hometown. His mother had moved back to Scotland after divorcing her husband. Healy has said that both his mother and his grandmother were major influences on him as a child. Healy attended [[Holyrood Secondary School]] in Glasgow.\n\nAs a young child at primary school, he was awarded a book of [[Robert Burns]] poems and a certificate \"For Outstanding Singing Abilities\" after singing the old Scottish song \"Westering Home\" while dressed in a kilt. However, Healy showed no further interest in singing until his teens. His obsession with songwriting began to take shape when he got his first guitar in 1986 at the age of 13, having seen [[Roy Orbison]] perform his hit [[Pretty Woman (song)|Pretty Woman]] on ''[[The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross]]''. First songs played on the guitar were old rock'n'roll numbers like \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\" and \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]]. His first complete song was written about the headmaster of his school, Peter Mullen, entitled \"Mr. Mullen Blues\", with a sample lyric: ''\"...and there was Pete Mullen, with his pie and beans. It was then I smelled it, it filled the room. Then some wee bugger lit a match and the whole place went Ka-BOOM...Where's your tie boy? Pick up that can. Get in line girl, do you understand...Cause his name is big Pete Mullen...And he's a man\"''. He performed it at the school talent show but failed to move the judges. He then played in several school bands.\n\n==Travis==\n{{Main|Travis (band)}}\n[[File:Travis 2007 II.jpg|thumb|right|Healy Performing With Travis.]]\nIn 1991,  [[Neil Primrose (musician)|Neil Primrose]], the drummer of Glasgow band Glass Onion, asked Healy if he would like to audition for the band; their previous singer, Catherine Maxwell, had just left the band. Healy joined the band on the same day he enrolled at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. This band soon changed their name to [[Travis (band)|Travis]], named after the main character in the [[Wim Wenders]] movie ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]''.\n\nTravis' first single, \"[[All I Want to Do Is Rock]]\", was written by Healy while on a visit to [[Millport, Cumbrae|Millport]] on Great [[Cumbrae]], a small island in the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Going there with the sole intention of composing the best song he had ever written, Healy surprised even himself when the track was born. In spite of Healy's success as a songwriter since, he is without formal musical training. As the band has risen to prominence, Healy has continued to be [[Travis (band)|Travis]]' main songwriter, as well as the band's main spokesman and most recognisable member.\n\nTravis has twice been awarded British album of the year at the annual [[BRIT Awards]], and is credited as having paved the way for British bands such as [[Coldplay]] and [[Keane (band)|Keane]]. Travis have released eight studio albums, beginning with ''[[Good Feeling (Travis album)|Good Feeling]]'' in 1997.\n\n==Other musical activities==\nAlthough Healy predominantly plays guitar, he has also been known to write and perform with piano.\n\nIn 2010 Healy released the solo album ''[[Wreckorder]]'', which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass and [[Neko Case]].\n\nHe appeared on the BBC's last night of the proms celebrations in Scotland on 10 September 2011 in the Caird Hall in Dundee.\n\nHe co-wrote the song \"Here With Me\" from [[The Killers]]' 2012 album ''[[Battle Born (album)|Battle Born]]''.\n\n==Influences==\nIn interviews, Healy has talked of being influenced by songwriters such as [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Graham Nash]] (of [[The Hollies]] and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] fame). Healy has since played with both McCartney and Nash.\n\n==Praise==\nHealy's songwriting has been praised by [[Paul McCartney]], [[Elton John]] and [[Noel Gallagher]]. In 2005, [[Coldplay]] frontman [[Chris Martin]] called himself \"a poor man's Fran Healy\".\n\n==Activism==\nHealy is a part of the movement [[Make Poverty History]] and has, alongside his band, played at the [[Live 8]] concerts in both London and [[Edinburgh]]. He  participated in [[Band Aid 20]]'s re-recording of [[Do They Know It's Christmas?]], with Healy and friend [[Nigel Godrich]] also playing roles in its organization.\n\nHe has so far made two trips to [[Sudan]] with the [[Save the Children]] Organization, for which he has just launched the biggest ever global campaign<ref>[http://www.cafonline.org/default.aspx?page=15189&WT.mc_id=399 \"Fran Healy launches Save the Children\u2019s biggest ever global campaign\"], ''[[Charities Aid Foundation]]'', 2008-02-20. Retrieved on 2008-02-25.</ref> to help the ten million children who die unnecessarily each year to survive.\n\nHealy has also taken part in and been a speaker at several [[anti-war]] demonstrations against the [[Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2850849.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Music &#124; Stars sing out against war |publisher=BBC News |date=16 March 2003 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Alexis Petridis |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/war/story/0,,916037,00.html |title=Sound of silence &#124; &#124; Guardian Unlimited Arts |publisher=Arts.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nSince 1996, Healy has been in a relationship with German photographer and former make-up artist Nora Kryst.

He is the lead singer and lyricist of the band [[Travis (band)|Travis]], having written nearly all of the songs on their first six studio albums, with the 7th and 8th being more of a co-written work. He is based in [[Berlin]]. Healy released his debut solo album titled ''[[Wreckorder]]'' in October 2010, which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass.\n\n==Early life==\nAlthough born in [[Stafford]], [[England]], Healy grew up in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] \u2013 his parents' hometown. His mother had moved back to Scotland after divorcing her husband. Healy has said that both his mother and his grandmother were major influences on him as a child. Healy attended [[Holyrood Secondary School]] in Glasgow.\n\nAs a young child at primary school, he was awarded a book of [[Robert Burns]] poems and a certificate \"For Outstanding Singing Abilities\" after singing the old Scottish song \"Westering Home\" while dressed in a kilt. However, Healy showed no further interest in singing until his teens. His obsession with songwriting began to take shape when he got his first guitar in 1986 at the age of 13, having seen [[Roy Orbison]] perform his hit [[Pretty Woman (song)|Pretty Woman]] on ''[[The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross]]''. First songs played on the guitar were old rock'n'roll numbers like \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\" and \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]]. His first complete song was written about the headmaster of his school, Peter Mullen, entitled \"Mr. Mullen Blues\", with a sample lyric: ''\"...and there was Pete Mullen, with his pie and beans. It was then I smelled it, it filled the room. Then some wee bugger lit a match and the whole place went Ka-BOOM...Where's your tie boy? Pick up that can. Get in line girl, do you understand...Cause his name is big Pete Mullen...And he's a man\"''. He performed it at the school talent show but failed to move the judges. He then played in several school bands.\n\n==Travis==\n{{Main|Travis (band)}}\n[[File:Travis 2007 II.jpg|thumb|right|Healy Performing With Travis.]]\nIn 1991,  [[Neil Primrose (musician)|Neil Primrose]], the drummer of Glasgow band Glass Onion, asked Healy if he would like to audition for the band; their previous singer, Catherine Maxwell, had just left the band. Healy joined the band on the same day he enrolled at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. This band soon changed their name to [[Travis (band)|Travis]], named after the main character in the [[Wim Wenders]] movie ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]''.\n\nTravis' first single, \"[[All I Want to Do Is Rock]]\", was written by Healy while on a visit to [[Millport, Cumbrae|Millport]] on Great [[Cumbrae]], a small island in the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Going there with the sole intention of composing the best song he had ever written, Healy surprised even himself when the track was born. In spite of Healy's success as a songwriter since, he is without formal musical training. As the band has risen to prominence, Healy has continued to be [[Travis (band)|Travis]]' main songwriter, as well as the band's main spokesman and most recognisable member.\n\nTravis has twice been awarded British album of the year at the annual [[BRIT Awards]], and is credited as having paved the way for British bands such as [[Coldplay]] and [[Keane (band)|Keane]]. Travis have released eight studio albums, beginning with ''[[Good Feeling (Travis album)|Good Feeling]]'' in 1997.\n\n==Other musical activities==\nAlthough Healy predominantly plays guitar, he has also been known to write and perform with piano.\n\nIn 2010 Healy released the solo album ''[[Wreckorder]]'', which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass and [[Neko Case]].\n\nHe appeared on the BBC's last night of the proms celebrations in Scotland on 10 September 2011 in the Caird Hall in Dundee.\n\nHe co-wrote the song \"Here With Me\" from [[The Killers]]' 2012 album ''[[Battle Born (album)|Battle Born]]''.\n\n==Influences==\nIn interviews, Healy has talked of being influenced by songwriters such as [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Graham Nash]] (of [[The Hollies]] and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] fame). Healy has since played with both McCartney and Nash.\n\n==Praise==\nHealy's songwriting has been praised by [[Paul McCartney]], [[Elton John]] and [[Noel Gallagher]]. In 2005, [[Coldplay]] frontman [[Chris Martin]] called himself \"a poor man's Fran Healy\".\n\n==Activism==\nHealy is a part of the movement [[Make Poverty History]] and has, alongside his band, played at the [[Live 8]] concerts in both London and [[Edinburgh]]. He  participated in [[Band Aid 20]]'s re-recording of [[Do They Know It's Christmas?]], with Healy and friend [[Nigel Godrich]] also playing roles in its organization.\n\nHe has so far made two trips to [[Sudan]] with the [[Save the Children]] Organization, for which he has just launched the biggest ever global campaign<ref>[http://www.cafonline.org/default.aspx?page=15189&WT.mc_id=399 \"Fran Healy launches Save the Children\u2019s biggest ever global campaign\"], ''[[Charities Aid Foundation]]'', 2008-02-20. Retrieved on 2008-02-25.</ref> to help the ten million children who die unnecessarily each year to survive.\n\nHealy has also taken part in and been a speaker at several [[anti-war]] demonstrations against the [[Iraq War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2850849.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Music &#124; Stars sing out against war |publisher=BBC News |date=16 March 2003 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Alexis Petridis |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/war/story/0,,916037,00.html |title=Sound of silence &#124; &#124; Guardian Unlimited Arts |publisher=Arts.guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nSince 1996, Healy has been in a relationship with German photographer and former make-up artist Nora Kryst.

He was aged between 30 and 45 years, remarkably old for a Neanderthal. Shanidar 1 had a cranial capacity of 1,600 cm<sup>3</sup>, was around the height of 5 feet 7 inches, and displayed severe signs of deformity.<ref name=\":12\">Lewis, R. Barry., et al. ''Understanding Humans: Introduction to Physical Anthropology and Archaeology''. Wadsworth, 2013.</ref> He was one of four reasonably complete skeletons from the cave which displayed trauma-related abnormalities, which in his case would have been debilitating to the point of making day-to-day life painful.\n\nDuring the course of the individual\u2019s life, he had suffered a violent blow to the left side of his face, creating a crushing fracture to his left orbit which would have left him partially or totally blind in one eye. Research by J\u00e1n Lietava shows that the individual exhibits \u201catypically worn teeth\u201d.<ref name=\":22\">{{cite journal|jstor=44602496|url=http://puvodni.mzm.cz/Anthropologie/downloads/articles/1988/Lietava_1988_p183-196.pdf|title=A Differential Diagnostics of the Right Shoulder Girdle Deformity in the Shanidar I Neanderthal|journal=Anthropologie |volume=26|issue=3|pages=183\u2013196|last1=Lietava|first1=J\u00e1n|year=1988}}</ref> Severe changes to the individuals incisors and a flattened capitulum show additional evidence towards Shanidar 1 suffering from a degenerative disease. Additionally, analysis shows that Shanidar 1 likely suffered from profound hearing loss, as his left ear canal was partially blocked and his right ear canal was completely blocked by exostoses. He also suffered from a withered right arm which had been fractured in several places. A fracture of the individual\u2019s C5 vertebrae is thought to have caused damage to his muscle function (specifically the deltoids and biceps) of the right arm<ref name=\":22\" />. Shanidar 1 healed, but this caused the loss of his lower arm and hand. This is thought to be either congenital, a result of childhood disease and trauma, or due to an amputation later in his life. The sharp point caused by a distal fracture of the individual's right humerus points towards this theory of amputation. \u00a0If the arm was amputated, this demonstrates one of the earliest signs of surgery on a living individual. The arm had healed, but the injury may have caused some paralysis down his right side, leading to deformities in his lower legs and feet. Studies show that this individual had suffered from two broken legs<ref name=\":12\" />. This would have resulted in him walking with a pronounced, painful limp. These findings in Shanidar 1\u2019s skeleton propose that he was unlikely to be able to provide for himself in a Neandertal society<ref name=\":22\" />.\n\nMore recent analysis of Shanidar 1 by [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] Professor Erik Trinkaus and Dr. S\u00e9bastien Villotte of the French National Centre for Scientific Research confirm that bony growths in his ear canals would have resulted in extensive hearing loss. These bony growths support a diagnosis of [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]] (DISH), also known as Forestier's disease. This diagnosis would make Shanidar 1 the oldest hominin specimen clearly presenting this systemic condition.The researchers found these bone growths in multiple places all over the partial skeleton. <ref>{{cite journal|pmid=1463085|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330890402|title=Shanidar 1: A case of hyperostotic disease (DISH) in the middle Paleolithic|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=89|issue=4|pages=411\u2013420|year=1992|last1=Crub\u00e9zy|first1=Eric|last2=Trinkaus|first2=Erik}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the healing of his injuries, Shanidar 1 lived a substantial amount of time before his death. If the Neandertals did perform surgery on Shanidar 1, this proves that their methods were successful in sustaining life. Considering that all the injuries were healed during this time period may lead to the reasoning that this individual was kept alive for a reason. According to paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus, Shanidar must have been aided by others in order to survive his injuries<ref name=\":12\" />. Due to all of the injuries and side effects of trauma, it was very unlikely that this individual could provide for his family or contribute to society in a meaningful way. With that being said, this individual may have been kept alive due to a high status within society or a repository of cultural knowledge.\n\nThis leads us to believe that the Neandertals had some sort of altruistic characteristics with the possibility of the presence of ethos within the Neandertal community. The discovery of stone tools found in proximity to these individuals allows us to deduce that the Neandertals exhibited enough intelligence to make everyday life easier themselves. Maybe this knowledge surpasses basic comprehension to include characteristics such as humility and compassion which have the most known presence in ''Homo sapiens''<ref name=\":12\" />. These individuals may have had the capacity to show empathy to others and come to the understanding that life has meaning - causing them to want to help Shanidar 1.\n\n=== Shanidar 2 ===\nShanidar 2 was a Neanderthal male around the age of 30 who suffered from slight arthritis, found lying on his right side. It is estimated that Shanidar 2 was 5 feet 2 inches in stature which places him just below the average height of a male neanderthal. He was killed by rocks falling from the cave\u2019s ceiling, which crushed his skull and bones significantly. The skull had been compressed by about 5-6 cm. Much of his bones were missing when discovered, and the left tibia had teeth marks. Scavengers likely disposed of parts of his remains.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=986524|title=The Neanderthal Skeletal Remains from Shanidar Cave, Iraq: A Summary of Findings to Date|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=121|issue=2|pages=121\u2013165|last1=Stewart|first1=T. D.|year=1977}}</ref> There is evidence that Shanidar 2 was given a ritual send-off: a small pile of stones with some worked stone points (made out of [[chert]]) were found on top of his grave. Also, there had been a large fire by the burial site.<ref>T. D. Stewart, The Skull of Shanidar II, Sumer, vol. 17, pp. 97-106, 1961</ref>\n\nShanidar 2 had a \"higher cranial vault\", and other skull proportions that did not quite match up to the average Neanderthal skull. This may prove that the Neanderthals of Shanidar had more of a \"morphology of anatomically modern humans\" than other Neanderthals, or that the group was very diverse. This points to similarities between the two species, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, but it doesn\u2019t show any inherit \"relationships within that species\".<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.academia.edu/4862544|title=The Shanidar Neanderthal crania|editor-last=Stringer|editor-first=C.B.|encyclopedia=Aspects of Human Evolution|pages= 129\u2013165|last1=Stringer|first1=C.B.|last2=Trinkaus|first2=E.}}</ref>\n\n=== Shanidar 3 ===\n[[File:Shanidar Cave - overview.jpg|thumb|Inside the Shanidar Cave]]\nShanidar 3 was a 40- to 50-year-old male, found in the same grave as Shanidar 1 and 2.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url = http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/3d-collection/neanderthal-shanidar-3|title = Neanderthal (Shanidar 3)|date = 2013-02-14|accessdate = 17 October 2014|website = The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program|publisher = The Smithsonian Institution}}</ref> A wound to the left 9th rib suggests that the individual died of complications from a stab wound by a sharp implement.

Routine [[soil sample]]s from around the body, gathered for [[pollen]] analysis in an attempt to reconstruct the [[palaeoclimate]] and vegetational history of the site, were analysed eight years after its discovery. In two of the soil samples in particular, whole clumps of pollen were discovered by [[Arlette Leroi-Gourhan]] in addition to the usual pollen found throughout the site, suggesting that entire [[flowering plant]]s (or at least heads of plants) had been part of the grave deposit.<ref>[[Arlette Leroi-Gourhan]], Shanidar et ses fleurs, Pal\u00e9orient, vol. 24, pp. 79-88, 1998</ref> Furthermore, a study of the particular flower types suggested that the flowers may have been chosen for their specific medicinal properties. [[Achillea millefolium|Yarrow]], [[Centaurea cyanus|cornflower]], [[Bachelor's buttons|bachelor's button]], [[Centaurea solstitialis|St Barnaby's thistle]], [[Senecio|ragwort]], [[Muscari|grape hyacinth]],  [[Equisetum|horsetail]] and [[Alcea|hollyhock]] were represented in the pollen samples, all of which have been traditionally used, as [[diuretic]]s, [[stimulant]]s, and [[astringent]]s and [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0378-8741(92)90023-K|pmid=1548898|title=Medicinal plants in a Middle Paleolithic grave Shanidar IV?|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=263\u2013266|year=1992|last1=Lietava|first1=Jan}}</ref> This led to the idea that the man could possibly have had [[shamanism|shamanic powers]], perhaps acting as [[medicine man]] to the Shanidar Neandertals.<ref>T.

The jird is known to store large numbers of seeds and flowers at certain points in their burrows and this argument was used in conjunction with the lack of ritual treatment of the rest of the skeletons in the cave to suggest that the Shanidar 4 burial had natural, not cultural, origins.<ref>D.J.

Pettitt]] has stated that the \"deliberate placement of flowers has now been convincingly eliminated\", noting that \"A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent ''Meriones persicus'', which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today\". Despite his conclusions that flowers were unlikely to have been deliberately placed, Petitt nevertheless concludes that the Shanidar burials, because they happened over so many years, represent a deliberate mortuary practice by Neanderthals.<ref>The Neanderthal Dead, exploring mortuary variability in Middle Paleolithic Eurasia.

He was aged between 30 and 45 years, remarkably old for a Neanderthal. Shanidar 1 had a cranial capacity of 1,600 cm<sup>3</sup>, was around the height of 5 feet 7 inches, and displayed severe signs of deformity.<ref name=\":12\">Lewis, R. Barry., et al. ''Understanding Humans: Introduction to Physical Anthropology and Archaeology''. Wadsworth, 2013.</ref> He was one of four reasonably complete skeletons from the cave which displayed trauma-related abnormalities, which in his case would have been debilitating to the point of making day-to-day life painful.\n\nDuring the course of the individual\u2019s life, he had suffered a violent blow to the left side of his face, creating a crushing fracture to his left orbit which would have left him partially or totally blind in one eye. Research by J\u00e1n Lietava shows that the individual exhibits \u201catypically worn teeth\u201d.<ref name=\":22\">{{cite journal|jstor=44602496|url=http://puvodni.mzm.cz/Anthropologie/downloads/articles/1988/Lietava_1988_p183-196.pdf|title=A Differential Diagnostics of the Right Shoulder Girdle Deformity in the Shanidar I Neanderthal|journal=Anthropologie |volume=26|issue=3|pages=183\u2013196|last1=Lietava|first1=J\u00e1n|year=1988}}</ref> Severe changes to the individuals incisors and a flattened capitulum show additional evidence towards Shanidar 1 suffering from a degenerative disease. Additionally, analysis shows that Shanidar 1 likely suffered from profound hearing loss, as his left ear canal was partially blocked and his right ear canal was completely blocked by exostoses. He also suffered from a withered right arm which had been fractured in several places. A fracture of the individual\u2019s C5 vertebrae is thought to have caused damage to his muscle function (specifically the deltoids and biceps) of the right arm<ref name=\":22\" />. Shanidar 1 healed, but this caused the loss of his lower arm and hand. This is thought to be either congenital, a result of childhood disease and trauma, or due to an amputation later in his life. The sharp point caused by a distal fracture of the individual's right humerus points towards this theory of amputation. \u00a0If the arm was amputated, this demonstrates one of the earliest signs of surgery on a living individual. The arm had healed, but the injury may have caused some paralysis down his right side, leading to deformities in his lower legs and feet. Studies show that this individual had suffered from two broken legs<ref name=\":12\" />. This would have resulted in him walking with a pronounced, painful limp. These findings in Shanidar 1\u2019s skeleton propose that he was unlikely to be able to provide for himself in a Neandertal society<ref name=\":22\" />.\n\nMore recent analysis of Shanidar 1 by [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] Professor Erik Trinkaus and Dr. S\u00e9bastien Villotte of the French National Centre for Scientific Research confirm that bony growths in his ear canals would have resulted in extensive hearing loss. These bony growths support a diagnosis of [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]] (DISH), also known as Forestier's disease. This diagnosis would make Shanidar 1 the oldest hominin specimen clearly presenting this systemic condition.The researchers found these bone growths in multiple places all over the partial skeleton. <ref>{{cite journal|pmid=1463085|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330890402|title=Shanidar 1: A case of hyperostotic disease (DISH) in the middle Paleolithic|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=89|issue=4|pages=411\u2013420|year=1992|last1=Crub\u00e9zy|first1=Eric|last2=Trinkaus|first2=Erik}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the healing of his injuries, Shanidar 1 lived a substantial amount of time before his death. If the Neandertals did perform surgery on Shanidar 1, this proves that their methods were successful in sustaining life. Considering that all the injuries were healed during this time period may lead to the reasoning that this individual was kept alive for a reason. According to paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus, Shanidar must have been aided by others in order to survive his injuries<ref name=\":12\" />. Due to all of the injuries and side effects of trauma, it was very unlikely that this individual could provide for his family or contribute to society in a meaningful way. With that being said, this individual may have been kept alive due to a high status within society or a repository of cultural knowledge.\n\nThis leads us to believe that the Neandertals had some sort of altruistic characteristics with the possibility of the presence of ethos within the Neandertal community. The discovery of stone tools found in proximity to these individuals allows us to deduce that the Neandertals exhibited enough intelligence to make everyday life easier themselves. Maybe this knowledge surpasses basic comprehension to include characteristics such as humility and compassion which have the most known presence in ''Homo sapiens''<ref name=\":12\" />. These individuals may have had the capacity to show empathy to others and come to the understanding that life has meaning - causing them to want to help Shanidar 1.\n\n=== Shanidar 2 ===\nShanidar 2 was a Neanderthal male around the age of 30 who suffered from slight arthritis, found lying on his right side. It is estimated that Shanidar 2 was 5 feet 2 inches in stature which places him just below the average height of a male neanderthal. He was killed by rocks falling from the cave\u2019s ceiling, which crushed his skull and bones significantly. The skull had been compressed by about 5-6 cm. Much of his bones were missing when discovered, and the left tibia had teeth marks. Scavengers likely disposed of parts of his remains.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=986524|title=The Neanderthal Skeletal Remains from Shanidar Cave, Iraq: A Summary of Findings to Date|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=121|issue=2|pages=121\u2013165|last1=Stewart|first1=T. D.|year=1977}}</ref> There is evidence that Shanidar 2 was given a ritual send-off: a small pile of stones with some worked stone points (made out of [[chert]]) were found on top of his grave. Also, there had been a large fire by the burial site.<ref>T. D. Stewart, The Skull of Shanidar II, Sumer, vol. 17, pp. 97-106, 1961</ref>\n\nShanidar 2 had a \"higher cranial vault\", and other skull proportions that did not quite match up to the average Neanderthal skull. This may prove that the Neanderthals of Shanidar had more of a \"morphology of anatomically modern humans\" than other Neanderthals, or that the group was very diverse. This points to similarities between the two species, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, but it doesn\u2019t show any inherit \"relationships within that species\".<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.academia.edu/4862544|title=The Shanidar Neanderthal crania|editor-last=Stringer|editor-first=C.B.|encyclopedia=Aspects of Human Evolution|pages= 129\u2013165|last1=Stringer|first1=C.B.|last2=Trinkaus|first2=E.}}</ref>\n\n=== Shanidar 3 ===\n[[File:Shanidar Cave - overview.jpg|thumb|Inside the Shanidar Cave]]\nShanidar 3 was a 40- to 50-year-old male, found in the same grave as Shanidar 1 and 2.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url = http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/3d-collection/neanderthal-shanidar-3|title = Neanderthal (Shanidar 3)|date = 2013-02-14|accessdate = 17 October 2014|website = The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program|publisher = The Smithsonian Institution}}</ref> A wound to the left 9th rib suggests that the individual died of complications from a stab wound by a sharp implement.

Routine [[soil sample]]s from around the body, gathered for [[pollen]] analysis in an attempt to reconstruct the [[palaeoclimate]] and vegetational history of the site, were analysed eight years after its discovery. In two of the soil samples in particular, whole clumps of pollen were discovered by [[Arlette Leroi-Gourhan]] in addition to the usual pollen found throughout the site, suggesting that entire [[flowering plant]]s (or at least heads of plants) had been part of the grave deposit.<ref>[[Arlette Leroi-Gourhan]], Shanidar et ses fleurs, Pal\u00e9orient, vol. 24, pp. 79-88, 1998</ref> Furthermore, a study of the particular flower types suggested that the flowers may have been chosen for their specific medicinal properties. [[Achillea millefolium|Yarrow]], [[Centaurea cyanus|cornflower]], [[Bachelor's buttons|bachelor's button]], [[Centaurea solstitialis|St Barnaby's thistle]], [[Senecio|ragwort]], [[Muscari|grape hyacinth]],  [[Equisetum|horsetail]] and [[Alcea|hollyhock]] were represented in the pollen samples, all of which have been traditionally used, as [[diuretic]]s, [[stimulant]]s, and [[astringent]]s and [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0378-8741(92)90023-K|pmid=1548898|title=Medicinal plants in a Middle Paleolithic grave Shanidar IV?|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=263\u2013266|year=1992|last1=Lietava|first1=Jan}}</ref> This led to the idea that the man could possibly have had [[shamanism|shamanic powers]], perhaps acting as [[medicine man]] to the Shanidar Neandertals.<ref>T.

The jird is known to store large numbers of seeds and flowers at certain points in their burrows and this argument was used in conjunction with the lack of ritual treatment of the rest of the skeletons in the cave to suggest that the Shanidar 4 burial had natural, not cultural, origins.<ref>D.J.

Pettitt]] has stated that the \"deliberate placement of flowers has now been convincingly eliminated\", noting that \"A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent ''Meriones persicus'', which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today\". Despite his conclusions that flowers were unlikely to have been deliberately placed, Petitt nevertheless concludes that the Shanidar burials, because they happened over so many years, represent a deliberate mortuary practice by Neanderthals.<ref>The Neanderthal Dead, exploring mortuary variability in Middle Paleolithic Eurasia.

The name ''Bali dwipa'' (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343.

The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\n\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at [[Buleleng, Bali|Buleleng]] on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:\n\n<blockquote>I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe.

The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P.

A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<ref>Slattum, J.

Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |title=Short Post |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072104/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |title=Hectic, yet void, week |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072220/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of [[Balinese people]] are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\n[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Balinese art|Music of Bali|Balinese cuisine}}\n[[File:Kecak.JPG|thumb|left|A ''[[kecak]]'' dance being performed at [[Uluwatu Temple]], in Bali]]\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.<ref>{{cite book|title=Masked Performance: The Play of Self and Other in Ritual and Theatre|last=Emigh|first=John|authorlink=John Emigh|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1336-X}} The author is a Western theatre professor who has become a performer in Balinese [[topeng]] theater himself.</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:Sanur Beach.JPG|thumb|A scene in Bali on ''Nyepi'', the Hindu festival of silence.

On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d\u00e9sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst/> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley/> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram\u00e9'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram\u00e9''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]\n''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst/><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>\n\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18\u201326.</ref>\n\n[[File:A collage of scenes from Barong dance of Bali Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Barong dance]]\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger/>\n\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| url-status=live}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"[[kasepekang]]\", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have.

The name ''Bali dwipa'' (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of [[Hayam Wuruk]] is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386. A mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the [[Majapahit Empire]] fell in 1520.<ref name=indianized/>{{rp|234,240}} Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy.

It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands.

The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\n\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at [[Buleleng, Bali|Buleleng]] on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:\n\n<blockquote>I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about {{convert|10|or|12|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of [[coconut palms]], [[tamarind]] and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best cultivated parts of Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=The Malay Archipelago|year=1869|isbn=9780794605636|page=116}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe Dutch mounted large naval and ground [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1906)|assaults at the Sanur region]] in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (''[[puputan]]'') to avoid the humiliation of surrender.<ref name=\"ctpqur\" /> Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender.<ref>[[#Haer|Haer]], p. 38.</ref> In the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)|Dutch intervention in Bali]], a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in [[Klungkung]]. Afterward the Dutch governors exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n\nIn the 1930s, anthropologists [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], artists [[Miguel Covarrubias]] and [[Walter Spies]], and musicologist [[Colin McPhee]] all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as \"an enchanted land of [[aesthetes]] at peace with themselves and nature\". Western tourists began to visit the island.<ref name=Friend>Friend, Theodore.

It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on [[Borneo]] were inoperative due to heavy rains, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942 the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer [Senur]. The island was quickly captured.<ref>{{cite web|author = Klemen, L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/bali.html |title= The Capture of Bali Island, February 1942 |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, [[I Gusti Ngurah Rai|Gusti Ngurah Rai]], formed a Balinese 'freedom army'.

Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.\n\nIn 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed [[State of East Indonesia]], a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]].

South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately {{cvt|75|km|mi}} (see [[List of rivers of Bali]]).\n\nThe island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]].

The transition is known as the [[Wallace Line]], named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who first proposed a transition zone between these two major [[biome]]s.

Bali is also famous for its [[artisan]]s who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including [[batik]] and [[ikat]] [[Bali Nusra Tangi|cloth and clothing]], [[Woodworking|wooden carvings]], stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.\n\nThe [[Coffea arabica|Arabica coffee]] production region is the highland region of [[Kintamani, Bali|Kintamani]] near [[Mount Batur]]. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency.

Tourism further increased on Bali after the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.\n\nThe [[tourism industry]] is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island. The main tourist locations are the town of [[Kuta]] (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of [[Legian]] and [[Seminyak]] (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]] (once the only tourist hub), [[Ubud]] towards the centre of the island, to the south of the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]], [[Jimbaran]] and the newer developments of [[Nusa Dua]] and [[Pecatu]].\n\nThe United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008.

Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active, investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.\n\nIn the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors improved value for their currencies.\n\nBali's tourism economy survived the [[Islamists]] terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0\u20132.3 million tourists.

This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<ref>Slattum, J.

As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |title=Short Post |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072104/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |title=Hectic, yet void, week |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072220/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of [[Balinese people]] are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\n[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Balinese art|Music of Bali|Balinese cuisine}}\n[[File:Kecak.JPG|thumb|left|A ''[[kecak]]'' dance being performed at [[Uluwatu Temple]], in Bali]]\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance).

On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d\u00e9sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst/> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley/> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram\u00e9'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram\u00e9''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]\n''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst/><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>\n\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18\u201326.</ref>\n\n[[File:A collage of scenes from Barong dance of Bali Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Barong dance]]\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger/>\n\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| url-status=live}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"[[kasepekang]]\", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have.

Like it or not, this is architecture at its provocative best. The 18-story structure and its four-story annex show how buildings fit together. They demonstrate that simple materials can be used in fresh ways, and they prod you to think about how design and the environment are linked.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> According to his colleague at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', [[Christopher Hawthorne (journalist)|Christopher Hawthorne]], the building \"shows what happens when a celebrated American architect is compelled [...] to embrace sustainability. And it dramatizes a clash between the prerogatives of architectural creativity and the basics of sustainable design\".<ref name=\"LA Times\" /> He called the result a \"hulking, aggressive tower [... and] perhaps the most ambitious of the federal government\u2019s effort, through the [[General Services Administration|General Services Administration\u2019s]] 'design excellence' program, to make new courthouses and office buildings models of forward-looking design.\"<ref name=\"LA Times\" /> \n\nThe San Francisco Federal Building has been called an example of the \"innovative public building projects that embrace contemporary design strategies and material approaches\" that were enabled by the 1962 \"Guiding Principles for [[Federal building|Federal Architecture]]\" directive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/news/article/150182232/new-executive-order-could-make-classical-architecture-the-preferred-and-default-style-for-america-s-public-buildings|title=New executive order could make classical architecture \"the preferred and default style\" for America's public buildings|website=Archinect|language=en|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>[[File:San Francisco Federal Building close detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of the building|alt=|left]]The construction budget and cost for the building was $144 million.<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{Cite news | author=Christopher Hawthorne | date=21 March 2007 |title=Green clashes with design in S.F. tower |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/21/entertainment/et-sanfran21 | work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> The architect's decision to eliminate the usual [[HVAC]] system saved $11 million in construction costs.<ref name=\"RMI\">{{Cite journal |title=U.S. General Services Administration San Francisco Federal Building |url=http://bet.rmi.org/files/case-studies/gsa/US_General_Services_Administration.pdf | publisher=Rocky Mountain Institute |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> At the same time, the design's nonfunctional use of extended, folded metal sunshading at ground level, which in the opinion of some are purely for aesthetic effect, and require extensive galvanized steel bracing, added millions in materials and fabrication costs back into the project.<ref name=\"LA Times\"/>\n\nMorphosis' design was selected at least partly because of its projected energy efficiency; a requirement of the GSA's brief. At the time of design, the GSA did not mandate [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification, and the building was not evaluated for it until after construction; it failed. Mayne said \"I wasn't arrogant, but I was confident \u2014 I just assumed we had the platinum (the highest LEED) rating. All of a sudden we went through LEED and it wasn't working.\" Ultimately, the building received only silver LEED qualifications; two steps below platinum.<ref name=\"BeyondChron\">{{Cite web | author=Randy Shaw|title=San Francisco\u2019s Green Building Nightmare |url=http://www.beyondchron.org/articles/San_Francisco_s_Green_Building_Nightmare_5428.html| work=BeyondCron | date=3 March 2008| accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe building has been criticized as being dysfunctional for its employees. According to an employee interviewed by BeyondChron.com, \"Workers seek to relieve the heat by opening windows, which not only sends papers flying, but, depending on their proximity to the opening, makes creating a stable temperature for all workers near impossible ... some employees must use umbrellas to keep the sun out of their cubicles.\"<ref name=\"BeyondChron\"/>\n\nMayne believed that the federal government should be a model in the promotion of worker health and exercise. This led Morphosis to specify passenger elevators that stop only at every third floor, requiring many employees and visitors to then walk up or down one or two flights of stairs to reach their destinations.  There are also elevators for the disabled that stop at each floor, but it has become commonly used by the able-bodied as well, causing overcrowding.<ref name=\"BeyondChron\"/>\n[[File:San Francisco Federal Building.jpg|left|thumb|View of the entire building, consisting of the tall structure at right and the lower annex structure in the left foreground, which frame a plaza|alt=]]\nUnlike most large government office buildings, the Federal Building does not have its own cafeteria inside the building.  The cafeteria function was instead placed just outside the building on the public plaza, and was again due to the architect's belief that this would encourage employees to walk, interact, and increase worker health; a situation that seems to not be appreciated by some of the 2400 employees who work in the building.<ref name=\"BeyondChron\"/>\n\nIn 2010 the GSA commissioned a survey of employees in 22 federal buildings nationwide, to determine employee satisfaction with their workplaces. The San Francisco Federal Building was included in this study even though commissioning was still underway, and tenant improvements of some floors were not complete.{{Cn|date=February 2020}} The buildings included in the study scored between a low of 13 and a high of 98 percent employee satisfaction; seventeen of the 22 buildings scored above 50 percent employee satisfaction. While incorporating many green concepts more aggressively than other buildings, the lowest ranked building for employee satisfaction was the San Francisco Federal Building, with a rating of just 13 percent; the next-lowest was considered twice as satisfactory, at 26 percent. The San Francisco building scored well below the median in the categories of thermal comfort, lighting and acoustics.<ref name=\"Pacific Northwest National Laboratory\">{{Cite journal |author1=Kim M.

And it dramatizes a clash between the prerogatives of architectural creativity and the basics of sustainable design\".<ref name=\"LA Times\" /> He called the result a \"hulking, aggressive tower [... and] perhaps the most ambitious of the federal government\u2019s effort, through the [[General Services Administration|General Services Administration\u2019s]] 'design excellence' program, to make new courthouses and office buildings models of forward-looking design.\"<ref name=\"LA Times\" /> \n\nThe San Francisco Federal Building has been called an example of the \"innovative public building projects that embrace contemporary design strategies and material approaches\" that were enabled by the 1962 \"Guiding Principles for [[Federal building|Federal Architecture]]\" directive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/news/article/150182232/new-executive-order-could-make-classical-architecture-the-preferred-and-default-style-for-america-s-public-buildings|title=New executive order could make classical architecture \"the preferred and default style\" for America's public buildings|website=Archinect|language=en|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>[[File:San Francisco Federal Building close detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of the building|alt=|left]]The construction budget and cost for the building was $144 million.<ref name=\"LA Times\">{{Cite news | author=Christopher Hawthorne | date=21 March 2007 |title=Green clashes with design in S.F. tower |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/21/entertainment/et-sanfran21 | work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> The architect's decision to eliminate the usual [[HVAC]] system saved $11 million in construction costs.<ref name=\"RMI\">{{Cite journal |title=U.S. General Services Administration San Francisco Federal Building |url=http://bet.rmi.org/files/case-studies/gsa/US_General_Services_Administration.pdf | publisher=Rocky Mountain Institute |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> At the same time, the design's nonfunctional use of extended, folded metal sunshading at ground level, which in the opinion of some are purely for aesthetic effect, and require extensive galvanized steel bracing, added millions in materials and fabrication costs back into the project.<ref name=\"LA Times\"/>\n\nMorphosis' design was selected at least partly because of its projected energy efficiency; a requirement of the GSA's brief. At the time of design, the GSA did not mandate [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification, and the building was not evaluated for it until after construction; it failed. Mayne said \"I wasn't arrogant, but I was confident \u2014 I just assumed we had the platinum (the highest LEED) rating. All of a sudden we went through LEED and it wasn't working.\" Ultimately, the building received only silver LEED qualifications; two steps below platinum.<ref name=\"BeyondChron\">{{Cite web | author=Randy Shaw|title=San Francisco\u2019s Green Building Nightmare |url=http://www.beyondchron.org/articles/San_Francisco_s_Green_Building_Nightmare_5428.html| work=BeyondCron | date=3 March 2008| accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe building has been criticized as being dysfunctional for its employees. According to an employee interviewed by BeyondChron.com, \"Workers seek to relieve the heat by opening windows, which not only sends papers flying, but, depending on their proximity to the opening, makes creating a stable temperature for all workers near impossible ... some employees must use umbrellas to keep the sun out of their cubicles.\"<ref name=\"BeyondChron\"/>\n\nMayne believed that the federal government should be a model in the promotion of worker health and exercise. This led Morphosis to specify passenger elevators that stop only at every third floor, requiring many employees and visitors to then walk up or down one or two flights of stairs to reach their destinations.  There are also elevators for the disabled that stop at each floor, but it has become commonly used by the able-bodied as well, causing overcrowding.<ref name=\"BeyondChron\"/>\n[[File:San Francisco Federal Building.jpg|left|thumb|View of the entire building, consisting of the tall structure at right and the lower annex structure in the left foreground, which frame a plaza|alt=]]\nUnlike most large government office buildings, the Federal Building does not have its own cafeteria inside the building.  The cafeteria function was instead placed just outside the building on the public plaza, and was again due to the architect's belief that this would encourage employees to walk, interact, and increase worker health; a situation that seems to not be appreciated by some of the 2400 employees who work in the building.<ref name=\"BeyondChron\"/>\n\nIn 2010 the GSA commissioned a survey of employees in 22 federal buildings nationwide, to determine employee satisfaction with their workplaces. The San Francisco Federal Building was included in this study even though commissioning was still underway, and tenant improvements of some floors were not complete.{{Cn|date=February 2020}} The buildings included in the study scored between a low of 13 and a high of 98 percent employee satisfaction; seventeen of the 22 buildings scored above 50 percent employee satisfaction. While incorporating many green concepts more aggressively than other buildings, the lowest ranked building for employee satisfaction was the San Francisco Federal Building, with a rating of just 13 percent; the next-lowest was considered twice as satisfactory, at 26 percent.

Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n[[Allan truss]]es were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n[[Percy Allan]], the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n===Carrathool Bridge===\n[[File:CarrathoolBridge002.JPG|thumb|Road entering the bridge]]\nThe bridge spanning the Murrumbidgee River between Carrathool and the Sturt Highway was completed in 1924. It is an Allan-type timber truss road bridge, and has a [[Bascule bridge|bascule-type lift span]] supported on cylindrical iron piers, designed to allow river-craft to pass. Only three bascule lift span bridges remain in NSW, and the Carrathool bridge is the only one of these in a timber truss road bridge.\n\nThe Carrathool bridge was constructed in response to public pressure for a bridge to replace the river [[Cable ferry|vehicular punt]]  Funding for work was drawn partly from the local community, and partly from the Department of Public Works. The requirement that local residents pay for half the cost of the bridge \"was deplored by the then Mayor of Hay, who was a vocal advocate for the rights and the development of the Riverina region\".<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4300165 \u2018Carrathool Bridge over Murrumbidgee River\u2019], NSW Roads and Traffic Authority website.</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nCarrathool Bridge is an Allan-type timber truss single-lane road bridge with a steel lift span.

In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The Bascule lift span is a rare feature, and has associational links with the historic river trade, and has much to reveal about late 19th century civil engineering and manufacturing technology. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Carrathool bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\nCarrathool Bridge over Murrumbidgee River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Bascule lift span is a distinctive visual feature, embodying the spirit of late 19th century aesthetics. Further, its function can be clearly seen, and shows unambiguously the innovation which went into its design. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\".

Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n[[Allan truss]]es were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n[[Percy Allan]], the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n===Carrathool Bridge===\n[[File:CarrathoolBridge002.JPG|thumb|Road entering the bridge]]\nThe bridge spanning the Murrumbidgee River between Carrathool and the Sturt Highway was completed in 1924. It is an Allan-type timber truss road bridge, and has a [[Bascule bridge|bascule-type lift span]] supported on cylindrical iron piers, designed to allow river-craft to pass. Only three bascule lift span bridges remain in NSW, and the Carrathool bridge is the only one of these in a timber truss road bridge.\n\nThe Carrathool bridge was constructed in response to public pressure for a bridge to replace the river [[Cable ferry|vehicular punt]]  Funding for work was drawn partly from the local community, and partly from the Department of Public Works. The requirement that local residents pay for half the cost of the bridge \"was deplored by the then Mayor of Hay, who was a vocal advocate for the rights and the development of the Riverina region\".<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4300165 \u2018Carrathool Bridge over Murrumbidgee River\u2019], NSW Roads and Traffic Authority website.</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nCarrathool Bridge is an Allan-type timber truss single-lane road bridge with a steel lift span.

In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The Bascule lift span is a rare feature, and has associational links with the historic river trade, and has much to reveal about late 19th century civil engineering and manufacturing technology. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Carrathool bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\nCarrathool Bridge over Murrumbidgee River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Bascule lift span is a distinctive visual feature, embodying the spirit of late 19th century aesthetics. Further, its function can be clearly seen, and shows unambiguously the innovation which went into its design. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has substantial aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1460/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\".

In modern times, Krabi was administered from Nakhon Si Thammarat, even after 1872 when King [[Chulalongkorn]] granted Krabi town status. In 1875 it was made a direct subordinate of Bangkok, becoming what is now a province. In 1900 the governor <!--[[Ratsadanupradit Mahison Phakdi|Phraya Ratsada Nupradit]] (Kho Sim Be na Ranong) --> moved the seat of the province from Ban Talad Kao to its present location at the mouth of the Krabi River.\n\nIt is believed the town may have taken its name from the word \"krabi\", which means 'sword'.

The report calculates that biomass could generate 118 MW in an initial  three-year period; solar could generate 55 MW; biogas, 54 MW; and wind energy 40 MW. During a subsequent three-year period, renewables could generate 287 MW, exceeding the province's peak demand year of 2015, when it consumed 143 MW.

In 1875 it was made a direct subordinate of Bangkok, becoming what is now a province. In 1900 the governor <!--[[Ratsadanupradit Mahison Phakdi|Phraya Ratsada Nupradit]] (Kho Sim Be na Ranong) --> moved the seat of the province from Ban Talad Kao to its present location at the mouth of the Krabi River.\n\nIt is believed the town may have taken its name from the word \"krabi\", which means 'sword'.

The crush of high-season visitors has come at considerable cost to the environment. Local authorities have devised a program, \"Krabi 365 Days\" to move some high-season visitors to the off-season, from May to October, called the \"green season\" by tourism officials, partly due to the seasonal rains. Tourism revenue has grown at an average of eight percent annually. In 2018, tourism income is expected to hit 100 billion [[Thai baht|baht]], up from 96 billion in 2017.
