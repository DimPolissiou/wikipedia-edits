[[Applications of virtual reality]] can include entertainment (i.e. [[video game]]s) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include [[augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]].\n\nCurrently standard virtual reality systems use either [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling, and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world. A [[virtual reality headset]] typically includes two small high resolution [[OLED]] or [[LCD]] monitors which provide separate images for each eye for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] graphics rendering a 3D virtual world, a [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] system, positional and rotational real-time [[Motion capture|head tracking]] for six degrees of movement. Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]]. It is most likely to be produced using a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N.

Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\" /> The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an \"Experience Theatre\" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and visual realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].\n\n==== 1970\u20131990 ====\nThe virtual reality industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDavid Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) from 1977 to 1984.<ref name=\"Creative Computing March 1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}</ref> The [[Aspen Movie Map]], a crude [[virtual tour]] in which users could wander the streets of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in one of the three modes (summer, winter, and [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]), was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978.\n\n[[File:Virtual Reality Headset Prototype.jpg|thumb|[[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]]'s 1985 VIEW headset]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth ([[field of view]]) in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]].

Lanier had founded the company [[VPL Research]] in 1985. VPL Research has developed several VR devices like the [[DataGlove]], the EyePhone, and the AudioSphere. VPL licensed the DataGlove technology to [[Mattel]], which used it to make the [[Power Glove]], an early affordable VR device.\n\n[[Atari]] founded a research lab for virtual reality in 1982, but the lab was closed after two years due to the Atari Shock ([[North American video game crash of 1983]]).

[[Applications of virtual reality]] can include entertainment (i.e. [[video game]]s) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include [[augmented reality]] and [[mixed reality]].\n\nCurrently standard virtual reality systems use either [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates [[Auditory feedback|auditory]] and [[video feedback]], but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through [[haptic technology]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]\" has had the meaning of \"being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact\" since the mid-1400s.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> The term \"virtual\" has been used in the computer sense of \"not [[Reality|physically existing]] but made to appear by [[software]]\" since 1959.<ref name=\"etymonline.com\" />\n\nIn 1938, French avant-garde playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:R\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle|\"la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 virtuelle\"]] in a collection of essays, ''Le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son double''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\">[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).</ref> is the earliest published use of the term \"virtual reality\". The term \"[[artificial reality]]\", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term \"virtual reality\" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].\n\n==Forms and methods==\n{{Further|Immersion (virtual reality)|Reality\u2013virtuality continuum}}\n\nOne method by which virtual reality can be realized is [[simulation]]-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.\n\nWith [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar image]]-based virtual reality, people can join the virtual environment in the form of real video as well as an avatar. One can participate in the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] distributed virtual environment as form of either a conventional avatar or a real video. A user can select own type of participation based on the system capability.\n\nIn projector-based virtual reality, modeling of the real environment plays a vital role in various virtual reality applications, such as robot navigation, construction modeling, and airplane simulation. Image-based virtual reality systems have been gaining popularity in [[computer graphics]] and [[computer vision]] communities. In generating realistic models, it is essential to accurately register acquired 3D data; usually, a camera is used for modeling small [[Object (image processing)|objects]] at a short distance.\n\nDesktop-based virtual reality involves displaying a 3D [[virtual world]] on a regular [[Visual display unit|desktop display]] without use of any specialized [[positional tracking]] equipment. Many modern [[First-person (gaming)|first-person]] video games can be used as an example, using various triggers, responsive characters, and other such interactive devices to make the user feel as though they are in a virtual world. A common criticism of this form of immersion is that there is no sense of [[peripheral vision]], limiting the user's ability to know what is happening around them.\n\n[[File:Engineers train in virtual environment to prepare for real missions 150616-Z-YF431-084.jpg|thumb|A [[Missouri National Guard]]sman looks into a VR training [[head-mounted display]] at [[Fort Leonard Wood]] in 2015]]\n\nA [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) more fully immerses the user in a virtual world. A [[virtual reality headset]] typically includes two small high resolution [[OLED]] or [[LCD]] monitors which provide separate images for each eye for [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] graphics rendering a 3D virtual world, a [[3D audio effect|binaural audio]] system, positional and rotational real-time [[Motion capture|head tracking]] for six degrees of movement. Options include [[Motion controller|motion controls]] with [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] for physically interacting within the virtual world in an intuitive way with little to no abstraction and an [[omnidirectional treadmill]] for more freedom of physical movement allowing the user to perform locomotive motion in any direction.\n\n[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their real surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. AR systems layer virtual information over a camera [[live feed]] into a headset or [[smartglasses]] or through a [[mobile device]] giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.\n\n[[Mixed reality]] (MR) is the merging of the real world and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time.\n\nA [[cyberspace]] is a networked virtual reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace}}</ref>\n\n[[Simulated reality]] is a hypothetical virtual reality as truly immersive as the [[Real life|actual reality]], enabling an advanced [[lifelike experience]] or even [[Virternity|virtual eternity]]. It is most likely to be produced using a [[brain\u2013computer interface]] and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939|alt=]]\n\nThe exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}</ref> The development of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the \"multiplying of artificial worlds\".<ref name=\"Baltru\u0161aitis 1977\">{{cite book |last1=Baltru\u0161aitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N.

Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.<ref name=\"Artaud 1958\" /> The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an \"Experience Theatre\" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the \"Telesphere Mask\" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as \"a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes.\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his students including [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first head-mounted display system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and visual realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].\n\n==== 1970\u20131990 ====\nThe virtual reality industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nDavid Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) from 1977 to 1984.<ref name=\"Creative Computing March 1982\">{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}</ref> The [[Aspen Movie Map]], a crude [[virtual tour]] in which users could wander the streets of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] in one of the three modes (summer, winter, and [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]]), was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978.\n\n[[File:Virtual Reality Headset Prototype.jpg|thumb|[[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames]]'s 1985 VIEW headset]]\n\nIn 1979, [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth ([[field of view]]) in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for NASA's [[Ames Research Center]] in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]]. The LEEP system provides the basis for most of the modern virtual reality headsets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Wayne|title=\"Virtual Reality and Artificial Environments\", A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation|date=December 2005|chapter=Section 17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VPL DataSuit 1.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A [[VPL Research]] DataSuit, a full-body outfit with sensors for measuring the movement of arms, legs, and trunk.

Lanier had founded the company [[VPL Research]] in 1985. VPL Research has developed several VR devices like the [[DataGlove]], the EyePhone, and the AudioSphere.

Coolio achieved mainstream success in the mid-to-late 1990s with his albums ''[[It Takes a Thief (album)|It Takes a Thief]]'' (1994), ''[[Gangsta's Paradise (album)|Gangsta's Paradise]]'' (1995), and ''[[My Soul (Coolio album)|My Soul]]'' (1997). He is best known for his 1995 Grammy Award-winning hit single \"[[Gangsta's Paradise]]\", as well as other singles \"[[Fantastic Voyage (Coolio song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" (1994), \"[[1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)]]\" (1996) and \"[[C U When U Get There]]\" (1997).\n\nHe was also known for rapping the theme song (\"Aw, Here It Goes!\") for the mid-to-late 1990s [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Kenan & Kel]]''. Coolio has since gone on to release albums independently and has also become a chef, creating a web series titled ''[[Cookin' with Coolio]]'' and releasing a cookbook. Ivey originally rose to fame as a member of the [[Gangsta rap]] group [[WC and the Maad Circle]] alongside [[WC (rapper)|WC]] and his brother, [[Crazy Toones]].\n\n==Early life==\nArtis Leon Ivey Jr. was born in [[Compton, California]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Artis L Ivey California Birth Index|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VLJY-ZSQ|website=familysearch|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> After attending [[Compton Community College]], he worked in jobs such as [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighting]] and security at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]], before becoming a rapper.<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /><ref name=\"golfa\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/golfas-paradise-interview-coolio-1247021.html|title=Golfa's paradise; interview: Coolio|author=Sweet, Matthew|work=The Independent|date=August 23, 1997|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\nHe recorded his first single in 1987, titled \"Whatcha Gonna Do?\".<ref name=\"Berry\"/> He also recorded \"What Makes You Dance (Force Groove)\" with Nu-Skool in 1988. Coolio made connections in the L.A. rap scene, and in 1991, ended up joining the group [[WC and the Maad Circle]], led by rapper [[WC (rapper)|WC]]. He was a co-contributor on the group's debut album ''[[Ain't a Damn Thang Changed]]'', including on the single \"Dress Code\". The album was regionally successful.\n\n===Tommy Boy Records and ''It Takes a Thief''===\nIn 1994, Coolio signed to [[Tommy Boy Records]] and released his debut solo album ''[[It Takes a Thief (album)|It Takes a Thief]]''. The lead single \"[[Fantastic Voyage (Coolio song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" received heavy rotation on MTV, and peaked at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"Fantastic Voyage\" would become one of the biggest rap singles of the year, and the album contained a few other minor hits in \"County Line\" and \"I Remember\". ''It Takes a Thief'' peaked at No. 8 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref>{{cite web |title=It Takes A Thief Chart History |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/coolio/chart-history/billboard-200/song/177120 |publisher=Billboard |accessdate=September 8, 2018}}</ref> becoming certified Platinum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum - It Takes A Thief |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=COOLIO&ti=IT+TAKES+A+THIEF |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=September 8, 2018}}</ref> The album received praise for bringing a humorous and lighthearted perspective to often violent and profane themes of typical [[gangsta rap]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/coolio-mn0000780346/biography|title=Coolio Biography|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''Gangsta's Paradise''===\nIn 1995, Coolio made a song featuring [[R&B]] singer [[L.V. (singer)|LV]] for the movie ''[[Dangerous Minds]]'', titled \"[[Gangsta's Paradise]]\". It would become one of the most successful rap songs of all time, reaching No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for 3 weeks. It was the No. 1 single of 1995 in the United States for all genres, and was a global hit reaching No. 1 in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], Netherlands, Norway, [[Switzerland]], Australia, and New Zealand. Gangsta's Paradise was the second-best selling single of 1995 in the UK. The song also created a controversy when Coolio claimed that comedy musician [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] had not asked for permission to make his parody of \"Gangsta's Paradise\", titled \"[[Amish Paradise]]\". At the [[1996 Grammy Awards]], the song won Coolio a Grammy for [[Best Rap Solo Performance]].\n\nOriginally \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was not meant to be included on one of Coolio's studio albums, but it's success led to Coolio not only putting it on his next album but also making it the title track. The title track [[sampling (music)|sampled]] the chorus and music of the song \"[[Pastime Paradise]]\" by Stevie Wonder, which was recorded nearly twenty years earlier on Stevie Wonder's album ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]''. The album ''[[Gangsta's Paradise (album)|Gangsta's Paradise]]'' was released in 1995 and was certified 2X Platinum by the RIAA. The album contained two other major hits in \"[[1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)]]\" and \"Too Hot\" with J.T. Taylor of [[Kool & the Gang]] doing the chorus. Despite no longer being an official member of the group, Coolio made an appearance on the second WC and the Maad Circle album ''[[Curb Servin']]'', on the song \"In a Twist\". In 1996, Coolio had another top 40 hit with the song \"It's All the Way Live (Now)\" from the [[Eddie (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[Eddie (film)|Eddie]]''. He was also featured on the song \"Hit 'em High\" from the soundtrack to the successful 1997 film ''[[Space Jam]]'' with [[B-Real]], [[Method Man]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[Busta Rhymes]].\n\nIn 2014, the band ''[[Falling in Reverse]]'' did a cover of \"Gangsta's Paradise\" for \"Punk Goes 90's\", with Coolio making a cameo in the music video.\n\nIn 2019, the song revived new popularity on the Internet when it was featured in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' movie trailer.\n\n===Red Hot Organization and Tommy Boy Records dismissal===\nIn 1996, Coolio appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD ''[[America is Dying Slowly]]'', alongside [[Biz Markie]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], and [[Fat Joe]], among many other prominent hip-hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as \"a masterpiece\" by [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] magazine. That same year, he recorded the theme song \"Aw, Here It Goes!\" for the [[Nickelodeon]] TV series ''[[Kenan & Kel]]'', which ran for four seasons, and appeared in the series' opening sequence.\n\nAfter the success of ''[[Gangsta's Paradise]]'', Coolio's next album was expected to be another hit. His third solo album titled ''[[My Soul (Coolio album)|My Soul]]'', came out in 1997. Although it contained the major hit \"[[C U When U Get There]]\" and the album went platinum, it failed to reach the success of his previous two albums. Coolio was dropped from [[Tommy Boy Records]] and his albums since then, 2001's ''[[Coolio.com]]'', 2003's ''[[El Cool Magnifico]]'', 2006's ''[[The Return of the Gangsta]]'', and 2008's ''[[Steal Hear]]'', have not charted on any [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]]. He did have a minor hit in the UK in 2006 with \"[[Gangsta Walk]]\" (featuring [[Snoop Dogg]]), which peaked at No. 67 on the UK pop chart. Both of his last albums were produced by Joshua Fenu and Vanni Giorgilli from Subside Records.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nWhile touring with hip hop duo [[Insane Clown Posse]], Coolio received a tattoo as a homage to the group's fanbase, reading \"[[Juggalo|Jugalo]] Cool\" [''sic''].

Coolio achieved mainstream success in the mid-to-late 1990s with his albums ''[[It Takes a Thief (album)|It Takes a Thief]]'' (1994), ''[[Gangsta's Paradise (album)|Gangsta's Paradise]]'' (1995), and ''[[My Soul (Coolio album)|My Soul]]'' (1997). He is best known for his 1995 Grammy Award-winning hit single \"[[Gangsta's Paradise]]\", as well as other singles \"[[Fantastic Voyage (Coolio song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" (1994), \"[[1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)]]\" (1996) and \"[[C U When U Get There]]\" (1997).\n\nHe was also known for rapping the theme song (\"Aw, Here It Goes!\") for the mid-to-late 1990s [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Kenan & Kel]]''. Coolio has since gone on to release albums independently and has also become a chef, creating a web series titled ''[[Cookin' with Coolio]]'' and releasing a cookbook. Ivey originally rose to fame as a member of the [[Gangsta rap]] group [[WC and the Maad Circle]] alongside [[WC (rapper)|WC]] and his brother, [[Crazy Toones]].\n\n==Early life==\nArtis Leon Ivey Jr. was born in [[Compton, California]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Artis L Ivey California Birth Index|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VLJY-ZSQ|website=familysearch|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> After attending [[Compton Community College]], he worked in jobs such as [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighting]] and security at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]], before becoming a rapper.<ref name=\"Allmusic\" /><ref name=\"golfa\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/golfas-paradise-interview-coolio-1247021.html|title=Golfa's paradise; interview: Coolio|author=Sweet, Matthew|work=The Independent|date=August 23, 1997|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\nHe recorded his first single in 1987, titled \"Whatcha Gonna Do?\".<ref name=\"Berry\"/> He also recorded \"What Makes You Dance (Force Groove)\" with Nu-Skool in 1988. Coolio made connections in the L.A. rap scene, and in 1991, ended up joining the group [[WC and the Maad Circle]], led by rapper [[WC (rapper)|WC]]. He was a co-contributor on the group's debut album ''[[Ain't a Damn Thang Changed]]'', including on the single \"Dress Code\". The album was regionally successful.\n\n===Tommy Boy Records and ''It Takes a Thief''===\nIn 1994, Coolio signed to [[Tommy Boy Records]] and released his debut solo album ''[[It Takes a Thief (album)|It Takes a Thief]]''. The lead single \"[[Fantastic Voyage (Coolio song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" received heavy rotation on MTV, and peaked at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. \"Fantastic Voyage\" would become one of the biggest rap singles of the year, and the album contained a few other minor hits in \"County Line\" and \"I Remember\". ''It Takes a Thief'' peaked at No. 8 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref>{{cite web |title=It Takes A Thief Chart History |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/coolio/chart-history/billboard-200/song/177120 |publisher=Billboard |accessdate=September 8, 2018}}</ref> becoming certified Platinum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum - It Takes A Thief |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=COOLIO&ti=IT+TAKES+A+THIEF |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=September 8, 2018}}</ref> The album received praise for bringing a humorous and lighthearted perspective to often violent and profane themes of typical [[gangsta rap]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/coolio-mn0000780346/biography|title=Coolio Biography|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''Gangsta's Paradise''===\nIn 1995, Coolio made a song featuring [[R&B]] singer [[L.V. (singer)|LV]] for the movie ''[[Dangerous Minds]]'', titled \"[[Gangsta's Paradise]]\". It would become one of the most successful rap songs of all time, reaching No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 for 3 weeks. It was the No. 1 single of 1995 in the United States for all genres, and was a global hit reaching No. 1 in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], Netherlands, Norway, [[Switzerland]], Australia, and New Zealand. Gangsta's Paradise was the second-best selling single of 1995 in the UK. The song also created a controversy when Coolio claimed that comedy musician [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] had not asked for permission to make his parody of \"Gangsta's Paradise\", titled \"[[Amish Paradise]]\". At the [[1996 Grammy Awards]], the song won Coolio a Grammy for [[Best Rap Solo Performance]].\n\nOriginally \"Gangsta's Paradise\" was not meant to be included on one of Coolio's studio albums, but it's success led to Coolio not only putting it on his next album but also making it the title track. The title track [[sampling (music)|sampled]] the chorus and music of the song \"[[Pastime Paradise]]\" by Stevie Wonder, which was recorded nearly twenty years earlier on Stevie Wonder's album ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]''. The album ''[[Gangsta's Paradise (album)|Gangsta's Paradise]]'' was released in 1995 and was certified 2X Platinum by the RIAA. The album contained two other major hits in \"[[1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)]]\" and \"Too Hot\" with J.T. Taylor of [[Kool & the Gang]] doing the chorus. Despite no longer being an official member of the group, Coolio made an appearance on the second WC and the Maad Circle album ''[[Curb Servin']]'', on the song \"In a Twist\". In 1996, Coolio had another top 40 hit with the song \"It's All the Way Live (Now)\" from the [[Eddie (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the movie ''[[Eddie (film)|Eddie]]''. He was also featured on the song \"Hit 'em High\" from the soundtrack to the successful 1997 film ''[[Space Jam]]'' with [[B-Real]], [[Method Man]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[Busta Rhymes]].\n\nIn 2014, the band ''[[Falling in Reverse]]'' did a cover of \"Gangsta's Paradise\" for \"Punk Goes 90's\", with Coolio making a cameo in the music video.\n\nIn 2019, the song revived new popularity on the Internet when it was featured in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' movie trailer.\n\n===Red Hot Organization and Tommy Boy Records dismissal===\nIn 1996, Coolio appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD ''[[America is Dying Slowly]]'', alongside [[Biz Markie]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], and [[Fat Joe]], among many other prominent hip-hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as \"a masterpiece\" by [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] magazine. That same year, he recorded the theme song \"Aw, Here It Goes!\" for the [[Nickelodeon]] TV series ''[[Kenan & Kel]]'', which ran for four seasons, and appeared in the opening sequence.\n\nAfter the success of ''[[Gangsta's Paradise]]'', Coolio's next album was expected to be another hit. His third solo album titled ''[[My Soul (Coolio album)|My Soul]]'', came out in 1997. Although it contained the major hit \"[[C U When U Get There]]\" and the album went platinum, it failed to reach the success of his previous two albums. Coolio was dropped from [[Tommy Boy Records]] and his albums since then, 2001's ''[[Coolio.com]]'', 2003's ''[[El Cool Magnifico]]'', 2006's ''[[The Return of the Gangsta]]'', and 2008's ''[[Steal Hear]]'', have not charted on any [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]]. He did have a minor hit in the UK in 2006 with \"[[Gangsta Walk]]\" (featuring [[Snoop Dogg]]), which peaked at No. 67 on the UK pop chart. Both of his last albums were produced by Joshua Fenu and Vanni Giorgilli from Subside Records.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nWhile touring with hip hop duo [[Insane Clown Posse]], Coolio received a tattoo as a homage to the group's fanbase, reading \"[[Juggalo|Jugalo]] Cool\" [''sic''].
