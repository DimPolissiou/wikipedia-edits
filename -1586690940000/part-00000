Today it is a [[Lutheranism|Protestant Lutheran]] convent and is managed by the [[Klosterkammer Hannover]] (Hanover Monastic Chamber). The current [[abbess]] is Reinhild [[Freifrau]] von der Goltz.<ref>http://www.orden-online.de/news/2008/04/03/neue-aebtissin-im-evangelischen-kloster-luene-eingefuehrt/</ref>\n\nFounded in 1172, the convent soon established itself as a wealthy and autonomous local power in the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]] region. It recruited its nuns mostly from the influential [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician families]] of [[L\u00fcneburg]] and accommodated up to 60 women over most of its existence. These women would be thoroughly educated in [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Liberal arts education|Liberal Arts]] and in Christian doctrine and liturgy. Over the course of the 15th and 16th centuries, the convent structure changed first through the monastic reform (1481), then through the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] but was never resolved.\n\n== History ==\n=== The convent as a Benedictine abbey ===\n==== Foundation and early history ====\nL\u00fcne Abbey was founded in 1172 by a small community of no more than 10 noblewomen from [[Borstel, Lower Saxony|Nordborstel]]. The group, led by [[Hildeswidis von Marcboldestorpe]], was allowed to move into a vacant chapel that had been built as a hermitage for a monk from [[L\u00fcneburg]] in 1140. The foundation charter was signed by [[Hugo of Verden|Hugo]], [[Roman Catholic diocese of Verden|bishop of Verden]], [[Henry the Lion]], duke of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[History of Bavaria#Under the Welfs|Bavaria]], and Berthold II., abbott of the monastery [[St Michael]] in L\u00fcneburg.<ref>Nolte, Quellen (1932), 120\u2013126.</ref> The convent was dedicated to [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St Bartholomew]] and kept a part of the apostle's robe as the convent\u2019s main [[relic]].<ref>The saint is depicted on the convent\u2019s [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], cf. Reinhardt, Art. L\u00fcne, in: Germania Benedictina 11, 393.</ref> Although initially the convent did not follow any specific monastic rule, it adopted the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] during the course of the 13th century. The original convent buildings burned down two times (in 1240 and in 1372) and were subsequently rebuilt closer to the city of L\u00fcneburg.<ref>B\u00f6ker; Winghart (eds.), Baudenkmale (2010).</ref>\n\nOver the course of the 13th century, the convent grew steadily to a number of up to 60 nuns. They were mainly recruited from surrounding noble families and from the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician families]] of L\u00fcneburg. To cover the general living expenses, the convent relied first and foremost on the yearly income from the local [[History of salt#Cities and wars|saltworks]] that it held as a [[Pfandherr]] (pledge lord) since 1229. In 1367, the community had grown so influential and wealthy that it openly refused to accept its [[Pope|papally]] appointed [[Provost (religion)|provost]] [[Giles of Tusculum]], a powerful [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal bishop]], and instead elected their own candidate, the lesser known [[Conrad of Soltau]]. In the end, both parties agreed on a third candidate, [[Johannes Weigergang]], and [[Pope Urban V]] granted the nuns the [[Privilege (law)|privilege]] to elect their own provost.<ref>Nolte, Quellen (1932), 88\u201390.</ref> As premodern female convents had to rely on a male provost to represent the community\u2019s political and economical interests to the outside world, this privilege of free election implied the highest degree of autonomy the convent could obtain. In 1395, the L\u00fcne provost was granted the full sacramental care of the nuns, so that the convent was now [[De facto|''de facto'']] autonomous, both politically and spiritually.\n\n==== The Monastic Reform of 1481 ====\nThe 15th century brought with it a widespread desire for ecclesiastical reform, and the monastic orders were no exception. The reform movement (not to be confused with the [[Protestant Reformation]]) firmly established itself in Northern Germany in the early second half of the century.<ref>Grotefend, Der Einflu\u00df (1872), 73-88.</ref> The emerging reform theologians viewed the rich and influential convents of the north as having diverted from the original, rightful teachings of Christianity, first and foremost the ideal of poverty, but also their interference in the [[Temporalities|temporal sphere]] and a decline in Latin education were criticised. For a long time, historians have adopted the latter claim unaudited, but whether or not and to what extends it was actually accurate has to be evaluated individually for each convent. In most examined cases, however, the production of Latin writing within the women\u2019s convents shows no sign of the alleged decline in education.<ref>[[Jeffrey F. Hamburger|Hamburger]], [[Eva Schlotheuber|Schlotheuber]], Marti, [[Margot Fassler|Fassler]], Liturgical Life (2017), 92-96.</ref> L\u00fcne Abbey agreed nonetheless to undergo reformative measures, and took in the provost and seven nuns from the nearby [[Ebstorf Abbey]] which had already undergone reforms, in 1481. The provost, [[Matthias von dem Knesebeck]], deposed the [[Prior|prioress]] [[Bertha Hoyer]] and her subprioress, and installed his own candidate, the former Ebstorf nun [[Sophia von Bodenteich]].<ref>Nolte, Quellen (1932), 127-128.</ref>\n\nThe reform included an enhanced curriculum in matters of Catholic doctrine, a changed liturgy in conformity with the reform, and a centralized and communal intake of daily meals to strengthen the convent\u2019s isolation from the outside world and to better control the required abstinence from meat on Fridays and during [[Lent]]. The latter arguably provided the greatest logistical difficulty, as both the kitchen and the [[Refectory|refectory]] had to be rebuilt.<ref>Nolte, Quellen (1932), 128.</ref> Subsequently, the convent was incorporated into a dense network of reformed Northern German female convents and their male provosts, most of them committed reformers, which became a regional power within ecclesiastical politics.\n\n=== L\u00fcne Abbey and the Protestant Reformation ===\nThe territorial fragmentation of political sovereignty in Germany on the outset of the 16th century pushed the individual [[Territorial lord|territorial lords]] (\u2018\u2019Landesherren\u2019\u2019) into the position of the official decision-maker regarding the acceptance or rejection of the new Reformation process.<ref>Wolgast, Reformation (2017), 39.</ref> The monastic convents had to fear for their survival, as the new movement set out to secularize and expropriate what they saw as an expression of the decadence and detachment from the faithful in the outside world.<ref>Schmidt, Kirchenregiment (1984)</ref> L\u00fcne Abbey fell into the jurisdiction of the [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] which had been the main site of the [[Hildesheim Diocesan Feud]] in 1519. The convent suffered greatly under the joint raids of the princes of [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]] and [[Principality of Calenberg|Calenberg]], at some point even having to evacuate the convent building and move into the city of L\u00fcneburg itself.<ref>Van den Heuvel and Boetticher, Geschichte (1998), 35-38.</ref> The feud saw Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg fall into major debt and its convents become weakened as a result. In 1525, as many German territories had to face [[German Peasants' War|peasant uprisings]], [[Ernest I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Duke Ernest I]] tried to quickly consolidate his budget by sending a demand over 28,000 [[guilder|guilders]] to all convents in Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg which he threatened to enforce by a military show of force, if necessary.<ref>Tamcke, Impulse (1997), 242.</ref> It did not take long after that, however, for the duke to publicly declare his allegiance to the cause of the Reformation and thus target the Roman Catholic convents directly.<ref>Brandis, Zur Reformationsgeschichte (2017), 43.</ref> The female convents of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, tightly knit together since the monastic reform of 1481, staunchly opposed the duke\u2019s demands, and the situation effectively went into a standstill for the next four years. In 1529, Duke Ernest and his court decided to break up the monastic network by first targeting its male provosts. He hoped to replace them one by one with a Protestant preacher loyal only to the duke himself, as those provosts had once themselves deposed the old leadership of the convents without much opposition.<ref>[[Henrike L\u00e4hnemann|L\u00e4hnemann]], Nonnenkrieg (2016), 101.</ref> Indeed, in late 1529, the L\u00fcne provost Johannes Lorber resigned from his post and made way for a ducal administrator, Johannes Haselhorst, and a Protestant preacher, Hieronymous Enkhusen. In the following year, these measures were followed up by the inception of a new monastic policy which changed the liturgy within the convents drastically and nullified all [[Religious vows#In the Catholic Church|monastic vows]]. The female communities were explicitly stated to be the new religious enemies.<ref>Rhegius, \u2019\u2019Radtslach\u2019\u2019 (1530).</ref> In 1531, one of the ducal [[Tax collector|tax collectors]] even went so far as to destroy one of the chapels of L\u00fcne Abbey, consecrated to [[St. Gangolf|Saint Gangulphus of Burgundy]].\nAs prioress Mechthild von Wilde died in 1535, the nuns\u2019 opposition against the Reformation faltered altogether. Although the convent was able to independently elect a new prioress, Elisabeth Schneverding, they accepted their incorporation into the Protestant [[Landeshoheit]] of the duke. Duke Ernest, on the other hand, surprisingly accepted that the convent remained a secular foundation for unmarried Protestant women (''Damenstift''), and did not dissolve the institution as a whole.<ref>Brandis, Zur Reformationsgeschichte (2017), 41.</ref> It took, however, until 1562, for the convent to elect its first decidedly Protestant head.\n\n=== L\u00fcne Abbey as a ''Damenstift'' ===\nOver the course of the following two centuries, the community had a somewhat ambiguous status. Outwardly, it was treated as a purely secular retirement institution, but inwardly, the community still led a highly devoted spiritual life in Benedictine tradition. In 1711, this tension was resolved in an agreement between the convent and [[George I of Great Britain|Duke George-Louis]] (later George I of Great Britain) in favour of the secular role that came to dominate also withing the convent walls. L\u00fcne Abbey would find itself as part of a war zone two more times. In 1793, a French army marched through nearby territory during the [[War of the First Coalition|First Coalition War]] in which the [[Electorate of Hanover]] took part on the side of the anti-French coalition. The abbess, Artemisia von Bock, anticipated an upcoming occupation of the convent and quickly sold a large stock of artworks, [[Manuscript|manuscripts]] and books from the library, some into private hands, some into the care of larger archives and depositories nearby. During [[World War II]] many of those archives fell victim to [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Allied bombing statistics 1939\u201345|Allied bombing raids]], and many more artworks and manuscripts vanished within [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|the turmoils near the end of the war]] when German administrative structures collapsed and effectively ceased to exist.<ref>Dolle; Knochenhauer (eds.), Klosterbuch, (2012), vol. 2, 940-946.</ref>\n\n== Historical milieu ==\nAs new women entered the convent, they did not break off contact to their biological families. In that sense, the nuns lived in a ''double family'', as they were indissolubly linked both to their biological familiy and their newfound sisters in the convent. Their regular and unbroken contact to relatives in the outside world is documented in a number of letters, especially from the 15th and 16th centuries.<ref>[http://diglib.hab.de/edoc/ed000248/start.htm [[Henrike L\u00e4hnemann|L\u00e4hnemann]]; [[Eva Schlotheuber|Schlotheuber]] et.al. (eds.), Netzwerke der Nonnen (2016-), online edition]</ref> The familial connections between the nuns and the L\u00fcneburg patrician families are widely reconstructed and show a deep link between the convent and the city politics.<ref>Witzendorff, Stammtafeln (1952).</ref> Further connections could arise between the convent and other estates that a new provost held beside L\u00fcne Abbey.\n\n== Literacy and education ==\n[[File:Poster Presentation for the Nuns Network Project.pdf|alt=The four fields show 1. The Abbey of L\u00fcne, 2. One of the medieval letter books, 2. Members of the project group working on the edition (from left to right: Edmund Wareham, Lena Vosding, Eva Schlotheuber, Torsten Scha\u00dfan), 4. The open access online edition. The underlying map shows the Hanseatic League around 1400.|thumb|Poster presentation for the Nuns Network Project]]\nThe extant amounts of manuscripts originating within the convent walls suggest a thorough education of the nuns in the [[Latin]], Liberal Arts and theology. The educational standard was not limited to the convent leaders, but extended to every [[Novitiate|novice]] entering the abbey, provided by the convent\u2019s own [[Monastic school|monastic school]]. For the nuns, the central purpose of education was the rightful execution of the liturgy which had to be sung in Latin. In their letters, they styled themselves as [[Bride of Christ|Brides of Christ]], dedicating their life to serve God as spouses in the vineyard of the convent. Their personal and business correspondence only recently has been brought back to the attention.<ref>[[Eva Schlotheuber|Schlotheuber]], Doctrina (2019).</ref>\n\nLetters between the convent and their secular contacts, such as the city of L\u00fcneburg or their estates, were written in [[Middle Low German]] which was the economic [[Lingua franca|''lingua franca'']] within Northern Germany and around the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] as the main operating areas of the [[Hanseatic League]]. [[Macaronic language|Codeswitching between Latin and Middle Low German]] was used, mainly in the correspondence between the convents.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[Image:L\u00fcne sommerremter.jpg|thumb|Summer [[refectory]] (''Remter'') at L\u00fcne Abbey, restored in 16th century style]]\n[[Image:L\u00fcne Wandmalerei.jpg|thumb|Wall painting on the east wall of the refectory dating to 1500]]\nIn 1380 the convent was rebuilt in the [[Brick Gothic]] style after a major fire. The [[cloisters]], the single-nave church of 1412 and the ''Nonnenchor'' (nuns' choir) are well preserved, the same is true of the former ''Dormitorium'' (dormitory).<ref>[https://www.kloster-luene.de/klosteranlage/geschichte/ Article on the abbey's architectural history on its website.]</ref>\n\n== Art ==\nL\u00fcne is famous for its knitting and embroidery (wool on linen). Valuable pieces (white embroidery (''Wei\u00dfstickerei'') altar cloths, fasting cloths (''Fastent\u00fccher'') and carpets, the oldest dating to around 1250) are displayed in the textile museum in the grounds of the monastery opened in 1995. In the church on the altar in the ''Nonnenchor'' is a painting from the workshop of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. The high altar's [[triptych]] (carved altar) was made in the early 16th century. Also worthy of mention are the wall paintings from around 1500 in the [[refectory]] of the monastery.<ref>https://www.kloster-luene.de/klosteranlage/klosterschaetze/ Article about the ''convent treasures'' on the abbey's website.]</ref>\n\n== Scholarly reception ==\nUnsurprisingly, most of the historiographic literature on L\u00fcne Abbey is written in German. Only the most recent edition project, a cooperation between the universities of Oxford and D\u00fcsseldorf on the convent's letter collections,<ref>[http://diglib.hab.de/edoc/ed000248/start.htm [[Henrike L\u00e4hnemann|L\u00e4hnemann]]; [[Eva Schlotheuber|Schlotheuber]]et.al. (eds.), Netzwerke der Nonnen (2016-), online edition]</ref> has opened up the opportunity of a more widespread reception of the Lower German women's convents within the [[Anglosphere]]. Nonetheless, the amount of English literature currently available remains all but non-existent.<ref>An exception being the article by Vosding, Gifts (2018).</ref>\n\n== List of heads of convent ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|+ List of provosts\n!Name||From||Until\n|-\n|Burchardt||1197?||1197?\n|-\n|Otto||1202?||1213?\n|-\n|Thietwig ||1231?||1231?\n|-\n|Conrad||1241?||1255?\n|-\n|Werner von D\u00f6ren||1263?||1264?\n|-\n|Heinrich von der S\u00fclte||1273?||1278?\n|-\n|Alward||1282?||1288\n|-\n|Christian||1288||1308\n|-\n|Johannes Schinkel||1309||1317\n|-\n|Gerlach von Stade||1318||1339\n|-\n|Heinrich von Langlingen||1341||1369\n|-\n|Conrad von Soltau||1369||1370\n|-\n|Egidius von Tusculum||1373||1373\n|-\n|Johannes Weigergang||1374||1412\n|-\n|Heinrich Bodenstedt||1412||1433\n|-\n|Cord von Tzerstede||1433||1440\n|-\n|Dietrich Schaper||1440||1451\n|-\n|L\u00fcder Lerte||1451||1457\n|-\n|Dietrich Schaper||1457||1457\n|-\n|Nikolaus Graurock||1457||1470\n|-\n|Otto Vulle||1470||1471\n|-\n|Nikolaus Graurock||1471||1493\n|-\n|Nikolaus Schomaker||1494||1506\n|-\n|Johannes Lorber||1506||1529\n|-\n|Johann Haselhorst in Winsen (ducal [[Bailiff|bailiff]])||1529||1535\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|+ List of prioresses (until 1562)\n\n!Name||From||Until\n|-\n|Hildeswidis von Marcboldestorpe||1172||?\n|-\n|Gertrudis||1231?||1231?\n|-\n|Oldegardis||1284?||1289?\n|-\n|Ghisla||1299?||1315?\n|-\n|Elisabeth||1318?||1329\n|-\n|Lutgarda||1330||1337?\n|-\n|Gertrudis||1339?||1339?\n|-\n|Alheyd von Barfelde||1341?||1346?\n|-\n|Ghyseltrudis Willeri||1349?||1357?\n|-\n|Richza||1362?||1369\n|-\n|Mechtildis||1370||1370?\n|-\n|Wicburgis||1374?||1374\n|-\n|Kunegundis||1375||1375?\n|-\n|Mechtildis von Oedeme||1397?||1415\n|-\n|Drude Semmelbecker||1415||1422?\n|-\n|Helena von Meding||1436?||1446?\n|-\n|Gebeke M\u00f6ller||1448?||1450\n|-\n|Gertrudis Schomaker||1450||1450\n|-\n|Susanne M\u00fcnter ||1451||1451?\n|-\n|Mette von dem Berge||1458?||1468\n|-\n|Berta Hoyer||1468||1481\n|-\n|Sophia von Bodenteich||1481||1504\n|-\n|Mechtild Wilde||1504||1535\n|-\n|Elisabeth Schneverding||1535||1540\n|-\n|Katharina Semmelbecker ||1540||1562\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left\"\n|+ List of Protestant abbesses (since 1562)\n!Name||From||Until\n|-\n|Anna Marenholtz||1562||1580\n|-\n|Dorothea von Meding||1580||1634\n|-\n|Katharina Margaretha von Estorff||1634||1659\n|-\n|Dorothea Elisabeth von Meding||1659||1672\n|-\n|Dorothea Maria von Estorff||1672||1680\n|-\n|Margaretha Elisabeth von Harling||1680||1685\n|-\n|Barbara von Wittorf||1685||1713\n|-\n|Anna Dorothea von Estorff||1713||1729\n|-\n|Eleonore Margaretha von Harling||1729||1759\n|-\n|Barbara Sophia von Estorff||1759||1790\n|-\n|Eleonore Artemisia Friederike von Bock von W\u00fclfingen||1790||1798\n|-\n|Caroline von der Wense||1799||1838\n|-\n|Wilhelmine von Meding||1838||1844\n|-\n|Friederike von Meding||1844||1893\n|-\n|Dorothee Marie von der Decken||1893||1927\n|-\n|Emilie Elisabeth von M\u00f6ller||1927||1944\n|-\n|Marie Agnes von Reden||1944||1970\n|-\n|Ilse Erna Margarethe Segler||1970||1976\n|-\n|Liesel Sofie G\u00f6ssling||1976||2000\n|-\n|Barbara Taglang||2000||2006\n|-\n|Renate Kr\u00fcger||2006||2008\n|-\n|Reinhild Freifrau von der Goltz, n\u00e9e von dem Knesebeck-Milendonck||2008||incumbent\n|}<ref>Dolle; Knochenhauer (eds.), Klosterbuch (2012), 946-947.</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*B\u00f6ker, Doris; Winghart, Stefan, eds.

Today it is a [[Lutheranism|Protestant Lutheran]] convent and is managed by the [[Klosterkammer Hannover]] (Hanover Monastic Chamber). The current [[abbess]] is Reinhild [[Freifrau]] von der Goltz.<ref>http://www.orden-online.de/news/2008/04/03/neue-aebtissin-im-evangelischen-kloster-luene-eingefuehrt/</ref>\n\nFounded in 1172, the convent soon established itself as a wealthy and autonomous local power in the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]] region. It recruited its nuns mostly from the influential [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician families]] of [[L\u00fcneburg]] and accomodated up to 60 women over most of its existence. These women would be thoroughly educated in [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Liberal arts education|Liberal Arts]] and in Christian doctrine and liturgy. Over the course of the 15th and 16th centuries, the convent structure changed first through the monastic reform (1481), then through the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]] but was never resolved.\n\n== History ==\n=== The convent as a Benedictine abbey ===\n==== Foundation and early history ====\nL\u00fcne Abbey was founded in 1172 by a small community of no more than 10 noblewomen from [[Borstel, Lower Saxony|Nordborstel]]. The group, led by [[Hildeswidis von Marcboldestorpe]], was allowed to move into a vacant chapel that had been built as a hermitage for a monk from [[L\u00fcneburg]] in 1140. The foundation charter was signed by [[Hugo of Verden|Hugo]], [[Roman Catholic diocese of Verden|bishop of Verden]], [[Henry the Lion]], duke of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[History of Bavaria#Under the Welfs|Bavaria]], and Berthold II., abbott of the monastery [[St Michael]] in L\u00fcneburg.<ref>Nolte, Quellen (1932), 120\u2013126.</ref> The convent was dedicated to [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St Bartholomew]] and kept a part of the apostle's robe as the convent\u2019s main [[relic]].<ref>The saint is depicted on the convent\u2019s [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], cf. Reinhardt, Art. L\u00fcne, in: Germania Benedictina 11, 393.</ref> Although initially the convent did not follow any specific monastic rule, it adopted the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] during the course of the 13th century. The original convent buildings burned down two times (in 1240 and in 1372) and were subsequently rebuilt closer to the city of L\u00fcneburg.<ref>B\u00f6ker; Winghart (eds.), Baudenkmale (2010).</ref>\n\nOver the course of the 13th century, the convent grew steadily to a number of up to 60 nuns. They were mainly recruited from surrounding noble families and from the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician families]] of L\u00fcneburg. To cover the general living expenses, the convent relied first and foremost on the yearly income from the local [[History of salt#Cities and wars|saltworks]] that it held as a [[Pfandherr]] (pledge lord) since 1229. In 1367, the community had grown so influential and wealthy that it openly refused to accept its [[Pope|papally]] appointed [[Provost (religion)|provost]] [[Giles of Tusculum]], a powerful [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal bishop]], and instead elected their own candidate, the lesser known [[Conrad of Soltau]]. In the end, both parties agreed on a third candidate, [[Johannes Weigergang]], and [[Pope Urban V]] granted the nuns the [[Privilege (law)|privilege]] to elect their own provost.<ref>Nolte, Quellen (1932), 88\u201390.</ref> As premodern female convents had to rely on a male provost to represent the community\u2019s political and economical interests to the outside world, this privilege of free election implied the highest degree of autonomy the convent could obtain. In 1395, the L\u00fcne provost was granted the full sacramental care of the nuns, so that the convent was now [[De facto|''de facto'']] autonomous, both politically and spiritually.\n\n==== The Monastic Reform of 1481 ====\nThe 15th century brought with it a widespread desire for ecclesiastical reform, and the monastic orders were no exception. The reform movement (not to be confused with the [[Protestant Reformation]]) firmly established itself in Northern Germany in the early second half of the century.<ref>Grotefend, Der Einflu\u00df (1872), 73-88.</ref> The emerging reform theologians viewed the rich and influential convents of the north as having diverted from the original, rightful teachings of Christianity, first and foremost the ideal of poverty, but also their interference in the [[Temporalities|temporal sphere]] and a decline in Latin education were criticised. For a long time, historians have adopted the latter claim unaudited, but whether or not and to what extends it was actually accurate has to be evaluated individually for each convent. In most examined cases, however, the production of Latin writing within the women\u2019s convents shows no sign of the alleged decline in education.<ref>[[Jeffrey F. Hamburger|Hamburger]], [[Eva Schlotheuber|Schlotheuber]], Marti, [[Margot Fassler|Fassler]], Liturgical Life (2017), 92-96.</ref> L\u00fcne Abbey agreed nonetheless to undergo reformative measures, and took in the provost and seven nuns from the nearby [[Ebstorf Abbey]] which had already undergone reforms, in 1481. The provost, [[Matthias von dem Knesebeck]], deposed the [[Prior|prioress]] [[Bertha Hoyer]] and her subprioress, and installed his own candidate, the former Ebstorf nun [[Sophia von Bodenteich]].<ref>Nolte, Quellen (1932), 127-128.</ref>\n\nThe reform included an enhanced curriculum in matters of Catholic doctrine, a changed liturgy in conformity with the reform, and a centralized and communal intake of daily meals to strengthen the convent\u2019s isolation from the outside world and to better control the required abstinence from meat on Fridays and during [[Lent]]. The latter arguably provided the greatest logistical difficulty, as both the kitchen and the [[Refectory|refectory]] had to be rebuilt.<ref>Nolte, Quellen (1932), 128.</ref> Subsequently, the convent was incorporated into a dense network of reformed Northern German female convents and their male provosts, most of them committed reformers, which became a regional power within ecclesiastical politics.\n\n=== L\u00fcne Abbey and the Protestant Reformation ===\nThe territorial fragmentation of political sovereignty in Germany on the outset of the 16th century pushed the individual [[Territorial lord|territorial lords]] (\u2018\u2019Landesherren\u2019\u2019) into the position of the official decision-maker regarding the acceptance or rejection of the new Reformation process.<ref>Wolgast, Reformation (2017), 39.</ref> The monastic convents had to fear for their survival, as the new movement set out to secularize and expropriate what they saw as an expression of the decadence and detachment from the faithful in the outside world.<ref>Schmidt, Kirchenregiment (1984)</ref> L\u00fcne Abbey fell into the jurisdiction of the [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] which had been the main site of the [[Hildesheim Diocesan Feud]] in 1519. The convent suffered greatly under the joint raids of the princes of [[Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel]] and [[Principality of Calenberg|Calenberg]], at some point even having to evacuate the convent building and move into the city of L\u00fcneburg itself.<ref>Van den Heuvel and Boetticher, Geschichte (1998), 35-38.</ref> The feud saw Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg fall into major debt and its convents become weakened as a result. In 1525, as many German territories had to face [[German Peasants' War|peasant uprisings]], [[Ernest I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Duke Ernest I]] tried to quickly consolidate his budget by sending a demand over 28,000 [[guilder|guilders]] to all convents in Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg which he threatened to enforce by a military show of force, if necessary.<ref>Tamcke, Impulse (1997), 242.</ref> It did not take long after that, however, for the duke to publicly declare his allegiance to the cause of the Reformation and thus target the Roman Catholic convents directly.<ref>Brandis, Zur Reformationsgeschichte (2017), 43.</ref> The female convents of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, tightly knit together since the monastic reform of 1481, staunchly opposed the duke\u2019s demands, and the situation effectively went into a standstill for the next four years. In 1529, Duke Ernest and his court decided to break up the monastic network by first targeting its male provosts. He hoped to replace them one by one with a Protestant preacher loyal only to the duke himself, as those provosts had once themselves deposed the old leadership of the convents without much opposition.<ref>[[Henrike L\u00e4hnemann|L\u00e4hnemann]], Nonnenkrieg (2016), 101.</ref> Indeed, in late 1529, the L\u00fcne provost Johannes Lorber resigned from his post and made way for a ducal administrator, Johannes Haselhorst, and a Protestant preacher, Hieronymous Enkhusen. In the following year, these measures were followed up by the inception of a new monastic policy which changed the liturgy within the convents drastically and nullified all [[Religious vows#In the Catholic Church|monastic vows]]. The female communities were explicitly stated to be the new religious enemies.<ref>Rhegius, \u2019\u2019Radtslach\u2019\u2019 (1530).</ref> In 1531, one of the ducal [[Tax collector|tax collectors]] even went so far as to destroy one of the chapels of L\u00fcne Abbey, consecrated to [[St. Gangolf|Saint Gangulphus of Burgundy]].\nAs prioress Mechthild von Wilde died in 1535, the nuns\u2019 opposition against the Reformation faltered altogether. Although the convent was able to independently elect a new prioress, Elisabeth Schneverding, they accepted their incorporation into the Protestant [[Landeshoheit]] of the duke. Duke Ernest, on the other hand, surprisingly accepted that the convent remained a secular foundation for unmarried Protestant women (''Damenstift''), and did not dissolve the institution as a whole.<ref>Brandis, Zur Reformationsgeschichte (2017), 41.</ref> It took, however, until 1562, for the convent to elect its first decidedly Protestant head.\n\n=== L\u00fcne Abbey as a ''Damenstift'' ===\nOver the course of the following two centuries, the community had a somewhat ambiguous status. Outwardly, it was treated as a purely secular retirement institution, but inwardly, the community still led a highly devoted spiritual life in Benedictine tradition. In 1711, this tension was resolved in an agreement between the convent and [[George I of Great Britain|Duke George-Louis]] (later George I of Great Britain) in favour of the secular role that came to dominate also withing the convent walls. L\u00fcne Abbey would find itself as part of a war zone two more times. In 1793, a French army marched through nearby territory during the [[War of the First Coalition|First Coalition War]] in which the [[Electorate of Hanover]] took part on the side of the anti-French coalition. The abbess, Artemisia von Bock, anticipated an upcoming occupation of the convent and quickly sold a large stock of artworks, [[Manuscript|manuscripts]] and books from the library, some into private hands, some into the care of larger archives and depositories nearby. During [[World War II]] many of those archives fell victim to [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Allied bombing statistics 1939\u201345|Allied bombing raids]], and many more artworks and manuscripts vanished within [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|the turmoils near the end of the war]] when German administrative structures collapsed and effectively ceased to exist.<ref>Dolle; Knochenhauer (eds.), Klosterbuch, (2012), vol. 2, 940-946.</ref>\n\n== Historical milieu ==\nAs new women entered the convent, they did not break off contact to their biological families. In that sense, the nuns lived in a ''double family'', as they were indissolubly linked both to their biological familiy and their newfound sisters in the convent. Their regular and unbroken contact to relatives in the outside world is documented in a number of letters, especially from the 15th and 16th centuries.<ref>[http://diglib.hab.de/edoc/ed000248/start.htm [[Henrike L\u00e4hnemann|L\u00e4hnemann]]; [[Eva Schlotheuber|Schlotheuber]] et.al. (eds.), Netzwerke der Nonnen (2016-), online edition]</ref> The familial connections between the nuns and the L\u00fcneburg patrician families are widely reconstructed and show a deep link between the convent and the city politics.<ref>Witzendorff, Stammtafeln (1952).</ref> Further connections could arise between the convent and other estates that a new provost held beside L\u00fcne Abbey.\n\n== Literacy and education ==\n[[File:Poster Presentation for the Nuns Network Project.pdf|alt=The four fields show 1. The Abbey of L\u00fcne, 2. One of the medieval letter books, 2. Members of the project group working on the edition (from left to right: Edmund Wareham, Lena Vosding, Eva Schlotheuber, Torsten Scha\u00dfan), 4. The open access online edition. The underlying map shows the Hanseatic League around 1400.|thumb|Poster presentation for the Nuns Network Project]]\nThe extant amounts of manuscripts originating within the convent walls suggest a thorough education of the nuns in the [[Latin]], Liberal Arts and theology. The educational standard was not limited to the convent leaders, but extended to every [[Novitiate|novice]] entering the abbey, provided by the convent\u2019s own [[Monastic school|monastic school]]. For the nuns, the central purpose of education was the rightful execution of the liturgy which had to be sung in Latin. In their letters, they styled themselves as [[Bride of Christ|Brides of Christ]], dedicating their life to serve God as spouses in the vineyard of the convent. Their personal and business correspondence only recently has been brought back to the attention.<ref>[[Eva Schlotheuber|Schlotheuber]], Doctrina (2019).</ref>\n\nLetters between the convent and their secular contacts, such as the city of L\u00fcneburg or their estates, were written in [[Middle Low German]] which was the economic [[Lingua franca|''lingua franca'']] within Northern Germany and around the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]] as the main operating areas of the [[Hanseatic League]]. [[Macaronic language|Codeswitching between Latin and Middle Low German]] was used, mainly in the correspondence between the convents.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[Image:L\u00fcne sommerremter.jpg|thumb|Summer [[refectory]] (''Remter'') at L\u00fcne Abbey, restored in 16th century style]]\n[[Image:L\u00fcne Wandmalerei.jpg|thumb|Wall painting on the east wall of the refectory dating to 1500]]\nIn 1380 the convent was rebuilt in the [[Brick Gothic]] style after a major fire. The [[cloisters]], the single-nave church of 1412 and the ''Nonnenchor'' (nuns' choir) are well preserved, the same is true of the former ''Dormitorium'' (dormitory).<ref>[https://www.kloster-luene.de/klosteranlage/geschichte/ Article on the abbey's architectural history on its website.]</ref>\n\n== Art ==\nL\u00fcne is famous for its knitting and embroidery (wool on linen). Valuable pieces (white embroidery (''Wei\u00dfstickerei'') altar cloths, fasting cloths (''Fastent\u00fccher'') and carpets, the oldest dating to around 1250) are displayed in the textile museum in the grounds of the monastery opened in 1995. In the church on the altar in the ''Nonnenchor'' is a painting from the workshop of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. The high altar's [[triptych]] (carved altar) was made in the early 16th century. Also worthy of mention are the wall paintings from around 1500 in the [[refectory]] of the monastery.<ref>https://www.kloster-luene.de/klosteranlage/klosterschaetze/ Article about the ''convent treasures'' on the abbey's website.]</ref>\n\n== Scholarly reception ==\nUnsurprisingly, most of the historiographic literature on L\u00fcne Abbey is written in German. Only the most recent edition project, a cooperation between the universities of Oxford and D\u00fcsseldorf on the convent's letter collections,<ref>[http://diglib.hab.de/edoc/ed000248/start.htm [[Henrike L\u00e4hnemann|L\u00e4hnemann]]; [[Eva Schlotheuber|Schlotheuber]]et.al. (eds.), Netzwerke der Nonnen (2016-), online edition]</ref> has opened up the opportunity of a more widespread reception of the Lower German women's convents within the [[Anglosphere]]. Nonetheless, the amount of English literature currently available remains all but non-existent.<ref>An exception being the article by Vosding, Gifts (2018).</ref>\n\n== List of heads of convent ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|+ List of provosts\n!Name||From||Until\n|-\n|Burchardt||1197?||1197?\n|-\n|Otto||1202?||1213?\n|-\n|Thietwig ||1231?||1231?\n|-\n|Conrad||1241?||1255?\n|-\n|Werner von D\u00f6ren||1263?||1264?\n|-\n|Heinrich von der S\u00fclte||1273?||1278?\n|-\n|Alward||1282?||1288\n|-\n|Christian||1288||1308\n|-\n|Johannes Schinkel||1309||1317\n|-\n|Gerlach von Stade||1318||1339\n|-\n|Heinrich von Langlingen||1341||1369\n|-\n|Conrad von Soltau||1369||1370\n|-\n|Egidius von Tusculum||1373||1373\n|-\n|Johannes Weigergang||1374||1412\n|-\n|Heinrich Bodenstedt||1412||1433\n|-\n|Cord von Tzerstede||1433||1440\n|-\n|Dietrich Schaper||1440||1451\n|-\n|L\u00fcder Lerte||1451||1457\n|-\n|Dietrich Schaper||1457||1457\n|-\n|Nikolaus Graurock||1457||1470\n|-\n|Otto Vulle||1470||1471\n|-\n|Nikolaus Graurock||1471||1493\n|-\n|Nikolaus Schomaker||1494||1506\n|-\n|Johannes Lorber||1506||1529\n|-\n|Johann Haselhorst in Winsen (ducal [[Bailiff|bailiff]])||1529||1535\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:1em\"\n|+ List of prioresses (until 1562)\n\n!Name||From||Until\n|-\n|Hildeswidis von Marcboldestorpe||1172||?\n|-\n|Gertrudis||1231?||1231?\n|-\n|Oldegardis||1284?||1289?\n|-\n|Ghisla||1299?||1315?\n|-\n|Elisabeth||1318?||1329\n|-\n|Lutgarda||1330||1337?\n|-\n|Gertrudis||1339?||1339?\n|-\n|Alheyd von Barfelde||1341?||1346?\n|-\n|Ghyseltrudis Willeri||1349?||1357?\n|-\n|Richza||1362?||1369\n|-\n|Mechtildis||1370||1370?\n|-\n|Wicburgis||1374?||1374\n|-\n|Kunegundis||1375||1375?\n|-\n|Mechtildis von Oedeme||1397?||1415\n|-\n|Drude Semmelbecker||1415||1422?\n|-\n|Helena von Meding||1436?||1446?\n|-\n|Gebeke M\u00f6ller||1448?||1450\n|-\n|Gertrudis Schomaker||1450||1450\n|-\n|Susanne M\u00fcnter ||1451||1451?\n|-\n|Mette von dem Berge||1458?||1468\n|-\n|Berta Hoyer||1468||1481\n|-\n|Sophia von Bodenteich||1481||1504\n|-\n|Mechtild Wilde||1504||1535\n|-\n|Elisabeth Schneverding||1535||1540\n|-\n|Katharina Semmelbecker ||1540||1562\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left\"\n|+ List of Protestant abbesses (since 1562)\n!Name||From||Until\n|-\n|Anna Marenholtz||1562||1580\n|-\n|Dorothea von Meding||1580||1634\n|-\n|Katharina Margaretha von Estorff||1634||1659\n|-\n|Dorothea Elisabeth von Meding||1659||1672\n|-\n|Dorothea Maria von Estorff||1672||1680\n|-\n|Margaretha Elisabeth von Harling||1680||1685\n|-\n|Barbara von Wittorf||1685||1713\n|-\n|Anna Dorothea von Estorff||1713||1729\n|-\n|Eleonore Margaretha von Harling||1729||1759\n|-\n|Barbara Sophia von Estorff||1759||1790\n|-\n|Eleonore Artemisia Friederike von Bock von W\u00fclfingen||1790||1798\n|-\n|Caroline von der Wense||1799||1838\n|-\n|Wilhelmine von Meding||1838||1844\n|-\n|Friederike von Meding||1844||1893\n|-\n|Dorothee Marie von der Decken||1893||1927\n|-\n|Emilie Elisabeth von M\u00f6ller||1927||1944\n|-\n|Marie Agnes von Reden||1944||1970\n|-\n|Ilse Erna Margarethe Segler||1970||1976\n|-\n|Liesel Sofie G\u00f6ssling||1976||2000\n|-\n|Barbara Taglang||2000||2006\n|-\n|Renate Kr\u00fcger||2006||2008\n|-\n|Reinhild Freifrau von der Goltz, n\u00e9e von dem Knesebeck-Milendonck||2008||incumbent\n|}<ref>Dolle; Knochenhauer (eds.), Klosterbuch (2012), 946-947.</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*B\u00f6ker, Doris; Winghart, Stefan, eds.

In addition to tag team success, he was also a [[List of WWE United States Champions|one time]] [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]] and a [[List of WCW World Television Champions|three time]] [[WCW World Television Championship|World Television Champion]]. Beyond WCW, Steiner found success in the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]], where he and Scott won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Championship]] [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|twice]].\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early career (1983-1988)===\nRick Steiner was an [[Collegiate wrestling|amateur wrestling]] standout at the [[University of Michigan]], where he placed second at the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] Championships in 1983 For The Wolverines, became an NCAA qualifier and established the fastest pin record in the school's history at 15 seconds. (It is also noted that at the 1983 NCAA tournament, Rick wrestled against [[Tab Thacker]] of North Carolina State.  Thacker went on to fame as a Hollywood actor)<ref name=OWOW/> After earning his [[bachelor's degree]] in education,<ref name=REMAX>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingrealestate.com/about-us/|title=About Broadus/Steiner Group at RE/MAX}}</ref> he was introduced to professional wrestling by [[George Steele|George \"The Animal\" Steele]] and entered the business immediately out of college.<ref name=OWOW/> He initially wrestled under the name Rob Rechsteiner before he took on the simpler [[ring name]] Rick Steiner. He spent time in the [[American Wrestling Association]], [[Montreal]] promotion International Wrestling, and the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF). While in the UWF he formed a [[tag team]] with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], winning the [[UWF World Tag Team Championship]] in 1987. Also in 1987 he wrestled for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=201&page=4&year=1987&promotion=7 |title=Rick Steiner - Matches |website=CageMatch |accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref> The UWF was bought out by [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] in 1988, acquiring much of its roster (including Steiner), for his [[National Wrestling Alliance]] territory, [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP).<ref name=OWOW/>\n\n===Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1988\u20131992) ===\n{{Main|The Steiner Brothers}}\nSteiner was a charter member of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|faction]] known as [[The Varsity Club]] along with [[Mike Rotunda]] and their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], with the long-term angle being that Rotunda was favored by Sullivan and both of them looked at Steiner as their dull-witted underling. It also started a slow fan favorite turn for Steiner, as he began breaking rules less often and was portrayed as a dim but good-hearted guy who was a villain by association only. Steiner and Rotunda were given a spot at the second ever Clash of the Champions, which took place in Miami on June 8, 1988. The duo faced Jimmy Garvin and Ronnie Garvin in a losing effort. Eventually, this would lead to a breakup and Steiner subsequently [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|became]] a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] before winning the [[WCW World Television Championship|Television Championship]] from Rotunda at [[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade]].\n\nIn early 1989, his brother Scott began accompanying him to the ring and eventually, the two formed [[The Steiner Brothers|a tag team]]. They proved they were a serious tag team by defeating the Freebirds for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championship]] in November 1989. The pair continued to dominate in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) (as JCP came to be known following its sale to [[Turner Broadcasting System]]), winning multiple championships and making occasional trips to [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1992\u20131994)===\nThe two jumped to the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), WCW's biggest competitor, in December 1992 after then WCW Executive Vice President [[Bill Watts]] lowballed them on a contract extension and then gave them the option for an early release from their present contracts. They found success there as well, winning the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] from [[Money Inc.]] ([[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]]) on two occasions.\n\nThe Steiners left the WWF in 1994, with Rick stating that he felt that [[Vince McMahon]] was not following through with promises made to the team.\n\n===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)===\nAfter leaving the WWF, the Steiner Brothers debuted in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] on July 28, 1995, defeating [[Dudley Dudley (wrestler)|Dudley Dudley]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Vampire Warrior]]. A few days later on August 4, they defeated Dudley Dudley and [[2 Cold Scorpio]]. The following day, the Steiner Brothers made their debut in the [[The Arena (Philadelphia)|ECW Arena]] at [[Wrestlepalooza (1995)|Wrestlepalooza]], where they teamed with [[Eddie Guerrero]] in a loss to Scorpio, [[Dean Malenko]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]]. On August 25, they defeated Scorpio and Malenko and then Scorpio and [[Chris Benoit]] the following evening. On August 28, they defeated Dudley Dudley and [[Dances with Dudley]].\n\nAt Gangstas' Paradise on September 16, 1995, they teamed with [[Tazz|Taz]] in a loss to [[The Eliminators]] ([[John Kronus]] and [[Perry Saturn]]) and [[Jason Knight|Jason]]. On September 23, they defeated [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] and [[Stevie Richards]]. Rick made his final ECW appearance on October 28, teaming with Taz in a loss to The Eliminators in a tag team match.\n\n===New Japan Pro Wrestling (1991\u20131997, 2000)===\nSteiner made his return to [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] in 1991 with Scott. They won the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] two times. In 1995, the Steiners wrestled for NJPW full time until going to WCW in March 1996. Rick returned later that year while under contact with WCW with [[Keiji Muto]] as a tag team. On May 3, 1997 he teamed with Scott and Muto as they lost to [[Masahiro Chono]] and [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]].\n\nOn January 4, 2000 Steiner defeated [[Randy Savage]] at the Tokyo Dome. This would be Savage's last match for a few years.\n\n===Return to WCW (1996\u20132001)===\nOn the March 11, 1996 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'', the Steiner Brothers redebuted in [[World Championship Wrestling]] in a losing effort to [[The Road Warriors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1996032m.htm|title=Nitro report on March 11, 1996}}</ref> The following week on ''Nitro'', the Steiners picked up their first win since returning after they defeated [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]].<ref name=Nitro96>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1996033m.htm|title=Nitro report on March 18, 1996}}</ref> After briefly [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuding]] with both the Warriors and Public Enemy, the Steiners began feuding with the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Champions]] [[Harlem Heat]].

It also started a slow fan favorite turn for Steiner, as he began breaking rules less often and was portrayed as a dim but good-hearted guy who was a villain by association only. Steiner and Rotunda were given a spot at the second ever Clash of the Champions, which took place in Miami on June 8, 1988. The duo faced Jimmy Garvin and Ronnie Garvin in a losing effort. Eventually, this would lead to a breakup and Steiner subsequently [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|became]] a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] before winning the [[WCW World Television Championship|Television Championship]] from Rotunda at [[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade]].\n\nIn early 1989, his brother Scott began accompanying him to the ring and eventually, the two formed [[The Steiner Brothers|a tag team]].

They found success there as well, winning the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]] from [[Money Inc.]] ([[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]]) on two occasions.\n\nThe Steiners left the WWF in 1994, with Rick stating that he felt that [[Vince McMahon]] was not following through with promises made to the team.\n\n===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1995)===\nAfter leaving the WWF, the Steiner Brothers debuted in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] on July 28, 1995, defeating [[Dudley Dudley (wrestler)|Dudley Dudley]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Vampire Warrior]].

They won the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] two times. In 1995, the Steiners wrestled for NJPW full time until going to WCW in March 1996. Rick returned later that year while under contact with WCW with [[Keiji Muto]] as a tag team. On May 3, 1997 he teamed with Scott and Muto as they lost to [[Masahiro Chono]] and [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Scott Hall]].\n\nOn January 4, 2000 Steiner defeated [[Randy Savage]] at the Tokyo Dome.

It is loosely based on Stoner's [[AR-10]],{{cn|date=July 2019}} rebuilt in its original [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] caliber.  SR-25 barrels were originally manufactured by [[Remington Arms]] with its 5R (5 grooves, right twist) [[rifling]], with twist 1:11.25. The heavy {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} barrel is [[Free-floating barrel|free-floating]], so handguards are attached to the front of the receiver and do not touch the barrel.\n\nIn 2005, a modified version of the SR-25 / Mk 11 rifle won US Army Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle (XM110 SASR) competition, and today it is being issued to US Army snipers as the [[M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System]].\n\n==History==\nIn the late 1950s, [[Eugene Stoner]] designed the [[AR-10]] battle rifle to equip U.S. troops.  It was accurate for an auto-loading rifle, but it lost the competition to the [[M14 rifle]].  The patent rights for the AR-10 and the [[AR-15]] were sold to [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]].  Colt focused on the AR-15, giving others the ability to capitalize on the AR-10 system.<ref name=\"sadj\">[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=741 Knight\u2019s Armament M110: The New Breed of Sniper Rifle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109010157/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=741 |date=2013-11-09 }} - SAdefensejournal.com, 5 January 2012</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, Stoner joined [[Knight's Armament Company]] and continued his AR-10 design work.  The end result was the SR-25 (adding together the numbers of the AR-10 and AR-15) which improved the AR-10 design with [[M16 rifle|M16A2]] advancements and parts commonality.  The original SR-25 was released in the early 1990s and had a heavy free-floating {{convert|24|in|mm|abbr=on}} match grade barrel with a [[fiberglass]] handguard.  It had a flat top upper receiver with a [[Picatinny rail|Mil-Std 1913 rail]] for mounting optics and a 2-stage match grade trigger.  The bolt carrier was similar to the AR-10's, being [[Chrome plating|chrome plated]] and having a captive firing pin retainer pin.  The SR-25 was designed specifically to fire {{convert|168|gr|g|abbr=on}} open-tip match cartridges.  Accuracy was guaranteed at or under 1 [[minute of angle]]. The SR-25 uses what has become colloquially known as [[SR-25 pattern magazine]]s. At first, AR-10 type 20-round magazines were used,{{clarify|date=April 2020}} but they were later replaced by steel 20-round magazines.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nThe [[United States Special Operations Command]] took interest in the SR-25, particularly its high magazine capacity and faster engagement time compared to bolt-action rifles.  After some modifications, SOCOM adopted the SR-25 as the Mk 11 Mod 0 in May 2000.  Changes included a shorter {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on}} barrel that could fire M118 and M118LR 7.62\u00d751mm NATO rounds and had a quick detachable sound suppressor mount.  An {{convert|11.35|in|mm|abbr=on}} free-floating handguard rail system allowed mounting accessories.  Flip-up front sights and adjustable back-up iron sights were added, and an M16A2 stock and pistol grip were used.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nBeginning in mid-2011, SOCOM began divesting the Mk 11 Mod 0 from their inventory and replacing it with the [[FN SCAR|SSR Mk 20]], the sniper variant of the FN SCAR.  The Mk 11 is to be completely replaced by 2017.<ref>[http://kitup.military.com/2011/06/usasoc-reveals-fnh-usa-mk20-plan.html USASOC Reveals FNH-USA Mk20 Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022054337/http://kitup.military.com/2011/06/usasoc-reveals-fnh-usa-mk20-plan.html |date=2014-10-22 }} - Kitup.Military.com, 8 June 2011</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:SR-25-Mk11--Our-IDF-2018-IZE-024.jpg|thumb|SR-25 Mk 11]]\nThe SR-25 enhanced match rifle utilizes the newer URX II [[Picatinny rail|Picatinny]]-[[Weaver rail mount|Weaver]] rail system, rather than the older Mk 11 free-floating RAS, on the top of the receiver to accept different scope mounts or a carrying handle with iron sights (front sight mounted on the rail located on the forward end of the non-modular handguard).<ref name=\"Site\">{{cite web|url=http://www.knightarmco.com/commercial/?term=sr-25|title=SR-25 EM SERIES|accessdate=2010-06-27|publisher=Knight's Armament Company|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022001853/http://www.knightarmco.com/commercial/?term=sr-25|archivedate=2012-10-22}}</ref> The match version is designed to shoot at a precision of 0.5 [[minutes of angle]], which corresponds to {{convert|0.5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[shot grouping|groups]] at {{convert|100|yd|m}}.\n\nThe '''Mk 11 Mod 0''' system is chambered for 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, and is designed for [[match-grade]] ammunition.  The Mk 11 system includes the rifle, 20 round box magazines, QD (Quick Detachable) scope rings, [[Leupold]] Mark 4 [[Telescopic sight#Mil-dot reticles|Mil-dot riflescope]], Harris swivel-base bipod on a Knight's mount, and QD [[Suppressor|sound suppressor]], which is also manufactured by Knight's Armament Co.<ref name=\"WG\"/>  Flip-up BUIS (Back up iron sights) are attached to the modified gas block and upper receiver.\n\nThe Mk 11 Mod 0 utilizes an Obermeyer {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} match target barrel, along with a RAS (Rail Accessory System) fore-end made by KAC, consisting of an {{convert|11.35|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} long match fore-end.  The RAS allows for quick attachment/detachment of MIL-STD-1913 components.  The aluminum fore-end makes no contact with the barrel forward of the receiver, allowing for extreme accuracy.  The Mk 11 Mod 0 has an empty weight of {{convert|15.3|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and an overall length of {{convert|45.4|in|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}}.  The civilian version, using the longer {{convert|24|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} match barrel, is guaranteed to produce groupings of less than {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}}, or 0.3 [[angular mil]], using factory match loads.\n\nDuring the [[Iraq War]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] ordered 180 '''Mk 11 Mod 1''' rifles.  These were Mk 11s equipped with the upper receiver of the [[M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System]].  The M110 upper gave the Mk 11 Mod 1 a URX modular rail system and a flash suppressor on the barrel.  These saw limited use before they were phased out when the Marines chose to purchase the '''Mk 11 Mod 2''', which was simply the [[United States Special Operations Command|USSOCOM]] and [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] designation for the complete M110 rifle.<ref>[http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/09/29/knights-armament-civilian-mk11-mod-1-sr-25/ Mk 11 Mod 1/2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808005804/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/09/29/knights-armament-civilian-mk11-mod-1-sr-25/ |date=2012-08-08 }} \u2013 Thefirearmblog.com, September 29, 2009</ref>\n\nThe new SR-25 Enhanced Match (E.M.)

It is loosely based on Stoner's [[AR-10]],{{cn|date=July 2019}} rebuilt in its original [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] caliber.  SR-25 barrels were originally manufactured by [[Remington Arms]] with its 5R (5 grooves, right twist) [[rifling]], with twist 1:11.25. The heavy {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} barrel is [[Free-floating barrel|free-floating]], so handguards are attached to the front of the receiver and do not touch the barrel.\n\nIn 2005, a modified version of the SR-25 / Mk 11 rifle won US Army Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle (XM110 SASR) competition, and today it is being issued to US Army snipers as the [[M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System]]\n\n==History==\nIn the late 1950s, [[Eugene Stoner]] designed the [[AR-10]] battle rifle to equip U.S. troops.  It was accurate for an auto-loading rifle, but it lost the competition to the [[M14 rifle]].  The patent rights for the AR-10 and the [[AR-15]] were sold to [[Colt's Manufacturing Company]].  Colt focused on the AR-15, giving others the ability to capitalize on the AR-10 system.<ref name=\"sadj\">[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=741 Knight\u2019s Armament M110: The New Breed of Sniper Rifle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109010157/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=741 |date=2013-11-09 }} - SAdefensejournal.com, 5 January 2012</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, Stoner joined [[Knight's Armament Company]] and continued his AR-10 design work.  The end result was the SR-25 (adding together the numbers of the AR-10 and AR-15) which improved the AR-10 design with [[M16 rifle|M16A2]] advancements and parts commonality.  The original SR-25 was released in the early 1990s and had a heavy free-floating {{convert|24|in|mm|abbr=on}} match grade barrel with a [[fiberglass]] handguard.  It had a flat top upper receiver with a [[Picatinny rail|Mil-Std 1913 rail]] for mounting optics and a 2-stage match grade trigger.  The bolt carrier was similar to the AR-10's, being [[Chrome plating|chrome plated]] and having a captive firing pin retainer pin.  The SR-25 was designed specifically to fire {{convert|168|gr|g|abbr=on}} open-tip match cartridges.  Accuracy was guaranteed at or under 1 [[minute of angle]]. The SR-25 uses what has become colloquially known as [[SR-25 pattern magazine]]s. At first, AR-10 type 20-round magazines were used,{{clarify|date=April 2020}} but they were later replaced by steel 20-round magazines.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nThe [[United States Special Operations Command]] took interest in the SR-25, particularly its high magazine capacity and faster engagement time compared to bolt-action rifles.  After some modifications, SOCOM adopted the SR-25 as the Mk 11 Mod 0 in May 2000.  Changes included a shorter {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on}} barrel that could fire M118 and M118LR 7.62\u00d751mm NATO rounds and had a quick detachable sound suppressor mount.  An {{convert|11.35|in|mm|abbr=on}} free-floating handguard rail system allowed mounting accessories.  Flip-up front sights and adjustable back-up iron sights were added, and an M16A2 stock and pistol grip were used.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nBeginning in mid-2011, SOCOM began divesting the Mk 11 Mod 0 from their inventory and replacing it with the [[FN SCAR|SSR Mk 20]], the sniper variant of the FN SCAR.  The Mk 11 is to be completely replaced by 2017.<ref>[http://kitup.military.com/2011/06/usasoc-reveals-fnh-usa-mk20-plan.html USASOC Reveals FNH-USA Mk20 Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022054337/http://kitup.military.com/2011/06/usasoc-reveals-fnh-usa-mk20-plan.html |date=2014-10-22 }} - Kitup.Military.com, 8 June 2011</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:SR-25-Mk11--Our-IDF-2018-IZE-024.jpg|thumb|SR-25 Mk 11]]\nThe SR-25 enhanced match rifle utilizes the newer URX II [[Picatinny rail|Picatinny]]-[[Weaver rail mount|Weaver]] rail system, rather than the older Mk 11 free-floating RAS, on the top of the receiver to accept different scope mounts or a carrying handle with iron sights (front sight mounted on the rail located on the forward end of the non-modular handguard).<ref name=\"Site\">{{cite web|url=http://www.knightarmco.com/commercial/?term=sr-25|title=SR-25 EM SERIES|accessdate=2010-06-27|publisher=Knight's Armament Company|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022001853/http://www.knightarmco.com/commercial/?term=sr-25|archivedate=2012-10-22}}</ref> The match version is designed to shoot at a precision of 0.5 [[minutes of angle]], which corresponds to {{convert|0.5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[shot grouping|groups]] at {{convert|100|yd|m}}.\n\nThe '''Mk 11 Mod 0''' system is chambered for 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, and is designed for [[match-grade]] ammunition.  The Mk 11 system includes the rifle, 20 round box magazines, QD (Quick Detachable) scope rings, [[Leupold]] Mark 4 [[Telescopic sight#Mil-dot reticles|Mil-dot riflescope]], Harris swivel-base bipod on a Knight's mount, and QD [[Suppressor|sound suppressor]], which is also manufactured by Knight's Armament Co.<ref name=\"WG\"/>  Flip-up BUIS (Back up iron sights) are attached to the modified gas block and upper receiver.\n\nThe Mk 11 Mod 0 utilizes an Obermeyer {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} match target barrel, along with a RAS (Rail Accessory System) fore-end made by KAC, consisting of an {{convert|11.35|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} long match fore-end.  The RAS allows for quick attachment/detachment of MIL-STD-1913 components.  The aluminum fore-end makes no contact with the barrel forward of the receiver, allowing for extreme accuracy.  The Mk 11 Mod 0 has an empty weight of {{convert|15.3|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and an overall length of {{convert|45.4|in|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}}.  The civilian version, using the longer {{convert|24|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} match barrel, is guaranteed to produce groupings of less than {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}}, or 0.3 [[angular mil]], using factory match loads.\n\nDuring the [[Iraq War]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] ordered 180 '''Mk 11 Mod 1''' rifles.  These were Mk 11s equipped with the upper receiver of the [[M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System]].  The M110 upper gave the Mk 11 Mod 1 a URX modular rail system and a flash suppressor on the barrel.  These saw limited use before they were phased out when the Marines chose to purchase the '''Mk 11 Mod 2''', which was simply the [[United States Special Operations Command|USSOCOM]] and [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] designation for the complete M110 rifle.<ref>[http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/09/29/knights-armament-civilian-mk11-mod-1-sr-25/ Mk 11 Mod 1/2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808005804/http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2009/09/29/knights-armament-civilian-mk11-mod-1-sr-25/ |date=2012-08-08 }} \u2013 Thefirearmblog.com, September 29, 2009</ref>\n\nThe new SR-25 Enhanced Match (E.M.)

The character was created by series producer [[Shonda Rhimes]], and is portrayed by actress [[Sandra Oh]]. Introduced as a [[Internship (medicine)|surgical intern]] at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Yang worked her way up to [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] level, eventually becoming a [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellow]], while her relationships with colleagues [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), and [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) formed a focal point of the series. Yang earlier in the series got engaged to [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]), in the past had a relationship with renowned surgeon and mentor Colin Marlow, and wed but later divorced [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]).\n\nOh originally auditioned for the role of [[Miranda Bailey]], although [[Chandra Wilson]] was ultimately cast in the part. Oh has received generally positive reviews for her portrayal, with Mark Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' considering her friendship with Meredith to be \"the secret core of ''Grey's''\". Oh has also garnered numerous awards and nominations for her role as Yang, including [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] wins in 2006. She was additionally nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] each year, from 2005 to 2009. Characterizing the character, ABC noted her competitiveness, ambition, and intelligence as her main traits, while her aggressive, and tactless attitude was highlighted as her main weakness. In May 2012, ''[[E! Online]]'' reported that Oh had signed on for two more years, along with her fellow cast members. Oh left the show after season 10, and her character Cristina Yang was written out of the storyline as a main cast member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2013/08/13/greys-anatomy-sandra-oh-leaving-cristina-yang/|title=Grey's Anatomy Shocker: Sandra Oh Leaving After 10 Years -- 'I Am Ready to Let Cristina Go'|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=13 August 2013|website=tvline.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Storylines and character ==\nCristina Yang is introduced as a graduate from [[Smith College]] and a fellow [[surgery|surgical]] [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] to [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T.R. Knight]]), and [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]); the five of them working under [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]). An [[atheism|atheistic]] competitive intern of Korean-American ancestry, she first desired to become a doctor after a childhood car accident which killed her biological father. Yang also has [[dyslexia]], and was raised in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]] by her mother and supportive [[Jewish]] stepfather. She has a B.A. from [[Smith College]], an MD from [[Stanford University]] and a Ph.D. from [[University of California, Berkeley]], making her a \"double doctor\". While her emotional pragmatism, competitive perfectionism, and logical nature lead many to view her as a cutthroat \"robot\", Cristina hits it off with Meredith on their first day and the pair soon become best friends and each other's \"person\", sharing the same \"dark and twisty\" sense of humor.\n\nDuring her internship, Cristina has an on-off relationship with the chief of [[cardiothoracic surgery]] [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]) that leads to an accidental pregnancy. Yang schedules an abortion without telling him about the pregnancy due to Burke's behavior towards their lack of relationship status. However, Yang experiences an [[ectopic pregnancy]] and Burke discovers the pregnancy after Yang collapses from a burst [[fallopian tube]] while in the O.R. Burke and Yang resume their relationship in the aftermath of her miscarriage. Burke gets shot after a \u201cshooting\u201d at the hospital and needs surgery. After Burke is shot in the arm and develops a hand tremor, Yang helps him cover it up by forming a covert partnership wherein she performs most of his surgeries. Yang initially denies involvement during a confrontation, but then confesses everything to [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]]), the chief of surgery. Yang's actions jeopardize Burke's chances of becoming chief, which he views as a huge betrayal. After a short breakup, Yang breaks the silence and Burke proposes marriage, which Yang accepts after eight days of hesitation. When the wedding day comes, Yang has a moment of panic before she is about to walk down the aisle but Burke leaves her because he wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready to commit. Burke then disappears and isn\u2019t seen again until later in the series. Yang then proceeds to go on her honeymoon to [[Hawaii]] with Meredith to recover, returning to discover that Burke has disappeared from her life and transferred to a different hospital.\n\nBurke is replaced by [[Erica Hahn]] ([[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]]), who immediately dislikes Yang for her trend of having affairs with famous surgeons, such as Burke, going so far as refusing to let her scrub in on cardiac surgeries. Eventually, [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]) moves in with Yang, and she still tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself and continues to cut Yang out of cardio surgeries and neglects to teach her, before eventually quitting the hospital and leaving Seattle Grace without a head of cardio (due to a dispute with Torres). Without a teacher, Yang begins to seriously doubt the purpose of remaining in her place at Seattle Grace when the program falls to twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals and Burke wins the Harper-Avery award without mentioning her at all, despite her saving his career. Yang tells the Chief that her current existence in the hospital is \"unbearable\" and that she has turned into a ghost.\n\nYang meets [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), an army [[trauma surgeon]] when he patches her up from being stabbed in the stomach by a falling icicle outside the hospital. The pair are immediately attracted to each other and share a brief kiss. Owen Hunt is later honorably discharged, he is hired as Seattle Grace's chief of [[trauma surgery]] and he and Yang begin a flirtation. Yang grows emotionally when she decides to support Meredith in her relationship with [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), despite her logical misgivings about their staying power, and begins to be more emotionally open towards Hunt. However, Hunt has repressed memories of his time in [[Iraq]] and [[PTSD]] which causes Hunt to behave erratically, and even attack and strangle her while asleep. Yang attempts to be emotionally supportive but ends their relationship as she is afraid of sleeping next to him. Cristina loses her shot at being the first resident to perform a solo surgery despite being unanimously chosen by the attending surgeons, having been disciplined from failing to report the irresponsible behavior of the new interns. Meredith and Cristina have a fight during the intern scandal, and Cristina chooses Alex to be her replacement. They eventually reconcile. When Izzie Stevens discovers her life-threatening [[cancer]], Yang is the one she confides in over her other friends due to Yang's ability to remain emotionally distant. Yang saves Izzie's life by coming up with a treatment plan and forcing Izzie to tell their friends of her diagnosis. Hunt begins seeing a therapist, and Yang confesses her love for him. The pair begin a tentative relationship, hampered by Hunt's therapeutic progress and his hot and cold professional behavior, wherein he frequently ignores or penalizes Yang to avoid the appearance of favoritism.\n\nHunt hires ex-colleague from the Army, [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]), to become the chief of cardiothoracic surgery as a \"gift\" for Yang, after she breaks down over having no new head of cardio. Yang is unimpressed with Altman, neither published nor famous, but her calm proficiency and belief in Yang's skills win her over. A conflict arises in the trio due to Altman and Hunt's repressed feelings for each other. Altman chooses to resign her place as temporary head of cardio because of her feelings for Hunt. Devastated by the blow to her education and the depressing potential of returning to her previous directionless state, Yang begs Altman to stay and teach her, offering Hunt to Altman in exchange. Altman intellectually understands Yang choosing her gift over a man and their relationship is repaired, but Hunt is deeply hurt that Yang would trade him away. Hunt subconsciously tries to sabotage Yang's education and the two break up again after Hunt is unable to decide between the two women. After being shot by Gary Clarke, a grieving widower who commits mass murder at the hospital, Cristina operates on Derek at gunpoint, thus saving his life. The shooter injures Hunt as well when he chooses to return for Yang over Altman, and Grey treats him as Yang saves Grey's husband. Following the attack on the hospital, Hunt and Yang impulsively decide to get married. Yang suffers from severe PTSD and is unable to bear being alone, making marriage to Hunt, who understands what she's going through, attractive. Yang spends the early days of her marriage in shock and hiding at Meredith's.\n\nDue to having severe PTSD and being unable to do her job correctly anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally, and she ultimately decides to go to work after helping the victim of a school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton ([[Scott Foley]]), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt-stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang evolves into an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang to come up with a wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.\n\nYang and Hunt distance themselves from each other as they keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counseling. Hunt has a [[one-night stand]] with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|medical boards]] and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the [[Mayo Clinic]], Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), and [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) are involved in an [[aviation accident]] while on the way to [[Boise, Idaho]] to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, has [[brief reactive psychosis]] which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellow]] and goes, as planned, to the Mayo Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas ([[William Daniels]]). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker ([[Steven Culp]]) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle.\n\nCristina is re-hired and Owen asks for a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the potential conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as he thought she was dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital with the help of the Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.\n\nAfter breaking up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points out the fact that it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgment. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina kisses Shane. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful, and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.\n\nCristina is nominated for the Harper Avery award and is a strong candidate, however she is passed over due to her relationship with the Harper-Avery Foundation that co-owns the hospital. Cristina goes to speak at a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland, orchestrated by [[Preston Burke]] who built his own hospital following his winning of the Harper Avery. He offers Cristina his job as the head of the hospital so that he can spend more time with his wife and kids.\n\nCristina accepts the offer and interviews candidates for her replacement position at the hospital, including Maggie Pierce for new chief of cardio. Cristina transfers her hospital shares to Alex Karev and recommends he take over her seat on the board.\n\nAt the end of season 10, she says goodbye to her co-workers she has come to know and love including Owen and Meredith. Cristina and Meredith share special moments reminiscing about all the horrors they went through and dancing it out one last time. Cristina leaves for Zurich with surgical intern Shane Ross, who chooses to leave in order to study under her in Switzerland.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Casting and creation===\n[[File:Sandra Oh 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sandra Oh]]'s character was not supposed to be of Asian descent.]]\n\nOn the creation of Yang, [[Shonda Rhimes]] said the character contained \"a little bit of [her] personality\".<ref name=OhAud>{{cite web|last=Oakley|first=Colleen|title=Interview with Shonda Rhimes|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/greys-anatomy|work=[[Marie Claire]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012|date=2007-04-09}}</ref> Speaking with talk show host [[Oprah Winfrey]], Rhimes said: \"Cristina was second, simply because she's the kind of woman I know really well, and I like her.

The character was created by series producer [[Shonda Rhimes]], and is portrayed by actress [[Sandra Oh]]. Introduced as a [[Internship (medicine)|surgical intern]] at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Yang worked her way up to [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] level, eventually becoming a [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellow]], while her relationships with colleagues [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), and [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]) formed a focal point of the series. Yang earlier in the series got engaged to [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]), in the past had a relationship with renowned surgeon and mentor Colin Marlow, and wed but later divorced [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]).\n\nOh originally auditioned for the role of [[Miranda Bailey]], although [[Chandra Wilson]] was ultimately cast in the part. Oh has received generally positive reviews for her portrayal, with Mark Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' considering her friendship with Meredith to be \"the secret core of ''Grey's''\". Oh has also garnered numerous awards and nominations for her role as Yang, including [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] wins in 2006. She was additionally nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]] each year, from 2005 to 2009. Characterizing the character, ABC noted her competitiveness, ambition, and intelligence as her main traits, while her aggressive, and tactless attitude was highlighted as her main weakness. In May 2012, ''[[E! Online]]'' reported that Oh had signed on for two more years, along with her fellow cast members. Oh left the show after season 10, and her character Cristina Yang was written out of the storyline as a main cast member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2013/08/13/greys-anatomy-sandra-oh-leaving-cristina-yang/|title=Grey's Anatomy Shocker: Sandra Oh Leaving After 10 Years -- 'I Am Ready to Let Cristina Go'|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=13 August 2013|website=tvline.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Storylines and character ==\nCristina Yang is introduced as a graduate from [[Smith College]] and a fellow [[surgery|surgical]] [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] to [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), [[George O'Malley]] ([[T.R. Knight]]), and [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]); the five of them working under [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]). An [[atheism|atheistic]] competitive intern of Korean-American ancestry, she first desired to become a doctor after a childhood car accident which killed her biological father. Yang also has [[dyslexia]], and was raised in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]] by her mother and supportive [[Jewish]] stepfather. She has a B.A. from [[Smith College]], an MD from [[Stanford University]] and a Ph.D. from [[University of California, Berkeley]], making her a \"double doctor\". While her emotional pragmatism, competitive perfectionism, and logical nature lead many to view her as a cutthroat \"robot\", Cristina hits it off with Meredith on their first day and the pair soon become best friends and each other's \"person\", sharing the same \"dark and twisty\" sense of humor.\n\nDuring her internship, Cristina has an on-off relationship with the chief of [[cardiothoracic surgery]] [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]) that leads to an accidental pregnancy. Yang schedules an abortion without telling him about the pregnancy due to Burke's behavior towards their lack of relationship status. However, Yang experiences an [[ectopic pregnancy]] and Burke discovers the pregnancy after Yang collapses from a burst [[fallopian tube]] while in the O.R. Burke and Yang resume their relationship in the aftermath of her miscarriage. Burke gets shot after a \u201cshooting\u201d at the hospital and needs surgery. After Burke is shot in the arm and develops a hand tremor, Yang helps him cover it up by forming a covert partnership wherein she performs most of his surgeries. Yang initially denies involvement during a confrontation, but then confesses everything to [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]]), the chief of surgery. Yang's actions jeopardize Burke's chances of becoming chief, which he views as a huge betrayal. After a short breakup, Yang breaks the silence and Burke proposes marriage, which Yang accepts after eight days of hesitation. When the wedding day comes, Yang has a moment of panic before she is about to walk down the aisle but Burke leaves her because he wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready to commit. Burke then disappears and isn\u2019t seen again until later in the series. Yang then proceeds to go on her honeymoon to [[Hawaii]] with Meredith to recover, returning to discover that Burke has disappeared from her life and transferred to a different hospital.\n\nBurke is replaced by [[Erica Hahn]] ([[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]]), who immediately dislikes Yang for her trend of having affairs with famous surgeons, such as Burke, going so far as refusing to let her scrub in on cardiac surgeries. Eventually, [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]) moves in with Yang, and she still tries to earn Hahn's approval. Hahn reveals that she dislikes Yang because she reminds her of an early version of herself and continues to cut Yang out of cardio surgeries and neglects to teach her, before eventually quitting the hospital and leaving Seattle Grace without a head of cardio (due to a dispute with Torres). Without a teacher, Yang begins to seriously doubt the purpose of remaining in her place at Seattle Grace when the program falls to twelfth on a list of the best teaching hospitals and Burke wins the Harper-Avery award without mentioning her at all, despite her saving his career. Yang tells the Chief that her current existence in the hospital is \"unbearable\" and that she has turned into a ghost.\n\nYang meets [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), an army [[trauma surgeon]] when he patches her up from being stabbed in the stomach by a falling icicle outside the hospital. The pair are immediately attracted to each other and share a brief kiss. Owen Hunt is later honorably discharged, he is hired as Seattle Grace's chief of [[trauma surgery]] and he and Yang begin a flirtation. Yang grows emotionally when she decides to support Meredith in her relationship with [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), despite her logical misgivings about their staying power, and begins to be more emotionally open towards Hunt. However, Hunt has repressed memories of his time in [[Iraq]] and [[PTSD]] which causes Hunt to behave erratically, and even attack and strangle her while asleep. Yang attempts to be emotionally supportive but ends their relationship as she is afraid of sleeping next to him. Cristina loses her shot at being the first resident to perform a solo surgery despite being unanimously chosen by the attending surgeons, having been disciplined from failing to report the irresponsible behavior of the new interns. Meredith and Cristina have a fight during the intern scandal, and Cristina chooses Alex to be her replacement. They eventually reconcile. When Izzie Stevens discovers her life-threatening [[cancer]], Yang is the one she confides in over her other friends due to Yang's ability to remain emotionally distant. Yang saves Izzie's life by coming up with a treatment plan and forcing Izzie to tell their friends of her diagnosis. Hunt begins seeing a therapist, and Yang confesses her love for him. The pair begin a tentative relationship, hampered by Hunt's therapeutic progress and his hot and cold professional behavior, wherein he frequently ignores or penalizes Yang to avoid the appearance of favoritism.\n\nHunt hires ex-colleague from the Army, [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]), to become the chief of cardiothoracic surgery as a \"gift\" for Yang, after she breaks down over having no new head of cardio. Yang is unimpressed with Altman, neither published nor famous, but her calm proficiency and belief in Yang's skills win her over. A conflict arises in the trio due to Altman and Hunt's repressed feelings for each other. Altman chooses to resign her place as temporary head of cardio because of her feelings for Hunt. Devastated by the blow to her education and the depressing potential of returning to her previous directionless state, Yang begs Altman to stay and teach her, offering Hunt to Altman in exchange. Altman intellectually understands Yang choosing her gift over a man and their relationship is repaired, but Hunt is deeply hurt that Yang would trade him away. Hunt subconsciously tries to sabotage Yang's education and the two break up again after Hunt is unable to decide between the two women. After being shot by Gary Clarke, a grieving widower who commits mass murder at the hospital, Cristina operates on Derek at gunpoint, thus saving his life. The shooter injures Hunt as well when he chooses to return for Yang over Altman, and Grey treats him as Yang saves Grey's husband. Following the attack on the hospital, Hunt and Yang impulsively decide to get married. Yang suffers from severe PTSD and is unable to bear being alone, making marriage to Hunt, who understands what she's going through, attractive. Yang spends the early days of her marriage in shock and hiding at Meredith's.\n\nDue to having severe PTSD and being unable to do her job correctly anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally, and she ultimately decides to go to work after helping the victim of a school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton ([[Scott Foley]]), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt-stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang evolves into an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang to come up with a wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.\n\nYang and Hunt distance themselves from each other as they keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counseling. Hunt has a [[one-night stand]] with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. As the end of the fifth year of [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|medical boards]] and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the [[Mayo Clinic]], Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), and [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]) are involved in an [[aviation accident]] while on the way to [[Boise, Idaho]] to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, has [[brief reactive psychosis]] which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgical]] [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellow]] and goes, as planned, to the Mayo Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas ([[William Daniels]]). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker ([[Steven Culp]]) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle.\n\nCristina is re-hired and Owen asks for a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the potential conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as he thought she was dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital with the help of the Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks things off with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.\n\nAfter breaking up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points out the fact that it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgment. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina kisses Shane. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful, and she is informed that she could be considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.\n\nCristina is nominated for the Harper Avery award and is a strong candidate, however she is passed over due to her relationship with the Harper-Avery Foundation that co-owns the hospital. Cristina goes to speak at a hospital in Zurich, Switzerland, orchestrated by [[Preston Burke]] who built his own hospital following his winning of the Harper Avery. He offers Cristina his job as the head of the hospital so that he can spend more time with his wife and kids.\n\nCristina accepts the offer and interviews candidates for her replacement position at the hospital, including Maggie Pierce for new chief of cardio. Cristina transfers her hospital shares to Alex Karev and recommends he take over her seat on the board.\n\nAt the end of season 10, she says goodbye to her co-workers she has come to know and love including Owen and Meredith. Cristina and Meredith share special moments reminiscing about all the horrors they went through and dancing it out one last time. Cristina leaves for Zurich with surgical intern Shane Ross, who chooses to leave in order to study under her in Switzerland.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Casting and creation===\n[[File:Sandra Oh 2016.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sandra Oh]]'s character was not supposed to be of Asian descent.]]\n\nOn the creation of Yang, [[Shonda Rhimes]] said the character contained \"a little bit of [her] personality\".<ref name=OhAud>{{cite web|last=Oakley|first=Colleen|title=Interview with Shonda Rhimes|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/greys-anatomy|work=[[Marie Claire]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012|date=2007-04-09}}</ref> Speaking with talk show host [[Oprah Winfrey]], Rhimes said: \"Cristina was second, simply because she's the kind of woman I know really well, and I like her.

She became a professor in the philosophy department there, teaching [[Contemporary Philosophy]], the [[Philosophy of Language]], and [[Taoism]], while publishing articles on Hume, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], [[Laozi]] (Lao-Tzu or Lao-tze), and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]. She also served as a professor at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Brussel|Catholic University in Brussels]] for the 2007-08 academic year.  She was awarded an honorary doctorate for her lifetime achievements on 29 January 2009, during the 20th anniversary observance at the [[Universiteit voor Humanistiek|University for Humanistic Studies]] in [[Utrecht]].\n\n==Author==\nDe Martelaere was known not only for her academic work, but also as an author of novels and essays. She made her literary debut at age fourteen with the youth novel ''King of the Jungle''. Her first novel for adults was ''Nachtboek van een slapeloze'' (''Night Book of an Insomniac'') published in Belgium in 1988 and awarded the Prize for Best Debut. She then published ''De schilder en zijn model'' (''The Painter and His Model'', 1989), ''Littekens'' (''Scars, 1990''), and ''De staart'' (''The Tail'', 1992). In 1994 her collection of essays ''Een verlangen naar ontroostbaarheid ''(''A Longing for Inconsolability'') received the J. Greshoff Award. In 1997 she published another essay collection, ''Verrassingen'' (''Surprises''), which earned her the Belgian State Prize for Essay and Criticism. In 2004, more than a decade after her previous novel, she unexpectedly published ''Het onverwachte antwoord'' (''The Unexpected Answer''), which was nominated for both the AKO and Libris Literature Prizes and won the audience award at the Golden Owl.\n\nStefan Hertmans, De Morgen called her \"a literary essayist--not only because of the attractive, almost Montaigne-like form she uses when writing her essays, but also because of the place she insists on reserving for art, dreams, and desire in her critical mental exercises. Time and again she provides a convenient gloss of a major theory which she then uses as a basis to logically justify her commentary or to subtly push the reasoning one step further.\"<ref name=\"letterenfonds.nl\">http://www.letterenfonds.nl/en/book/3/surprises</ref>\n\n==Literary Themes==\nDe Martelaere was reluctant to seek publicity and preferred her work to speak for itself. She rarely gave interviews, instead writing essays and giving lectures about her field, ideas, work as an author. Her primary theme was to examine with great lucidity and philosophical insight the world of everyday life, death, and change, including both scientific and literary perspectives. Her literary works were realized by observing reality and processing her observations into ideas and metaphors. In one of her rare interviews she described her method as \"plagiarizing reality.\"\n\nShe achieved considerable success in Flanders and the Netherlands with her first collection of essays, ''Een verlangen naar ontroostbaarheid'' (''A Longing for Inconsolability: About Life, Art and Death''), with sales over 15,000 copies. De Martelaere treats ostensibly difficult subjects such as Wittgenstein, Freud, art, religion, diaries, and love in ways that are philosophically serious without alienating the general reader. One review hails \"her obstinacy, perverse and infectious sense of humour, courtly style, and deep erudition.\"<ref name=\"letterenfonds.nl\"/>\n\n''Verrassingen'' (''Surprises'') was her next collection of eleven essays, the first of which is \"Home: A Place to Get Sick of\". She alternates between literature and philosophy, referring to Freud, Jung, [[Stendhal]], and [[Val\u00e9ry]], asserting that \"home is where the boredom is: a kind of psychic relaxation that makes psychological space for the re-emergence of inspiration.\" In \"The Exemplary Writer\" she questions the position of [[Richard Rorty]] that literature is best used to promote feelings of solidarity and empathy between people. From both ethics and literature she considers the mystery by which artists may attempt to reveal in their art more than what can be seen or said. This ethical meaning of art should never be made subordinate to an interpretation or message.\nThe essay \"Prescribed Variations\" on concepts such as \"seeing\", \"longing\", \"body\" and \"moon\" \"have the density of aphorisms and reveal De Martelaere\u2019s astounding capacity to express complex material clearly while immediately linking it to a challenging vision. An essay, as she states earlier in the book, is born of the paradoxical desire to explain and adorn reality, it longs to explore and to embellish. It is like a trial marriage between Einstein and Marilyn Monroe.\"<ref name=\"letterenfonds.nl\"/>\nIn ''The Unexpected Answer'' she does not allow the writer, philosopher, husband, lover, and father Godfried H. to speak, but makes him instead the subject of six texts written from the points of view of the women who play a role in his life. The first draws his portrait. Initially she keeps her distance, later she embarks on an unexpected and brief relationship with him. Thus De Martelaere illustrates her claim that language is \"not a tool\" but \"material\" to an author.\n\n==Philosophical works==\n* 1984 - ''Hume, science and ordinary thinking'' (Ph.D. dissertation)\n* 1987 - ''Hume's \"moderate\" Skepticism: futile or fatal?'' - Palace of the Academies, Brussels, 130 p.\n* 1996 - ''The exemplary writer'' - Tilburg University Press, 28 p.\n* 1996 - (ed.), ''Dubious thinking - History and forms of philosophical skepticism'', Cook Agora / Pelckmans, Kampen / Chapels, 231 p.\n* 1998 - ''A cold art'' - Studium Generale Maastricht.\n* 1998 - ''Passions: Between ecstasy and discipline'' - (editorial + excess), Throw and Sticht Publishing, Baarn.\n* 1998 - ''Belgian Endive (honoring Cornelis Verhoeven)'', Damon Publishing.\n* 1999 - ''Something inside'', Nijmegen University Press, Nijmegen, 1999. 16 p.\n* 2000 - ''Weltfremdheit, Essays'' - Meulenhoff, Amsterdam, 159 p.\n* 2001 - ''David Hume'' - with W.

This ethical meaning of art should never be made subordinate to an interpretation or message.\nThe essay \"Prescribed Variations\" on concepts such as \"seeing\", \"longing\", \"body\" and \"moon\" \"have the density of aphorisms and reveal De Martelaere\u2019s astounding capacity to express complex material clearly while immediately linking it to a challenging vision. An essay, as she states earlier in the book, is born of the paradoxical desire to explain and adorn reality, it longs to explore and to embellish. It is like a trial marriage between Einstein and Marilyn Monroe.\"<ref name=\"letterenfonds.nl\"/>\nIn ''The Unexpected Answer'' she does not allow the writer, philosopher, husband, lover, and father Godfried H. to speak, but makes him instead the subject of six texts written from the points of view of the women who play a role in his life. The first draws his portrait. Initially she keeps her distance, later she embarks on an unexpected and brief relationship with him. Thus De Martelaere illustrates her claim that language is \"not a tool\" but \"material\" to an author.\n\n==Philosophical works==\n* 1984 - ''Hume, science and ordinary thinking'' (Ph.D. dissertation)\n* 1987 - ''Hume's \"moderate\" Skepticism: futile or fatal?'' - Palace of the Academies, Brussels, 130 p.\n* 1996 - ''The exemplary writer'' - Tilburg University Press, 28 p.\n* 1996 - (ed.), ''Dubious thinking - History and forms of philosophical skepticism'', Cook Agora / Pelckmans, Kampen / Chapels, 231 p.\n* 1998 - ''A cold art'' - Studium Generale Maastricht.\n* 1998 - ''Passions: Between ecstasy and discipline'' - (editorial + excess), Throw and Sticht Publishing, Baarn.\n* 1998 - ''Belgian Endive (honoring Cornelis Verhoeven)'', Damon Publishing.\n* 1999 - ''Something inside'', Nijmegen University Press, Nijmegen, 1999. 16 p.\n* 2000 - ''Weltfremdheit, Essays'' - Meulenhoff, Amsterdam, 159 p.\n* 2001 - ''David Hume'' - with W.

The project was delegated to Pakistani scientist, Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], who was one of the founding members of the institute and was once registered as an [[associate professor]] of [[physics]].<ref name=\"thenews1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=29777&Cat=9 |title=On institutions \u2013 Dr A Q Khan |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref> The genesis of the Institute can be traced back to the early 1950s when Mr. Ghulam Ishaq Khan (late) became acutely aware of Pakistan's dependence on foreign expertise and imported technology. Out of his frequent interaction with the foreign and local experts emerged the idea that a center of excellence in engineering sciences and production technology ought to be established in the country, a center whose standards of education are comparable to those of its counterparts in the advanced countries.The transformation of this idea into a practical proposition took place in December 1985 when the Benevolent Community Care and Infaq Foundation donated Rs. 50 million for setting up an institute in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for promotion of science and technology.\n\nA milestone in the evolution of the Institute was the registration in June, 1988 of its parent body, namely, Society for the Promotion of Engineering Sciences and Technology in Pakistan (SOPREST). Mr. Ghulam Ishaq Khan (late), then the President of the country, was elected the President of the Society for life and Mr. H. U. Beg was appointed its Honorary Executive Director and Mr. Samiullah Marwat the first full-time Secretary.\n\nThe task of conceiving and formulating the basic form and features of the Institute was entrusted to a group of eminent scientists and engineers. These professionals started transformation of the dream into reality at a galloping pace. The civil works at the campus site were started in early 1990. An interim office of the Institute was set up in August 1992 where senior professionals with outstanding backgrounds worked in a cohesive group to evolve the educational aims and philosophy of the Institute, its curricula and details of state-of-the-art equipment for its laboratories and workshops.<ref>[https://www.giki.edu.pk/AboutGIK/Genesis GIK Website]</ref>\nIn March 1993 an \"Ordinance\" was promulgated by the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Provincial) Government for the establishment of the Institute under the umbrella of SOPREST, and the first batch of students was inducted the same year in October. Since an Ordinance has a limited life, it was ratified through an \"Act\" by the Provincial Assembly in July 1994.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Institute symbolizes the immense altruism and concern for collective welfare that exists in the private sector. It is the first privately funded institute of its kind in the country and dedicated to bringing our engineering education at par with the advanced countries. The tuition fee has to be in consonance with the high cost of education. However, what the students are charged hardly covers the annual expenditure. Total capital outlay of the Institute to-date on historical cost basis works out to more than Rs. 2.5 billion for which funds were mobilized from diverse sources including a major donation of Rs. 750 million from Infaq Foundation and land measuring 216 acres donated by the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nMajor founding donors include Nouman Benevolent Community Care, Infaq Foundation, Chiniot Anjuman-e-Islamia, Dawood Group of Industries, and the Government of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] which has donated land at [[Topi (town)|Topi]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n== Location ==\nThe university is situated beside the river [[Indus River|Indus]] in the mountains of [[Tarbela]] and [[Gadoon-Amazai]], in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa near the town of [[Topi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Topi]] and in proximity to the lakes of [[Tarbela Dam]] (world's largest earth-filled dam)  and [[Ghazi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Ghazi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giki.edu.pk/Campus |title=Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology \u2013 Campus |publisher=Giki.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\nIts campus is in the mountains of Tarbela and Gadoon-Amazai, and is a residential campus with accommodation for students.\n\n{{wide image|The Agha Hassan Abidi Auditorium.png|800px|AHA Auditorium \u2013 Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology \u2013 The GIKI WebTeam}}\n\n==Clock tower==\n{{Infobox building\n|name            = Clock Tower\n|completion_date = 1995 (est.)\n|image           = GIK Institute Clock Tower.jpg\n|image_size      = 210px\n|caption         = GIK Institute Clock Tower\n|building_type   = Time, Monument, other\n|location        = [[Topi (town)|Topi]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]\n|coordinates     = {{coord|34.0687|72.6449|region:PK|display=inline,title}}\n}}\n'''Clock Tower''', (Landmark of Ghulam Ishaq Khan, aka LOGIK in short), is located in Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, [[Topi (town)|Topi]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]].

The project was delegated to Pakistani scientist, Dr. [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], who was one of the founding members of the institute and was once registered as an [[associate professor]] of [[physics]].<ref name=\"thenews1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=29777&Cat=9 |title=On institutions \u2013 Dr A Q Khan |publisher=Thenews.com.pk |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref> The genesis of the Institute can be traced back to the early 1950s when Mr. Ghulam Ishaq Khan (late) became acutely aware of Pakistan's dependence on foreign expertise and imported technology. Out of his frequent interaction with the foreign and local experts emerged the idea that a center of excellence in engineering sciences and production technology ought to be established in the country, a center whose standards of education are comparable to those of its counterparts in the advanced countries.The transformation of this idea into a practical proposition took place in December 1985 when the Benevolent Community Care and Infaq Foundation donated Rs. 50 million for setting up an institute in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for promotion of science and technology.\n\nA milestone in the evolution of the Institute was the registration in June, 1988 of its parent body, namely, Society for the Promotion of Engineering Sciences and Technology in Pakistan (SOPREST). Mr. Ghulam Ishaq Khan (late), then the President of the country, was elected the President of the Society for life and Mr. H. U. Beg was appointed its Honorary Executive Director and Mr. Samiullah Marwat the first full-time Secretary.\n\nThe task of conceiving and formulating the basic form and features of the Institute was entrusted to a group of eminent scientists and engineers. These professionals started transformation of the dream into reality at a galloping pace. The civil works at the campus site were started in early 1990. An interim office of the Institute was set up in August 1992 where senior professionals with outstanding backgrounds worked in a cohesive group to evolve the educational aims and philosophy of the Institute, its curricula and details of state-of-the-art equipment for its laboratories and workshops.<ref>[https://www.giki.edu.pk/AboutGIK/Genesis GIK Website]</ref>\nIn March 1993 an \"Ordinance\" was promulgated by the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (Provincial) Government for the establishment of the Institute under the umbrella of SOPREST, and the first batch of students was inducted the same year in October. Since an Ordinance has a limited life, it was ratified through an \"Act\" by the Provincial Assembly in July 1994.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Institute symbolizes the immense altruism and concern for collective welfare that exists in the private sector. It is the first privately funded institute of its kind in the country and dedicated to bringing our engineering education at par with the advanced countries. The tuition fee has to be in consonance with the high cost of education. However, what the students are charged hardly covers the annual expenditure. Total capital outlay of the Institute to-date on historical cost basis works out to more than Rs. 2.5 billion for which funds were mobilized from diverse sources including a major donation of Rs. 750 million from Infaq Foundation and land measuring 216 acres donated by the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nMajor founding donors include Nouman Benevolent Community Care, Infaq Foundation, Chiniot Anjuman-e-Islamia, Dawood Group of Industries, and the Government of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] which has donated land at [[Topi (town)|Topi]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n== Location ==\nThe university is situated beside the river [[Indus River|Indus]] in the mountains of [[Tarbela]] and [[Gadoon-Amazai]], in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa near the town of [[Topi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Topi]] and in proximity to the lakes of [[Tarbela Dam]] (world's largest earth-filled dam)  and [[Ghazi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Ghazi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giki.edu.pk/Campus |title=Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology \u2013 Campus |publisher=Giki.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\nIts campus is in the mountains of Tarbela and Gadoon-Amazai, and is a residential campus with accommodation for students.\n\n{{wide image|The Agha Hassan Abidi Auditorium.png|800px|AHA Auditorium \u2013 Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology \u2013 The GIKI WebTeam}}\n\n==Clock tower==\n{{Infobox building\n|name            = Clock Tower\n|completion_date = 1995 (est.)\n|image           = GIK Institute Clock Tower.jpg\n|image_size      = 210px\n|caption         = GIK Institute Clock Tower\n|building_type   = Time, Monument, other\n|location        = [[Topi (town)|Topi]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]\n|coordinates     = {{coord|34.0687|72.6449|region:PK|display=inline,title}}\n}}\n'''Clock Tower''', (Landmark of Ghulam Ishaq Khan, aka LOGIK in short), is located in Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, [[Topi (town)|Topi]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]].

On its southeastern side, the Ziliana gorge divides Mount Olympus from Kato Olympos (Lower Olympus), while on its southwestern foothills, there are the villages Sykaminea and [[Karya, Larissa|Karya]].

Further east, the plain of Dion is fertile and watered by the streams which originate on Olympus.\n\n== Geology ==\nMount Olympus is formed of [[sedimentary rock]] laid down 200 million years ago in a [[shallow sea]]. Various [[geological]] events that followed caused the emergence of the whole region and the sea. Around one million years ago [[glaciers]] covered Olympus and created its plateaus and depressions. With the temperature rise that followed, the ice melted and the streams that were created swept away large quantities of crushed rock in the lowest places, forming the [[alluvial fan]]s, that spread out all over the region from the foothills of the mountain to the sea.<ref name=np /> The [[Geological Museum of Mount Olympus]], located in [[Leptokarya]], provides detailed information about the geological structure of the mountain.\n\n== Morphology ==\n[[File:Olympus Mountain.jpg|thumb|Stratospheric view of Mount Olympus]]\nThe complicated geological past of the region is obvious from the morphology of Olympus and its National Park. Features include deep gorges and dozens of smooth peaks, many of them in altitude of more than {{convert|2000|m}}, including Aghios Antonios ({{convert|2815|m}}), Kalogeros ({{convert|2700|m}}), Toumpa ({{convert|2801|m}}) and Profitis Ilias ({{convert|2803|m}}). However, it is the central, almost vertical, rocky peaks, that impress the visitor. Over the town of Litochoro, on the horizon, the relief of the mountain displays an apparent V, between two peaks of almost equal height. The left limb is the peak named Mytikas (or Pantheon). It is Greece's highest peak. Then, on the right is Stefani (or Thronos Dios [Throne of Zeus{{snd}}{{convert|2902|m}}]), which presents the most impressive and steep peak of Olympus, with its last sharply rising 200 meters presenting the greatest challenge for climbers. Further south, Skolio ({{coor|40.0829|N|22.3571|E|}} second highest sub-peak \u2013 {{convert|2911|m}}) completes an arc of about 200 degrees, with its steep slopes forming on the west side, like a wall, an impressive precipitous amphitheatrical cavity, {{convert|700|m}} in depth and {{convert|1000|m}} in circumference, the 'Megala Kazania'. On the east side of the high peaks the steep slopes form zone like parallel folds, the 'Zonaria'. Even narrower and steeper scorings, the 'Loukia', lead to the peak.\n\n\u039fn the north side, between Stefani and Profitis Ilias, extends the Muses' Plateau, at {{convert|2550|m}}, while further south, almost in the center of the massif, extends the [[alpine tundra]] region of Bara, at an altitude of {{convert|2350|m}}. Olympus has numerous ravines and gullies. Most distinguishable of the ravines are those of Mavrologos-Enipeas (14&nbsp;km) and Mavratzas-Sparmos (13&nbsp;km) near Bara and 'cut' the massif in two oval portions. On the southern foothills the great gorge of Ziliana, 13&nbsp;km long, consists of a natural limit that separates the mountain from Lower Olympus. There are also many precipices and a number of caves, even nowadays unexplored. The form and layout of the rocks favor the emergence of numerous springs, mainly lower than 2,000&nbsp;m, of small seasonal lakes and streams and of a small river, Enipeas, with its springs in the site Prionia and its estuary in the [[Aegean Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5862/|title=UNESCO}}</ref><ref>Arne Strid.

In [[Homeric Greek]] (''[[Odyssey]]'' 6.42), the variant \u039f\u1f54\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''Oulumpos'' occurs, conceived of as the seat of the gods (and not identified with any specific peak).\nHomer (''[[Iliad]]''  5.754, ''Odyssey'' 20.103) also appears to be using \u03bf\u1f54\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 as a common noun, as a synonym of \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 ''[[Uranus (mythology)|ouranos]]'' \"sky\".\nMt Olympus was historically also known as  ''Mount Belus'', after ''[[Iliad]]'' 1.591, where the seat of the gods is referred to as  \u03b2\u03b7\u03bb[\u03cc\u03c2] \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03bf[\u03c2]  \"heavenly threshold\".{{efn|1={{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u1fd6\u03c8\u03b5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u1f7c\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03b2\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf}} \"he [Zeus] caught me [Hepahistos] by the foot and flung me from the heavenly threshold.\" (trans.

The history of the surrounding area is consequently of interest in the context of the [[Rise of Macedon]], the [[Chremonidean War]] and the [[Macedonian Wars]] during the 4th to 2nd centuries BC.\nIn the period of the [[Ottoman Empire]] the mountain was a hiding place and base of operations for [[klepht]]s and [[armatoloi]].<ref name=np />\n\nIn Olympus, the second [[armatoloi|armatoliki]] was founded, led by Kara Michalis in 1489. The action of the klephts in Olympus led the Turks to visit their outrage on the klephts' ally-village of [[Milia, Pieria|Milia]] (in the late 17th century), which they destroyed. In that period Livadi in Olympus became the seat of the armatoliki of Olympus and Western Macedonia, with their first renowned commander Panos Zidros. In the 18th century the Turks had to replace the armatoloi (who very often joined the klephts) with Moslem Albanian armatoloi who ravaged the countryside of Macedonia. However, Olympus' armatoloi, even after their capitulation to [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]], never ceased fighting on land and at sea. Among them who were active there and in nearby regions were Nikotsaras, [[Giorgakis Olympios]] and the legendary family of Lazaioi. In the early 20th century, even for some time after the liberation from the Ottoman Empire (1912), robbers were active in the region \u2013 the best known of them the notorious Giagoulas, while during the German invasion in 1941 the Greek army fought significant battles along with units of [[New Zealand]]ers and [[Australia]]ns. During the German Occupation (1941\u20131944) the mountain was one of the centers of the [[Greek Resistance]], while a little later the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349) started there, in Litochoro.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://origins.osu.edu/milestones/march-2016-greek-civil-war-1946-1949|title=Current Events in Historical Perspective Published by the History Departments at The Ohio State University and Miami University}}</ref>\n\n=== Ancient and medieval sites ===\n{{Main|History of Pieria (regional unit)}}\n[[File:Petra Olympus.jpeg|thumb|Mount Olympus as seen from north at Petra, Pieria]]\nThe whole region of Pieria's Olympus was declared archaeological and historical site for the preservation of its monumental and historical character. Five km away from the sea is [[Archaeological Park of Dion|Dion]], sacred city of the ancient Macedons, dedicated to Zeus and the Twelve Olympians. Its prosperity lasted from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD. The excavations, continuing since 1928, have revealed numerous findings of the Macedonian, the Hellenistic and the Roman period. Currently there is a unique archaeological park of 200 hectares, with the ancient town and the sacred places of worship, outside its walls.

Examples include the French archaeologist [[Leon Heuzey]] (1855), the German explorer [[Heinrich Barth]] (1862), and the German engineer Edward Richter. Richter tried to reach the summit in 1911 but was abducted by [[klepht]]s, who also killed the Ottoman gendarmes that accompanied him.\n\nIt was just one year after the liberation of northern Greece from Ottoman rule, on 2 August 1913, that the summit of Olympus was finally reached. The Swiss [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boissonnas]] and Daniel Baud-Bovy, aided by a hunter of wild goats from Litochoro, [[Christos Kakkalos]], were the first to reach Greece's highest peak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.travelogues.gr/collection.php?view=139|title=Aikaterina Laskaridis Foundation, Travelogues}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/07/24/the-hundred-year-climb-of-mount-olympus/|title=The Hundred-Year Climb of Mount Olympus}}</ref> Kakkalos, who had much experience climbing Olympus, was the first of the three to climb Mytikas. Afterwards, and till his death in 1976, he was the official guide on Olympus. In 1921, he and Marcel Kurz reached the second highest summit of Olympus, Stefani. Based on these explorations, Kurz in 1923 edited ''Le Mont Olympe'', a book that includes the first detailed map of the summits. In 1928, the painter Vasilis Ithakisios climbed Olympus together with Kakalos, reaching a cave that he named ''Shelter of the Muses'', and he spent many summers painting views of the mountain. Olympus was later photographed and mapped in detail by others, and a series of successful climbs and winter ascents of the steepest summits in difficult weather conditions took place.\n\nClimbing Mount Olympus is a non-technical hike, except for the final section from the Skala summit to the Mytikas peak, which is a [[Yosemite Decimal System|YDS]] class 3 [[scrambling|rock scramble]]. It is estimated that 10,000 people climb Mount Olympus each year, most of them reaching only the Skolio summit. Most climbs of Mount Olympus start from the town of [[Litochoro]], which took the name ''City of Gods'' because of its location at the foot of the mountain. From there a road goes to Prionia, where the hike begins at the bottom of the mountain.\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Olympus17.jpg|thumb|Christos Kakalos refuge and Profitis Ilias peak]]\nGenerally speaking Olympus' climate can be described as one of [[mediterranean climate|Mediterranean type]] with continental influence. Its local variations are the result of the impact of the sea and the rugged relief of the region. In the lower locations (Litochoro and the foothills) the climate is typically Mediterranean, i.e. hot and dry in the summer, while humid and cold in the winter. Higher it is more humid and severe, with more intense phenomena; in these locations it often snows all over the winter, while raining and snowing is not unusual, even in the summer. The temperature varies in the winter from \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C to 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and in the summer from 0&nbsp;\u00b0C to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, while winds are an almost everyday occurrence. Generally the temperature falls 1&nbsp;\u00b0C per 200&nbsp;m of altitude. As the altitude rises, the phenomena are more intense and the variations of temperature and humidity are often sudden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/us/Infos.asp|title=Management Agency of Olympus National Park, Climate|access-date=2018-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020101722/http://www.olympusfd.gr/us/Infos.asp|archive-date=2018-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal northeast slopes of Olympus receive more rain than the continental northwest, so, as a result, there is a clear difference in vegetation, being more abundant in the first of them. Hottest month is August, while coldest is February.\n\nThe mountain's highest zone, over 2,000 metres, is snowcapped for about nine months (September to May). In some places the winds gather snow, 8\u201310 metres thick (''anemosouria'' in Greek), while in some deep ravines the snow is maintained all over the year (everlasting snow). For this Olympus' alpine region, recordings have been made in the 1960s in the highest-altitude [[weather station]] in Greece, that was established on the summit of Aghios Antonios (2,815&nbsp;m), providing a number of interesting data for the mountain's climate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/units/8169|title=Mount Olympus Meteorological Stations, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki}}</ref> The average temperature is \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter and 10&nbsp;\u00b0C in summer. The average annual precipitation heights vary from 149&nbsp;cm at Prionia (1,100&nbsp;m) to 170&nbsp;cm at Aghios Antonios, about half of them rainfall and hailstorms in summer and the rest snowfall in winter. The weather may change several times in the same day. In summer rainfalls are frequent, commonly as evening thunderstorms, many times accompanied by hail and strong winds. However water springs over 2,000 metres are scarce and visitors should ensure that they have always water and of course the necessary clothing for any weather conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Mount-Olympus/forecasts/2917|title=Detailed weather forecast for different altitudes and times of the day}}</ref>\n\n== Flora ==\n[[File:Olympus26.jpg|thumb|Beech forest along the path from Prionia to Spilios Agapitos refuge]]\nThe research of Olympus' plants started in 1836, when the French [[Botany|botanist]] [[Pierre Martin R\u00e9mi Aucher-\u00c9loy|Aucher-\u00c9loy]] studied them. According to this and later studies, the National Park of Olympus is considered one of the richest flora regions in Greece, with about 1,700 species and subspecies, that represent some 25% of Greek flora. Of them 187 are characterized as significant, 56 are Greek [[Endemism|endemic]] and of them 23 are local endemic, i.e. they can be found only in Olympus, and 16 are rare in Greece or/and have there the limits of their spread within Northern Greece.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/us/Xlorida_Panida.asp|title=Olympus National Park Management, Flora and Fauna}}</ref>\n\nAn important book about the plants and flowers, from the beach of the agean sea up to the upper regions, of Mount Olympus was written in 1980 by the Swedish botanist [[Arne Strid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnhm.gr/en/publication/wild-flowers-of-mount-olympus/|title=Wild Flowers of Mount Olympus|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821033814/http://www.gnhm.gr/en/publication/wild-flowers-of-mount-olympus/|archive-date=2016-08-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMost of those found in lower altitude are the common Mediterranean and central European species. ''[[Jankaea heldreichii]]'', a plant relict of the [[Ice age]], is of particular interest to botanists. The intense diversity of the landscape, the varying orientation of the slopes and their position in relation to the sea affect locally Olympus' climate and so a local [[microclimate]] prevails, combined with the geological background and the soil favor the growth of particular vegetation types and biotopes. Generally Olympus' northeast side is densely forested, as it receives the most rainfall, while the southwest one has significantly sparser vegetation. Moreover, there is a clear sequence of the vegetation zones in accordance to altitude, in Olympus there is no such a regularity. It is due to the great microclimate variety, caused by the region's landscape.\n\n=== Flora zones ===\nIn Olympus there are generally four sequent flora zones, but not clearly separated:\n\n==== Mediterranean vegetation zone ====\nIn the altitude between 300 and 500 metres occurs the evergreen broadleaf trees' zone ([[Maquis shrubland|maquis]]). Along with [[oak]] (''Quercus ilex'') and [[Arbutus andrachne|Greek strawberry tree]] there occur [[Quercus coccifera|kermes oak]], [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]], ''[[Phillyrea]] latifolia'', [[Laurus nobilis|bay laurel]], [[Cedrus|cedar]] and others. Of the deciduous species most common are ''[[Fraxinus]]'', ''[[Ulmus]]'', [[Acer monspessulanum|Montpellier maple]], [[Cercis siliquastrum|Judas tree]], [[Pistacia terebinthus|terebinth]], ''[[Cotinus coggygria]]'' and others.\n\n==== Forest zone of beech, fir and mountain coniferous ====\nThe evergreen broadleaf trees' zone is gradually replaced by [[ecosystem]]s of [[Pinus nigra|European black pine]], that forms compact clusters, with no intermediate zone of deciduous oaks, although trees of these species occur sporadically within clusters of black pine. On the northern slopes of Xirolakos valley, at altitude between 600 and 700 metres, there is a high forest of [[Quercus pubescens|downy oak]] of about 120 hectares.\n\nThe black pine dominates on the eastern and northern side of the mountain, between 500 and 1,700 metres. In this zone there is also hybrid fir in small groups and scrubs or small clumps, particularly in the lower region and in the sites Naoumi (west) and Stalamatia and Polykastro (east), where it is mixed with black pine and [[Pinus heldreichii|Bosnian pine]]. In this zone there is also [[beech]]. While in the neighboring mountains Pierians and Ossa it creates an extended vegetation zone, in Olympus it is restricted to small clusters, appearing as islets, mainly in more humid locations and the best soils. A particularly rich variety of trees and shrubs is found in Enipeas' gorge. One can see there [[elm]], [[cherry plum]], [[Taxus baccata|European yew]], [[hazel]], [[holly]], ''[[Cornus mas]]'', [[Fraxinus ornus|manna ash]], [[maple]] and a considerable variety of herbaceous plants. Gorges and ravines are covered by [[Platanus orientalis|oriental planes]], [[willow]]s, [[Alnus glutinosa|black alders]] and riverside greenery.\n\n==== Boreal coniferous zone ====\nTypical species of this zone is Bosnian pine. This rare kind of pine occurs sporadically higher than 1,000 metres and gradually replaces the black pine, while over 1,400 metres it creates an almost unmixed forest. \u039fver 2,000 metres the forest becomes sparser, reaching to 2,750 metres, thus creating one of the highest forest [[tree line]] limit (limit of forest growth) in the [[Balkans]] and Europe. Another feature of this zone is that over 2,500 metres the trees appear in a [[Krummholz|crawling form]]. The region, where Bosnian pine grows, is mostly dry and its slopes are rocky. There are no springs or water streams. The vegetation growing there is adapted to specific local conditions and represented by typical shrubs, [[graminaceous]], chasmophytes etc., while the flora includes many endemic species of the Balkans.\n\n==== Treeless high mountain zone ([[Alpine tundra]]) ====\nBeyond Bosnian pine's zone follows an extensive zone, without trees, with alpine meadows, consisted by a mosaic of grassland ecosystems, depending on the topography, the slope and the orientation of the ground. In general, this alpine flora with more than 150 plant species, contains snow accumulation meadows, grassy swamps, alpine scree and rock crevices. On the meadows, the rocks and the steep slopes live most of the endemic Olympus' plants, among them some of the most beautiful wildflowers in Greece. Half of them are found only in the Balkans and 23 only in Olympus and nowhere else.\n\n=== Local endemic plants ===\n{{see|List of Balkan endemic plants}}\nThe  list of 23 local endemic plants at Mount Olympus from the Olympus National Park Management Agency:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/us/Xlorida_Panida.asp|title=Olympus National Park \u2013 Flora and Fauna \u2013 Olympus mount \u2013 Litohoro \u2013 National Park |first=Paradox|last=Interactive|website=olympusfd.gr}}</ref>\n\n''[[Achillea ambrosiaca]],  [[Alyssum handelii]], [[Asprerula muscosa]], [[Aubrieta thessala]], [[Campanula oreadum]], [[Carum adamovicii]], [[Centaurea incompleta]], [[Centaurea litochorea]], [[Centaurea transiens]], [[Cerastrium theophrasti]], [[Coincla nivalis]], [[Erysimum olympicum]], [[Festuca olympica]], [[Genista sakellariadis]], [[Jankaea heldreichii]], [[Ligusticum olympicum]], [[Melampyrus ciliatum]], Ophrys helenae'' ([[Ophrys sphegodes#Supspecies|''Ophrys sphegodes'' subsp.

Large mammals, that lived formerly in the region, like [[deer]], have disappeared. In ancient times there were [[lion]]s ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), while at least until the 16th century there were [[bear]]s (Life of St. Dionysios the Later).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias6A.html|title=Pausanias Book 6.5.5}}</ref>\n\nThere have been recorded 32 species of mammals, including [[Chamois|wild goat]] (R\u03c5\u03c1icapra rupicapra balcanica), [[roe deer]] (Capreolus capreolus), [[wild boar]] (Sus scrofa), [[wildcat]] (Felis sylvestris), [[beech marten]] (Martes foina), [[red fox]] (Vulpes vulpes) and red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). There have also been detected 108 species of birds (like [[sparrowhawk]], [[cinereous vulture]], [[rock partridge]], [[white stork]], [[rock dove]], [[European robin]], [[lanner falcon]], [[peregrine falcon]], tree falcon, [[golden eagle]], [[short-toed snake eagle]], [[booted eagle]] and [[hoopoe]]). Many of them, particularly the birds of prey, are scarce. In addition there are the common [[reptile]]s of Greek fauna (22 species like [[snake]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s, etc.) and some [[amphibian]]s (8 species) in streams and seasonal ponds, as well as a great variety of insects, particularly butterflies.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\n== National Park ==\nGreece's highest mountain, dwelling of the Twelve Gods of antiquity, has been the first region in the country to be applied specific protective rules, by its declaration as a National Park in 1938. The aim of this declaration was \"...the preservation in perpetuity of the natural environment of the region, i.e. of wild flora, fauna and natural landscape, as well as its cultural and other values...\". In addition the declaration has aimed promoting scientific research along with environmental education for the public and tourist development in the region. Specific laws prohibit all forms of exploitation on the eastern side of the mountain in an area of about 4,000 hectares, that is the core of the Park. A wider region, around this core, has been designated \"peripheral zone of the National Park\", so that its managing and exploitation to be done so as not to adversely affect the core's protection. At present, the park has been expanded to 24,000 hectares. Administratively it belongs to Pieria's and Larissa's Prefectures and specifically to the municipalities Diou-Olympou and Katerinis (Pieria) and \u03a4empon and Elassonas (Larissa). Its lowest altitude is 600 metres and its peak, Mytikas, at 2,917 metres. In 1981 [[UNESCO]] proclaimed Olympus \"Biosphere Reserve\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/greece/mount-olympus/|title=Ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/greece/mount-olympus|website=}}</ref> [[European Union]] has listed Olympus in the \"Significant for Birdlife Regions of European Union\". It is also registered in the list of [[Natura 2000]] European Network as a special protection area and a site of community interest.\n\nIn June 2016 the [[Olympus National Park Information Center]], located at Litochoro, opened its gates. It informs their visitors about geology, archaeological sites, mythology, monasteries, plants, animals and other subjects affecting Mount Olympus.

Further east, the plain of Dion is fertile and watered by the streams which originate on Olympus.\n\n== Geology ==\nMount Olympus is formed of [[sedimentary rock]] laid down 200 million years ago in a [[shallow sea]]. Various [[geological]] events that followed caused the emergence of the whole region and the sea. Around one million years ago [[glaciers]] covered Olympus and created its plateaus and depressions. With the temperature rise that followed, the ice melted and the streams that were created swept away large quantities of crushed rock in the lowest places, forming the [[alluvial fan]]s, that spread out all over the region from the foothills of the mountain to the sea.<ref name=np /> The [[Geological Museum of Mount Olympus]], located in [[Leptokarya]], provides detailed information about the geological structure of the mountain.\n\n== Morphology ==\n[[File:Olympus Mountain.jpg|thumb|Stratospheric view of Mount Olympus]]\nThe complicated geological past of the region is obvious from the morphology of Olympus and its National Park. Features include deep gorges and dozens of smooth peaks, many of them in altitude of more than {{convert|2000|m}}, including Aghios Antonios ({{convert|2815|m}}), Kalogeros ({{convert|2700|m}}), Toumpa ({{convert|2801|m}}) and Profitis Ilias ({{convert|2803|m}}). However, it is the central, almost vertical, rocky peaks, that impress the visitor. Over the town of Litochoro, on the horizon, the relief of the mountain displays an apparent V, between two peaks of almost equal height. The left limb is the peak named Mytikas (or Pantheon). It is Greece's highest peak. Then, on the right is Stefani (or Thronos Dios [Throne of Zeus{{snd}}{{convert|2902|m}}]), which presents the most impressive and steep peak of Olympus, with its last sharply rising 200 meters presenting the greatest challenge for climbers. Further south, Skolio ({{coor|40.0829|N|22.3571|E|}} second highest sub-peak \u2013 {{convert|2911|m}}) completes an arc of about 200 degrees, with its steep slopes forming on the west side, like a wall, an impressive precipitous amphitheatrical cavity, {{convert|700|m}} in depth and {{convert|1000|m}} in circumference, the 'Megala Kazania'. On the east side of the high peaks the steep slopes form zone like parallel folds, the 'Zonaria'. Even narrower and steeper scorings, the 'Loukia', lead to the peak.\n\n\u039fn the north side, between Stefani and Profitis Ilias, extends the Muses' Plateau, at {{convert|2550|m}}, while further south, almost in the center of the massif, extends the [[alpine tundra]] region of Bara, at an altitude of {{convert|2350|m}}. Olympus has numerous ravines and gullies. Most distinguishable of the ravines are those of Mavrologos-Enipeas (14&nbsp;km) and Mavratzas-Sparmos (13&nbsp;km) near Bara and 'cut' the massif in two oval portions. On the southern foothills the great gorge of Ziliana, 13&nbsp;km long, consists of a natural limit that separates the mountain from Lower Olympus. There are also many precipices and a number of caves, even nowadays unexplored. The form and layout of the rocks favor the emergence of numerous springs, mainly lower than 2,000&nbsp;m, of small seasonal lakes and streams and of a small river, Enipeas, with its springs in the site Prionia and its estuary in the [[Aegean Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5862/|title=UNESCO}}</ref><ref>Arne Strid.

The history of the surrounding area is consequently of interest in the context of the [[Rise of Macedon]], the [[Chremonidean War]] and the [[Macedonian Wars]] during the 4th to 2nd centuries BC.\nIn the period of the [[Ottoman Empire]] the mountain was a hiding place and base of operations for [[klepht]]s and [[armatoloi]].<ref name=np />\n\nIn Olympus, the second [[armatoloi|armatoliki]] was founded, led by Kara Michalis in 1489. The action of the klephts in Olympus led the Turks to visit their outrage on the klephts' ally-village of [[Milia, Pieria|Milia]] (in the late 17th century), which they destroyed. In that period Livadi in Olympus became the seat of the armatoliki of Olympus and Western Macedonia, with their first renowned commander Panos Zidros. In the 18th century the Turks had to replace the armatoloi (who very often joined the klephts) with Moslem Albanian armatoloi who ravaged the countryside of Macedonia. However, Olympus' armatoloi, even after their capitulation to [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina|Ali Pasha]], never ceased fighting on land and at sea. Among them who were active there and in nearby regions were Nikotsaras, [[Giorgakis Olympios]] and the legendary family of Lazaioi. In the early 20th century, even for some time after the liberation from the Ottoman Empire (1912), robbers were active in the region \u2013 the best known of them the notorious Giagoulas, while during the German invasion in 1941 the Greek army fought significant battles along with units of [[New Zealand]]ers and [[Australia]]ns. During the German Occupation (1941\u20131944) the mountain was one of the centers of the [[Greek Resistance]], while a little later the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349) started there, in Litochoro.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://origins.osu.edu/milestones/march-2016-greek-civil-war-1946-1949|title=Current Events in Historical Perspective Published by the History Departments at The Ohio State University and Miami University}}</ref>\n\n=== Ancient and medieval sites ===\n{{Main|History of Pieria (regional unit)}}\n[[File:Petra Olympus.jpeg|thumb|Mount Olympus as seen from north at Petra, Pieria]]\nThe whole region of Pieria's Olympus was declared archaeological and historical site for the preservation of its monumental and historical character.

Its prosperity lasted from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD. The excavations, continuing since 1928, have revealed numerous findings of the Macedonian, the Hellenistic and the Roman period. Currently there is a unique archaeological park of 200 hectares, with the ancient town and the sacred places of worship, outside its walls.

Examples include the French archaeologist [[Leon Heuzey]] (1855), the German explorer [[Heinrich Barth]] (1862), and the German engineer Edward Richter. Richter tried to reach the summit in 1911 but was abducted by [[klepht]]s, who also killed the Ottoman gendarmes that accompanied him.\n\nIt was just one year after the liberation of northern Greece from Ottoman rule, on 2 August 1913, that the summit of Olympus was finally reached. The Swiss [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boissonnas]] and Daniel Baud-Bovy, aided by a hunter of wild goats from Litochoro, [[Christos Kakkalos]], were the first to reach Greece's highest peak.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eng.travelogues.gr/collection.php?view=139|title=Aikaterina Laskaridis Foundation, Travelogues}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/07/24/the-hundred-year-climb-of-mount-olympus/|title=The Hundred-Year Climb of Mount Olympus}}</ref> Kakkalos, who had much experience climbing Olympus, was the first of the three to climb Mytikas. Afterwards, and till his death in 1976, he was the official guide on Olympus. In 1921, he and Marcel Kurz reached the second highest summit of Olympus, Stefani. Based on these explorations, Kurz in 1923 edited ''Le Mont Olympe'', a book that includes the first detailed map of the summits. In 1928, the painter Vasilis Ithakisios climbed Olympus together with Kakalos, reaching a cave that he named ''Shelter of the Muses'', and he spent many summers painting views of the mountain. Olympus was later photographed and mapped in detail by others, and a series of successful climbs and winter ascents of the steepest summits in difficult weather conditions took place.\n\nClimbing Mount Olympus is a non-technical hike, except for the final section from the Skala summit to the Mytikas peak, which is a [[Yosemite Decimal System|YDS]] class 3 [[scrambling|rock scramble]]. It is estimated that 10,000 people climb Mount Olympus each year, most of them reaching only the Skolio summit. Most climbs of Mount Olympus start from the town of [[Litochoro]], which took the name ''City of Gods'' because of its location at the foot of the mountain. From there a road goes to Prionia, where the hike begins at the bottom of the mountain.\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Olympus17.jpg|thumb|Christos Kakalos refuge and Profitis Ilias peak]]\nGenerally speaking Olympus' climate can be described as one of [[mediterranean climate|Mediterranean type]] with continental influence. Its local variations are the result of the impact of the sea and the rugged relief of the region. In the lower locations (Litochoro and the foothills) the climate is typically Mediterranean, i.e. hot and dry in the summer, while humid and cold in the winter. Higher it is more humid and severe, with more intense phenomena; in these locations it often snows all over the winter, while raining and snowing is not unusual, even in the summer. The temperature varies in the winter from \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C to 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and in the summer from 0&nbsp;\u00b0C to 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, while winds are an almost everyday occurrence. Generally the temperature falls 1&nbsp;\u00b0C per 200&nbsp;m of altitude. As the altitude rises, the phenomena are more intense and the variations of temperature and humidity are often sudden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/us/Infos.asp|title=Management Agency of Olympus National Park, Climate|access-date=2018-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020101722/http://www.olympusfd.gr/us/Infos.asp|archive-date=2018-10-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal northeast slopes of Olympus receive more rain than the continental northwest, so, as a result, there is a clear difference in vegetation, being more abundant in the first of them. Hottest month is August, while coldest is February.\n\nThe mountain's highest zone, over 2,000 metres, is snowcapped for about nine months (September to May). In some places the winds gather snow, 8\u201310 metres thick (''anemosouria'' in Greek), while in some deep ravines the snow is maintained all over the year (everlasting snow). For this Olympus' alpine region, recordings have been made in the 1960s in the highest-altitude [[weather station]] in Greece, that was established on the summit of Aghios Antonios (2,815&nbsp;m), providing a number of interesting data for the mountain's climate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/units/8169|title=Mount Olympus Meteorological Stations, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki}}</ref> The average temperature is \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter and 10&nbsp;\u00b0C in summer. The average annual precipitation heights vary from 149&nbsp;cm at Prionia (1,100&nbsp;m) to 170&nbsp;cm at Aghios Antonios, about half of them rainfall and hailstorms in summer and the rest snowfall in winter. The weather may change several times in the same day. In summer rainfalls are frequent, commonly as evening thunderstorms, many times accompanied by hail and strong winds. However water springs over 2,000 metres are scarce and visitors should ensure that they have always water and of course the necessary clothing for any weather conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Mount-Olympus/forecasts/2917|title=Detailed weather forecast for different altitudes and times of the day}}</ref>\n\n== Flora ==\n[[File:Olympus26.jpg|thumb|Beech forest along the path from Prionia to Spilios Agapitos refuge]]\nThe research of Olympus' plants started in 1836, when the French [[Botany|botanist]] [[Pierre Martin R\u00e9mi Aucher-\u00c9loy|Aucher-\u00c9loy]] studied them. According to this and later studies, the National Park of Olympus is considered one of the richest flora regions in Greece, with about 1,700 species and subspecies, that represent some 25% of Greek flora. Of them 187 are characterized as significant, 56 are Greek [[Endemism|endemic]] and of them 23 are local endemic, i.e. they can be found only in Olympus, and 16 are rare in Greece or/and have there the limits of their spread within Northern Greece.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/us/Xlorida_Panida.asp|title=Olympus National Park Management, Flora and Fauna}}</ref>\n\nAn important book about the plants and flowers, from the beach of the agean sea up to the upper regions, of Mount Olympus was written in 1980 by the Swedish botanist [[Arne Strid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnhm.gr/en/publication/wild-flowers-of-mount-olympus/|title=Wild Flowers of Mount Olympus|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821033814/http://www.gnhm.gr/en/publication/wild-flowers-of-mount-olympus/|archive-date=2016-08-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMost of those found in lower altitude are the common Mediterranean and central European species. ''[[Jankaea heldreichii]]'', a plant relict of the [[Ice age]], is of particular interest to botanists. The intense diversity of the landscape, the varying orientation of the slopes and their position in relation to the sea affect locally Olympus' climate and so a local [[microclimate]] prevails, combined with the geological background and the soil favor the growth of particular vegetation types and biotopes. Generally Olympus' northeast side is densely forested, as it receives the most rainfall, while the southwest one has significantly sparser vegetation. Moreover, there is a clear sequence of the vegetation zones in accordance to altitude, in Olympus there is no such a regularity. It is due to the great microclimate variety, caused by the region's landscape.\n\n=== Flora zones ===\nIn Olympus there are generally four sequent flora zones, but not clearly separated:\n\n==== Mediterranean vegetation zone ====\nIn the altitude between 300 and 500 metres occurs the evergreen broadleaf trees' zone ([[Maquis shrubland|maquis]]). Along with [[oak]] (''Quercus ilex'') and [[Arbutus andrachne|Greek strawberry tree]] there occur [[Quercus coccifera|kermes oak]], [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]], ''[[Phillyrea]] latifolia'', [[Laurus nobilis|bay laurel]], [[Cedrus|cedar]] and others. Of the deciduous species most common are ''[[Fraxinus]]'', ''[[Ulmus]]'', [[Acer monspessulanum|Montpellier maple]], [[Cercis siliquastrum|Judas tree]], [[Pistacia terebinthus|terebinth]], ''[[Cotinus coggygria]]'' and others.\n\n==== Forest zone of beech, fir and mountain coniferous ====\nThe evergreen broadleaf trees' zone is gradually replaced by [[ecosystem]]s of [[Pinus nigra|European black pine]], that forms compact clusters, with no intermediate zone of deciduous oaks, although trees of these species occur sporadically within clusters of black pine. On the northern slopes of Xirolakos valley, at altitude between 600 and 700 metres, there is a high forest of [[Quercus pubescens|downy oak]] of about 120 hectares.\n\nThe black pine dominates on the eastern and northern side of the mountain, between 500 and 1,700 metres. In this zone there is also hybrid fir in small groups and scrubs or small clumps, particularly in the lower region and in the sites Naoumi (west) and Stalamatia and Polykastro (east), where it is mixed with black pine and [[Pinus heldreichii|Bosnian pine]]. In this zone there is also [[beech]]. While in the neighboring mountains Pierians and Ossa it creates an extended vegetation zone, in Olympus it is restricted to small clusters, appearing as islets, mainly in more humid locations and the best soils. A particularly rich variety of trees and shrubs is found in Enipeas' gorge. One can see there [[elm]], [[cherry plum]], [[Taxus baccata|European yew]], [[hazel]], [[holly]], ''[[Cornus mas]]'', [[Fraxinus ornus|manna ash]], [[maple]] and a considerable variety of herbaceous plants. Gorges and ravines are covered by [[Platanus orientalis|oriental planes]], [[willow]]s, [[Alnus glutinosa|black alders]] and riverside greenery.\n\n==== Boreal coniferous zone ====\nTypical species of this zone is Bosnian pine. This rare kind of pine occurs sporadically higher than 1,000 metres and gradually replaces the black pine, while over 1,400 metres it creates an almost unmixed forest. \u039fver 2,000 metres the forest becomes sparser, reaching to 2,750 metres, thus creating one of the highest forest [[tree line]] limit (limit of forest growth) in the [[Balkans]] and Europe. Another feature of this zone is that over 2,500 metres the trees appear in a [[Krummholz|crawling form]]. The region, where Bosnian pine grows, is mostly dry and its slopes are rocky. There are no springs or water streams. The vegetation growing there is adapted to specific local conditions and represented by typical shrubs, [[graminaceous]], chasmophytes etc., while the flora includes many endemic species of the Balkans.\n\n==== Treeless high mountain zone ([[Alpine tundra]]) ====\nBeyond Bosnian pine's zone follows an extensive zone, without trees, with alpine meadows, consisted by a mosaic of grassland ecosystems, depending on the topography, the slope and the orientation of the ground. In general, this alpine flora with more than 150 plant species, contains snow accumulation meadows, grassy swamps, alpine scree and rock crevices. On the meadows, the rocks and the steep slopes live most of the endemic Olympus' plants, among them some of the most beautiful wildflowers in Greece. Half of them are found only in the Balkans and 23 only in Olympus and nowhere else.\n\n=== Local endemic plants ===\n{{see|List of Balkan endemic plants}}\nThe  list of 23 local endemic plants at Mount Olympus from the Olympus National Park Management Agency:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/us/Xlorida_Panida.asp|title=Olympus National Park \u2013 Flora and Fauna \u2013 Olympus mount \u2013 Litohoro \u2013 National Park |first=Paradox|last=Interactive|website=olympusfd.gr}}</ref>\n\n''[[Achillea ambrosiaca]],  [[Alyssum handelii]], [[Asprerula muscosa]], [[Aubrieta thessala]], [[Campanula oreadum]], [[Carum adamovicii]], [[Centaurea incompleta]], [[Centaurea litochorea]], [[Centaurea transiens]], [[Cerastrium theophrasti]], [[Coincla nivalis]], [[Erysimum olympicum]], [[Festuca olympica]], [[Genista sakellariadis]], [[Jankaea heldreichii]], [[Ligusticum olympicum]], [[Melampyrus ciliatum]], Ophrys helenae'' ([[Ophrys sphegodes#Supspecies|''Ophrys sphegodes'' subsp.

Large mammals, that lived formerly in the region, like [[deer]], have disappeared. In ancient times there were [[lion]]s ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), while at least until the 16th century there were [[bear]]s (Life of St. Dionysios the Later).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias6A.html|title=Pausanias Book 6.5.5}}</ref>\n\nThere have been recorded 32 species of mammals, including [[Chamois|wild goat]] (R\u03c5\u03c1icapra rupicapra balcanica), [[roe deer]] (Capreolus capreolus), [[wild boar]] (Sus scrofa), [[wildcat]] (Felis sylvestris), [[beech marten]] (Martes foina), [[red fox]] (Vulpes vulpes) and red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). There have also been detected 108 species of birds (like [[sparrowhawk]], [[cinereous vulture]], [[rock partridge]], [[white stork]], [[rock dove]], [[European robin]], [[lanner falcon]], [[peregrine falcon]], tree falcon, [[golden eagle]], [[short-toed snake eagle]], [[booted eagle]] and [[hoopoe]]). Many of them, particularly the birds of prey, are scarce. In addition there are the common [[reptile]]s of Greek fauna (22 species like [[snake]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s, etc.) and some [[amphibian]]s (8 species) in streams and seasonal ponds, as well as a great variety of insects, particularly butterflies.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n\n== National Park ==\nGreece's highest mountain, dwelling of the Twelve Gods of antiquity, has been the first region in the country to be applied specific protective rules, by its declaration as a National Park in 1938. The aim of this declaration was \"...the preservation in perpetuity of the natural environment of the region, i.e. of wild flora, fauna and natural landscape, as well as its cultural and other values...\". In addition the declaration has aimed promoting scientific research along with environmental education for the public and tourist development in the region. Specific laws prohibit all forms of exploitation on the eastern side of the mountain in an area of about 4,000 hectares, that is the core of the Park. A wider region, around this core, has been designated \"peripheral zone of the National Park\", so that its managing and exploitation to be done so as not to adversely affect the core's protection. At present, the park has been expanded to 24,000 hectares. Administratively it belongs to Pieria's and Larissa's Prefectures and specifically to the municipalities Diou-Olympou and Katerinis (Pieria) and \u03a4empon and Elassonas (Larissa). Its lowest altitude is 600 metres and its peak, Mytikas, at 2,917 metres. In 1981 [[UNESCO]] proclaimed Olympus \"Biosphere Reserve\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/greece/mount-olympus/|title=Ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/greece/mount-olympus|website=}}</ref> [[European Union]] has listed Olympus in the \"Significant for Birdlife Regions of European Union\". It is also registered in the list of [[Natura 2000]] European Network as a special protection area and a site of community interest.\n\nIn June 2016 the [[Olympus National Park Information Center]], located at Litochoro, opened its gates. It informs their visitors about geology, archaeological sites, mythology, monasteries, plants, animals and other subjects affecting Mount Olympus. Hikers will find help from professional rangers, a guide provides tours for groups in the mountain area.\n\n=== Olympus' National Park's regulations ===\nThe Park is protected by specific legislation.

The defending Video Game champions for the year were [[Se Jun Park]] from [[South Korea]] (Masters Division), Nikolai Zielinsky from the [[United States]] (Senior Division) and Kota Yamamoto from [[Japan]] (Junior Division).\n\n== Qualification ==\nPlayers could only gain an invitation to play in the Video Game World Championships by either being the [[2014 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships|2014 Pok\u00e9mon World Champions]], or by obtaining enough Championship Points in their respective geographic zone designated by [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]]. However, the only exception to this rule are for players from Japan and South Korea, as their tournaments are not overseen by Play! Pok\u00e9mon and their invites are governed through a different system of qualification.\n\nSince 2014, players were able to earn Championship Points from various tournaments within their geographical region. The tournaments vary in scale, ranging from local Premier Challenges to state-level Regional Championships and finally the large-scale National Championships. The number of points awarded varies with scale, and players who earn these points are ranked and divided into zones such as North America, Europe and South Africa. This year, two new zones (Latin America and Asia-Pacific) were introduced.\n\nThe 2015 Pok\u00e9mon Video Game World Championship was intended to be played under 2 Swiss tournaments and 1 single-elimination tournament which would then determine the 2015 World Champions. As such, there are two types of invites:\n* a regular 'Day One' invite, and\n* a 'Day Two' invite, which allows players to receive a bye for the Swiss tournament on the first day.\n\nAs an example, the invitations for the Masters Division were distributed as follows:-:<ref name=\"pokemon.com\"/>\n* 'Day One' invitation (by Championship Points): \n**'''Top 40''' players from [[North America]]\n**'''Top 60''' players from [[Europe]]\n**'''Top 18''' players from [[Latin America]]\n**'''Top 18''' players from [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]]\n**'''Top 2''' players from [[South Africa]]\n* 'Day Two' invitation (i.e. 'Day One' bye)\n** 2014 World Champion\n**'''Top 8''' players from [[North America]] by Championship Points.\n**'''Top 16''' players from [[Europe]] by Championship Points.\n**'''Top 2''' players from [[Latin America]] by Championship Points.\n**'''Top 2''' players from [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] by Championship Points. \n**'''Top 2''' players from [[South Africa]] by Championship Points.\n**'''Top 4''' players of the [[South Korea]] Video Game National Championships.\n**'''Top 8''' players of the [[Japan]] Video Game National Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuggetbridge.com/news/japans-path-to-the-2015-pokemon-world-championships-announced/|title=Japan's Path to the 2015 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships Announced - Nugget Bridge|work=Nugget Bridge|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Tournament Structure==\nThe [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Video Game]] Championships consisted of 2 [[Swiss system tournament|Swiss tournaments]] and 1 single elimination tournament played across three days.\n\nOn Friday (Day 1), all players who earned an invitation without a Day 1 bye were entered into a Swiss tournament, where players with two or fewer losses would advance onto the next round.

The item was likely used as a check to Amoonguss' toting Spore and Rage Powder. Only the victor chose to take the item, and it came in handy during several of the ladder matches.\n\nThe most common technique of the event was Trick Room Cresselia. More than half of the eight finalists, including the victor, used Trick Room Cresselia to speed up Amoonguss' Spore in order to protect a revenge sweeper. However, in each of the matches of finals, both players opted for a more aggressive strategy with simply leading with Kangaskhan and Landorus.<ref>{{Citation|title=2015 Pokemon World Championships Finals - Masters VG|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxlirY09qTM|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>\n\nVery few of the picks for this tournament bled into the 2016 championship, and it resulted in another diverse set of teams. 2015 stands as an oddity for its almost identical teams coming out in the top eight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2016/teams/masters/|title=2016 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships Masters Division Top Cut Teams {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2014/teams/masters/#team-markus-liu-de-semifinalist-masters-division|title=2014 World Championships Masters Division Teams {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Terrorism in the United States]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links==\n* [http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/2015_World_Championships Bulbapedia: 2015 World Championships (tournament brackets)]\n\n{{Pok\u00e9mon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2015 Pokemon World Championships}}\n[[Category:2015 in American sports]]\n[[Category:2015 in esports|Pokemon World Championships, 2015]]\n[[Category:2015 in sports in Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Pok\u00e9mon World Championships]]\n[[Category:2015 in Boston]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox sport tournament\n| name =  Pok\u00e9mon World Championships\n| year = 2015\n| image =\n\n| caption = \n| location = [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]\n| start_date = August 21\n| end_date = 23\n| administrator = [[Play!

Pok\u00e9mon]], a division of [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company]] that unites the top ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]'' [[video game]] players from around the world. The event was held alongside the [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]] World Championships at the [[Hynes Convention Center]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"pokemon.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/pokemon-events/pokemon-tournaments/vg-world-championships/|title=Pok\u00e9mon VG World Championships|work=pokemon.com|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe tournament was transmitted with live streaming from the official Pok\u00e9mon [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] channel. The defending Video Game champions for the year were [[Se Jun Park]] from [[South Korea]] (Masters Division), Nikolai Zielinsky from the [[United States]] (Senior Division) and Kota Yamamoto from [[Japan]] (Junior Division).\n\n== Qualification ==\nPlayers could only gain an invitation to play in the Video Game World Championships by either being the [[2014 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships|2014 Pok\u00e9mon World Champions]], or by obtaining enough Championship Points in their respective geographic zone designated by [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]]. However, the only exception to this rule are for players from Japan and South Korea, as their tournaments are not overseen by Play! Pok\u00e9mon and their invites are governed through a different system of qualification.\n\nSince 2014, players were able to earn Championship Points from various tournaments within their geographical region. The tournaments vary in scale, ranging from local Premier Challenges to state-level Regional Championships and finally the large-scale National Championships. The number of points awarded varies with scale, and players who earn these points are ranked and divided into zones such as North America, Europe and South Africa. This year, two new zones (Latin America and Asia-Pacific) were introduced.\n\nThe 2015 Pok\u00e9mon Video Game World Championship was intended to be played under 2 Swiss tournaments and 1 single-elimination tournament which would then determine the 2015 World Champions. As such, there are two types of invites:\n* a regular 'Day One' invite, and\n* a 'Day Two' invite, which allows players to receive a bye for the Swiss tournament on the first day.\n\nAs an example, the invitations for the Masters Division were distributed as follows:-:<ref name=\"pokemon.com\"/>\n* 'Day One' invitation (by Championship Points): \n**'''Top 40''' players from [[North America]]\n**'''Top 60''' players from [[Europe]]\n**'''Top 18''' players from [[Latin America]]\n**'''Top 18''' players from [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]]\n**'''Top 2''' players from [[South Africa]]\n* 'Day Two' invitation (i.e. 'Day One' bye)\n** 2014 World Champion\n**'''Top 8''' players from [[North America]] by Championship Points.\n**'''Top 16''' players from [[Europe]] by Championship Points.\n**'''Top 2''' players from [[Latin America]] by Championship Points.\n**'''Top 2''' players from [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] by Championship Points. \n**'''Top 2''' players from [[South Africa]] by Championship Points.\n**'''Top 4''' players of the [[South Korea]] Video Game National Championships.\n**'''Top 8''' players of the [[Japan]] Video Game National Championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nuggetbridge.com/news/japans-path-to-the-2015-pokemon-world-championships-announced/|title=Japan's Path to the 2015 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships Announced - Nugget Bridge|work=Nugget Bridge|accessdate=24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Tournament Structure==\nThe [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Video Game]] Championships consisted of 2 [[Swiss system tournament|Swiss tournaments]] and 1 single elimination tournament played across three days.\n\nOn Friday (Day 1), all players who earned an invitation without a Day 1 bye were entered into a Swiss tournament, where players with two or fewer losses would advance onto the next round. The second Swiss tournament was then played on Saturday (Day 2), where players who advanced from Day 1 were joined by players who received an invitation with a Day 1 bye.\n\nAt the end of the Day 2 Swiss tournament, the top eight players played in single elimination rounds until the last two remain. The finals took place on Sunday (Day 3).\n\n=== Final standings (Video Game Championships) ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Place !!

The two posted status updates and images of their weaponry on social media, which were noticed by various ''Pok\u00e9mon'' fans who treated them as supposed threats against the tournament. The updates were reported to the [[Boston Police Department|Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC)]], who promptly seized their automobile and then stopped them at the door and barred them from entering the Hynes Convention Center on Thursday evening. Police executed a search warrant on Friday and Norton and Stumbo were arrested at their Red Roof Inn room in Saugus just after midnight on Saturday, August 22, 2015.<ref name=GlobeAug23>{{cite news |
