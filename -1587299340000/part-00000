The college was established in 1869 by [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] as the first [[women's college]] in Cambridge. In 1948, it was granted full college status by the university, marking the official admittance of women to the university. In 1976, it was the first Cambridge women's college to become [[mixed-sex education|coeducational]].\n\nThe main College site, situated on the outskirts of the village of [[Girton, Cambridgeshire|Girton]], about 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) northwest of the university town, comprises {{convert|33|acre|ha|1}} of land. In a typical [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] red brick design, most was built by architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] between 1872 and 1887. It provides extensive sports facilities, an indoor swimming pool, an award-winning library and a chapel with two organs. There is an accommodation annexe, known as Swirles Court, situated in the Eddington neighborhood of the [[North West Cambridge development]]. Swirles opened in 2017 and provides up to 325 en-suite single rooms for graduates, and for second-year undergraduates and above.\n\nThe College has several equal-access admittance schemes. It has a reputation for musical talent. Several art collections are held on the main site, including ''People's Portraits'', the millennial exhibition of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]], and an Egyptian collection containing the world's most reproduced [[Fayum mummy portraits|portrait mummy]].\n\nAmong Girton's notable alumni are Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court President]] [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Lady Hale]], ''[[HuffPost]]'' co-founder [[Arianna Huffington]], the comedian/author [[Sandi Toksvig]], the comedian/broadcaster/GP [[Phil Hammond (comedian)|Phil Hammond]], the economist [[Joan Robinson]], and the anthropologist [[Marilyn Strathern]], also Mistress from 1998 to 2009.\n\nIts [[sister college]] is [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], one of the first two women's colleges of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cambridge - Girton College Main Gate - June 2018.jpg|thumb|Main gate with porter's lodge]]\n\n===1869 to 1976: Pioneering for women's education===\nThe early feminist movement began to argue for the improvement of women's education in the 1860s<!--Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke for that purpose in 1837-->: [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] met through their activism at the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women|Society for the Employment of Women]] and the [[Englishwoman's Review]].<ref>Stephen 1933, p.6</ref> They shared the aim of securing women's admission to university.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.7</ref> In particular, they wanted to determine whether girls could be admitted at Oxford or Cambridge to sit the Senior and Junior Local Examinations.<ref>Megson and Lindsay 1961, pp.1\u20132</ref> Davies and Bodichon set up a committee to that effect in 1862. In 1865, with the help of Henry Tomkinson, [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] alumnus and owner of an insurance company with good contacts within the University,<ref>Bradbrook 1969, p.7</ref> 91 female students entered the Cambridge Local Examination.<ref>Megson and Lindsay 1961, p.2</ref> This first concession to women's educational rights met relatively little resistance, as admission to the examination did not imply residence of women at the university site.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.10</ref>\n\n[[File:Girton College Water Colour.jpg|thumb|Water colour by the architect of Girton College Alfred Waterhouse]]\nAt that time, students had the option of doing a Pass degree, which consisted of \"a disorderly collection of fragmented learning\",<ref>Brooke p.209</ref> or an [[Honours degree]], which at that time meant the Mathematics [[Tripos]], classics, natural or moral sciences. An Honours degree was considered more challenging than the Pass degree. In 1869, [[Henry Sidgwick]] helped institute the Examinations for Women, which was designed to be of intermediate difficulty.<ref>Winstanley 1977 p.154</ref> This idea was heavily opposed by Emily Davies, as she demanded admittance to the Tripos examinations.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.23</ref>\n\nThe college was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of the '''College for Women at Benslow House''' in [[Hitchin]], Hertfordshire, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London.<ref>Jones 1913, pp.16\u201317</ref> It was thought to be less \"risky\" and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.25</ref> The college was one of [[England]]'s first residential colleges for women. ([[Whitelands College]], now part of the [[University of Roehampton]], was established as a college of higher education for women earlier, in 1841.) They worked with Fanny Metcalfe to develop the curricula.<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=J.

In 1884, Hospital Wing was completed, and Orchard Wing, Stanley Library and the Old Kitchens added. At that time, Girton had 80 students. By 1902, Tower Wing, Chapel Wing and Woodlands Wing as well as the Chapel and the Hall were finished, which allowed the college to accommodate 180 students.<ref name=\"Bradbrook 1969, p.161\" />\n\nIn 1921, a committee was appointed to draft a charter for the college. By summer 1923 the committee had completed the task, and on 21 August 1924 the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King]] granted the charter to \"the Mistress and Governors of Girton College\" as a [[Body corporate|Body Corporate]].<ref>Stephen 1933, 120\u2013121</ref> Girton was not officially a college yet, nor were its members part of the University. Girton and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] were classed as \"recognised institutions for the higher education for women\", not colleges of the university. On 27 April 1948, women were admitted to full membership of the University of Cambridge, and Girton College received the status of a college of the university.\n\n===1976 to present: Pioneering for sexual equality===\nSocial and cultural changes in the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war period]] led to an increasing number of British universities to become co-educational. In Cambridge, [[Churchill College, Cambridge|Churchill College]], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] and [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] were the first men's colleges to admit women in 1972.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.58</ref> Girton had already amended its statutes in 1971 in such a way as to allow the admission of men should the Governing Body vote in favour at an unspecified date in the future.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.63</ref> The decision to become mixed came in November 1976, when the Governing Body voted to act upon the statute, which made Girton the first women's college to admit men.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.17</ref> In January 1977, the first two male [[Fellow]]s, Frank Wilkinson and John Marks, arrived, followed by male graduate students in 1978, and, finally, undergraduates in October 1979.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.19</ref> One reason for the change was that the first mixed colleges in Cambridge immediately shot to the top of the Tripos league tables, as they seemed to attract bright students, who preferred to stay in co-educational colleges.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.80</ref>\n\nGirton became co-residential as well, which meant that male and female students shared the same facilities. Only one all-female corridor in which rooms were reserved exclusively for women remained. Upon the arrival of male undergraduates, [[Common Room (university)|JCR and MCR]] social facilities had to be enlarged. The college bar was opened in 1979 as well as rugby, cricket and soccer pitches provided from 1982 onwards.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.73</ref><ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.40</ref>\n\nIn the 22-year period from 1997 to 2019, the [[Tompkins Table]] annual ranking of Cambridge colleges by undergraduate academic performance ranked Girton College an average of 20 out of the 29 colleges researched.

The Lamb who may alone open the book sealed with seven seals is shown at the foot of the light, while the descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove is shown at its apex. The flowers and fruit in the centre light represent the Tree of Jesse. The two lights flanking that in the centre depict scenes from the Passion of Our Lord. On the left are the entry into Jerusalem, the Betrayal of Judas and the Ecce Homo: on the right, the Scourging, Christ bearing His Cross, the Crucifixion. The scenes are linked with a pattern of leaves. Palm is used for the Entry into Jerusalem, and among other plants represented are the Star of Bethlehem, the Passion Flower and the Thorn. The lowest medallion on the right, portraying the crucifixion, is darker than the others, suggesting the darkness that was over the land. The uppermost tracery light depicts the Pelican in her Piety, and the remaining tracery lights contain the symbols of the Passion; the betrayal money, Peter\u2019s lantern, pillar and scourges, dice, ladder and nails, hammer and pincers, crown of thorns and chalice.<ref name=\"Girton college 1955\"/></blockquote>\nIn the original statement of aims and scope for the 'Proposed College for Women' in 1867, it was announced that religious services and instruction would be in accordance with the principles of the [[Church of England]], but where conscientious objections were entertained, attendance would not be necessary.

The Rev. [[Edward Earle Dorling]] submitted a great variety of designs to the council, however the task was not easy. \"A patch-work of elaborate charges and many colours was to be avoided. Mr Tomkinson's fascinating martlets and Lady Stanley's lion had to be abandoned with regret, as was also a design of green and silver chequers which would have given more prominence to Miss [[Emily Davies|Davies]].\"<ref>Girton Review, Michaelmas 1928, pp. 2\u20134</ref>\n\nFinally in 1928 the design was accepted by all and the College was granted the following:\n\n<blockquote>We \u2026 grant and assign unto The [[Mistress (college)|Mistress]] and Governors of Girton College the Arms following that is to say: Quarterly [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]] and [[Argent]] a [[cross flory]] countercharged a [[Roundel (heraldry)|Roundel]] [[Ermine (heraldry)|Ermine]] and in the second and third quarters a [[Crescent]] [[Gules]], \u2026 to be borne and used for ever, hereafter by the Mistress and Governors of Girton College and by their Successors upon Seals Shields or otherwise according to the Laws of Arms.<ref>{{cite journal | last = K\u00f3czy| first = L\u00e1szl\u00f3 \u00c1.| authorlink = | title = Girton College and its Arms| journal = The Escutcheon| volume = 2| issue = 3| pages =| publisher = [[Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society]]| location = Cambridge| year = 1997|url = http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cuhags/escutcheon/1996-97/ar_girtn.htm| doi =|accessdate=27 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314010013/http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cuhags/escutcheon/1996-97/ar_girtn.htm|archivedate=2012-03-14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Gown===\n\nThe college gown has the standard pattern of an [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|undergraduate gown at the University of Cambridge]], with the sleeves sewn up for a length of eight inches from the shoulder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/students/guide/academic-matters |title=Academic matters |author=Girton College |year=2010 |website= |accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> The proper dress of the gown and cap was observed at the first honorary degree to a woman, given to the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen]], an [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D]]. on 21 October 1948. As [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|academic dress]], gowns were adopted with little changes (the sleeves had to be closed so that even in the summer, when women wear short-sleeved dresses their bare shoulders do not show), and square caps were chosen as head-dress. However, to remember the time when women were not allowed to obtain degrees of the University of Cambridge, no gowns are worn during the college feast, when students in their final year are celebrated.\n\n===Graces===\nGirton College has a traditional two-word grace and a more recent full grace, both in Latin.  On regular formal occasions, such as [[Formal (university)|Formal Halls]], the two-word graces are spoken, ''Benedictus benedicat'' (May the blessed one give blessing) at the start of the meal, and ''Benedictus benedicatur'' (May praise be given to the blessed one) at the end of the meal. There is evidence that the two-word grace was used in 1926, and it is thought the two-word grace <!-- is that grace, singular, or graces, plural? what exactly does Freeman refer to? --> was used from the foundation of the college onwards.<ref>{{cite book |title=Alma Mater: Memoirs of Girton College 1926\u20131929 |last=Freeman |first=Gwendolen |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=David and Charles |location=Devon |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= |asin=}}</ref>\n\nThe words and the music of the full grace were composed in 1950 by Alison Duke and Jill Vlasto respectively.<ref name=\"Wheeler 2002\">{{cite journal | last = Wheeler| first = Graham| authorlink = | title = Dining graces at Cambridge colleges| journal =| volume = | issue = | pages =| publisher = paper presented to the Interdisciplinary Seminar, Faculty of Classics| location = Cambridge| year = 2002|url =| doi =}}</ref> The grace came after the admission of women to full membership of the university so as to bring Girton in line with the other colleges.<ref name=\"Wheeler 2002\"/> It is used on the most formal occasions, such as the Foundation Dinner, and it is sung once a year at the College Feast, which all final year students attend.\n\nFull grace (in Latin):\n\n<blockquote><poem>''Benedic Domine, nobis et omnibus huius collegii alumnis,\ndonisque tuis quae de munificentia tua sumus iam sumpturi;\net illis salubriter nutriti debitas tibi gratias pie reddamus.\nCustodi, quaesumus, Domine, filios et filias\net consule necessitatibus animarum et corporum,\nhoc ipso momento et in aeternum.''</poem></blockquote>\n\nFull grace (English translation):\n<blockquote><poem>Bless us, O Lord, and all members of this college,\nand also thy gifts, which of thy bounty we are about to receive;\nand having been wholesomely nourished by the same let us dutifully render to thee the thanks that are owed.\nProtect, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy sons and daughters and provide for the needs both of our souls and bodies,\nat this present time and for evermore.</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Songs===\n[[File:The Girton Pioneers.jpg|thumb|right|''The Girton Pioneers'' (tune of [[The British Grenadiers]]) honours the first three women to sit the [[Tripos|Tripos exams]]]]\nThe oldest college song, ''The Girton Pioneers'', was composed by several students in Hitchin in 1873.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> Its purpose was to celebrate the first three students who sat the Tripos examinations in 1871.<ref name=\"Jones 1913 p.28f\">Jones 1913 p.28f.</ref> It is sung with the tune of ''[[The British Grenadiers]]''. This is the first stanza:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Some talk of Senior Wranglers,\nAnd some of Double Firsts,\nAnd truly of their species\nThese are not the worst;\nBut of all the Cambridge heroes\nThere\u2019s none that can compare\nWith Woodhead, Cook and Lumsden,\nThe Girton Pioneers.<ref name=\"Jones 1913 p.28f\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nMore recently, Girtonians have become known for their chant of ''We are Girton \u2013 super Girton! No one likes us, but we don't care''!, in imitation of the [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] fans' famous song: ''[[No one likes us, we don't care]]''. The reference to ''no one likes us'' is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison to many of the other colleges. In 2016 the Casual Choir performed ''Long Way to Girton College'', an adaptation of ''[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]'', written and arranged by two choir members.\n\nThe college song ''I love to go a-bicycling'', sung with the tune of'' I love to go a-wandering'' also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> For example, the second stanza reads:\n<blockquote><poem>But when I climb up Castle Hill\nIn the wind and squall\nA strong desire does then me fill\nTo be-e at [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]].\n\n''Chorus:''\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra,\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra-a-a-a-\n.... To be-e at New Hall.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother song, composed in 1972 by [[Common Room (university)|JCR]] president Anna Cocconi,<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> is called ''Song to Wolfson Court''. The annexe of the college was opened in that year. Students often found fault with the modern architecture of the building, which was less spacious and elegant than the main site. The first two stanzas go as follows:\n<blockquote><poem> In a wheat field, west of Cambridge,\nOff a lane called Clarkson Road,\nWolfson Court is standing proudly;\nLet its story now be told\n\nHundred rooms with running water,\nCould you ever ask for more?\nNot unless you choose a boy-friend,\nMeas\u2019ring over five foot four!<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Girton College Boat Club]]\n* [[:Category:Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n* [[:Category:Fellows of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n\n===Eponymous institutions===\n*[[Girton Grammar School]], [[Bendigo, Victoria]], [[Australia]]\n*[[Girton Hall]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]\n\n===Official College Website===\n*[http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/ Girton College]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Books\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |title=Life at Girton College |last=a Girton student |author-link= |year=1882 |publisher=(no publisher) |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |access-date=}}\n*{{cite book |title = 'That Infidel Place'.

The college was established in 1869 by [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] as the first [[women's college]] in Cambridge. In 1948, it was granted full college status by the university, marking the official admittance of women to the university. In 1976, it was the first Cambridge women's college to become [[mixed-sex education|coeducational]].\n\nThe main College site, situated on the outskirts of the village of [[Girton, Cambridgeshire|Girton]], about 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) northwest of the university town, comprises {{convert|33|acre|ha|1}} of land. In a typical [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] red brick design, most was built by architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] between 1872 and 1887. It provides extensive sports facilities, an indoor swimming pool, an award-winning library and a chapel with two organs. There is an accommodation annexe, known as Swirles Court, situated in the Eddington neighborhood of the [[North West Cambridge development]]. Swirles opened in 2017 and provides up to 325 en-suite single rooms for graduates, and for second-year undergraduates and above.\n\nThe College has several equal-access admittance schemes. It has a reputation for musical talent. Several art collections are held on the main site, including ''People's Portraits'', the millennial exhibition of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]], and an Egyptian collection containing the world's most reproduced [[Fayum mummy portraits|portrait mummy]].\n\nAmong Girton's notable alumni are Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court President]] [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Lady Hale]], ''[[HuffPost]]'' co-founder [[Arianna Huffington]], the comedian/author [[Sandi Toksvig]], the comedian/broadcaster/GP [[Phil Hammond (comedian)|Phil Hammond]], the economist [[Joan Robinson]], and the anthropologist [[Marilyn Strathern]], also Mistress from 1998 to 2009.\n\nIts [[sister college]] is [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], one of the first two women's colleges of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cambridge - Girton College Main Gate - June 2018.jpg|thumb|Main gate with porter's lodge]]\n\n===1869 to 1976: Pioneering for women's education===\nThe early feminist movement began to argue for the improvement of women's education in the 1860s<!--Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke for that purpose in 1837-->: [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] met through their activism at the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women|Society for the Employment of Women]] and the [[Englishwoman's Review]].<ref>Stephen 1933, p.6</ref> They shared the aim of securing women's admission to university.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.7</ref> In particular, they wanted to determine whether girls could be admitted at Oxford or Cambridge to sit the Senior and Junior Local Examinations.<ref>Megson and Lindsay 1961, pp.1\u20132</ref> Davies and Bodichon set up a committee to that effect in 1862. In 1865, with the help of Henry Tomkinson, [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] alumnus and owner of an insurance company with good contacts within the University,<ref>Bradbrook 1969, p.7</ref> 91 female students entered the Cambridge Local Examination.<ref>Megson and Lindsay 1961, p.2</ref> This first concession to women's educational rights met relatively little resistance, as admission to the examination did not imply residence of women at the university site.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.10</ref>\n\n[[File:Girton College Water Colour.jpg|thumb|Water colour by the architect of Girton College Alfred Waterhouse]]\nAt that time, students had the option of doing a Pass degree, which consisted of \"a disorderly collection of fragmented learning\",<ref>Brooke p.209</ref> or an [[Honours degree]], which at that time meant the Mathematics [[Tripos]], classics, natural or moral sciences. An Honours degree was considered more challenging than the Pass degree. In 1869, [[Henry Sidgwick]] helped institute the Examinations for Women, which was designed to be of intermediate difficulty.<ref>Winstanley 1977 p.154</ref> This idea was heavily opposed by Emily Davies, as she demanded admittance to the Tripos examinations.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.23</ref>\n\nThe college was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of the '''College for Women at Benslow House''' in [[Hitchin]], Hertfordshire, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London.<ref>Jones 1913, pp.16\u201317</ref> It was thought to be less \"risky\" and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.25</ref> The college was one of [[England]]'s first residential colleges for women.

Only one all-female corridor in which rooms were reserved exclusively for women remained. Upon the arrival of male undergraduates, [[Common Room (university)|JCR and MCR]] social facilities had to be enlarged.

The scenes are linked with a pattern of leaves. Palm is used for the Entry into Jerusalem, and among other plants represented are the Star of Bethlehem, the Passion Flower and the Thorn.

There is evidence that the two-word grace was used in 1926, and it is thought the two-word grace <!-- is that grace, singular, or graces, plural? what exactly does Freeman refer to? --> was used from the foundation of the college onwards.<ref>{{cite book |title=Alma Mater: Memoirs of Girton College 1926\u20131929 |last=Freeman |first=Gwendolen |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=David and Charles |location=Devon |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= |asin=}}</ref>\n\nThe words and the music of the full grace were composed in 1950 by Alison Duke and Jill Vlasto respectively.<ref name=\"Wheeler 2002\">{{cite journal | last = Wheeler| first = Graham| authorlink = | title = Dining graces at Cambridge colleges| journal =| volume = | issue = | pages =| publisher = paper presented to the Interdisciplinary Seminar, Faculty of Classics| location = Cambridge| year = 2002|url =| doi =}}</ref> The grace came after the admission of women to full membership of the university so as to bring Girton in line with the other colleges.<ref name=\"Wheeler 2002\"/> It is used on the most formal occasions, such as the Foundation Dinner, and it is sung once a year at the College Feast, which all final year students attend.\n\nFull grace (in Latin):\n\n<blockquote><poem>''Benedic Domine, nobis et omnibus huius collegii alumnis,\ndonisque tuis quae de munificentia tua sumus iam sumpturi;\net illis salubriter nutriti debitas tibi gratias pie reddamus.\nCustodi, quaesumus, Domine, filios et filias\net consule necessitatibus animarum et corporum,\nhoc ipso momento et in aeternum.''</poem></blockquote>\n\nFull grace (English translation):\n<blockquote><poem>Bless us, O Lord, and all members of this college,\nand also thy gifts, which of thy bounty we are about to receive;\nand having been wholesomely nourished by the same let us dutifully render to thee the thanks that are owed.\nProtect, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy sons and daughters and provide for the needs both of our souls and bodies,\nat this present time and for evermore.</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Songs===\n[[File:The Girton Pioneers.jpg|thumb|right|''The Girton Pioneers'' (tune of [[The British Grenadiers]]) honours the first three women to sit the [[Tripos|Tripos exams]]]]\nThe oldest college song, ''The Girton Pioneers'', was composed by several students in Hitchin in 1873.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> Its purpose was to celebrate the first three students who sat the Tripos examinations in 1871.<ref name=\"Jones 1913 p.28f\">Jones 1913 p.28f.</ref> It is sung with the tune of ''[[The British Grenadiers]]''. This is the first stanza:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Some talk of Senior Wranglers,\nAnd some of Double Firsts,\nAnd truly of their species\nThese are not the worst;\nBut of all the Cambridge heroes\nThere\u2019s none that can compare\nWith Woodhead, Cook and Lumsden,\nThe Girton Pioneers.<ref name=\"Jones 1913 p.28f\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nMore recently, Girtonians have become known for their chant of ''We are Girton \u2013 super Girton! No one likes us, but we don't care''!, in imitation of the [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] fans' famous song: ''[[No one likes us, we don't care]]''. The reference to ''no one likes us'' is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison to many of the other colleges. In 2016 the Casual Choir performed ''Long Way to Girton College'', an adaptation of ''[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]'', written and arranged by two choir members.\n\nThe college song ''I love to go a-bicycling'', sung with the tune of'' I love to go a-wandering'' also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> For example, the second stanza reads:\n<blockquote><poem>But when I climb up Castle Hill\nIn the wind and squall\nA strong desire does then me fill\nTo be-e at [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]].\n\n''Chorus:''\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra,\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra-a-a-a-\n.... To be-e at New Hall.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother song, composed in 1972 by [[Common Room (university)|JCR]] president Anna Cocconi,<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> is called ''Song to Wolfson Court''. The annexe of the college was opened in that year. Students often found fault with the modern architecture of the building, which was less spacious and elegant than the main site. The first two stanzas go as follows:\n<blockquote><poem> In a wheat field, west of Cambridge,\nOff a lane called Clarkson Road,\nWolfson Court is standing proudly;\nLet its story now be told\n\nHundred rooms with running water,\nCould you ever ask for more?\nNot unless you choose a boy-friend,\nMeas\u2019ring over five foot four!<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Girton College Boat Club]]\n* [[:Category:Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n* [[:Category:Fellows of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n\n===Eponymous institutions===\n*[[Girton Grammar School]], [[Bendigo, Victoria]], [[Australia]]\n*[[Girton Hall]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]\n\n===Official College Website===\n*[http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/ Girton College]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Books\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |title=Life at Girton College |last=a Girton student |author-link= |year=1882 |publisher=(no publisher) |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |access-date=}}\n*{{cite book |title = 'That Infidel Place'.

It was not used in writing to refer to the American subculture of the mid-20th century until the mid-1960s, though in this sense it still evoked a pejorative connotation and a relation to machine work.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}{{efn|[[S. E. Hinton]], author of the novel [[The Outsiders (novel)|''The Outsiders'']], an influential portrayal of greasers, knew the term from her youth in the 1950s.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}}}} The name was applied to members of the subculture because of their characteristic greased-back hair.{{sfn|Torres|2017}}\n\n=== Origins of the subculture and rise to popularity ===\nThe greaser subculture may have emerged in the post\u2013[[World War II]] era among the [[motorcycle club]]s and [[outlaw motorcycle club|gangs]] of the late 1940s in the United States, though it was certainly established by the 1950s.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}{{efn|Moore writes that there is ambiguity surrounding the birth of the defining greaser fashion and style, though the associated look is similar to the one displayed by post-war bikers.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}}} The original greasers were aligned by a feeling of [[social alienation|disillusionment]] with American popular culture, either through a lack of economic opportunity in spite of the [[Economic history of the United States#Postwar prosperity: 1945\u20131973|post-war boom]] or a marginalization enacted by the general domestic shift towards homogeneity in the 1950s.{{sfn|Moore|2017|pp=138\u2013139}} Most were male, usually ethnic and white working class, and held interest in [[hotrod]] culture or motorcycling.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}} A handful of middle-class youth were drawn to the subculture for its rebellious attitude.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|p=182}}\n\nThe weak structural foundation of the greasers can be attributed to the subculture's origins in working-class youth possessing few economic resources with which to participate in American [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers, unlike motorcyclists, did not explicitly have their own interest clubs or publications. As such, there was no business marketing geared specifically towards the group.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Their choice in clothing was largely drawn from a common understanding of the empowering aesthetic of working-class attire, rather than cohesive association with similarly dressed individuals.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Some greasers were in motorcycle clubs or in [[street gangs]] (and conversely, some gang members and bikers dressed like greasers),{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} though such membership was not necessarily an inherent principle of the subculture.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}\n\nEthnically, original greasers were  composed mostly of [[Italian Americans]] in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Chicanos]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. Since both of these peoples were mostly [[olive skin|olive skinned]], the \"greaser\" label assumed a quasi-racial status that implied an urban, ethnic, lower-class masculinity and delinquency. This development led to an ambiguity in the racial distinction between poor [[Italian American]]s and [[Puerto Rican migration to New York City#1950s|Puerto Ricans]] in [[New York City]] in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers were also perceived as being predisposed to perpetrating [[sexual violence]], stoking fear among middle-class males and a degree of [[sexual arousal|arousal]] among middle-class females.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n=== Decline and modern incarnations ===\nThough the television show ''[[American Bandstand]]'' helped to \"sanitize\" the negative image of greasers in the 1960s, [[Promiscuity|sexual promiscuity]] was still seen as a key component of the modern character.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Footnote #56}} By the mid-1970s, the greaser image had become a quintessential part of 1950s [[nostalgia]] and cultural revival.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|p=184}}\n\n== Fashion, style, and culture ==\n[[File:Young greaser.jpg|thumb|Young greaser in the Southeastern United States, 1956]]\nThe most notable physical characteristic of greasers was the greased hairstyles they fashioned through the use of hair products such as [[pomade]] or [[petroleum jelly]], which necessitated frequent combing and reshaping to maintain.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} Males sported coiffures adopted from early rock 'n' roll and [[rockabilly]]\nperformers such as [[Elvis Presley]], among them the Folsom, [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|Pompadour]], Elephant's trunk, and [[Duck's ass]], while females commonly [[backcombing|backcombed]] or teased their hair.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=140}}\n\nMale greasers typically wore loose cotton [[twill]] trousers, common among the working class, or dark blue [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] [[blue jeans|jeans]], widely popular among all American youth in the 1950s. The latter were often cuffed over ankle-high black or brown leather boots,{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} including [[cowboy boots|cowboy]], steel-toed [[engineer boot|engineer]], or [[Harness boots|harness]] styles. Other footwear choices included [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] and [[brothel creeper]]s.{{sfn|Blanco F.|2015|p=137}} Male tops were typically solid black or white [[T-shirt]]s, [[ringer T-shirt]]s, or sometimes [[tank tops]] (which would have been retailed as [[underwear]]). Choices of outerwear included denim or [[leather jacket]]s (including [[Perfecto motorcycle jacket]]s). Female greaser dress included leather jackets and risque clothing, such as tight and cropped [[capri pants|capris]] and [[pedal pushers]] (broadly popular during the time period).{{sfn|Moore|2017|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\n=== Music tastes ===\nIn the early 1950s, there was significant greaser interest in [[doo-wop]], a black genre of music from the industrial cities of the Northeast that had disseminated to mainstream American music through Italian American performers.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers were heavily associated with the culture surrounding [[rock n' roll]], a musical genre that had induced feelings of a [[moral panic]] among older middle-class generations during the mid-to-late 1950s, to whom greasers epitomized the connection between rock music and [[juvenile delinquency]] professed by several important social and cultural observers of the time.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n== Portrayal in media and popular culture ==\n[[File:LA teens.jpg|thumb|Greaser revival look in 1974]]\nThe first cinematic representation of the greaser subculture was the 1953 film ''[[The Wild One]]''.{{sfn|Gelder|Thornton|1997|p=185}} The band [[Sha-Na-Na]] models their on-stage presence on New York City greasers (the band members themselves were mostly [[Ivy League]]rs).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/danny-mcbride-guitarist-with-rockn-roll-revivalists-sha-na-na-1773502.html?action=Popup|date=April 10, 2010|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|title=Danny McBride: Guitarist with rock'n' roll revivalists Sha Na Na}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Rockers (youth movement)|Rockers]], similar subculture in the United Kingdom\n* [[Teddy Boy]], a contemporary subculture in the United Kingdom\n* [[Nozem]], a similar subculture in the Netherlands\n* [[Raggare]], a similar subculture in Sweden\n* [[Bodgies and widgies]], a similar subculture in Australia\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book| last = Blanco F.| first = Jos\u00e9| title = Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe| publisher = ABC-CLIO| edition = illustrated| date = 23 November 2015| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hDkVCwAAQBAJ&dq=&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781610693103|ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| editor-last = Gelder| editor-first = Ken| editor-last2 = Thornton| editor-first2 = Sarah|editorlink2=Sarah Thornton| title = The Subcultures Reader| publisher = Psychology Press | edition = illustrated, reprint| date = 1997| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BDa6PDEgiawC&dq=| isbn = 9780415127271| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Moore| first = Jennifer Grayer| title = Street Style in America: An Exploration| publisher = ABC-CLIO| edition = illustrated| date = 2017| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8x8uDwAAQBAJ&dq=| isbn = 9781440844621| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Symmons| first = Tom| title = The New Hollywood Historical Film: 1967\u201378| publisher = Springer| edition = illustrated| date = 2016| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T_xjDAAAQBAJ&dq=| isbn = 9781137529305| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web| url = https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/pachucos-and-teddy-boys-how-generations-of-youth-in-the-us-and-uk-borrowed-from-each| title = Pachucos and Teddy Boys: How Generations of Youth in the U.S. and U.K. Borrowed From Each Other| last = Torres| first = Lucia| date = January 12, 2017| publisher = [[KCET|KCETLink]]| access-date = August 7, 2017| ref= harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Tricario |first=Donald| chapter= 10.

[[Rock and roll]] music, [[rockabilly]] and [[doo-wop]] were major parts of the culture.\n\n== History ==\n=== Etymology of the term \"greaser\" ===\nThe word \"greaser\" originated in the 19th century in the United States as [[Greaser (derogatory)|a derogatory label]] for poor laborers, specifically those of Mexican or Italian descent.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}{{efn|The similar term \"greaseball\" became a slur for individuals of [[Italians|Italian]] descent, though to a lesser extent it has also been used more generally to refer to all [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]], Latin, or [[Hispanic]] people.<ref name=\"slang\">{{cite book|last1=Dalzell|first1=Tom|last2=Victor|first2=Terry|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|page=1044|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbcBCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1044&dq=greaseball&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1pMLHk_rYAhXLzVMKHdu3DJkQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=greaseball&f=false|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"maledicta\">{{cite book|last1=Aman|first1=Reinhold|title=Maledicta, Volume 7|date=1984|publisher=Maledicta|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAnqAAAAMAAJ&q=greaseball+italian&dq=greaseball+italian&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj79PfqlPrYAhVCtlMKHZCwA-w4ChDoAQg8MAQ}}</ref><ref name=\"migrations\">{{cite book|last1=Ruberto|first1=Laura E.|last2=Sciorra|first2=Joseph|title=New Italian Migrations to the United States: Vol. 1: Politics and History Since 1945|date=2017|publisher=University of Illinois Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qauzDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT118&dq=greaseball+italian&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibrJumlPrYAhWF2lMKHVZPBp8Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=greaseball%20italian&f=false}}</ref>}} The term was later used to refer to mechanics. It was not used in writing to refer to the American subculture of the mid-20th century until the mid-1960s, though in this sense it still evoked a pejorative connotation and a relation to machine work.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}{{efn|[[S. E. Hinton]], author of the novel [[The Outsiders (novel)|''The Outsiders'']], an influential portrayal of greasers, knew the term from her youth in the 1950s.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}}}} The name was applied to members of the subculture because of their characteristic greased-back hair.{{sfn|Torres|2017}}\n\n=== Origins of the subculture and rise to popularity ===\nThe greaser subculture may have emerged in the post\u2013[[World War II]] era among the [[motorcycle club]]s and [[outlaw motorcycle club|gangs]] of the late 1940s in the United States, though it was certainly established by the 1950s.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}{{efn|Moore writes that there is ambiguity surrounding the birth of the defining greaser fashion and style, though the associated look is similar to the one displayed by post-war bikers.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}}} The original greasers were aligned by a feeling of [[social alienation|disillusionment]] with American popular culture, either through a lack of economic opportunity in spite of the [[Economic history of the United States#Postwar prosperity: 1945\u20131973|post-war boom]] or a marginalization enacted by the general domestic shift towards homogeneity in the 1950s.{{sfn|Moore|2017|pp=138\u2013139}} Most were male, usually ethnic and white working class, and held interest in [[hotrod]] culture or motorcycling.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}} A handful of middle-class youth were drawn to the subculture for its rebellious attitude.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|p=182}}\n\nThe weak structural foundation of the greasers can be attributed to the subculture's origins in working-class youth possessing few economic resources with which to participate in American [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers, unlike motorcyclists, did not explicitly have their own interest clubs or publications. As such, there was no business marketing geared specifically towards the group.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Their choice in clothing was largely drawn from a common understanding of the empowering aesthetic of working-class attire, rather than cohesive association with similarly dressed individuals.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} Some greasers were in motorcycle clubs or in [[street gangs]] (and conversely, some gang members and bikers dressed like greasers),{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=141}} though such membership was not necessarily an inherent principle of the subculture.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=138}}\n\nEthnically, original greasers were  composed mostly of [[Italian Americans]] in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Chicanos]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]]. Since both of these peoples were mostly [[olive skin|olive skinned]], the \"greaser\" label assumed a quasi-racial status that implied an urban, ethnic, lower-class masculinity and delinquency. This development led to an ambiguity in the racial distinction between poor [[Italian American]]s and [[Puerto Rican migration to New York City#1950s|Puerto Ricans]] in [[New York City]] in the 1950s and 1960s.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers were also perceived as being predisposed to perpetrating [[sexual violence]], stoking fear among middle-class males and a degree of [[sexual arousal|arousal]] among middle-class females.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n=== Decline and modern incarnations ===\nThough the television show ''[[American Bandstand]]'' helped to \"sanitize\" the negative image of greasers in the 1960s, [[Promiscuity|sexual promiscuity]] was still seen as a key component of the modern character.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Footnote #56}} By the mid-1970s, the greaser image had become a quintessential part of 1950s [[nostalgia]] and cultural revival.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|p=184}}\n\n== Fashion, style, and culture ==\n[[File:Young greaser.jpg|thumb|Young greaser in the Southeastern United States, 1956]]\nThe most notable physical characteristic of greasers was the greased hairstyles they fashioned through the use of hair products such as [[pomade]] or [[petroleum jelly]], which necessitated frequent combing and reshaping to maintain.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} Males sported coiffures adopted from early rock 'n' roll and [[rockabilly]]\nperformers such as [[Elvis Presley]], among them the Folsom, [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|Pompadour]], Elephant's trunk, and [[Duck's ass]], while females commonly [[backcombing|backcombed]] or teased their hair.{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=140}}\n\nMale greasers typically wore loose cotton [[twill]] trousers, common among the working class, or dark blue [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] [[blue jeans|jeans]], widely popular among all American youth in the 1950s. The latter were often cuffed over ankle-high black or brown leather boots,{{sfn|Moore|2017|p=139}} including [[cowboy boots|cowboy]], steel-toed [[engineer boot|engineer]], or [[Harness boots|harness]] styles. Other footwear choices included [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]] and [[brothel creeper]]s.{{sfn|Blanco F.|2015|p=137}} Male tops were typically solid black or white [[T-shirt]]s, [[ringer T-shirt]]s, or sometimes [[tank tops]] (which would have been retailed as [[underwear]]). Choices of outerwear included denim or [[leather jacket]]s (including [[Perfecto motorcycle jacket]]s). Female greaser dress included leather jackets and risque clothing, such as tight and cropped [[capri pants|capris]] and [[pedal pushers]] (broadly popular during the time period).{{sfn|Moore|2017|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\n=== Music tastes ===\nIn the early 1950s, there was significant greaser interest in [[doo-wop]], a black genre of music from the industrial cities of the Northeast that had disseminated to mainstream American music through Italian American performers.{{sfn|Tricario|2014|loc=Section \"Anticipating an Italian American Consumption Culture\"}} Greasers were heavily associated with the culture surrounding [[rock n' roll]], a musical genre that had induced feelings of a [[moral panic]] among older middle-class generations during the mid-to-late 1950s, to whom greasers epitomized the connection between rock music and [[juvenile delinquency]] professed by several important social and cultural observers of the time.{{sfn|Symmons|2016|pp=181\u2013182}}\n\n== Portrayal in media and popular culture ==\n[[File:LA teens.jpg|thumb|Greaser revival look in 1974]]\nThe first cinematic representation of the greaser subculture was the 1953 film ''[[The Wild One]]''.{{sfn|Gelder|Thornton|1997|p=185}} The band [[Sha-Na-Na]] models their on-stage presence on New York City greasers (the band members themselves were mostly [[Ivy League]]rs).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/danny-mcbride-guitarist-with-rockn-roll-revivalists-sha-na-na-1773502.html?action=Popup|date=April 10, 2010|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|title=Danny McBride: Guitarist with rock'n' roll revivalists Sha Na Na}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Rockers (youth movement)|Rockers]], similar subculture in the United Kingdom\n* [[Teddy Boy]], a contemporary subculture in the United Kingdom\n* [[Nozem]], a similar subculture in the Netherlands\n* [[Raggare]], a similar subculture in Sweden\n* [[Bodgies and widgies]], a similar subculture in Australia\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book| last = Blanco F.| first = Jos\u00e9| title = Clothing and Fashion: American Fashion from Head to Toe| publisher = ABC-CLIO| edition = illustrated| date = 23 November 2015| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hDkVCwAAQBAJ&dq=&source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9781610693103|ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| editor-last = Gelder| editor-first = Ken| editor-last2 = Thornton| editor-first2 = Sarah| title = The Subcultures Reader| publisher = Psychology Press | edition = illustrated, reprint| date = 1997| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BDa6PDEgiawC&dq=| isbn = 9780415127271| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Moore| first = Jennifer Grayer| title = Street Style in America: An Exploration| publisher = ABC-CLIO| edition = illustrated| date = 2017| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8x8uDwAAQBAJ&dq=| isbn = 9781440844621| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book| last = Symmons| first = Tom| title = The New Hollywood Historical Film: 1967\u201378| publisher = Springer| edition = illustrated| date = 2016| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T_xjDAAAQBAJ&dq=| isbn = 9781137529305| ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web| url = https://www.kcet.org/shows/artbound/pachucos-and-teddy-boys-how-generations-of-youth-in-the-us-and-uk-borrowed-from-each| title = Pachucos and Teddy Boys: How Generations of Youth in the U.S. and U.K. Borrowed From Each Other| last = Torres| first = Lucia| date = January 12, 2017| publisher = [[KCET|KCETLink]]| access-date = August 7, 2017| ref= harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Tricario |first=Donald| chapter= 10.
