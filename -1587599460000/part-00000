His mother and advisors were anxious to have him settled in marriage. The 17-year-old Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz appealed to him as a prospective consort partly because she had been brought up in an insignificant north German duchy; and therefore, would probably have had no experience or interest in power politics or party intrigues. That proved to be the case; to make sure, he instructed her shortly after their wedding \"not to meddle,\" a precept she was glad to follow.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jean L. Cooper and Angelika S.

They reached [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Strelitz]] on 14 August 1761, and were received the next day by [[Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|the reigning duke]], Princess Charlotte's brother, at which time the marriage contract was signed by him on the one hand and Earl Harcourt on the other. Three days of public celebrations followed, and on 17 August 1761, the Princess set out for Britain, accompanied by her brother, [[Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Duke Adolphus Frederick]], and by the British escort party. On 22 August, they reached [[Cuxhaven]], where a small fleet awaited to convey them to England. The voyage was extremely difficult; the party encountered three storms at sea, and landed at [[Harwich]] only on 7 September. They set out at once for London, spent that night in [[Witham]], at the residence of [[Lord Abercorn]], and arrived at 3:30 pm the next day at [[St. James's Palace]] in London. They were received by the King and his family at the garden gate, which marked the first meeting of the bride and groom.\n\nAt 9:00 pm that same evening (8 September 1761), within six hours of her arrival, Charlotte was united in marriage with King George III. The ceremony was performed at the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St. James's Palace]], by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Thomas Secker]].<ref name=\"Fitzgerald pp. 32-33\">Fitzgerald, pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Only the royal family, the party who had travelled from Germany, and a handful of guests were present.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald pp. 32-33\"/>\n\n==Queenship==\nUpon her wedding day, Charlotte spoke no English.

Relatively more private and compact, the new property stood amid rolling parkland not far from St James's Palace. Around 1762 the King and Queen moved to this residence, which was originally intended as a private retreat. The Queen came to favour this residence, spending so much of her time there that it came to be known as The Queen's House. Indeed, in 1775, an Act of Parliament settled the property on Queen Charlotte in exchange for her rights to [[Somerset House]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Walford\n | first1 = Edward\n | author-link1 = Edward Walford\n | chapter = Westminster: Buckingham Palace\n | title = Old and New London\n | url = https://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol4/pp61-74#p15\n | volume = 4\n | location = London\n | publisher = Cassell, Petter & Galpin\n | date = 1878\n | pages = 61\u201374\n | access-date = 3 December 2018\n | quote = In 1775 the property was legally settled, by Act of Parliament, on Queen Charlotte (in exchange for Somerset House, [...]); and henceforth Buckingham House was known in West-end society as the \"Queen's House.\"\n}}\n</ref>\nMost of her 15 children were born in Buckingham House, although St James's Palace remained the official and ceremonial royal residence.<ref>''[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45183 Westminster: Buckingham Palace]'', ''Old and New London'': Volume 4 (1878), pp. 61\u201374.

He favoured an informal and relaxed domestic life, to the dismay of some courtiers more accustomed to displays of grandeur and strict protocol. [[Lady Mary Coke]] was indignant on hearing in July 1769 that the King, the Queen, her visiting brother Prince Ernest and Lady Effingham had gone for a walk through Richmond town by themselves without any servants. \"I am not satisfied in my mind about the propriety of a Queen walking in town unattended.\"<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{rp|23}}\n\nFrom 1778 the Royal family spent much of their time at a newly-constructed residence, the Queen's Lodge at Windsor, opposite [[Windsor Castle]], in [[Windsor Great Park]], where the King enjoyed hunting deer.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/queens_lodge.html | title= Berkshire History|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | work= Queen's Lodge |accessdate= 1 April 2013}}</ref> The Queen was responsible for the interior decoration of their new residence, described by friend of the Royal Family and diarist [[Mary Delany]]: \"The entrance into the first room was dazzling, all furnished with beautiful Indian paper, chairs covered with different embroideries of the liveliest colours, glasses, tables, sconces, in the best taste, the whole calculated to give the greatest cheerfulness to the place.\"<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{rp|23}}\n\nQueen Charlotte endeared herself to her ladies and to her children's attendants by treating them with friendly warmth, reflected in this note she wrote to her daughters' assistant governess:\n<blockquote>My dear Miss Hamilton, What can I have to say? Not much indeed! But to wish you a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the pleasure to sit and read with you ''The Hermit'', a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I should not have been acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{rp|72}}</blockquote>\n\nCharlotte did have some influence on political affairs through the King. Her influence was discreet and indirect, as demonstrated in the correspondence with her brother Charles. She used her closeness with George III to keep herself informed and to make recommendations for offices. Apparently her recommendations were not direct, as she on one occasion, in 1779, asked her brother Charles to burn her letter, because the King suspected that a person she had recently recommended for a post was the client of a woman who sold offices. Charlotte particularly interested herself in German issues. She took an interest in the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] (1778\u20131779), and it is possible that it was due to her efforts that the King supported British intervention in the continuing conflict between [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] and the [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore of Bavaria]] in 1785.<ref name=\"Clarissa Campbell Orr 2004\">Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660\u20131815: The Role of the Consort.

The Regency Bill of 1765 stated that if the King should become permanently unable to rule, Charlotte was to become Regent. Her mother-in-law and Lord Bute had unsuccessfully opposed this arrangement, but as the King's illness of 1765 was temporary, Charlotte was aware neither of it, nor of the Regency Bill.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n\nThe King's bout of physical and mental illness in 1788 distressed and terrified the Queen. The writer [[Fanny Burney]], at that time one of the Queen's attendants, overheard her moaning to herself with \"desponding sound\": \"What will become of me? What will become of me?\"<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{rp|116}} When the King collapsed one night, she refused to be left alone with him and successfully insisted that she be given her own bedroom. When the doctor, Warren, was called, she was not informed and was not given the opportunity to speak with him. When told by the Prince of Wales that the King was to be removed to Kew, but that she should move to Queen's House or to Windsor, she successfully insisted that she accompany her spouse to Kew. However, she and her daughters were taken to Kew separately from the King and lived secluded from him during his illness. They regularly visited him, but the visits tended to be uncomfortable, as he had a tendency to embrace them and refuse to let them go.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n\nDuring the 1788 illness of the King, a conflict arose between the Queen and the Prince of Wales, who were both suspected of desiring to assume the Regency should the illness of the King become permanent, resulting in him being declared unfit to rule. The Queen suspected the Prince of Wales of a plan to have the King declared insane with the assistance of Doctor Warren, and to take over the Regency. The followers of the Prince of Wales, notably Sir Gilbert Ellis, in turn suspected the Queen of a plan to have the King declared sane with the assistance of Doctor Willis and Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]], so that he could have her appointed Regent should he fall ill again, and then have him declared insane again and assume the Regency. According to Doctor Warren, Doctor Willis had pressed him to declare the King sane on the orders of the Queen.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n\nIn the Regency Bill of 1789, the Prince of Wales was declared Regent should the King become permanently insane, but it also placed the King himself, his court and minor children under the guardianship of the Queen. The Queen used this Bill when she refused the Prince of Wales permission to see the King alone, even well after he had been declared sane again in the spring of 1789. The conflict around the regency led to serious discord between the Prince of Wales and his mother. In an argument he accused her of having sided with his enemies, while she called him the enemy of the King. Their conflict became public when she refused to invite him to the concert held in celebration of the recovery of the King, which created a scandal.  Queen Charlotte and the Prince of Wales finally reconciled, on her initiative, in March 1791.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n      \nAs the King gradually became permanently insane, the Queen's personality altered: she developed a terrible temper, sank into depression, no longer enjoyed appearing in public, not even at the musical concerts she had so loved, and her relationships with her adult children became strained.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{rp|112\u2013379 passim}} From 1792 she found some relief from her worry about her husband by planning the gardens and decoration of a new residence for herself, [[Frogmore House]], in Windsor Home Park.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/queens_lodge.html\n | title= Berkshire History\n |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n | work= Frogmore House |accessdate= 1 April 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFrom 1804 onward, when the King displayed declining mental health, Queen Charlotte slept in a separate bedroom, had her meals separate from him, and avoided seeing him alone.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n\n==Interests and patronage==\n[[Image:Margaret botany.jpg|left|thumb|\"Patroness of Botany, and of the Fine Arts\"]]\n[[Image:Queen-charlotte-1744-1818.jpg|thumb|Queen Charlotte in Robes of State, by [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1779]]\n\nKing George III and Queen Charlotte were music connoisseurs with German tastes, who gave special honour to German artists and composers.

His mother and advisors were anxious to have him settled in marriage. The 17-year-old Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz appealed to him as a prospective consort partly because she had been brought up in an insignificant north German duchy; and therefore, would probably have had no experience or interest in power politics or party intrigues. That proved to be the case; to make sure, he instructed her shortly after their wedding \"not to meddle,\" a precept she was glad to follow.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jean L. Cooper and Angelika S.

They reached [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Strelitz]] on 14 August 1761, and were received the next day by [[Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|the reigning duke]], Princess Charlotte's brother, at which time the marriage contract was signed by him on the one hand and Earl Harcourt on the other. Three days of public celebrations followed, and on 17 August 1761, the Princess set out for Britain, accompanied by her brother, [[Adolphus Frederick IV, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Duke Adolphus Frederick]], and by the British escort party. On 22 August, they reached [[Cuxhaven]], where a small fleet awaited to convey them to England. The voyage was extremely difficult; the party encountered three storms at sea, and landed at [[Harwich]] only on 7 September. They set out at once for London, spent that night in [[Witham]], at the residence of [[Lord Abercorn]], and arrived at 3:30 pm the next day at [[St. James's Palace]] in London. They were received by the King and his family at the garden gate, which marked the first meeting of the bride and groom.\n\nAt 9:00 pm that same evening (8 September 1761), within six hours of her arrival, Charlotte was united in marriage with King George III. The ceremony was performed at the [[Chapel Royal]], [[St. James's Palace]], by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Thomas Secker]].<ref name=\"Fitzgerald pp. 32-33\">Fitzgerald, pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Only the royal family, the party who had travelled from Germany, and a handful of guests were present.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald pp. 32-33\"/>\n\n==Queenship==\nUpon her wedding day, Charlotte spoke no English.

Relatively more private and compact, the new property stood amid rolling parkland not far from St James's Palace. Around 1762 the King and Queen moved to this residence, which was originally intended as a private retreat.

He favoured an informal and relaxed domestic life, to the dismay of some courtiers more accustomed to displays of grandeur and strict protocol. [[Lady Mary Coke]] was indignant on hearing in July 1769 that the King, the Queen, her visiting brother Prince Ernest and Lady Effingham had gone for a walk through Richmond town by themselves without any servants. \"I am not satisfied in my mind about the propriety of a Queen walking in town unattended.\"<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{rp|23}}\n\nFrom 1778 the Royal family spent much of their time at a newly-constructed residence, the Queen's Lodge at Windsor, opposite [[Windsor Castle]], in [[Windsor Great Park]], where the King enjoyed hunting deer.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/queens_lodge.html | title= Berkshire History|author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | work= Queen's Lodge |accessdate= 1 April 2013}}</ref> The Queen was responsible for the interior decoration of their new residence, described by friend of the Royal Family and diarist [[Mary Delany]]: \"The entrance into the first room was dazzling, all furnished with beautiful Indian paper, chairs covered with different embroideries of the liveliest colours, glasses, tables, sconces, in the best taste, the whole calculated to give the greatest cheerfulness to the place.\"<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{rp|23}}\n\nQueen Charlotte endeared herself to her ladies and to her children's attendants by treating them with friendly warmth, reflected in this note she wrote to her daughters' assistant governess:\n<blockquote>My dear Miss Hamilton, What can I have to say? Not much indeed! But to wish you a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the pleasure to sit and read with you ''The Hermit'', a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I should not have been acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{rp|72}}</blockquote>\n\nCharlotte did have some influence on political affairs through the King. Her influence was discreet and indirect, as demonstrated in the correspondence with her brother Charles. She used her closeness with George III to keep herself informed and to make recommendations for offices. Apparently her recommendations were not direct, as she on one occasion, in 1779, asked her brother Charles to burn her letter, because the King suspected that a person she had recently recommended for a post was the client of a woman who sold offices. Charlotte particularly interested herself in German issues. She took an interest in the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] (1778\u20131779), and it is possible that it was due to her efforts that the King supported British intervention in the continuing conflict between [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] and the [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore of Bavaria]] in 1785.<ref name=\"Clarissa Campbell Orr 2004\">Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660\u20131815: The Role of the Consort.

When the doctor, Warren, was called, she was not informed and was not given the opportunity to speak with him. When told by the Prince of Wales that the King was to be removed to Kew, but that she should move to Queen's House or to Windsor, she successfully insisted that she accompany her spouse to Kew. However, she and her daughters were taken to Kew separately from the King and lived secluded from him during his illness. They regularly visited him, but the visits tended to be uncomfortable, as he had a tendency to embrace them and refuse to let them go.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n\nDuring the 1788 illness of the King, a conflict arose between the Queen and the Prince of Wales, who were both suspected of desiring to assume the Regency should the illness of the King become permanent, resulting in him being declared unfit to rule. The Queen suspected the Prince of Wales of a plan to have the King declared insane with the assistance of Doctor Warren, and to take over the Regency. The followers of the Prince of Wales, notably Sir Gilbert Ellis, in turn suspected the Queen of a plan to have the King declared sane with the assistance of Doctor Willis and Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]], so that he could have her appointed Regent should he fall ill again, and then have him declared insane again and assume the Regency. According to Doctor Warren, Doctor Willis had pressed him to declare the King sane on the orders of the Queen.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n\nIn the Regency Bill of 1789, the Prince of Wales was declared Regent should the King become permanently insane, but it also placed the King himself, his court and minor children under the guardianship of the Queen. The Queen used this Bill when she refused the Prince of Wales permission to see the King alone, even well after he had been declared sane again in the spring of 1789. The conflict around the regency led to serious discord between the Prince of Wales and his mother. In an argument he accused her of having sided with his enemies, while she called him the enemy of the King. Their conflict became public when she refused to invite him to the concert held in celebration of the recovery of the King, which created a scandal.  Queen Charlotte and the Prince of Wales finally reconciled, on her initiative, in March 1791.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n      \nAs the King gradually became permanently insane, the Queen's personality altered: she developed a terrible temper, sank into depression, no longer enjoyed appearing in public, not even at the musical concerts she had so loved, and her relationships with her adult children became strained.<ref name=\"Fraser\"/>{{rp|112\u2013379 passim}} From 1792 she found some relief from her worry about her husband by planning the gardens and decoration of a new residence for herself, [[Frogmore House]], in Windsor Home Park.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/queens_lodge.html\n | title= Berkshire History\n |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n | work= Frogmore House |accessdate= 1 April 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFrom 1804 onward, when the King displayed declining mental health, Queen Charlotte slept in a separate bedroom, had her meals separate from him, and avoided seeing him alone.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n\n==Interests and patronage==\n[[Image:Margaret botany.jpg|left|thumb|\"Patroness of Botany, and of the Fine Arts\"]]\n[[Image:Queen-charlotte-1744-1818.jpg|thumb|Queen Charlotte in Robes of State, by [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1779]]\n\nKing George III and Queen Charlotte were music connoisseurs with German tastes, who gave special honour to German artists and composers.  They were passionate admirers of the music of [[George Frideric Handel]].<ref>Otto Jahn, Sir George Grove: ''Life of Mozart, Volume 1'', 1882, p. 39.</ref>\n\nIn April 1764, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], then aged eight, arrived in Britain with his family as part of their [[Mozart family grand tour|grand tour of Europe]] and remained until July 1765.<ref>Engel, Louis: ''From Mozart to Mario: Reminiscences of half a century, Volume 1'', 1886, p. 275.</ref> The Mozarts were summoned to court on 19 May and played before a limited circle from six to ten o'clock. [[Johann Christian Bach]], eleventh son of the great [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], was then music-master to the Queen. He put difficult works of Handel, J. S. Bach, and [[Carl Friedrich Abel]] before the boy: he played them all [[sight reading|at sight]], to the amazement of those present.<ref>Engel, Louis.

''Mozart'', 1911, p. 18.</ref> On 29 October, the Mozarts were in London again, and were invited to court to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the King's accession. As a memento of the royal favour, [[Leopold Mozart]] published six sonatas composed by Wolfgang, known as Mozart's [[Violin Sonatas, KV 10-15 (Mozart)|Opus 3]], that were dedicated to the Queen on 18 January 1765, a dedication she rewarded with a present of 50 guineas.<ref>Otto Jahn, Sir George Grove: ''Life of Mozart, Volume 1'', 1882, p. 41.</ref>\n\nQueen Charlotte was an amateur [[botany|botanist]] who took a great interest in [[Kew Gardens]]. In an age of discovery, when such travellers and explorers as [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] and [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] were constantly bringing home new species and varieties of plants, she ensured that the collections were greatly enriched and expanded.<ref>Murray, John. ''A Handbook for Travellers in Surrey, Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight'', 1876, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref> Her interest in botany led to the South African flower, the ''Bird of Paradise'', being named ''[[Strelitzia reginae]]'' in her honour.<ref>Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Missouri Botanical Garden bulletin, Volume 10'', 1922, p. 27.</ref>\n\nAmong the royal couple's favored craftsmen and artists were the cabinetmaker [[William Vile]], silversmith [[Thomas Heming]], the landscape designer [[Capability Brown]], and the German painter [[Johann Zoffany]], who frequently painted the king and queen and their children in charmingly informal scenes, such as a portrait of Queen Charlotte and her children as she sat at her dressing table.<ref>Levey, p. 4.</ref> In 1788 the royal couple visited the Worcester Porcelain Factory (founded in 1751, and later to be known as [[Royal Worcester]]), where Queen Charlotte ordered a porcelain service that was later renamed \"Royal Lily\" in her honour. Another well-known porcelain service designed and named in her honour was the \"Queen Charlotte\" pattern.<ref>Appendix III of ''Flight & Barr Worcester Porcelain'' by [[Henry Sandon]].</ref>\n\nThe queen founded orphanages and, in 1809, became the patron (providing new funding) of the General Lying-in Hospital, a hospital for expectant mothers. It was subsequently renamed as the Queen's Hospital, and is today the [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital]].<ref name=\"Thomas1885\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofqueench00ryan#page/n5/mode/2up |title=The History of Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital from its foundation in 1752 to the present time, with an account of its objects and present state|year= 1885|publisher= Hutchings & Crowsley|first= Thomas |last=Ryan}}</ref> The education of women was of great importance to her, and she ensured that her daughters were better educated than was usual for young women of the day; however, she also insisted that her daughters live restricted lives close to their mother, and she refused to allow them to marry until they were well-advanced in years.

It is now thought that the King was suffering from [[porphyria]], but at the time the cause of the King's illness was unknown. Sir [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Thomas Lawrence's]] portrait of her at this time marks a transition point, after which she looks much older in her portraits; the Assistant Keeper of Charlotte's Wardrobe, [[Charlotte Papendiek|Mrs. Papendiek]], wrote that the Queen was \"much changed, her hair quite grey\".<ref>Levey, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Relations with Marie Antoinette==\n[[File:Queen Charlotte by Sir Thomas Lawrence 1789.jpg|thumb|Charlotte sat for Sir [[Thomas Lawrence (painter)|Thomas Lawrence]] in September 1789.

Charlotte was 11 years older than Marie Antoinette, yet they shared many interests, such as their love of music and the arts, in which they both enthusiastically took an interest. Never meeting face to face, they relegated their friendship to pen and paper. Marie Antoinette confided in Charlotte upon the outbreak of the French Revolution. Charlotte had organized apartments to be prepared and ready for the refugee royal family of France to occupy.<ref>[[Antonia Fraser|Fraser, Antonia]]: ''Marie Antoinette: The Journey'', 2001; p. 287.</ref>\nShe was greatly distraught when she heard the news that the King and Queen of France had been executed.\n\n==During the Regency==\nAfter the onset of his permanent madness in 1811, George III was placed under the guardianship of his wife in accordance with the Regency Bill of 1789.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>  \nShe could not bring herself to visit him very often, due to his erratic behaviour and occasional violent reactions. It is believed she did not visit him again after June 1812. However, Charlotte remained supportive of her spouse as his illness, now believed to be [[porphyria]], worsened in old age. While her son, the Prince Regent, wielded the royal power, she was her spouse's legal guardian from 1811 until her death in 1818. Due to the extent of the King's illness he was incapable of knowing or understanding that she had died.<ref>Ayling, pp. 453\u2013455; Brooke, pp. 384\u2013385; Hibbert, p. 405</ref>\n\nDuring the Regency of her son, Queen Charlotte continued to fill her role as first lady in royal representation because of the estrangement of the Prince Regent and his spouse.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/> As such, she functioned as the hostess by the side of her son at official receptions, such as the festivities given in London to celebrate the defeat of Emperor [[Napoleon]] in 1814.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/> She also supervised the upbringing of Charlotte of Wales.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>   \nDuring her last years, she was met with a growing lack of popularity and sometimes subjected to demonstrations.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/> After having attended a reception in London on 29 April 1817, she was jeered by a crowd. She told the crowd that it was upsetting to be treated like that after such long service.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald, Percy 1899\"/>\n\n==Death==\nThe Queen died in the presence of her eldest son, the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]], who was holding her hand as she sat in an armchair at the family's country retreat, [[Kew Palace|Dutch House]] in [[Surrey]] (now known as [[Kew Palace]]).<ref>Fitzgerald, pp. 258\u2013260.</ref> She was buried at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].

The furnishings and fixtures at the royal residence at Frogmore, along with \"live and dead stock...on the estates\", were bequeathed to her daughter Augusta Sophia along with the Frogmore property, unless its maintenance would prove too expensive for her daughter, in which case it was to revert to the Crown.

There are no references to Charlotte in the documentary. The website describes several white European and American individuals and families who had or possibly had non-white ancestors. The majority of the website content was developed by Mario de Valdes y Cocom (also named as Mario Valdes in other articles), a self-described \"historian of the African diaspora.\" Valdes claims that Charlotte had an \"unmistakable African appearance\" and \"negroid physiogomy[''sic'']\" that was the result of distant African ancestry.<ref name=pbs>Mario de Valdes y Cocom, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/royalfamily.html \"The blurred racial lines of famous families \u2013 Queen Charlotte\"], PBS Frontline.</ref> In a 2017 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', journalist DeNeen L.

Valdes also cites as evidence a [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poem]] by Samuel Bowden with the line \"Descended from the warlike [[Vandal]] race, she still preserves that title in her face\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowden |first1=Samuel |title=The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Chronicle |date=September 1761 |page=424}}</ref> with the unconventional interpretation that this allusion is to African ancestry because the Vandals conquered [[Numidia]] in what is present-day [[Algeria]], rather than the simpler interpretation that the [[Vandals]] were a [[Germanic people]] and it alludes to Charlotte being ethnically [[Germans|German]].\n\nAn article in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' from June 1999 is the first published mention of Charlotte's connection to Madragana, referring to her by the name Madalena Gil.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ungoed-Thomas |first1=Jon |last2=Goncalves |first2=Eduardo |title=Revealed: The Queen's Black Ancestors |newspaper=The Sunday Times |date=June 6, 1999}}</ref> This article quotes an explicit claim by Valdes of her \"mixed-race\" ancestry and the authors use the term \"black\" ancestry, though they do not refer to Charlotte as \"mixed-race\" or \"black\". It is well-documented that Charlotte was descended from Margarita de Castro e Souza, a 15th-century Portuguese noblewoman, who traced her ancestry to King [[Afonso III of Portugal]] (1210\u20131279) and one of his [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]], [[Madragana]] (c. 1230\u2013?).<ref name='jeffries'>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/race-monarchy Stuart Jeffries, \"Was this Britain's first black queen?\"] ''The Guardian'', 12 March 2009.</ref>\n\nCritics of Valdes's claim point out that Margarita's and Madragana's distant position in Charlotte's ancestry makes any African ancestry that they may have contributed negligible. There is also no evidence that Madragana was \"black\", and Charlotte shared descent from Afonso III and Madragana with a large proportion of [[Monarchies in Europe|Europe's royalty]] and nobility.<ref name='jeffries'/> The claim of Madragana's African ancestry comes from her being described as a [[Moors|Moor]] by [[Duarte Nunes de Le\u00e3o]], a Portuguese royal chronicler of the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://purl.pt/15305/3/|title=Primeira parte das Chronicas dos reis de Portvgal|website=purl.pt|accessdate=14 September 2019}}</ref> She was probably [[Mozarab]], a modern historical term for Iberian Christians living in Muslim Iberia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/brasesdasalade01braauoft|title=Bras\u00f5es da Sala de Sintra|first=Anselmo|last=Braamcamp Freire|date=14 September 1921|publisher=Coimbra : Imprensa da Universidade|accessdate=14 September 2019|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>Felgueiras Gayo & Carvalhos de Basto, Nobili\u00e1rio das Fam\u00edlias de Portugal, Braga, 1989</ref><ref>Pizarro, Jos\u00e9 Augusto de Sotto Mayor, Linhagens Medievais Portuguesas, 3 vols., Porto, Universidade Moderna, 1999.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.soveral.info/mas/Souza%20do%20Prado.htm|title=Manuel Abranches de Soveral \u2013 Origem dos Souza ditos do Prado|accessdate=14 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Additional claims====\n\nDeNeen Brown claims incorrectly in her 2017 ''Washington Post'' article<ref name=brown/> that \"[[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] described her as 'ill-coloured' and referred to her kin as 'a bunch of ill-coloured orangutans.'\" Scott was instead describing paintings of Charlotte's ancestors that he thought to be comically bad:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=Walter |title=Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott, Volume 4 |date=1901}}</ref>\n\n{{quote\n| text=There are some fine paintings, and some droll ones: among the last are those of divers[''sic''] princes of the House of Mecklenberg-Strelitz, of which Queen Charlotte was descended.

As part of the tourism \"industry\", wealthy sportfishermen seeking [[Atlantic salmon]] flock to the scenic Restigouche Valley every summer.  The region sees extensive annual snowfall.  Alpine and Nordic ski facilities at [[Sugarloaf Provincial Park]] provide winter recreation opportunities for both visitors and local residents.\n\nCampbellton is also a retail and service centre for Restigouche County.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sir Archibald Campbell.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|[[Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet|Sir Archibald Campbell]], the Lieutenant-Governor after whom Campbellton was named]]\nThe area around the site of the present city was settled by [[French people|French]] people circa 1700 with a trading post based upon fishing and [[fur trading]] with the [[Listuguj Mi'gmaq First Nation|Mi'gmaq]]. More settlers arrived here when [[Ile St. Jean]] was lost to the French as the result of the capitulation of [[Louisbourg]] in 1758.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lockerby |first=Earle |title=The Deportation of the Acadians from Ile St.-Jean, 1758 |journal=Acadiensis |volume=XXVII |issue=2 |pages=45\u201394 |date=Spring 1998 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/10844/11665}}, para 47</ref> The area has had numerous names over the centuries: originally called Wisiamkik (muddy spot) by the [[Mi'kmaq]] who inhabited the region, it was then named Pointe-des-Sauvages by the French in 1700 and subsequently Pointe-Rochelle, Cavenik's Point, Kavanagh's Point, Quiton's Point and Martin's Point, before settling in 1833 with its current name in honour of Lieutenant-Governor Sir [[Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet|Archibald Campbell]].<ref name=\"Geographical Names of New Brunswick\">{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Alan|title=Geographical Names of New Brunswick|year=1975|publisher=\u00c9nergie, Mines et Ressources Canada|location=Ottawa, Canada|pages=69}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Restigouche===\n\nIt was here that the [[Battle of the Restigouche]], the final naval battle between the English and French for the possession of North America during the [[Seven Years' War]], was waged in 1760.  It marked a turning point for the settlement.\nRobert Ferguson and the development of Campbellton and Atholville\nowed their development to the enterprising immigrants from Scotland. In 1769, only nine years after the Battle of Restigouche, Scotsman Hugh Baillie and a partner set up a fur and salted salmon business on the site that would become Campbellton. The business was sold to London merchant John Shoolbred, who in 1773 established the first British settlement on the Restigouche. His agent, William Smith, brought over eight Scottish fishermen from Aberdeen, Scotland, to work for him. Two of these fishermen were John Duncan and Robert Adams, who brought their families with them as well. These two fishermen devoted themselves to the salmon fishing industry at Old Church Point, today Atholville. In 1794, a Scotsman from Perth named Alexander Ferguson settled in Martin's Point (Campbellton), where his brother Robert joined him two years later.\n\n[[Image:Campbellton CNR.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Old Intercolonial Railway Station in Campbellton.]]\n\n===From settlement to town===\n\nConsidered the founder of Restigouche County, Robert Ferguson established his control over the development of northern New Brunswick during the first half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ferguson_robert_8E.html |title=Ferguson, Robert |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> In 1803, Ferguson inherited his brother's business and quickly became the largest merchant and exporter of fish in Restigouche. Until the 1840s, he shipped between 1,200 and 1,400 barrels of salted salmon per year. He became the most important landowner in the region. He also operated a flour mill and a sawmill and exported hewn wood. He even constructed his own boats in the village that now bears the name of [[Atholville]]. In 1812, he built an impressive residence there that he named Athol House in memory of [[Atholl|his native region of Scotland]].\n\nIn 1875, the advent of the intercolonial railway, and permanent railway station in 1876, had a strong impact on Campbellton. Its population increased rapidly, reaching 1,800 in 1891,<ref name=\"campbellton.org\">{{cite web |title=Visitors Guide: Historical Evolution of the Settlement|url=http://www.campbellton.org/camp2/Historyofthecity.asp |publisher=City of Campbellton |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}\n</ref> and development of the settlement shifted westward. In 1889, Campbellton was incorporated as a [[town]], and in the late 1880s, an [[hospital|H\u00f4tel Dieu]] was founded by the [[Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph]], an order that established hospitals and schools in many towns in Canada.\n\n===The Great Fire===\n\nOn 11 July 1910, a disastrous fire sparked by a [[sawmill]] on the waterfront destroyed a large portion of the town. The fire was spread throughout the town by flaming shingles. Prior to the fire its population was approaching 4,000 citizens and help came from near and far to provide food and supplies in order to come to their aid. Most of the people had to live in tents while plans to rebuild were being prepared. Campbellton was subsequently rebuilt. In the months and years following the fire, many of the new (now historic) buildings were constructed of brick as Water Street had been designated a \"Fire District\" where all new buildings had to be built with fireproof exterior walls.\n\n===Growth of the City===\n\nFollowing the fire the railway station was moved to Roseberry St. and helped to define Campbellton in its early years. The town was bidding to become the leading commercial center in the North Shore and had three banks, five churches, two schools, 6 hotels and a hospital by the 1920s. At this time Campbellton was seeing upwards of 16 trains a day at the Central Station. In 1928, a pulp mill was built in nearby Atholville which continued to propel the population growth already being experienced. Campbellton was experiencing strong growth as the population grew at a steady rate: 3,817 in 1911, 5,570 in 1921, 6,505 in 1931, 6,714 in 1941, 9,257 in 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyberbart.tripod.com/cton3.htm |title=Page Three of Campbellton's history and pictures |first=Irene |last=Doyle |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> In 1951, Campbellton opened its new arena, the Memorial Gardens, with an exhibition game featuring the [[Montreal Canadiens]].\n\nIn 1958, Campbellton was incorporated as a [[City]] and its population was approaching 13,000. At this time the construction of the [[J.C. Van Horne Bridge|J.C. Van Horne Interprovincial bridge]] commenced which was designed to facilitate travel between Quebec and Northern [[New Brunswick]]. The bridge was completed in 1961 and allowed the cross-river town of [[Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix, Quebec|Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix]] to fully integrate itself commercially with the City of Campbellton. The Salmon Festival was inaugurated in 1967 and has been a popular annual week-long event which is enjoyed by tourists and residents alike. Campbellton's city limits were expanded in 1979 when the Richardsville area became part of the City.\n\n===Esplanade Restigouche===\n\nIn 2009, Mayor [[Bruce MacIntosh]] and Council made significant progress towards restoring the tourism industry in the area and in improving the City's waterfront. They announced that the long-awaited \"Esplanade Restigouche\" development would finally move forward. This is a three phased project, that began in 2011, that will significantly upgrade the already picturesque waterfront and further cement Campbellton's place as a tourist destination.  \nThe Restigouche River Experience Center has been constructed with a Restigouche River Museum and an 86 site RV Park which will help Campbellton in becoming the hub for regional experiential tourism.

The First President of the society was also The First Mayor of Campbellton [[John McAlister]]. To display the history of the city and the battle of the Restigouche, Riverside Park is home to two cannons used in the battle; one with three fleurs-de-lys on the barrel and the other with what appears to be stylized anchors. These are French naval guns from a five gun battery erected during the battle at Battery Point on the Quebec side of the river. When the Busteed family received a land grant at Battery Point, circa 1790, they found at least three cannons at the old battery site. One cannon was built into the fireplace of their home, called Bordeaux House, and two others were given to relatives across the river at Athol House in Atholville. For many years the two cannons outside Athol House were fired on ceremonial occasions. After Athol House burned, the guns lay on the riverbank until donated to the City of Campbellton in 1898. The park also features two monuments donated to the City displaying the names of local soldiers who died in battle during World War I and World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unb.ca/nbmhp/counties/Restigouche.html |title=Restigouche County  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824155528/https://www.unb.ca/nbmhp/counties/Restigouche.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 |website=New Brunswick Military Heritage Project}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Restigouche Gallery]] is local gallery and functions as a centre in the cultural program of the region.

|url=http://archives.gnb.ca/Exhibits/Communities/Details.aspx?culture=en-CA&community=574/ |website=New Brunswick Provincial Archives |title=Campbellton}}</ref>\n\nSituated on the south bank of the [[Restigouche River]] opposite [[Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix, Quebec|Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix]], [[Quebec]], Campbellton was officially incorporated in 1889 and achieved city status in 1958.\n\n[[Forestry]] and tourism are major industries in the regional economy, while a [[pulp mill]] in nearby [[Atholville, New Brunswick|Atholville]] is the largest single employer in the area.  As part of the tourism \"industry\", wealthy sportfishermen seeking [[Atlantic salmon]] flock to the scenic Restigouche Valley every summer.  The region sees extensive annual snowfall.  Alpine and Nordic ski facilities at [[Sugarloaf Provincial Park]] provide winter recreation opportunities for both visitors and local residents.\n\nCampbellton is also a retail and service centre for Restigouche County.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sir Archibald Campbell.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|[[Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet|Sir Archibald Campbell]], the Lieutenant-Governor after whom Campbellton was named.]]\nThe area around the site of the present city was settled by [[French people|French]] people circa 1700 with a trading post based upon fishing and [[fur trading]] with the [[Listuguj Mi'gmaq First Nation|Mi'gmaq]]. More settlers arrived here when [[Ile St. Jean]] was lost to the French as the result of the capitulation of [[Louisbourg]] in 1758.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lockerby |first=Earle |title=The Deportation of the Acadians from Ile St.-Jean, 1758 |journal=Acadiensis |volume=XXVII |issue=2 |pages=45\u201394 |date=Spring 1998 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/10844/11665}}, para 47</ref> The area has had numerous names over the centuries: originally called Wisiamkik (muddy spot) by the [[Mi'kmaq]] who inhabited the region, it was then named Pointe-des-Sauvages by the French in 1700 and subsequently Pointe-Rochelle, Cavenik's Point, Kavanagh's Point, Quiton's Point and Martin's Point, before settling in 1833 with its current name in honour of Lieutenant-Governor Sir [[Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet|Archibald Campbell]].<ref name=\"Geographical Names of New Brunswick\">{{cite book|last=Rayburn|first=Alan|title=Geographical Names of New Brunswick|year=1975|publisher=\u00c9nergie, Mines et Ressources Canada|location=Ottawa, Canada|pages=69}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Restigouche===\n\nIt was here that the [[Battle of the Restigouche]], the final naval battle between the English and French for the possession of North America during the [[Seven Years' War]], was waged in 1760.  It marked a turning point for the settlement.\nRobert Ferguson and the development of Campbellton and Atholville\nowed their development to the enterprising immigrants from Scotland. In 1769, only nine years after the Battle of Restigouche, Scotsman Hugh Baillie and a partner set up a fur and salted salmon business on the site that would become Campbellton. The business was sold to London merchant John Shoolbred, who in 1773 established the first British settlement on the Restigouche. His agent, William Smith, brought over eight Scottish fishermen from Aberdeen, Scotland, to work for him. Two of these fishermen were John Duncan and Robert Adams, who brought their families with them as well. These two fishermen devoted themselves to the salmon fishing industry at Old Church Point, today Atholville. In 1794, a Scotsman from Perth named Alexander Ferguson settled in Martin's Point (Campbellton), where his brother Robert joined him two years later.\n\n[[Image:Campbellton CNR.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Old Intercolonial Railway Station in Campbellton.]]\n\n===From settlement to town===\n\nConsidered the founder of Restigouche County, Robert Ferguson established his control over the development of northern New Brunswick during the first half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ferguson_robert_8E.html |title=Ferguson, Robert |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> In 1803, Ferguson inherited his brother's business and quickly became the largest merchant and exporter of fish in Restigouche. Until the 1840s, he shipped between 1,200 and 1,400 barrels of salted salmon per year. He became the most important landowner in the region. He also operated a flour mill and a sawmill and exported hewn wood. He even constructed his own boats in the village that now bears the name of [[Atholville]]. In 1812, he built an impressive residence there that he named Athol House in memory of [[Atholl|his native region of Scotland]].\n\nIn 1875, the advent of the intercolonial railway, and permanent railway station in 1876, had a strong impact on Campbellton. Its population increased rapidly, reaching 1,800 in 1891,<ref name=\"campbellton.org\">{{cite web |title=Visitors Guide: Historical Evolution of the Settlement|url=http://www.campbellton.org/camp2/Historyofthecity.asp |publisher=City of Campbellton |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}\n</ref> and development of the settlement shifted westward. In 1889, Campbellton was incorporated as a [[town]], and in the late 1880s, an [[hospital|H\u00f4tel Dieu]] was founded by the [[Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph]], an order that established hospitals and schools in many towns in Canada.\n\n===The Great Fire===\n\nOn 11 July 1910, a disastrous fire sparked by a [[sawmill]] on the waterfront destroyed a large portion of the town. The fire was spread throughout the town by flaming shingles. Prior to the fire its population was approaching 4,000 citizens and help came from near and far to provide food and supplies in order to come to their aid. Most of the people had to live in tents while plans to rebuild were being prepared. Campbellton was subsequently rebuilt. In the months and years following the fire, many of the new (now historic) buildings were constructed of brick as Water Street had been designated a \"Fire District\" where all new buildings had to be built with fireproof exterior walls.\n\n===Growth of the City===\n\nFollowing the fire the railway station was moved to Roseberry St. and helped to define Campbellton in its early years. The town was bidding to become the leading commercial center in the North Shore and had three banks, five churches, two schools, 6 hotels and a hospital by the 1920s. At this time Campbellton was seeing upwards of 16 trains a day at the Central Station. In 1928, a pulp mill was built in nearby Atholville which continued to propel the population growth already being experienced. Campbellton was experiencing strong growth as the population grew at a steady rate: 3,817 in 1911, 5,570 in 1921, 6,505 in 1931, 6,714 in 1941, 9,257 in 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyberbart.tripod.com/cton3.htm |title=Page Three of Campbellton's history and pictures |first=Irene |last=Doyle |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> In 1951, Campbellton opened its new arena, the Memorial Gardens, with an exhibition game featuring the [[Montreal Canadiens]].\n\nIn 1958, Campbellton was incorporated as a [[City]] and its population was approaching 13,000. At this time the construction of the [[J.C. Van Horne Bridge|J.C. Van Horne Interprovincial bridge]] commenced which was designed to facilitate travel between Quebec and Northern [[New Brunswick]]. The bridge was completed in 1961 and allowed the cross-river town of [[Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix, Quebec|Pointe-\u00e0-la-Croix]] to fully integrate itself commercially with the City of Campbellton. The Salmon Festival was inaugurated in 1967 and has been a popular annual week-long event which is enjoyed by tourists and residents alike. Campbellton's city limits were expanded in 1979 when the Richardsville area became part of the City.\n\n===Esplanade Restigouche===\n\nIn 2009, Mayor [[Bruce MacIntosh]] and Council made significant progress towards restoring the tourism industry in the area and in improving the City's waterfront. They announced that the long-awaited \"Esplanade Restigouche\" development would finally move forward. This is a three phased project, that began in 2011, that will significantly upgrade the already picturesque waterfront and further cement Campbellton's place as a tourist destination.  \nThe Restigouche River Experience Center has been constructed with a Restigouche River Museum and an 86 site RV Park which will help Campbellton in becoming the hub for regional experiential tourism.   In 2016, the newly elected mayor, Stephanie Anglehart-Paulin and Council have decided to move towards developing the Atlantic Culinary Institute in conjunction with the CCNB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://virtuel.laviron.canoe.ca/doc/hebdo_l-aviron/Aviron_20090501OPT/2009042801/3.html%232 |title=Esplanade Restigouche: Un projet pour developper les berges |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120721230052/http://virtuel.laviron.canoe.ca/doc/hebdo_l-aviron/Aviron_20090501OPT/2009042801/3.html%232 |archivedate=July 21, 2012|language=French |website=laviron.canoe.ca|date=June 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Fire Ship===\n\nThe history of the City of Campbellton is not complete without mentioning the infamous Phantom Ship known as \"[[Fireship of Baie des Chaleurs]]\".<ref name=\"campbellton.org\"/> Stories of its appearance include seeing a burning sailing vessel, sometimes a vessel with all its sails set scudding along the water or sometimes a ball of fire or burning vessel on the water's surface or fading out of sight. This is not frequently seen. Some believe it is a ghost ship from the Battle of the Restigouche whereas others believe it is merely caused by heat waves, reflections or hallucinations.<ref>{{cite web |title=The phantom ship of Chaleur Bay |url=http://new-brunswick.net/new-brunswick/ghoststory/ghost7.html |first=Gail |last=MacMillan |accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCampbellton is 20&nbsp;km upstream (west) from the mouth of the Bay des Chaleurs [[Dalhousie, New Brunswick|Dalhousie]] and approximately 100&nbsp;km northwest of [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]].  The city is approximately 160&nbsp;km northeast of [[Saint-L\u00e9onard, New Brunswick|St. Leonard]] in the [[St. John River (Bay of Fundy)|St. John River]] valley and approximately the same distance from [[Mont-Joli]], Quebec in the [[Saint Lawrence River]] valley. Campbellton was settled by the Scottish including surrounding area like Balmoral, Glencoe, and Glenlevit.\n\n{{wide image|Campbellton - Skyline Full.jpg|1800px|Campbellton Skyline - Eastern portion of the downtown area from the City Center to the Memorial Civic Center.

The First President of the society was also The First Mayor of Campbellton [[John McAlister]]. To display the history of the city and the battle of the Restigouche, Riverside Park is home to two cannons used in the battle; one with three fleurs-de-lys on the barrel and the other with what appears to be stylized anchors. These are French naval guns from a five gun battery erected during the battle at Battery Point on the Quebec side of the river. When the Busteed family received a land grant at Battery Point, circa 1790, they found at least three cannons at the old battery site. One cannon was built into the fireplace of their home, called Bordeaux House, and two others were given to relatives across the river at Athol House in Atholville. For many years the two cannons outside Athol House were fired on ceremonial occasions. After Athol House burned, the guns lay on the riverbank until donated to the City of Campbellton in 1898. The park also features two monuments donated to the City displaying the names of local soldiers who died in battle during World War I and World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unb.ca/nbmhp/counties/Restigouche.html |title=Restigouche County  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824155528/https://www.unb.ca/nbmhp/counties/Restigouche.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 |website=New Brunswick Military Heritage Project}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Restigouche Gallery]] is local gallery and functions as a centre in the cultural program of the region.

These programs, which are offered by public and private not-for-profit institutions, postsecondary vocational institutions, and by for-profit proprietary institutions, should prepare students for [[gainful employment]]. For decades, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) had not established regulations that explicitly outlined what it means for a program to be properly preparing students for gainful employment. As pressing concerns about the quality of programs at for- profit institutions began to arise, the concerns about the level of student loan debt assumed by students did as well. Such issues led to new initiatives and rules to be set in place outlining the parameters for what should be mandated to help ensure gainful employment. The 2011 Senate HELP committee released data showing one in every four students who enroll at a for-profit school default on their loans within three years of leaving, with for-profit students accounting for almost half of all loan defaults.<ref name=\"Sessions, Jennifer 2011\">Sessions, Jennifer. (February 8, 2011). \"Harkin Calls on For-Profit Colleges to End Deceptive Recruiting Practices\". Senate HELP Committee. Accessed February 4, 2013.</ref> Most for-profit colleges charge enrollees much higher tuition rates than analogous programs at community colleges and state public universities despite credits being likely not eligible to be transferred to other institutions.<ref name=\"Sessions, Jennifer 2011\"/> In fact, 96% of students attending for-profit college apply for federal student loans compared to 13% at community colleges. During the 2009\u20132010 school years, for-profit colleges received almost $32 billion in grants and loans provided to students under federal student aid programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gao.gov/products/GAO-12-150 |title=U.S. GAO - For-Profit Schools: Experiences of Undercover Students Enrolled in Online Classes at Selected Colleges |publisher=Gao.gov |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref> This staggering number means nearly all students at for-profit institutions acquire student loan debt, even when they do not earn the end product of a degree or accumulate increased earning power through their studies (Sessions, 2011). These statistics represent a large portion of for- profits, uncovering the serious need for greater accountability in ensuring students are making sound investments in such institutions. According to the [[Government Accountability Office]], enrollment in such institutions has increased faster than traditional higher-education institutions in recent years. With the student and federal interest in such programs growing, so has the concern with their productivity. Regrettably, this is not a simple matter to address, as the issue is multidimensional. For-profit institutions have become an increasingly visible portion of the U.S. higher education sector. For-profits also acquire the largest percentage of their overall revenue from federal student aid programs, highlighting tax dollars are potentially not being used efficiently.<ref>Deming, David. (February 2012). \"The For-Profit Postsecondary School Sector:\nNimble Critters or Agile Predators?\" Center for Analysis Postsecondary education and employment.</ref> Federal regulatory actions by the ED have attempted to address these issues in the Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. These efforts were very contentious. For-profit institutions argue their sector is unfairly targeted and believe the Department of Education over stepped its boundaries in 2010 by implementing regulations specifying requirements for [[Gainful Employment]]. These rules outlined in a report by Congressional Research Service (CRS), aimed to hold for-profits accountable by creating standards which must be upheld and followed, which will in turn attempt create more opportunity for gainful employment amongst enrollees.<ref name=\"SmoleDavid\">Smole, David.

However, the [[Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities]], which endorses for-profits, challenged these regulations in court. On June 30, 2012 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia decided to vacate most aspects of the regulations.<ref name=\"SmoleDavid\" /> The court sustained that the ED had the authority to regulate gainful employment, yet it cited the ED had not provided rationale metrics or measures in the debt measures. At present, only the disclosure requirements of providing prospective students with placements rates, on time graduation rates and other similar information remain.<ref>Smole, David.

Congressional Research Service Database</ref> On March 19, 2013 the judge ruled again in response to the ED's motion to reinstate the reporting requirements in order that it could implement the disclosure requirements of Gainful Employment. The judged denied the motion of the ED on the basis that the reporting requirements would violate the federal ban on the student unit record system. It is strongly debatable that the court's ruling negates the small amount of transparency and accountability mandated by the disclosure requirements, leaving the policy issue of for-profits being accountable for [[Gainful Employment]] unattended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newamerica.net/taxonomy/term/1764 |title=Welcome to nginx! |publisher=Newamerica.net |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref> Some former students claim that for-profit colleges make them feel like they went to the flea market and bought themselves a degree.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6838088n CBS News Video, \"For-Profit Colleges Under Fire\"], September 18, 2010.</ref> According to James G.

These programs, which are offered by public and private not-for-profit institutions, postsecondary vocational institutions, and by for-profit proprietary institutions, should prepare students for [[gainful employment]]. For decades, the [[U.S. Department of Education]] (ED) had not established regulations that explicitly outlined what it means for a program to be properly preparing students for gainful employment. As pressing concerns about the quality of programs at for- profit institutions began to arise, the concerns about the level of student loan debt assumed by students did as well. Such issues led to new initiatives and rules to be set in place outlining the parameters for what should be mandated to help ensure gainful employment. The 2011 Senate HELP committee released data showing one in every four students who enroll at a for-profit school default on their loans within three years of leaving, with for-profit students accounting for almost half of all loan defaults.<ref name=\"Sessions, Jennifer 2011\">Sessions, Jennifer. (February 8, 2011). \"Harkin Calls on For-Profit Colleges to End Deceptive Recruiting Practices\". Senate HELP Committee. Accessed February 4, 2013.</ref> Most for-profit colleges charge enrollees much higher tuition rates than analogous programs at community colleges and state public universities despite credits being likely not eligible to be transferred to other institutions.<ref name=\"Sessions, Jennifer 2011\"/> In fact, 96% of students attending for-profit college apply for federal student loans compared to 13% at community colleges. During the 2009\u20132010 school years, for-profit colleges received almost $32 billion in grants and loans provided to students under federal student aid programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gao.gov/products/GAO-12-150 |title=U.S. GAO - For-Profit Schools: Experiences of Undercover Students Enrolled in Online Classes at Selected Colleges |publisher=Gao.gov |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref> This staggering number means nearly all students at for-profit institutions acquire student loan debt, even when they do not earn the end product of a degree or accumulate increased earning power through their studies (Sessions, 2011). These statistics represent a large portion of for- profits, uncovering the serious need for greater accountability in ensuring students are making sound investments in such institutions. According to the [[Government Accountability Office]], enrollment in such institutions has increased faster than traditional higher-education institutions in recent years. With the student and federal interest in such programs growing, so has the concern with their productivity. Regrettably, this is not a simple matter to address, as the issue is multidimensional. For-profit institutions have become an increasingly visible portion of the U.S. higher education sector. For-profits also acquire the largest percentage of their overall revenue from federal student aid programs, highlighting tax dollars are potentially not being used efficiently.<ref>Deming, David. (February 2012). \"The For-Profit Postsecondary School Sector:\nNimble Critters or Agile Predators?\" Center for Analysis Postsecondary education and employment.</ref> Federal regulatory actions by the ED have attempted to address these issues in the Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. These efforts were very contentious. For-profit institutions argue their sector is unfairly targeted and believe the Department of Education over stepped its boundaries in 2010 by implementing regulations specifying requirements for [[Gainful Employment]]. These rules outlined in a report by Congressional Research Service (CRS), aimed to hold for-profits accountable by creating standards which must be upheld and followed, which will in turn attempt create more opportunity for gainful employment amongst enrollees.<ref name=\"SmoleDavid\">Smole, David.

However, the [[Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities]], which endorses for-profits, challenged these regulations in court. On June 30, 2012 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia decided to vacate most aspects of the regulations.<ref name=\"SmoleDavid\" /> The court sustained that the ED had the authority to regulate gainful employment, yet it cited the ED had not provided rationale metrics or measures in the debt measures. At present, only the disclosure requirements of providing prospective students with placements rates, on time graduation rates and other similar information remain.<ref>Smole, David. (January 23, 2013). \"Department of Education Final Rules for Postsecondary Education Programs That Prepare Students for Gainful Employment in a Recognized Occupation\". Accessed February 4, 2013. Congressional Research Service Database</ref> On March 19, 2013 the judge ruled again in response to the ED's motion to reinstate the reporting requirements in order that it could implement the disclosure requirements of Gainful Employment. The judged denied the motion of the ED on the basis that the reporting requirements would violate the federal ban on the student unit record system. It is strongly debatable that the court's ruling negates the small amount of transparency and accountability mandated by the disclosure requirements, leaving the policy issue of for-profits being accountable for [[Gainful Employment]] unattended.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newamerica.net/taxonomy/term/1764 |title=Welcome to nginx! |publisher=Newamerica.net |date= |accessdate=July 4, 2015}}</ref> Some former students claim that for-profit colleges make them feel like they went to the flea market and bought themselves a degree.<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6838088n CBS News Video, \"For-Profit Colleges Under Fire\"], September 18, 2010.</ref> According to James G.
