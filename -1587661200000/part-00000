A [[Madison County, Missouri|Madision County]], [[Missouri]] native and self-described \"Union Man\", he served during the [[American Civil War]]. In August 1861, Henry traveled to Camp Blood in [[Pilot Knob, Missouri|Pilot Knob]], Missouri and enlisted for 3 years in the [[6th Missouri Volunteer Infantry|6th Missouri Infantry]].\n\n==Biography==\nTwo months into his service with the Missouri Infantry he contracted the [[measles]], [[Bronchitis]] and sore eyes and was sent to a hospital in [[Tipton]], [[Missouri]]. After treatment and recovery, he later rejoined his unit and fought with them at the [[Battle of Vicksburg]] in [[Mississippi]]. While there Frizzell joined a fighting group of only unmarried volunteers. This group, called [[Forlorn Hope]], was so named because they were not expected to return. This unit was to storm \"Fort Hill\" as Frizzell described it. This \"fort\" was actually a patchwork of several well-protected forts and entrenchments, which housed a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] garrison of more than 20,000 men. On May 22, 1863, the brave men of Forlorn Hope attacked Fort Hill. At the end of the [[battle]] 85% of this [[Military volunteer|volunteer]] storming party were either killed or badly wounded.  Frizzell was one of the wounded that day, suffering a gunshot to the head, breaking the bone by his right eye and losing a portion of his right ear. For his actions on that date he would later receive the [[Medal of Honor]].  To this day, he is the only Medal of Honor recipient from Madison County and one of only 77 from Missouri.\n\nFrizzell was captured by the Confederacy that day. A week later he was released by the Confederacy in a prisoner exchange and spent the next two months in a hospital in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]].  Later in 1863, his unit joined the ranks of [[General officer|General]] [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and fought in the [[Battle of Lookout Mountain]] near Chattanooga.  After re-enlisting in January 1864, Frizzell and the 6th Missouri infantry joined General Sherman on his march through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Frizzell was shot in the left knee on May 14, 1864, at the [[Battle of Resaca]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He continued fighting until [[Lynch Creek]], [[North Carolina]], where the Confederates again captured him on March 1, 1865. After escaping, he heard the war was over and, in his own words, \"he started working his way back to Madison County as best he could.\"\n\nFrizzell made it back to Madison County, eventually getting married and having children.

Benefits may include the publication of research outputs, learning opportunities, personal enjoyment, social benefits, satisfaction through contributing to scientific evidence e.g. to address local, national and international issues, and through that, the potential to influence policy.\n# Citizen scientists may, if they wish, participate in multiple stages of the scientific process. This may include developing the research question, designing the method, gathering and analysing data, and communicating the results.\n# Citizen scientists receive feedback from the project. For example, how their data are being used and what the research, policy or societal outcomes are.\n# Citizen science is considered a research approach like any other, with limitations and biases that should be considered and controlled for. However unlike traditional research approaches, citizen science provides opportunity for greater public engagement and democratisation of science.\n# Citizen science project data and meta-data are made publicly available and where possible, results are published in an open access format.

Because the members come from different areas of the island, the collection of data could serve as an animal distribution map of the island. According to the geographical data and pictures of dead animals collected by the members, the community itself and the sponsor the Endemic Species Center could find out the hotspots and the reasons of animals\u2019 death. One of the most renowned case is that the community successfully detected rabies cases due to the massively collected data and the corpse of Melogale moschata have been accumulated for years and alarmed the government authority to take actions to prevent the prevalence of rabies in Taiwan immediately. Another case in 2014 that some citizen scientists discovered birds that died from unknown causes near an agricultural area, then Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network cooperated with National Pingtung University of Science and Technology and engaged citizen scientists to collect bird carcass. The volunteers collected 250 bird corpses for laboratory tests, which con\ufb01rmed that the bird deaths were attributable to the pesticides used on crops. This prompted the Taiwanese government to restrict pesticides, and the Bill of Pesticide Management amendment, establishing a pesticide control system, was passed after the third reading in the Legislative Yuan. The results indicated that Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network developed a set of shared working methods and jointly completed certain actions. Furthermore, the community of Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network have made real changes on road resign to avoid roadkill, improved the management of usage of pesticide, epidemic prevention, and so on.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Chia-Hsuan|last2=Lin|first2=Te-En|last3=Fang|first3=Wei-Ta|last4=Liu|first4=Chi-Chang|date=2018-10-10|title=Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network: An Example of a Community of Practice Contributing to Taiwanese Environmental Literacy for Sustainability|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328208270|journal=Sustainability|volume=10|issue=10|pages=3610|doi=10.3390/su10103610}}</ref>\n*The AirBox Project was launched in Taiwan to create a participatory ecosystem with a focus on PM2.5 monitoring with AirBox devices. At the end of 2014, the public paid more attention to the PM2.5 level because the air pollution problem became worse, especially in central and southern Taiwan. High PM2.5 level is harmful to our health, such as respiratory problems, so it aroused public concerns and led to an intensive debate about air pollution sources. Some experts indicated that the air quality was affected by pollutants from Mainland China, while some environmentalists believed that it is the result of industrialization such as exhaust fumes from local power plants or factories; however, no one knew the answer because of insufficient data. Dr. Ling-Jyh Chen, a researcher of the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, launched The AirBox Project. His original idea is inspired by a popular Taiwanese slogan Save Your Environment by Yourself. As an expert in Participatory Sensing System, he decided to take this bottom-up approach to collect PM2.5 level data, and through open data and data analysis to have a better understanding of the possible air pollution source. In this ecosystem, massive data was collected from the AirBox device. Data was instantly revealed online to inform people of PM2.5 level so that they take proper action, such as wearing a mask or staying at home, to prevent themselves from directly exploring to polluted environment. Data could be also analyzed to understand the possible sources of pollution and provide recommendations for improving the situation. To be precise, there are four main steps in this project. '''I)''' Develop the AirBox device. Developing a device that could correctly collect the data of the PM2.5 level was time-consuming. It took more than three years to develop AirBox that can be easily used, but with both high accuracy and low cost. '''II)''' Broad installation of AirBox. In the beginning, very few people were willing to install it at their homes because of their concerns about the possible harm to their health, power-consuming problem and maintenances of it, so that AirBoxs were only installed in a relatively small area. Thanks to the help from Taiwan's LASS (Location Aware Sensing System) community, AirBox appeared in all parts of Taiwan. As of February 2017, there are more than 1,600 Air Boxes installed in more than 27 countries. '''III)''' Open Source and Data Analysis. All measurement results were released and visualized in real-time to the public through different media, such as [https://pm25.lass-net.org/ their website] and [https://www.facebook.com/groups/pm25opendata/ Facebook page]. Data can be analyzed to trace pollution sources.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://research.sinica.edu.tw/pm25-air-box/|title=\u7a7a\u6c23\u76d2\u5b50\u63a8\u624b\uff1a\u7a7a\u6c23\u8b8a\u9ad2\u4e86\uff0c\u96e3\u9053\u6c92\u6709\u8fa6\u6cd5\u55ce\uff1f\u2502\u7814\u4e4b\u6709\u7269 - \u4e2d\u592e\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u8cc7\u6599\u79d1\u5b78\u7814\u7a76|date=2017-02-16|language=zh-TW|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n*Japan has a long history of citizen science involvement, the 1,200-year-old tradition of collecting records on [[cherry blossom]] flowering probably being the world's longest-running citizen science project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technology.org/2015/03/25/cherry-blossom-season-emperors-sake-and-citizen-science/|title=Cherry blossom season, Emperor's sake and Citizen Science|date=25 March 2015|website=Technology Org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> One of the most influential citizen science projects has also come out of Japan: [[Safecast (organization)|Safecast]].

Because the members come from different areas of the island, the collection of data could serve as an animal distribution map of the island. According to the geographical data and pictures of dead animals collected by the members, the community itself and the sponsor the Endemic Species Center could find out the hotspots and the reasons of animals\u2019 death. One of the most renowned case is that the community successfully detected rabies cases due to the massively collected data and the corpse of Melogale moschata have been accumulated for years and alarmed the government authority to take actions to prevent the prevalence of rabies in Taiwan immediately. Another case in 2014 that some citizen scientists discovered birds that died from unknown causes near an agricultural area, then Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network cooperated with National Pingtung University of Science and Technology and engaged citizen scientists to collect bird carcass. The volunteers collected 250 bird corpses for laboratory tests, which con\ufb01rmed that the bird deaths were attributable to the pesticides used on crops. This prompted the Taiwanese government to restrict pesticides, and the Bill of Pesticide Management amendment, establishing a pesticide control system, was passed after the third reading in the Legislative Yuan. The results indicated that Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network developed a set of shared working methods and jointly completed certain actions. Furthermore, the community of Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network have made real changes on road resign to avoid roadkill, improved the management of usage of pesticide, epidemic prevention, and so on.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Chia-Hsuan|last2=Lin|first2=Te-En|last3=Fang|first3=Wei-Ta|last4=Liu|first4=Chi-Chang|date=2018-10-10|title=Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network: An Example of a Community of Practice Contributing to Taiwanese Environmental Literacy for Sustainability|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328208270|journal=Sustainability|volume=10|issue=10|pages=3610|doi=10.3390/su10103610}}</ref>\n*The AirBox Project was launched in Taiwan to create a participatory ecosystem with a focus on PM2.5 monitoring with AirBox devices. At the end of 2014, the public paid more attention to the PM2.5 level because the air pollution problem became worse, especially in central and southern Taiwan. High PM2.5 level is harmful to our health, such as respiratory problems, so it aroused public concerns and led to an intensive debate about air pollution sources. Some experts indicated that the air quality was affected by pollutants from Mainland China, while some environmentalists believed that it is the result of industrialization such as exhaust fumes from local power plants or factories; however, no one knew the answer because of insufficient data. Dr. Ling-Jyh Chen, a researcher of the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, launched The AirBox Project. His original idea is inspired by a popular Taiwanese slogan Save Your Environment by Yourself. As an expert in Participatory Sensing System, he decided to take this bottom-up approach to collect PM2.5 level data, and through open data and data analysis to have a better understanding of the possible air pollution source. In this ecosystem, massive data was collected from the AirBox device. Data was instantly revealed online to inform people of PM2.5 level so that they take proper action, such as wearing a mask or staying at home, to prevent themselves from directly exploring to polluted environment. Data could be also analyzed to understand the possible sources of pollution and provide recommendations for improving the situation. To be precise, there are four main steps in this project. '''I)''' Develop the AirBox device. Developing a device that could correctly collect the data of the PM2.5 level was time-consuming. It took more than three years to develop AirBox that can be easily used, but with both high accuracy and low cost. '''II)''' Broad installation of AirBox. In the beginning, very few people were willing to install it at their homes because of their concerns about the possible harm to their health, power-consuming problem and maintenances of it, so that AirBoxs were only installed in a relatively small area. Thanks to the help from Taiwan's LASS (Location Aware Sensing System) community, AirBox appeared in all parts of Taiwan. As of February 2017, there are more than 1,600 Air Boxes installed in more than 27 countries. '''III)''' Open Source and Data Analysis. All measurement results were released and visualized in real-time to the public through different media, such as [https://pm25.lass-net.org/ their website] and [https://www.facebook.com/groups/pm25opendata/ Facebook page]. Data can be analyzed to trace pollution sources.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://research.sinica.edu.tw/pm25-air-box/|title=\u7a7a\u6c23\u76d2\u5b50\u63a8\u624b\uff1a\u7a7a\u6c23\u8b8a\u9ad2\u4e86\uff0c\u96e3\u9053\u6c92\u6709\u8fa6\u6cd5\u55ce\uff1f\u2502\u7814\u4e4b\u6709\u7269 - \u4e2d\u592e\u7814\u7a76\u9662\u8cc7\u6599\u79d1\u5b78\u7814\u7a76|date=2017-02-16|language=zh-TW|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n*Japan has a long history of citizen science involvement, the 1,200-year-old tradition of collecting records on [[cherry blossom]] flowering probably being the world's longest-running citizen science project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.technology.org/2015/03/25/cherry-blossom-season-emperors-sake-and-citizen-science/|title=Cherry blossom season, Emperor's sake and Citizen Science|date=25 March 2015|website=Technology Org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> One of the most influential citizen science projects has also come out of Japan: [[Safecast (organization)|Safecast]].

is an American lawyer and politician, who has served as the [[List of Governors of Washington|governor of Washington]] since 2013. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1993 to 1995 and from 1999 to 2012 and was a [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate from March 1, 2019 to August 21, 2019 for [[2020 United States presidential election|the 2020 election]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Seattle]], Inslee graduated from the [[University of Washington]] and [[Willamette University College of Law]]. He served in the [[Washington House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1993. In 1992, Inslee was elected to represent {{ushr|WA|4}}, based around [[Central Washington]], in the U.S. House of Representatives. Defeated for reelection in [[1994 United States House of Representatives elections|1994]], Inslee briefly returned to private legal practice. He made his first run for governor of Washington in [[1996 Washington gubernatorial election|1996]], coming in fifth in the [[blanket primary]] ahead of the general election, which was won by Democrat [[Gary Locke]]. Inslee then served as regional director for the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] under President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\nInslee returned to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1999, this time for {{ushr|WA|1|}}. The new district included Seattle's northern suburbs in [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Snohomish County, Washington|Snohomish County]], and [[Kitsap County, Washington|Kitsap County]]. He was reelected six times before announcing that he would make another run for the governorship in the [[2012 Washington gubernatorial election|2012 election]]. He resigned from Congress to focus on his campaign. He defeated Republican [[Rob McKenna]], the [[List of Attorneys General of Washington|Attorney General of Washington]]. Inslee was reelected to a second term in [[2016 Washington gubernatorial election|2016]], defeating Republican [[Port of Seattle|Seattle Port Commissioner]] [[Bill Bryant (politician)|Bill Bryant]], 54% to 46%. Inslee served as chair of the [[Democratic Governors Association]] for the [[2018 United States gubernatorial elections|2018 election cycle]].\n\nAs governor, Inslee has emphasized [[climate change]], [[Education in the United States|education]] and [[drug policy reform]]. He has garnered national attention for his critiques of President [[Donald Trump]]. Inslee, State Attorney General [[Bob Ferguson (politician)|Bob Ferguson]] and State Solicitor General [[Noah Purcell]] sued the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump Administration]] over [[Executive Order 13769]], which halted travel for 90 days from seven Muslim-majority countries and imposed a total ban on Syrian refugees entering the United States. The case, ''[[Washington v. Trump]]'', led to the order being blocked by the courts, and other executive orders later superseded it.\n\nInslee [[Jay Inslee 2020 presidential campaign|was a candidate]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic nomination]] for President of the United States in the 2020 election, launching his campaign on March 1, 2019. He suspended his campaign on August 21, citing extremely low poll numbers. The next day, Inslee announced his intention to seek a third term as governor in [[2020 Washington gubernatorial election|the 2020 election]].and if he is re-elected it will mean the downfall of most of Washington state. He doesn't represent his state, he only rules it despite what his constituents desire or request.\n\n==Early life, education, and legal career==\nJay Robert Inslee was born February 9, 1951 in Seattle, Washington, the oldest of three sons of Adele A.
