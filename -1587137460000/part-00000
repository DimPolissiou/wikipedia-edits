The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure.

They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching.

Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles,<ref>[[Stanley Malamed|Malamed, Stanley]] (2004). ''Handbook of Local Anesthesia'', 5th Edition.

Conversely, stainless steel is used in fuel cells that do the opposite, react hydrogen with oxygen to produce water and electrical energy.\n\n===Culinary===\n\nStainless steel is often preferred for [[sink|kitchen sinks]] because of its ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, [[acoustic noise]] is controlled by applying [[Sound dampening|resilient undercoating]] to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as [[kitchen appliance|appliances]] and [[Kitchen|backsplashes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Cookware and bakeware]] may be clad in stainless steels, to enhance their cleanability and durability, and to permit their use in [[induction cooking]] (this requires a [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]] grade of stainless steel, such as 432). Because stainless steel is a poor conductor of heat, it is often used as a thin surface cladding over a core of copper or aluminium, which conduct heat more readily.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCutlery is normally stainless steel,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QzJDRxLLxNIC&pg=PA240&dq=Cutlery+is+normally+stainless+steel#v=onepage&q=Cutlery%20is%20normally%20stainless%20steel&f=false|title=Stainless Steels for Design Engineers|last=McGuire|first=Michael F.|date=2008|publisher=ASM International|isbn=9781615030590|language=en}}</ref> for low corrosion, ease of cleaning, negligible toxicity, as well as not flavoring the food by<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catra.org/pages/products/sharpening/careof.htm|title=care of cutlery|website=www.catra.org|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> [[Standard electrode potential|electrolytic activity]].\n\n===Jewelry===\n\nStainless steel is used for jewelry and watches, with 316L being the type commonly used for such applications.

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

As this is an average, countries that have low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in their electricity production (such as France with nuclear energy) will have lower figures.  Ferritics without Ni will have a lower CO<sub>2</sub> footprint than austenitics with 8% Ni or more.\n\nCarbon footprint must not be the only factor for deciding the choice of materials:\n* over any product life,  maintenance, repairs (when possible) or early end of life (planned obsolescence) can increase the overall footprint way beyond the difference between materials only.  In addition loss of service (typically for bridges) may induce large hidden costs (queues, wasted fuel, loss of man-hours;)\n* how much material is used to provide a given service varies with the performance, particularly the strength level, which allows lighter structures and components.\n\nStainless steel is 100% [[recyclable]].<ref>{{citation |author= Johnson, J., Reck, B.K., Wang, T., Graede, T.E. |title=The energy benefit of stainless steel recycling |year=2008 |journal=Energy Policy\n|volume=36 |pages=181\u2013192 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.08.028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingStainlessSteel.aspx|title=Recycling Stainless Steel|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingofNickelcontainingalloys.aspx|title=Recycling of Nickel-containing Alloys|website=Nickel Instiitute}}</ref> An average stainless steel object is composed of about 60% recycled material of which approximately 40% originates from end-of-life products and about 60% comes from manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110127075255/http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 27 January 2011\n |title      = The Recycling of Stainless Steel (\"Recycled Content\" and \"Input Composition\" slides)\n |accessdate = 19 November 2006\n |year       = 2006\n |format     = Flash\n |publisher  = International Stainless Steel Forum\n}}</ref> What prevents a higher recycling content is the availability of stainless steel scrap, in spite of a very high recycling rate. According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching.

Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature. Thus Type 304 SS is rarely used in contact with sulfuric acid.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

It only absorbs a small amount of carbon because of its cubic crystalline structure, which consists of one iron in each corner and a central iron atom; the central atom is what gives it magnetic properties. \n\nGrades with low coercitive field Hc have been developed for electrovalves used in household appliances  and for injection systems in internal combustion engines\n\nAnnealed [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] stainless steels are usually [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Values for some common materials|non-magnetic]].   \n\nSome applications require non-magnetic materials, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Magnetic permeability of some austenitic  stainless steel grades after annealing 2 hours at 1050{{nbsp}}\u00b0C<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fofanov|first=D.|url=|title=Magnetic properties of Stainless Steels: applications, opportunities and new developments|date=29 Nov 2011|work=Stainless steel World Conference|access-date=|last2=Riedner|first2=S.}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse together. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/ReviewofWearandGallingCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9006_.ashx |title=Review of the Wear and Galling Characteristics of Stainless Steels |last=Committee of Stainless Steel Producers.

Additionally, threaded joints may be [[Lubrication|lubricated]] to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Also, [[Nitronic]] 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Standard finishes==\n{{Main|Brushed metal}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

For example, duplex stainless steels are being used in [[Kraft process|digesters]] to convert wood chips into wood pulp. 6% Mo superaustenitics are used in the [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleach plant]] and Type 316 is used extensively in the [[paper machine]].\n\n===Chemical processing and petrochemical===\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in these industries for their corrosion resistance to both aqueous, gaseous and high temperature environments, their mechanical properties at all temperatures from cryogenic to the very high, and occasionally for other special physical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelsforChemicalProcessEquipment_14038_.ashx|title=Stainless Steels for Chemical Process Equipment|last=G.

Stainless steels do not affect the taste of the product, they are easily cleaned and sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination of the food, and they are durable.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in cookware, commercial food processing, commercial kitchens, brewing beer, wine making, and meat processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/FoodAndBeverage/WhyStainless.aspx|title=Food & Beverage Industry|last=Nickel Institute|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nAcidic foods with high salt additions, such as tomato sauce, and highly salted condiments, such as soya sauce may require higher alloyed stainless steels such as 6% Mo superaustenitics to prevent pitting corrosion by chloride.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n;  Automobiles\n{{See also|Braided stainless steel brake lines}}\nThe [[Allegheny Technologies|Allegheny Ludlum Corporation]] worked with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] on various [[concept car]]s with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s to demonstrate the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles,<ref>[[Stanley Malamed|Malamed, Stanley]] (2004). ''Handbook of Local Anesthesia'', 5th Edition.

Conversely, stainless steel is used in fuel cells that do the opposite, react hydrogen with oxygen to produce water and electrical energy.\n\n===Culinary===\n\nStainless steel is often preferred for [[sink|kitchen sinks]] because of its ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, [[acoustic noise]] is controlled by applying [[Sound dampening|resilient undercoating]] to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as [[kitchen appliance|appliances]] and [[Kitchen|backsplashes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Cookware and bakeware]] may be clad in stainless steels, to enhance their cleanability and durability, and to permit their use in [[induction cooking]] (this requires a [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]] grade of stainless steel, such as 432).

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

In the United States, diesel\u2013electric propulsion was brought to high-speed mainline passenger service in late 1934, largely through the research and development efforts of [[General Motors]] dating back to the late 1920s and advances in lightweight car body design by the [[Budd Company]].\n\nThe economic recovery from [[World War II]] caused the widespread adoption of diesel locomotives in many countries. They offered greater flexibility and performance than [[steam locomotive]]s, as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs.

The response to this law was to electrify high-traffic rail lines. However, electrification was uneconomical to apply to lower-traffic areas.\n\nThe first regular use of diesel\u2013electric locomotives was in [[Switcher|switching]] (shunter) applications, which were more forgiving than mainline applications of the limitations of contemporary diesel technology and where the idling economy of diesel relative to steam would be most beneficial.  GE entered a collaboration with the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO) and [[Ingersoll-Rand]] (the \"AGEIR\" consortium) in 1924 to produce a prototype {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \"boxcab\" locomotive delivered in July 1925. This locomotive demonstrated that the diesel\u2013electric power unit could provide many of the benefits of an [[electric locomotive]] without the railroad having to bear the sizeable expense of electrification.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=25-27}} The unit successfully demonstrated, in switching and local freight and passenger service, on ten railroads and three industrial lines.<ref>Evolution of the American Diesel Locomotive, J Parker Lamb 2007, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-253-34863-0}}, p.29</ref>  Westinghouse Electric and Baldwin collaborated to build switching locomotives starting in 1929.  However, the [[Great Depression]] curtailed demand for Westinghouse's electrical equipment, and they stopped building locomotives internally, opting to supply electrical parts instead.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=28-30}}\n\nIn June 1925, [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] outshopped a prototype diesel\u2013electric locomotive for \"special uses\" (such as for runs where water for steam locomotives was scarce) using electrical equipment from [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Company]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Railroads To Try Diesel Locomotive |newspaper=Special to the New York Times |date=February 18, 1925 |page=1}}</ref> Its twin-engine design was not successful, and the unit was scrapped after a short testing and demonstration period.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=283}} Industry sources were beginning to suggest \u201cthe outstanding advantages of this new form of motive power\u201d.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=27}}  In 1929, the [[Canadian National Railways]] became the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service with two units, 9000 and 9001, from Westinghouse.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=409}}  However, these early diesels proved expensive and unreliable, with their high cost of acquisition relative to steam unable to be realized in operating cost savings as they were frequently out of service.  It would be another five years before diesel\u2013electric propulsion would be successfully used in mainline service, and nearly ten years before it would show real potential to fully replace steam.\n\nBefore diesel power could make inroads into mainline service, the limitations of diesel engines circa 1930&nbsp;\u2013 low power-to-weight ratios and narrow output range&nbsp;\u2013 had to be overcome.  A major effort to overcome those limitations was launched by [[General Motors]] after they moved into the diesel field with their acquisition of the [[Winton Engine Company]], a major manufacturer of diesel engines for marine and stationary applications, in 1930. Supported by the General Motors Research Division, GM's [[Cleveland Diesel Engine Division|Winton Engine Corporation]] sought to develop diesel engines suitable for high-speed mobile use.  The first milestone in that effort was delivery in early 1934 of the Winton 201A, a [[two-stroke]], [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots-supercharged]], [[Uniflow scavenging|uniflow-scavenged]], [[Unit injector|unit-injected]] [[diesel engine]] that could deliver the required performance for a fast, lightweight passenger train.  The second milestone, and the one that got American railroads moving towards diesel, was the 1938 delivery of GM's  [[EMD 567|Model 567]] engine that was designed specifically for locomotive use, bringing a fivefold increase in life of some mechanical parts and showing its potential for meeting the rigors of freight service.<ref name=Kettering>{{cite conference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuUiAQAAMAAJ|title=History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine |author=Kettering, E.W. |date={{date|1951-11-29|dmy}} |publisher=Electro-Motive Division, General Motors Corporation |conference=ASME 1951 Annual Meeting |location=Atlantic City, New Jersey}}</ref>\n\nDiesel\u2013electric railroad locomotion entered  mainline service when the [[Burlington Railroad]] and [[Union Pacific]] used custom-built diesel \"[[streamliner]]s\" to haul passengers, starting in late 1934.<ref name=\"Stover 212\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=79oDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA165&dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=RasMTuyGFYifsQLC3sGzCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Diesel Streamliners Now Link Coast-to-Coast\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1937</ref> Burlington's ''[[Burlington Zephyr|Zephyr]]'' trainsets evolved from articulated three-car sets with 600&nbsp;hp power cars in 1934 and early 1935, to the ''Denver Zephyr'' semi-articulated ten car trainsets pulled by cab-booster power sets introduced in late 1936.

The Burlington and Union Pacific streamliners were built by the [[Budd Company]] and the [[Pullman-Standard|Pullman-Standard Company]], respectively, using the new Winton engines and power train systems designed by GM's [[Electro-Motive Corporation]].  EMC's experimental [[EMC 1800 hp B-B|1800 hp B-B]] locomotives of 1935 demonstrated the multiple-unit control systems used for the cab/booster sets and the twin-engine format used with the later ''Zephyr'' power units.  Both of those features would be used in EMC's later production model locomotives.  The lightweight diesel streamliners of the mid-1930s demonstrated the advantages of diesel for passenger service with breakthrough schedule times, but diesel locomotive power would not fully come of age until regular series production of mainline diesel locomotives commenced and it was shown suitable for full-size passenger and freight service.\n\n====First American series production locomotives====\nFollowing their 1925 prototype, the AGEIR consortium produced 25 more units of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \"60 ton\" [[ALCO boxcab|AGEIR boxcab]] [[switcher|switching locomotives]] between 1925 and 1928 for several New York City railroads, making them the first series-produced diesel locomotives.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=209\u2013211}}  The consortium also produced seven twin-engine \"100 ton\" boxcabs and one hybrid trolley/battery unit with a diesel-driven charging circuit.  ALCO acquired the [[McIntosh & Seymour]] Engine Company in 1929 and entered series production of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} single-cab switcher units in 1931.  ALCO would be the pre-eminent builder of switch engines through the mid-1930s and would adapt the basic switcher design to produce versatile and highly successful, albeit relatively low powered, road locomotives.\n\nGM, seeing the success of the custom streamliners, sought to expand the market for diesel power by producing standardized locomotives under their [[Electro-Motive Corporation]]. In 1936, EMC's new factory started production of switch engines.  In 1937, the factory started producing their new [[EMD E-unit|E series]] streamlined passenger locomotives, which would be upgraded with more reliable purpose-built engines in 1938.  Seeing the performance and reliability of the new [[EMD 567|567 model]] engine in passenger locomotives, EMC was eager to demonstrate diesel's viability in freight service.\n\nFollowing the successful 1939 tour of [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMC's]] [[EMD FT|FT]] demonstrator freight locomotive set, the stage was set for dieselization of American railroads.  In 1941, [[ALCO-GE]] introduced the [[ALCO RS-1|RS-1]] road-switcher that occupied its own market niche while EMD's [[EMD F-unit|F series]] locomotives were sought for mainline freight service.  The US entry into World War II slowed conversion to diesel; the War Production Board put a halt to building new passenger equipment and gave naval uses priority for diesel engine production.  During the [[Big Inch|petroleum crisis of 1942-43]], coal-fired steam had the advantage of not using fuel that was in critically short supply.   EMD was later allowed to increase the production of its FT locomotives and ALCO-GE was allowed to produce a limited number of [[DL-109]] road locomotives, but most in the locomotive business were restricted to making switch engines and steam locomotives.\n\nIn the early postwar era, EMD dominated the market for mainline locomotives with their E and F series locomotives.  ALCO-GE in the late 1940s produced switchers and road-switchers that were successful in the short-haul market.  However, EMD launched their [[EMD GP7|GP series]] road-switcher locomotives in 1949, which displaced all other locomotives in the freight market including their own F series locomotives.  GE subsequently dissolved its partnership with ALCO and would emerge as EMD's main competitor in the early 1960s, eventually taking the top position in the locomotive market from EMD.\n\nEarly diesel\u2013electric locomotives in the United States used direct current (DC) traction motors, but alternating current (AC) motors came into widespread use in the 1990s, starting with the [[EMD SD70 series|Electro-Motive SD70MAC]] in 1993 and followed by the [[GE AC4400CW|General Electric's AC4400CW]] in 1994 and [[GE AC6000CW|AC6000CW]] in 1995.<ref>Solomon, Brian, ''Locomotive'', 2001, pp 120, 130</ref>\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Europe===\n====First functional diesel vehicles====\n[[File:Limousin2010RVT01.jpg|thumb|[[Switzerland|Swiss]] & [[Germany|German]] co-production: world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcar 1914]]\nIn 1914, world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcars were produced for the ''K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsische Staatseisenbahnen'' ([[Royal Saxon State Railways]]) by [[Waggonfabrik Rastatt]] with electric equipment from [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] and diesel engines from [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer AG]]. They were classified as [[Saxon DET 1-2|DET 1 and DET 2]] ({{Interlanguage link|de.wiki|de|S\u00e4chsischer DET 1\u20132|vertical-align=sup}}). Due to shortage of petrol products during [[World War I]], they remained unused for regular service in Germany. In 1922, they were sold to Swiss [[Compagnie du Chemin de fer R\u00e9gional du Val-de-Travers]] ({{Interlanguage link|fr.wiki|fr|R\u00e9gional du Val-de-Travers|vertical-align=sup}}), where they were used in regular service up to the [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] of the line in 1944. Afterwards, the company kept them in service as boosters till 1965.\n\n[[Fiat]] claims a first Italian diesel\u2013electric locomotive built in 1922, but little detail is available.  A Fiat-TIBB diesel\u2013locomotive \"A\", of 440CV, is reported to have entered service on the Ferrovie Calabro Lucane in southern Italy in 1926, following trials in 1924\u201325.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrovie.it/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=13653|title=vecchia loco ferrovie della Calabria \u2013 Ferrovie.it|website=www.ferrovie.it}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, two diesel\u2013electric locomotives were taken in service by the [[Rail transport in the Soviet Union|Soviet railways]], almost at one time:\n[[File:Teplovoz Eel2 (2).jpg|thumb|left|World's first useful diesel locomotive for long distances [[Russian locomotive class E el-2|S\u017dD Eel2]], 1924 in [[Kiev]]]]\n* The engine \u042d<sup>\u044d\u043b</sup>2 ([[Russian locomotive class E el-2|E<sup>el</sup>2]] original number \u042e\u044d 001/Yu-e 001) started on October 22.

It had ten driving axles in three [[bogie]]s (1' Co' Do' Co' 1'). From 1925 to 1927, it hauled trains between [[Moscow]] and [[Kursk]] and in [[Caucasus]] region. Due to technical problems, afterwards, it was out of service. Since 1934, it was used as a stationary electric generator.\n\nIn 1935, [[Krauss-Maffei]], [[MAN AG|MAN]] and [[Voith]] built the first diesel\u2013hydraulic locomotive, called [[DRG Class V 140|V 140]], in Germany. The German railways (DRG) being very pleased with the performance of that engine, diesel\u2013hydraulics became the mainstream in diesel locomotives in Germany.  Serial production of diesel locomotives in Germany began after World War II.\n{{clear left}}\n\n====Switchers====\n[[File:Rangeerlocomotor NS 228.jpg|thumb|Shunter of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] from 1934, in modern livery]]\nIn many railway stations and industrial compounds, steam shunters had to be kept hot during lots of breaks between scattered short tasks. Therefore, diesel traction became economical for [[Shunting (rail)|shunting]] before it became economical for hauling trains. The construction of diesel shunters began in 1920 in France, in 1925 in Denmark, in 1926 in the Netherlands, and in 1927 in Germany. After a few years of testing, hundreds of units were produced within a decade.\n\n====Diesel railcars for regional traffic====\n[[File:Autorail Renault VH2211 Mulhouse FRA 001.jpg|thumb|Renault VH, [[History of rail transport in France|France]], 1933/34]]\nDiesel-powered or \"oil-engined\" railcars, generally diesel\u2013mechanical, were developed by various European manufacturers in the 1930s, e.g. by [[William Beardmore and Company]] for the [[Canadian National Railways]] (the [[Beardmore Tornado]] engine was subsequently used in the [[R101]] airship). Some of those series for regional traffic were begun with gasoline motors and then continued with diesel motors, such as Hungarian BC<sup>mot</sup> (The class code doesn't tell anything but \"railmotor with 2nd and 3rd class seats\".), 128 cars built 1926 \u2013 1937, or German [[Wismar railbus]]es (57 cars 1932 \u2013 1941). In France, the first diesel railcar was [[Renault VH]], 115 units produced 1933/34.\nIn Italy, after 6 Gasoline cars since 1931, Fiat and [[Societ\u00e0 Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] built a lot of diesel railmotors, more than 110 from 1933 to 1938 and 390 from 1940 to 1953, [[FS Class ALn 772|Class 772]] known as ''Littorina'', and Class ALn 900.\n\n====High-speed railcars====\nIn the 1930s, streamlined highspeed diesel railcars were developed in several countries:\n* In Germany, the [[Flying Hamburger]] was built in 1932. After a test ride in December 1932, this two coach diesel railcar (in English terminology a DMU2) started service at [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] (DRG) in February 1933. It became the prototype of [[DRG Class SVT 137]] with 33 more highspeed DMUs, built for DRG till 1938, 13 DMU 2 (\"Hamburg\" series), 18 DMU 3 (\"Leipzig\" and \"K\u00f6ln\" series), and 2 DMU 4 (\"Berlin\" series).\n* French [[SNCF]] classes XF 1000 and XF 1100 comprised 11 high-speed DMUs, also called TAR, built 1934\u20131939.\n* In Hungary, [[Ganz Works]] built the {{Interlanguage link|Arp\u00e1d railmotor|hu|Aamot|de|M\u00c1V-Baureihe \u00c1rp\u00e1d}}, a kind of a luxurious railbus in a series of 7 items since 1934, and started to build the {{Interlanguage link|Hargita (DMU){{!}}Hargita|hu|Hargita motorvonat}} in 1944.\n\n====Further developments====\n[[File:LMS 10000 at Derby.jpg|thumb|[[British Rail Class D16/1]], since 1948]]In 1945, a batch of 30 Baldwin diesel\u2013electric locomotives, [[Baldwin 0-6-6-0 1000]], was delivered from the United States to the railways of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1947, the London Midland & Scottish Railway introduced the first of a pair of {{convert|1600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Co-Co diesel\u2013electric locomotives (later [[British Rail Class D16/1]]) for regular use in the United Kingdom, although British manufacturers such as Armstrong Whitworth had been exporting diesel locomotives since 1930.  Fleet deliveries to British Railways, of other designs such as Class 20 and Class 31, began in 1957.\n\nSeries production of diesel locomotives in Italy began in the mid-1950s. Generally, diesel traction in Italy was of less importance than in other countries, as it was amongst the most advanced countries in the electrification of the main lines and, as a result of Italian geography, even on many domestic connections freight transport over sea is cheaper than rail transport.\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Asia===\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, starting in the 1920s, some petrol\u2013electric railcars were produced.

Series production of China's first Diesel locomotive class, the DFH 1, began in 1964 following the construction of a prototype in 1959.\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Australia===\n[[File:McKeen railmotor at Wodonga.jpg|thumb|A Mckeen railcar in Wodonga, Australia, 1911]]\n\nThe [[Trans-Australian Railway]] built 1912 to 1917 by Commonwealth Railways (CR) passes through 2000&nbsp;km of waterless (or salt watered) desert terrain unsuitable for steam locomotives.  The original engineer [[Henry Deane (engineer)|Henry Deane]] envisaged [[Diesel engine|diesel operation]] to overcome such problems.<ref name=burk>Burke, A 1991., ''Rails through the Wilderness''; New South Wales University Press</ref> Some have suggested that the CR worked with the South Australian Railways to trial diesel traction.<ref>Holden, R 2006 No. 259 : the curious story of a forgotten locomotive, Railmac Publications</ref> However, the technology was not developed enough to be reliable.\n\nAs in Europe, the usage of internal combustion engines advanced more readily in self-propelled railcars than in locomotives.\n* Some Australian railway companies bought [[McKeen railcars]].\n* In the 1920s and 1930s, more reliable Gasoline railmotors were built by Australian industries.\n* Australia's first diesel railcars were the NSWGR 100 Class (PH later DP) Silver City Comet cars in 1937.<ref>Rail Motors and XPTs, David Cooke, ARHS, NSW Division, 1984 pp40-59</ref>\n* High-speed vehicles for those days' possibilities on {{Track gauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} were the 10 [[NZR RM class (Vulcan)|Vulcan railcars]] of 1940 for New Zealand.\n\n==Transmission types==\nUnlike steam engines, internal combustion engines require a transmission to power the wheels. The engine must be allowed to continue to run when the locomotive is stopped.\n\n===Diesel\u2013mechanical===\n[[File:DieselMechanicalLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|Schematic illustration of a diesel mechanical locomotive]]\n\nA diesel\u2013mechanical locomotive uses a [[Transmission (mechanics)|mechanical transmission]] in a fashion similar to that employed in most road vehicles. This type of transmission is generally limited to low-powered, low speed [[shunting (rail)|shunting]] (switching) locomotives, lightweight [[multiple unit]]s and self-propelled [[railcar]]s.\n\n[[File:D2069 at Doncaster Works.JPG|thumb|left|A [[British Rail Class 03]] diesel\u2013mechanical [[shunter]] with a [[Jackshaft (locomotive)|jackshaft]] under the cab.]]\nThe mechanical transmissions used for railroad propulsion are generally more complex and much more robust than standard-road versions.  There is usually a [[fluid coupling]] interposed between the engine and gearbox, and the gearbox is often of the [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic (planetary)]] type to permit shifting while under load.  Various systems have been devised to minimise the break in transmission during gear changing; e.g., the S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) gearbox used by [[Hudswell Clarke]].\n\nDiesel\u2013mechanical propulsion is limited by the difficulty of building a reasonably sized transmission capable of coping with the power and [[torque]] required to move a heavy train.  A number of attempts to use diesel\u2013mechanical propulsion in high power applications have been made (e.g., the {{convert|1500|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[British Rail 10100]] locomotive), although none have proved successful in the end.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Diesel\u2013electric{{Anchor|Diesel-electric}}===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n{{see also|Diesel\u2013electric transmission}}\n{{For|locomotives powered by both external electricity and diesel fuel|#Electro-diesel}}\n{{for|locomotives powered by a combination of diesel or fuel cells and batteries or ultracapacitors|hybrid train}}\n[[File:DieselElectricLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of diesel\u2013electric locomotive]]\nIn a '''diesel\u2013electric''' locomotive, the diesel engine drives either an electrical [[Electric generator|DC generator]] (generally, less than {{convert|3000|hp}} net for traction), or an electrical [[alternator|AC alternator-rectifier]] (generally {{convert|3000|hp}} net or more for traction), the output of which provides power to the [[traction motor]]s that drive the locomotive. There is no mechanical connection between the diesel engine and the wheels.\n\nThe important components of diesel\u2013electric propulsion are the diesel engine (also known as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), the main generator/alternator-rectifier, traction motors (usually with four or six axles), and a control system consisting of the engine [[governor (device)|governor]] and electrical or electronic components, including [[switchgear]], [[rectifiers]] and other components, which control or modify the electrical supply to the traction motors. In the most elementary case, the generator may be directly connected to the motors with only very simple switchgear.\n\n[[File:Metra Locomotives F40PH-2 & MP36PH-3S.jpg|thumb|left|The [[EMD F40PH]] (left) and [[MPI MPXpress]]-series MP36PH-3S (right) [[locomotive]]s [[Railway coupling|coupled]] together by [[Metra]] use [[diesel\u2013electric transmission]].]]\n[[File:2\u0422\u042d10\u041c-0870,_\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f,_\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c,_\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f_\u041e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_(Trainpix_184374).jpg|thumb|Soviet [[TE10|2TE10M]] locomotive]]\nOriginally, the traction motors and generator were [[direct current|DC]] machines. Following the development of high-capacity [[silicon rectifiers]] in the 1960s, the DC generator was replaced by an [[alternator]] using a [[diode bridge]] to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] and [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in the generator.  Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, disposed of the possibility of a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a [[flashover (electrical)|flashover]], which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.\n\nCurrent North American practice is for four axles for high-speed passenger or \"time\" freight, or for six axles for lower-speed or \"manifest\" freight. The most modern units on \"time\" freight service tend to have six axles underneath the frame. Unlike those in \"manifest\" service, \"time\" freight units will have only four of the axles connected to traction motors, with the other two as idler axles for weight distribution.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the development of high-power [[Variable-frequency drive|variable-voltage/variable-frequency]] (VVVF) drives, or \"traction inverters,\" allowed the use of polyphase AC traction motors, thus also eliminating the motor commutator and brushes.  The result is a more efficient and reliable drive that requires relatively little maintenance and is better able to cope with overload conditions that often destroyed the older types of motors.\n\n[[File:CSX locomotive cab.jpg|thumb|right|Engineer's controls in a diesel\u2013electric locomotive cab. The lever near bottom-centre is the throttle and the lever visible at bottom left is the automatic brake valve control.]]\n\n====Diesel\u2013electric control====\n[[File:S3DieselElectricLocomotiveSRM.jpg|thumb|left|[[Montreal Locomotive Works|MLW]] model S-3 produced in 1957 for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] adhering to designs by [[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]].]]\nA diesel\u2013electric locomotive's power output is independent of road speed, as long as the unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop [[tractive effort]] (also referred to as drawbar pull or [[tractive force]], which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel\u2013electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.\n\n====Throttle operation====\n[[File:116U-rabmash.jpg|thumb|Cab of the Russian locomotive [[2TE116]]U, 11 \u2013 throttle]]\nThe prime mover's [[Power (physics)|power]] output is primarily determined by its rotational speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) and fuel rate, which are regulated by a [[governor (device)|governor]] or similar mechanism. The governor is designed to react to both the throttle setting, as determined by the engine driver and the speed at which the prime mover is running (see [[Control theory]]). \n\nLocomotive power output, and thus speed, is typically controlled by the engine driver using a stepped or \"notched\" [[throttle]] that produces [[binary data|binary]]-like electrical signals corresponding to throttle position. This basic design lends itself well to [[multiple unit]] (MU) operation by producing discrete conditions that assure that all units in a [[consist]] respond in the same way to throttle position. Binary encoding also helps to minimize the number of [[Multiple-unit train control#Locomotive applications|trainlines]] (electrical connections) that are required to pass signals from unit to unit.  For example, only four trainlines are required to encode all possible throttle positions if there are up to 14 stages of throttling.\n\nNorth American locomotives, such as those built by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] or [[General Electric]], have nine throttle positions, one idle and eight power (as well as an emergency stop position that shuts down the prime mover). Many [[UK]]-built locomotives have a ten-position throttle. The power positions are often referred to by locomotive crews depending upon the throttle setting, such as \"run 3\" or \"notch 3\".\n\nIn older locomotives, the throttle mechanism was [[ratchet (device)|ratcheted]] so that it was not possible to advance more than one power position at a time. The engine driver could not, for example, pull the throttle from notch 2 to notch 4 without stopping at notch 3. This feature was intended to prevent rough train handling due to abrupt power increases caused by rapid throttle motion (\"throttle stripping\", an operating rules violation on many railroads). Modern locomotives no longer have this restriction, as their control systems are able to smoothly modulate power and avoid sudden changes in [[train]] loading regardless of how the engine driver operates the controls.\n\nWhen the throttle is in the idle position, the prime mover will be receiving minimal fuel, causing it to idle at low RPM. In addition, the traction motors will not be connected to the main generator and the generator's field windings will not be excited (energized) \u2013 the generator will not produce electricity with no excitation. Therefore, the locomotive will be in \"neutral\". Conceptually, this is the same as placing an automobile's transmission into neutral while the engine is running.\n\nTo set the locomotive in motion, the [[reverser handle|reverser control handle]] is placed into the correct position (forward or reverse), the [[air brake (rail)|brake]] is released and the throttle is moved to the run 1 position (the first power notch). An experienced engine driver can accomplish these steps in a coordinated fashion that will result in a nearly imperceptible start. The positioning of the reverser and movement of the throttle together is conceptually like shifting an automobile's automatic transmission into gear while the engine is idling.\n\nPlacing the throttle into the first power position will cause the traction motors to be connected to the main generator and the latter's field coils to be excited. With excitation applied, the main generator will deliver electricity to the traction motors, resulting in motion. If the locomotive is running \"light\" (that is, not coupled to the rest of a train) and is not on an ascending grade, it will easily accelerate. On the other hand, if a long train is being started, the locomotive may stall as soon as some of the slack has been taken up, as the drag imposed by the train will exceed the tractive force being developed. An experienced engine driver will be able to recognize an incipient stall and will gradually advance the throttle as required to maintain the pace of acceleration.\n\nAs the throttle is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate to the prime mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on the requirements of the train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved the throttle to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.\n\nThe propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. \nCurrent technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30% of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to {{convert|120000|lbf|kN}} of [[tractive force]] for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. \nIn fact, a [[consist]] of such units can produce more than enough [[drawbar pull]] at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad [[slang]] as \"jerking a lung\"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, \"jerking a lung\" could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of [[fail-safe]] [[air brake (rail)|automatic train brakes]] installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.\n\n====Propulsion system operation====\n[[File:3000hp curve ver2.jpg|thumb|350px|Typical main generator constant power curve at \"notch 8\"]]\n[[File:116U-left-corridore-diesel.jpg|thumb|Left corridor of power compartment of Russian locomotive [[2TE116]]U, 3 \u2013 alternator, 4 \u2013 rectifier, 6 \u2013 diesel]]\nA locomotive's control system is designed so that the main generator [[electrical power]] output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, as well as the way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (''see power curve graph for notch 8'').\n\nIn older designs, the prime mover's governor and a companion device, the load regulator, play a central role in the control system. The governor has two external inputs: requested engine speed, determined by the engine driver's throttle setting, and actual engine speed ([[feedback]]). The governor has two external control outputs: [[fuel injector]] setting, which determines the engine fuel rate, and load regulator position, which affects main generator excitation.  The governor also incorporates a separate overspeed protective mechanism that will immediately cut off the fuel supply to the injectors and sound an alarm in the [[Cab (locomotive)|cab]] in the event the prime mover exceeds a defined RPM.  Not all of these inputs and outputs are necessarily electrical.\n\nThe load regulator is essentially a large [[potentiometer]] that controls the main generator power output by varying its field excitation and hence the degree of loading applied to the engine.  The load regulator's job is relatively complex, because although the prime mover's power output is proportional to RPM and fuel rate, the main generator's output is not (which characteristic was not correctly handled by the [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard]] elevator- and hoist-type drive system that was initially tried in early locomotives). Instead, a quite complex electro-hydraulic [[Woodward, Inc.|Woodward]] governor was employed. Today, this important function would be performed by the Engine control unit, itself being a part of the Locomotive control unit.\n[[File:Russian Diesel Locomotive TEP80.JPG|right|thumb|Russian diesel locomotive [[TEP80]]]]\n[[File:EMD 567.jpg|thumb|An [[EMD 567|EMD 12-567B]] supercharged 12-cylinder diesel engine (square \"hand holes\"), stored pending rebuild, and missing some components, most notably the two [[Roots-type supercharger]]s, with a 16-567C or D 16-cylinder engine (round \"hand holes\").]]\nAs the load on the engine changes, its rotational speed will also change. This is detected by the governor through a change in the engine speed feedback signal.  The net effect is to adjust both the fuel rate and the load regulator position so that engine RPM and [[torque]] (and thus power output) will remain constant for any given throttle setting, regardless of actual road speed.\n\nIn newer designs controlled by a \u201ctraction computer,\u201d each engine speed step is allotted an appropriate power output, or \u201ckW reference\u201d, in software. The computer compares this value with actual main generator power output, or \u201ckW feedback\u201d, calculated from traction motor current and main generator voltage feedback values. The computer adjusts the feedback value to match the reference value by controlling the excitation of the main generator, as described above. The governor still has control of engine speed, but the load regulator no longer plays a central role in this type of control system. However, the load regulator is retained as a \u201cback-up\u201d in case of engine overload.  Modern locomotives fitted with [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI) may have no mechanical governor; however, a \u201cvirtual\u201d load regulator and governor are retained with computer modules.\n\nTraction motor performance is controlled either by varying the DC voltage output of the main generator, for DC motors, or by varying the frequency and voltage output of the [[Variable-frequency drive|VVVF]] for AC motors.  With DC motors, various connection combinations are utilized to adapt the drive to varying operating conditions.\n\nAt standstill, main generator output is initially low voltage/high current, often in excess of 1000 [[ampere]]s per motor at full power.  When the locomotive is at or near standstill, current flow will be limited only by the DC resistance of the motor windings and interconnecting circuitry, as well as the capacity of the main generator itself.  Torque in a [[Traction motor|series-wound motor]] is approximately proportional to the square of the current. Hence, the traction motors will produce their highest torque, causing the locomotive to develop maximum [[tractive effort]], enabling it to overcome the inertia of the train. This effect is analogous to what happens in an automobile [[automatic transmission]] at start-up, where it is in first gear and thus producing maximum torque multiplication.\n\nAs the locomotive accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures will start to generate a [[counter-electromotive force]] (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose the output of the main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, the locomotive will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as \"transition,\" a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.\n\nTransition methods include:\n* Series / Parallel or \"motor transition\".\n** Initially, pairs of motors are connected in series across the main generator. At higher speed, motors are reconnected in parallel across the main generator.\n* \"Field shunting\", \"field diverting\", or \"weak fielding\".\n** Resistance is connected in parallel with the motor field. This has the effect of increasing the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] current, producing a corresponding increase in motor torque and speed.\n\nBoth methods may also be combined, to increase the operating speed range.\n* Generator / rectifier transition\n** Reconnecting the two separate internal main generator [[alternator|stator windings]] of two rectifiers from parallel to series to increase the output voltage.\n\nIn older locomotives, it was necessary for the engine driver to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the [[ammeter|load meter]] (an indicator that shows the engine driver how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better-operating efficiency and to protect the main generator and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.\n\nModern locomotives incorporate traction ''inverters'', AC to DC, capable of delivering 1,200 volts (earlier traction ''generators'', DC to DC, were capable of delivering only 600 volts). This improvement was accomplished largely through improvements in silicon diode technology. With the capability of delivering 1,200 volts to the traction motors, the need for \"transition\" was eliminated.\n\n====Dynamic braking====\n{{Main|Dynamic brake}}\nA common option on diesel\u2013electric locomotives is [[Dynamic braking|dynamic (rheostatic) braking]].\n\nDynamic braking takes advantage of the fact that the [[traction motor]] armatures are always rotating when the locomotive is in motion and that a motor can be made to act as a [[electrical generator|generator]] by separately exciting the field winding.  When dynamic braking is utilized, the traction control circuits are configured as follows:\n* The field winding of each traction motor is connected across the main generator.\n* The armature of each traction motor is connected across a forced-air-cooled [[resistor|resistance grid]] (the dynamic braking grid) in the roof of the locomotive's hood.\n* The prime mover RPM is increased and the main generator field is excited, causing a corresponding excitation of the traction motor fields.\n\nThe aggregate effect of the above is to cause each traction motor to generate electric power and dissipate it as heat in the dynamic braking grid.  A fan connected across the grid provides forced-air cooling.  Consequently, the fan is powered by the output of the traction motors and will tend to run faster and produce more airflow as more energy is applied to the grid.\n\nUltimately, the source of the energy dissipated in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures.  Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake.  As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16&nbsp;km/h (10&nbsp;mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction motors and [[axle]]s.\n\nDynamic braking is particularly beneficial when operating in mountainous regions; where there is always the danger of a runaway due to overheated friction brakes during descent.  In such cases, dynamic brakes are usually applied in conjunction with the [[air brake (rail)|air brakes]], the combined effect being referred to as [[blended brake|blended braking]].  The use of blended braking can also assist in keeping the slack in a long train stretched as it crests a grade, helping to prevent a \"run-in\", an abrupt bunching of train slack that can cause a derailment.  Blended braking is also commonly used with [[commuter train]]s to reduce wear and tear on the mechanical brakes that is a natural result of the numerous stops such trains typically make during a run.\n\n====Electro-diesel====\n[[File:GE Genesis P32AC-DM 202 MNCRR Ossining.jpg|thumb|[[Metro-North]]'s [[GE Genesis#P32AC-DM|GE Genesis P32AC-DM]] electro-diesel locomotive can also operate off of [[third-rail]] electrification.]]\n{{Main|Electro-diesel locomotive}}\nThese special locomotives can operate as an [[electric locomotive]] or as a diesel locomotive.  The [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]] and [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations]] operate dual-mode diesel\u2013electric/third-rail ([[Overhead line|catenary]] on NJTransit) locomotives between non-electrified territory and [[New York City]] because of a local law banning diesel-powered locomotives in [[Manhattan]] tunnels.  For the same reason, [[Amtrak]] operates a fleet of dual-mode locomotives in the New York area.  [[British Rail]] operated dual diesel\u2013electric/electric locomotives designed to run primarily as electric locomotives with reduced power available when running on diesel power.  This allowed railway yards to remain unelectrified, as the third rail power system is extremely hazardous in a yard area.\n\n===Diesel\u2013hydraulic===\n<!-- The material on torque converters is confusing and somewhat inaccurate.

A torque converter consists of three main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the [[stator]]) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission in an automobile. Another method is to provide several torque converters each with a range of variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.\n\n=====Locomotives=====\n[[File:Western Warship and Hymek.jpg|thumb|right|British Rail diesel\u2013hydraulic locomotives: [[British Rail Class 52|Class 52 \"Western\"]], [[British Rail Class 42|Class 42 \"Warship\"]] and [[British Rail Class 35|Class 35 \"Hymek\"]]]]\nDiesel-hydraulic locomotives are less efficient than diesel\u2013electrics.

The frame and cylinders of the steam locomotive would be retained and the boiler would be replaced by a diesel engine driving an [[air compressor]].  The problem was low [[thermal efficiency]] because of the large amount of energy wasted as heat in the air compressor.  Attempts were made to compensate for this by using the diesel exhaust to re-heat the compressed air but these had limited success.  A German proposal of 1929 did result in a prototype<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/diesair/diesair.htm |title=A German Diesel-Pneumatic Locomotive |publisher=Douglas-self.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> but a similar British proposal of 1932, to use an [[LNER Class R1]] locomotive, never got beyond the design stage.\n\n==Multiple-unit operation==\n[[File:GM-EMD 2000.jpg|thumb|Diesel\u2013electric locomotive built by EMD for service in the UK and continental Europe.]]\nMost diesel locomotives are capable of [[multiple-unit train control]] (MU) as a means of increasing [[horsepower]] and [[tractive effort]] when hauling heavy trains. All [[North America]]n locomotives, including export models, use a standardized [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] electrical control system interconnected by a 27-pin [[jumper cable]] between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the electrical control connections made common to all units in a [[consist]] are referred to as [[trainline (railroad)|trainlines]]. \nThe result is that all locomotives in a [[consist]] behave as one in response to the engine driver's control movements.\n\nThe ability to couple diesel\u2013electric locomotives in an MU fashion was first introduced in the [[EMD FT]] four-unit demonstrator that toured the United States in 1939. At the time, American railroad work rules required that each operating locomotive in a train had to have on board a full crew. [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] circumvented that requirement by coupling the individual units of the demonstrator with [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbars]] instead of conventional [[Railway coupling|knuckle couplers]] and declaring the combination to be a single locomotive.  Electrical interconnections were made so one engine driver could operate the entire consist from the head-end unit.  Later on, work rules were amended and the semi-permanent coupling of units with drawbars was eliminated in favour of couplers, as servicing had proved to be somewhat cumbersome owing to the total length of the consist (about 200 feet or nearly 61 meters).\n\nIn mountainous regions, it is common to interpose [[helper locomotive]]s in the middle of the train, both to provide the extra power needed to ascend a grade and to limit the amount of [[tensile stress|stress]] applied to the [[Railway coupling#Drawgear|draft gear]] of the car coupled to the head-end power.  The helper units in such [[distributed power]] configurations are controlled from the lead unit's cab through coded radio signals.  Although this is technically not an MU configuration, the behaviour is the same as with physically interconnected units.\n\n===Cab arrangements===\nCab arrangements vary by builder and operator. Practice in the U.S. has traditionally been for a cab at one end of the locomotive with limited visibility if the locomotive is not operated cab forward. This is not usually a problem as U.S. locomotives are usually operated in pairs, or threes, and arranged so that a cab is at each end of each set. European practice is usually for a cab at each end of the locomotive as trains are usually light enough to operate with one locomotive. Early U.S. practice was to add power units without cabs (booster or [[B unit]]s) and the arrangement was often A-B, A-A, A-B-A, A-B-B, or A-B-B-A where A was a unit with a cab. Center cabs were sometimes used for switch locomotives.\n\n===Cow-calf===\n{{Main|Cow-calf}}\nIn North American railroading, a [[cow-calf]] set is a pair of switcher-type locomotives: one (the cow) equipped with a driving cab, the other (the calf) without a cab, and controlled from the cow through cables.  Cow-calf sets are used in heavy switching and [[hump yard]] service. Some are radio controlled without an operating engineer present in the cab. This arrangement is also known as [[Master-slave (technology)|master-slave]]. Where two connected units were present, [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] called these TR-2s (approximately {{convert|2,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}); where three units, TR-3s (approximately {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}).\n\nCow-calves have largely disappeared as these engine combinations exceeded their economic lifetimes many years ago.\n\nPresent North American practice is to pair two {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} [[EMD GP40-2|GP40-2]] or [[EMD SD40-2|SD40-2]] road switchers, often nearly worn-out and very soon ready for rebuilding or scrapping, and to utilize these for so-called \"transfer\" uses, for which the TR-2, TR-3 and TR-4 engines were originally intended, hence the designation TR, for \"transfer\".\n\nOccasionally, the second unit may have its prime-mover and traction alternator removed and replaced by concrete or steel ballast and the power for traction obtained from the master unit. As a 16-cylinder prime-mover generally weighs in the {{convert|36,000|lb|adj=on}} range, and a {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} traction alternator generally weighs in the {{convert|18,000|lb|adj=on}} range, this would mean that {{convert|54,000|lb|abbr=on}} would be needed for ballast.\n\nA pair of fully capable \"Dash 2\" units would be rated {{convert|6,000|HP|abbr=on}}. A \"Dash 2\" pair where only one had a prime-mover/alternator would be rated {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}}, with all power provided by master, but the combination benefits from the tractive effort provided by the slave as engines in transfer service are seldom called upon to provide {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} much less {{convert|6,000|HP|abbr=on}} on a continuous basis.\n\n==Fittings and appliances==\n\n===Flameproofing===\nA standard diesel locomotive presents a very low fire risk but \u201cflame proofing\u201d can reduce the risk even further.  This involves fitting a water-filled box to the exhaust pipe to quench any red-hot carbon particles that may be emitted.  Other precautions may include a fully insulated electrical system (neither side earthed to the frame) and all electric wiring enclosed in conduit.\n\nThe flameproof diesel locomotive has replaced the [[fireless steam locomotive]] in areas of high fire risk such as [[oil refineries]] and [[ammunition dump]]s.

North American locomotives are fitted with two headlights (for safety in case one malfunctions) and a pair of ditch lights.

Both designs reduce pollution below EPA Tier II standards and cut or eliminate emissions during idle.\n\n==Advantages over steam==\nAs diesel locomotives advanced, the cost of manufacturing and operating them dropped, and they became cheaper to own and operate than steam locomotives. In North America, [[steam locomotive]]s were custom-made for specific railway routes, so economies of scale were difficult to achieve.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=10}} Though more complex to produce with exacting manufacturing tolerances ({{convert|1/10000|in|adj=on|disp=or}} for diesel, compared with {{convert|1/100|in|adj=on}} for steam), diesel locomotive parts were easier to mass-produce. [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] offered almost five hundred steam models in its heyday, while [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] offered fewer than ten diesel varieties.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=19}} In the United Kingdom, [[British Railways]] built steam locomotives to standard designs from 1951 onwards. These included standard, interchangeable parts, making them cheaper to produce than the diesel locomotives then available. The capital cost per [[Tractive force|drawbar horse power]] was \u00a313 6s (steam), \u00a365 (diesel), \u00a369 7s (turbine) and \u00a317 13s (electric).<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Railway Magazine |date=January 1951 |pages=60\u201361 |title=Standardisation and Comparative Costs of Motive Power on B.R.}}</ref>\n\nDiesel locomotives offer significant operating advantages over steam locomotives.<ref>[http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html], Phil Jern \"How to Boot a Steam Locomotive\" (1990) San Diego Railroad Museum.</ref> They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives continue to have two-person crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked [[multiple working|in multiple]] with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives in a single train \u2013 something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered for use as a single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train. With steam traction, a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to [[double heading]] with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.\n\nDiesel engines can be started and stopped almost instantly, meaning that a diesel locomotive has the potential to incur no fuel costs when not being used. However, it is still the practice of large North American railroads to use straight water as a coolant in diesel engines instead of coolants that incorporate anti-freezing properties; this results in diesel locomotives being left idling when parked in cold climates instead of being completely shut down. A diesel engine can be left idling unattended for hours or even days, especially since practically every diesel engine used in locomotives has systems that automatically shut the engine down if problems such as a loss of oil pressure or coolant loss occur. Automatic start/stop systems are available which monitor coolant and engine temperatures. When the unit is close to having its coolant freeze, the system restarts the diesel engine to warm the coolant and other systems.<ref>[http://www.ztr.com/smartstart.php SmartStart\u00ae IIe \u2013 Automatic Engine Start/Stop System]. Ztr.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.</ref>\n\nSteam locomotives require intensive maintenance, lubrication, and cleaning before, during, and after use. Preparing and firing a steam locomotive for use from cold can take many hours. They can be kept in readiness between uses with a low fire, but this requires regular stoking and frequent attention to maintain the level of water in the boiler. This may be necessary to prevent the water in the boiler freezing in cold climates, so long as the water supply is not frozen.\n\nThe maintenance and operational costs of steam locomotives were much higher than diesels. Annual maintenance costs for steam locomotives accounted for 25% of the initial purchase price. Spare parts were cast from wooden masters for specific locomotives. The sheer number of unique steam locomotives meant that there was no feasible way for spare-part inventories to be maintained.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=12-17}} With diesel locomotives spare parts could be mass-produced and held in stock ready for use and many parts and sub-assemblies could be standardized across an operator's fleet using different models of locomotive from the same builder. Modern diesel locomotive engines are designed to allow the power assemblies (systems of working parts and their block interfaces) to be replaced while keeping the main block in the locomotive, which greatly reduces the time that a locomotive is out of revenue-generating service when it requires maintenance.<ref name=\"Kettering\" />\n\nSteam engines required large quantities of coal and water, which were expensive variable operating costs.<ref name=\"Stover 213\">Stover, 213</ref> Further, the [[thermal efficiency]] of steam was considerably less than that of diesel engines. Diesel's theoretical studies demonstrated potential thermal efficiencies for a compression ignition engine of 36% (compared with 6\u201310% for steam), and an 1897 one-cylinder prototype operated at a remarkable 26% efficiency.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=14}}\n\nHowever, one study published in 1959 suggested that many of the comparisons between diesel and steam locomotives were made unfairly. mostly because diesels were newer. After painstaking analysis of financial records and technological progress, the author found that if research had continued on steam technology instead of diesel, there would be negligible financial benefit in converting to diesel locomotion.<ref>Brown, H.

However, the [[Great Depression]] curtailed demand for Westinghouse's electrical equipment, and they stopped building locomotives internally, opting to supply electrical parts instead.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=28-30}}\n\nIn June 1925, [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] outshopped a prototype diesel\u2013electric locomotive for \"special uses\" (such as for runs where water for steam locomotives was scarce) using electrical equipment from [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Company]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Railroads To Try Diesel Locomotive |newspaper=Special to the New York Times |date=February 18, 1925 |page=1}}</ref> Its twin-engine design was not successful, and the unit was scrapped after a short testing and demonstration period.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=283}} Industry sources were beginning to suggest \u201cthe outstanding advantages of this new form of motive power\u201d.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=27}}  In 1929, the [[Canadian National Railways]] became the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service with two units, 9000 and 9001, from Westinghouse.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=409}}  However, these early diesels proved expensive and unreliable, with their high cost of acquisition relative to steam unable to be realized in operating cost savings as they were frequently out of service.  It would be another five years before diesel\u2013electric propulsion would be successfully used in mainline service, and nearly ten years before it would show real potential to fully replace steam.\n\nBefore diesel power could make inroads into mainline service, the limitations of diesel engines circa 1930&nbsp;\u2013 low power-to-weight ratios and narrow output range&nbsp;\u2013 had to be overcome.  A major effort to overcome those limitations was launched by [[General Motors]] after they moved into the diesel field with their acquisition of the [[Winton Engine Company]], a major manufacturer of diesel engines for marine and stationary applications, in 1930. Supported by the General Motors Research Division, GM's [[Cleveland Diesel Engine Division|Winton Engine Corporation]] sought to develop diesel engines suitable for high-speed mobile use.  The first milestone in that effort was delivery in early 1934 of the Winton 201A, a [[two-stroke]], [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots-supercharged]], [[Uniflow scavenging|uniflow-scavenged]], [[Unit injector|unit-injected]] [[diesel engine]] that could deliver the required performance for a fast, lightweight passenger train.  The second milestone, and the one that got American railroads moving towards diesel, was the 1938 delivery of GM's  [[EMD 567|Model 567]] engine that was designed specifically for locomotive use, bringing a fivefold increase in life of some mechanical parts and showing its potential for meeting the rigors of freight service.<ref name=Kettering>{{cite conference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuUiAQAAMAAJ|title=History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine |author=Kettering, E.W. |date={{date|1951-11-29|dmy}} |publisher=Electro-Motive Division, General Motors Corporation |conference=ASME 1951 Annual Meeting |location=Atlantic City, New Jersey}}</ref>\n\nDiesel\u2013electric railroad locomotion entered  mainline service when the [[Burlington Railroad]] and [[Union Pacific]] used custom-built diesel \"[[streamliner]]s\" to haul passengers, starting in late 1934.<ref name=\"Stover 212\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=79oDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA165&dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=RasMTuyGFYifsQLC3sGzCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Diesel Streamliners Now Link Coast-to-Coast\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1937</ref> Burlington's ''[[Burlington Zephyr|Zephyr]]'' trainsets evolved from articulated three-car sets with 600&nbsp;hp power cars in 1934 and early 1935, to the ''Denver Zephyr'' semi-articulated ten car trainsets pulled by cab-booster power sets introduced in late 1936.  Union Pacific started diesel streamliner service between Chicago and Portland Oregon in June 1935, and in the following year would add Los Angeles and Oakland California, and Denver Colorado to the destinations of diesel streamliners out of Chicago.  The Burlington and Union Pacific streamliners were built by the [[Budd Company]] and the [[Pullman-Standard|Pullman-Standard Company]], respectively, using the new Winton engines and power train systems designed by GM's [[Electro-Motive Corporation]].  EMC's experimental [[EMC 1800 hp B-B|1800 hp B-B]] locomotives of 1935 demonstrated the multiple-unit control systems used for the cab/booster sets and the twin-engine format used with the later ''Zephyr'' power units.  Both of those features would be used in EMC's later production model locomotives.  The lightweight diesel streamliners of the mid-1930s demonstrated the advantages of diesel for passenger service with breakthrough schedule times, but diesel locomotive power would not fully come of age until regular series production of mainline diesel locomotives commenced and it was shown suitable for full-size passenger and freight service.\n\n====First American series production locomotives====\nFollowing their 1925 prototype, the AGEIR consortium produced 25 more units of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \"60 ton\" [[ALCO boxcab|AGEIR boxcab]] [[switcher|switching locomotives]] between 1925 and 1928 for several New York City railroads, making them the first series-produced diesel locomotives.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=209\u2013211}}  The consortium also produced seven twin-engine \"100 ton\" boxcabs and one hybrid trolley/battery unit with a diesel-driven charging circuit.  ALCO acquired the [[McIntosh & Seymour]] Engine Company in 1929 and entered series production of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} single-cab switcher units in 1931.  ALCO would be the pre-eminent builder of switch engines through the mid-1930s and would adapt the basic switcher design to produce versatile and highly successful, albeit relatively low powered, road locomotives.\n\nGM, seeing the success of the custom streamliners, sought to expand the market for diesel power by producing standardized locomotives under their [[Electro-Motive Corporation]]. In 1936, EMC's new factory started production of switch engines.  In 1937, the factory started producing their new [[EMD E-unit|E series]] streamlined passenger locomotives, which would be upgraded with more reliable purpose-built engines in 1938.  Seeing the performance and reliability of the new [[EMD 567|567 model]] engine in passenger locomotives, EMC was eager to demonstrate diesel's viability in freight service.\n\nFollowing the successful 1939 tour of [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMC's]] [[EMD FT|FT]] demonstrator freight locomotive set, the stage was set for dieselization of American railroads.  In 1941, [[ALCO-GE]] introduced the [[ALCO RS-1|RS-1]] road-switcher that occupied its own market niche while EMD's [[EMD F-unit|F series]] locomotives were sought for mainline freight service.  The US entry into World War II slowed conversion to diesel; the War Production Board put a halt to building new passenger equipment and gave naval uses priority for diesel engine production.  During the [[Big Inch|petroleum crisis of 1942-43]], coal-fired steam had the advantage of not using fuel that was in critically short supply.   EMD was later allowed to increase the production of its FT locomotives and ALCO-GE was allowed to produce a limited number of [[DL-109]] road locomotives, but most in the locomotive business were restricted to making switch engines and steam locomotives.\n\nIn the early postwar era, EMD dominated the market for mainline locomotives with their E and F series locomotives.  ALCO-GE in the late 1940s produced switchers and road-switchers that were successful in the short-haul market.  However, EMD launched their [[EMD GP7|GP series]] road-switcher locomotives in 1949, which displaced all other locomotives in the freight market including their own F series locomotives.  GE subsequently dissolved its partnership with ALCO and would emerge as EMD's main competitor in the early 1960s, eventually taking the top position in the locomotive market from EMD.\n\nEarly diesel\u2013electric locomotives in the United States used direct current (DC) traction motors, but alternating current (AC) motors came into widespread use in the 1990s, starting with the [[EMD SD70 series|Electro-Motive SD70MAC]] in 1993 and followed by the [[GE AC4400CW|General Electric's AC4400CW]] in 1994 and [[GE AC6000CW|AC6000CW]] in 1995.<ref>Solomon, Brian, ''Locomotive'', 2001, pp 120, 130</ref>\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Europe===\n====First functional diesel vehicles====\n[[File:Limousin2010RVT01.jpg|thumb|[[Switzerland|Swiss]] & [[Germany|German]] co-production: world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcar 1914]]\nIn 1914, world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcars were produced for the ''K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsische Staatseisenbahnen'' ([[Royal Saxon State Railways]]) by [[Waggonfabrik Rastatt]] with electric equipment from [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] and diesel engines from [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer AG]]. They were classified as [[Saxon DET 1-2|DET 1 and DET 2]] ({{Interlanguage link|de.wiki|de|S\u00e4chsischer DET 1\u20132|vertical-align=sup}}). Due to shortage of petrol products during [[World War I]], they remained unused for regular service in Germany. In 1922, they were sold to Swiss [[Compagnie du Chemin de fer R\u00e9gional du Val-de-Travers]] ({{Interlanguage link|fr.wiki|fr|R\u00e9gional du Val-de-Travers|vertical-align=sup}}), where they were used in regular service up to the [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] of the line in 1944. Afterwards, the company kept them in service as boosters till 1965.\n\n[[Fiat]] claims a first Italian diesel\u2013electric locomotive built in 1922, but little detail is available.  A Fiat-TIBB diesel\u2013locomotive \"A\", of 440CV, is reported to have entered service on the Ferrovie Calabro Lucane in southern Italy in 1926, following trials in 1924\u201325.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ferrovie.it/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=13653|title=vecchia loco ferrovie della Calabria \u2013 Ferrovie.it|website=www.ferrovie.it}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, two diesel\u2013electric locomotives were taken in service by the [[Rail transport in the Soviet Union|Soviet railways]], almost at one time:\n[[File:Teplovoz Eel2 (2).jpg|thumb|left|World's first useful diesel locomotive for long distances [[Russian locomotive class E el-2|S\u017dD Eel2]], 1924 in [[Kiev]]]]\n* The engine \u042d<sup>\u044d\u043b</sup>2 ([[Russian locomotive class E el-2|E<sup>el</sup>2]] original number \u042e\u044d 001/Yu-e 001) started on October 22.

It had ten driving axles in three [[bogie]]s (1' Co' Do' Co' 1'). From 1925 to 1927, it hauled trains between [[Moscow]] and [[Kursk]] and in [[Caucasus]] region. Due to technical problems, afterwards, it was out of service. Since 1934, it was used as a stationary electric generator.\n\nIn 1935, [[Krauss-Maffei]], [[MAN AG|MAN]] and [[Voith]] built the first diesel\u2013hydraulic locomotive, called [[DRG Class V 140|V 140]], in Germany. The German railways (DRG) being very pleased with the performance of that engine, diesel\u2013hydraulics became the mainstream in diesel locomotives in Germany.  Serial production of diesel locomotives in Germany began after World War II.\n{{clear left}}\n\n====Switchers====\n[[File:Rangeerlocomotor NS 228.jpg|thumb|Shunter of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] from 1934, in modern livery]]\nIn many railway stations and industrial compounds, steam shunters had to be kept hot during lots of breaks between scattered short tasks. Therefore, diesel traction became economical for [[Shunting (rail)|shunting]] before it became economical for hauling trains. The construction of diesel shunters began in 1920 in France, in 1925 in Denmark, in 1926 in the Netherlands, and in 1927 in Germany. After a few years of testing, hundreds of units were produced within a decade.\n\n====Diesel railcars for regional traffic====\n[[File:Autorail Renault VH2211 Mulhouse FRA 001.jpg|thumb|Renault VH, [[History of rail transport in France|France]], 1933/34]]\nDiesel-powered or \"oil-engined\" railcars, generally diesel\u2013mechanical, were developed by various European manufacturers in the 1930s, e.g. by [[William Beardmore and Company]] for the [[Canadian National Railways]] (the [[Beardmore Tornado]] engine was subsequently used in the [[R101]] airship). Some of those series for regional traffic were begun with gasoline motors and then continued with diesel motors, such as Hungarian BC<sup>mot</sup> (The class code doesn't tell anything but \"railmotor with 2nd and 3rd class seats\".), 128 cars built 1926 \u2013 1937, or German [[Wismar railbus]]es (57 cars 1932 \u2013 1941). In France, the first diesel railcar was [[Renault VH]], 115 units produced 1933/34.\nIn Italy, after 6 Gasoline cars since 1931, Fiat and [[Societ\u00e0 Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] built a lot of diesel railmotors, more than 110 from 1933 to 1938 and 390 from 1940 to 1953, [[FS Class ALn 772|Class 772]] known as ''Littorina'', and Class ALn 900.\n\n====High-speed railcars====\nIn the 1930s, streamlined highspeed diesel railcars were developed in several countries:\n* In Germany, the [[Flying Hamburger]] was built in 1932. After a test ride in December 1932, this two coach diesel railcar (in English terminology a DMU2) started service at [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] (DRG) in February 1933. It became the prototype of [[DRG Class SVT 137]] with 33 more highspeed DMUs, built for DRG till 1938, 13 DMU 2 (\"Hamburg\" series), 18 DMU 3 (\"Leipzig\" and \"K\u00f6ln\" series), and 2 DMU 4 (\"Berlin\" series).\n* French [[SNCF]] classes XF 1000 and XF 1100 comprised 11 high-speed DMUs, also called TAR, built 1934\u20131939.\n* In Hungary, [[Ganz Works]] built the {{Interlanguage link|Arp\u00e1d railmotor|hu|Aamot|de|M\u00c1V-Baureihe \u00c1rp\u00e1d}}, a kind of a luxurious railbus in a series of 7 items since 1934, and started to build the {{Interlanguage link|Hargita (DMU){{!}}Hargita|hu|Hargita motorvonat}} in 1944.\n\n====Further developments====\n[[File:LMS 10000 at Derby.jpg|thumb|[[British Rail Class D16/1]], since 1948]]In 1945, a batch of 30 Baldwin diesel\u2013electric locomotives, [[Baldwin 0-6-6-0 1000]], was delivered from the United States to the railways of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1947, the London Midland & Scottish Railway introduced the first of a pair of {{convert|1600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Co-Co diesel\u2013electric locomotives (later [[British Rail Class D16/1]]) for regular use in the United Kingdom, although British manufacturers such as Armstrong Whitworth had been exporting diesel locomotives since 1930.  Fleet deliveries to British Railways, of other designs such as Class 20 and Class 31, began in 1957.\n\nSeries production of diesel locomotives in Italy began in the mid-1950s. Generally, diesel traction in Italy was of less importance than in other countries, as it was amongst the most advanced countries in the electrification of the main lines and, as a result of Italian geography, even on many domestic connections freight transport over sea is cheaper than rail transport.\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Asia===\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, starting in the 1920s, some petrol\u2013electric railcars were produced.

The engine must be allowed to continue to run when the locomotive is stopped.\n\n===Diesel\u2013mechanical===\n[[File:DieselMechanicalLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|Schematic illustration of a diesel mechanical locomotive]]\n\nA diesel\u2013mechanical locomotive uses a [[Transmission (mechanics)|mechanical transmission]] in a fashion similar to that employed in most road vehicles. This type of transmission is generally limited to low-powered, low speed [[shunting (rail)|shunting]] (switching) locomotives, lightweight [[multiple unit]]s and self-propelled [[railcar]]s.\n\n[[File:D2069 at Doncaster Works.JPG|thumb|left|A [[British Rail Class 03]] diesel\u2013mechanical [[shunter]] with a [[Jackshaft (locomotive)|jackshaft]] under the cab.]]\nThe mechanical transmissions used for railroad propulsion are generally more complex and much more robust than standard-road versions.  There is usually a [[fluid coupling]] interposed between the engine and gearbox, and the gearbox is often of the [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic (planetary)]] type to permit shifting while under load.  Various systems have been devised to minimise the break in transmission during gear changing; e.g., the S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) gearbox used by [[Hudswell Clarke]].\n\nDiesel\u2013mechanical propulsion is limited by the difficulty of building a reasonably sized transmission capable of coping with the power and [[torque]] required to move a heavy train.  A number of attempts to use diesel\u2013mechanical propulsion in high power applications have been made (e.g., the {{convert|1500|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[British Rail 10100]] locomotive), although none have proved successful in the end.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Diesel\u2013electric{{Anchor|Diesel-electric}}===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n{{see also|Diesel\u2013electric transmission}}\n{{For|locomotives powered by both external electricity and diesel fuel|#Electro-diesel}}\n{{for|locomotives powered by a combination of diesel or fuel cells and batteries or ultracapacitors|hybrid train}}\n[[File:DieselElectricLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of diesel\u2013electric locomotive]]\nIn a '''diesel\u2013electric''' locomotive, the diesel engine drives either an electrical [[Electric generator|DC generator]] (generally, less than {{convert|3000|hp}} net for traction), or an electrical [[alternator|AC alternator-rectifier]] (generally {{convert|3000|hp}} net or more for traction), the output of which provides power to the [[traction motor]]s that drive the locomotive. There is no mechanical connection between the diesel engine and the wheels.\n\nThe important components of diesel\u2013electric propulsion are the diesel engine (also known as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), the main generator/alternator-rectifier, traction motors (usually with four or six axles), and a control system consisting of the engine [[governor (device)|governor]] and electrical or electronic components, including [[switchgear]], [[rectifiers]] and other components, which control or modify the electrical supply to the traction motors. In the most elementary case, the generator may be directly connected to the motors with only very simple switchgear.\n\n[[File:Metra Locomotives F40PH-2 & MP36PH-3S.jpg|thumb|left|The [[EMD F40PH]] (left) and [[MPI MPXpress]]-series MP36PH-3S (right) [[locomotive]]s [[Railway coupling|coupled]] together by [[Metra]] use [[diesel\u2013electric transmission]].]]\n[[File:2\u0422\u042d10\u041c-0870,_\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f,_\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c,_\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f_\u041e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_(Trainpix_184374).jpg|thumb|Soviet [[TE10|2TE10M]] locomotive]]\nOriginally, the traction motors and generator were [[direct current|DC]] machines. Following the development of high-capacity [[silicon rectifiers]] in the 1960s, the DC generator was replaced by an [[alternator]] using a [[diode bridge]] to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] and [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in the generator.  Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, disposed of the possibility of a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a [[flashover (electrical)|flashover]], which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.\n\nCurrent North American practice is for four axles for high-speed passenger or \"time\" freight, or for six axles for lower-speed or \"manifest\" freight. The most modern units on \"time\" freight service tend to have six axles underneath the frame. Unlike those in \"manifest\" service, \"time\" freight units will have only four of the axles connected to traction motors, with the other two as idler axles for weight distribution.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the development of high-power [[Variable-frequency drive|variable-voltage/variable-frequency]] (VVVF) drives, or \"traction inverters,\" allowed the use of polyphase AC traction motors, thus also eliminating the motor commutator and brushes.  The result is a more efficient and reliable drive that requires relatively little maintenance and is better able to cope with overload conditions that often destroyed the older types of motors.\n\n[[File:CSX locomotive cab.jpg|thumb|right|Engineer's controls in a diesel\u2013electric locomotive cab.

Therefore, the unit's ability to develop [[tractive effort]] (also referred to as drawbar pull or [[tractive force]], which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel\u2013electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.\n\n====Throttle operation====\n[[File:116U-rabmash.jpg|thumb|Cab of the Russian locomotive [[2TE116]]U, 11 \u2013 throttle]]\nThe prime mover's [[Power (physics)|power]] output is primarily determined by its rotational speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) and fuel rate, which are regulated by a [[governor (device)|governor]] or similar mechanism. The governor is designed to react to both the throttle setting, as determined by the engine driver and the speed at which the prime mover is running (see [[Control theory]]). \n\nLocomotive power output, and thus speed, is typically controlled by the engine driver using a stepped or \"notched\" [[throttle]] that produces [[binary data|binary]]-like electrical signals corresponding to throttle position. This basic design lends itself well to [[multiple unit]] (MU) operation by producing discrete conditions that assure that all units in a [[consist]] respond in the same way to throttle position. Binary encoding also helps to minimize the number of [[Multiple-unit train control#Locomotive applications|trainlines]] (electrical connections) that are required to pass signals from unit to unit.  For example, only four trainlines are required to encode all possible throttle positions if there are up to 14 stages of throttling.\n\nNorth American locomotives, such as those built by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] or [[General Electric]], have nine throttle positions, one idle and eight power (as well as an emergency stop position that shuts down the prime mover). Many [[UK]]-built locomotives have a ten-position throttle. The power positions are often referred to by locomotive crews depending upon the throttle setting, such as \"run 3\" or \"notch 3\".\n\nIn older locomotives, the throttle mechanism was [[ratchet (device)|ratcheted]] so that it was not possible to advance more than one power position at a time. The engine driver could not, for example, pull the throttle from notch 2 to notch 4 without stopping at notch 3. This feature was intended to prevent rough train handling due to abrupt power increases caused by rapid throttle motion (\"throttle stripping\", an operating rules violation on many railroads). Modern locomotives no longer have this restriction, as their control systems are able to smoothly modulate power and avoid sudden changes in [[train]] loading regardless of how the engine driver operates the controls.\n\nWhen the throttle is in the idle position, the prime mover will be receiving minimal fuel, causing it to idle at low RPM. In addition, the traction motors will not be connected to the main generator and the generator's field windings will not be excited (energized) \u2013 the generator will not produce electricity with no excitation. Therefore, the locomotive will be in \"neutral\". Conceptually, this is the same as placing an automobile's transmission into neutral while the engine is running.\n\nTo set the locomotive in motion, the [[reverser handle|reverser control handle]] is placed into the correct position (forward or reverse), the [[air brake (rail)|brake]] is released and the throttle is moved to the run 1 position (the first power notch). An experienced engine driver can accomplish these steps in a coordinated fashion that will result in a nearly imperceptible start. The positioning of the reverser and movement of the throttle together is conceptually like shifting an automobile's automatic transmission into gear while the engine is idling.\n\nPlacing the throttle into the first power position will cause the traction motors to be connected to the main generator and the latter's field coils to be excited. With excitation applied, the main generator will deliver electricity to the traction motors, resulting in motion. If the locomotive is running \"light\" (that is, not coupled to the rest of a train) and is not on an ascending grade, it will easily accelerate. On the other hand, if a long train is being started, the locomotive may stall as soon as some of the slack has been taken up, as the drag imposed by the train will exceed the tractive force being developed. An experienced engine driver will be able to recognize an incipient stall and will gradually advance the throttle as required to maintain the pace of acceleration.\n\nAs the throttle is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate to the prime mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on the requirements of the train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved the throttle to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.\n\nThe propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. \nCurrent technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30% of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to {{convert|120000|lbf|kN}} of [[tractive force]] for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. \nIn fact, a [[consist]] of such units can produce more than enough [[drawbar pull]] at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad [[slang]] as \"jerking a lung\"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, \"jerking a lung\" could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of [[fail-safe]] [[air brake (rail)|automatic train brakes]] installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.\n\n====Propulsion system operation====\n[[File:3000hp curve ver2.jpg|thumb|350px|Typical main generator constant power curve at \"notch 8\"]]\n[[File:116U-left-corridore-diesel.jpg|thumb|Left corridor of power compartment of Russian locomotive [[2TE116]]U, 3 \u2013 alternator, 4 \u2013 rectifier, 6 \u2013 diesel]]\nA locomotive's control system is designed so that the main generator [[electrical power]] output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, as well as the way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (''see power curve graph for notch 8'').\n\nIn older designs, the prime mover's governor and a companion device, the load regulator, play a central role in the control system. The governor has two external inputs: requested engine speed, determined by the engine driver's throttle setting, and actual engine speed ([[feedback]]). The governor has two external control outputs: [[fuel injector]] setting, which determines the engine fuel rate, and load regulator position, which affects main generator excitation.  The governor also incorporates a separate overspeed protective mechanism that will immediately cut off the fuel supply to the injectors and sound an alarm in the [[Cab (locomotive)|cab]] in the event the prime mover exceeds a defined RPM.  Not all of these inputs and outputs are necessarily electrical.\n\nThe load regulator is essentially a large [[potentiometer]] that controls the main generator power output by varying its field excitation and hence the degree of loading applied to the engine.  The load regulator's job is relatively complex, because although the prime mover's power output is proportional to RPM and fuel rate, the main generator's output is not (which characteristic was not correctly handled by the [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard]] elevator- and hoist-type drive system that was initially tried in early locomotives). Instead, a quite complex electro-hydraulic [[Woodward, Inc.|Woodward]] governor was employed. Today, this important function would be performed by the Engine control unit, itself being a part of the Locomotive control unit.\n[[File:Russian Diesel Locomotive TEP80.JPG|right|thumb|Russian diesel locomotive [[TEP80]]]]\n[[File:EMD 567.jpg|thumb|An [[EMD 567|EMD 12-567B]] supercharged 12-cylinder diesel engine (square \"hand holes\"), stored pending rebuild, and missing some components, most notably the two [[Roots-type supercharger]]s, with a 16-567C or D 16-cylinder engine (round \"hand holes\").]]\nAs the load on the engine changes, its rotational speed will also change. This is detected by the governor through a change in the engine speed feedback signal.  The net effect is to adjust both the fuel rate and the load regulator position so that engine RPM and [[torque]] (and thus power output) will remain constant for any given throttle setting, regardless of actual road speed.\n\nIn newer designs controlled by a \u201ctraction computer,\u201d each engine speed step is allotted an appropriate power output, or \u201ckW reference\u201d, in software. The computer compares this value with actual main generator power output, or \u201ckW feedback\u201d, calculated from traction motor current and main generator voltage feedback values. The computer adjusts the feedback value to match the reference value by controlling the excitation of the main generator, as described above. The governor still has control of engine speed, but the load regulator no longer plays a central role in this type of control system. However, the load regulator is retained as a \u201cback-up\u201d in case of engine overload.  Modern locomotives fitted with [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI) may have no mechanical governor; however, a \u201cvirtual\u201d load regulator and governor are retained with computer modules.\n\nTraction motor performance is controlled either by varying the DC voltage output of the main generator, for DC motors, or by varying the frequency and voltage output of the [[Variable-frequency drive|VVVF]] for AC motors.  With DC motors, various connection combinations are utilized to adapt the drive to varying operating conditions.\n\nAt standstill, main generator output is initially low voltage/high current, often in excess of 1000 [[ampere]]s per motor at full power.  When the locomotive is at or near standstill, current flow will be limited only by the DC resistance of the motor windings and interconnecting circuitry, as well as the capacity of the main generator itself.  Torque in a [[Traction motor|series-wound motor]] is approximately proportional to the square of the current. Hence, the traction motors will produce their highest torque, causing the locomotive to develop maximum [[tractive effort]], enabling it to overcome the inertia of the train. This effect is analogous to what happens in an automobile [[automatic transmission]] at start-up, where it is in first gear and thus producing maximum torque multiplication.\n\nAs the locomotive accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures will start to generate a [[counter-electromotive force]] (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose the output of the main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, the locomotive will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as \"transition,\" a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.\n\nTransition methods include:\n* Series / Parallel or \"motor transition\".\n** Initially, pairs of motors are connected in series across the main generator. At higher speed, motors are reconnected in parallel across the main generator.\n* \"Field shunting\", \"field diverting\", or \"weak fielding\".\n** Resistance is connected in parallel with the motor field. This has the effect of increasing the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] current, producing a corresponding increase in motor torque and speed.\n\nBoth methods may also be combined, to increase the operating speed range.\n* Generator / rectifier transition\n** Reconnecting the two separate internal main generator [[alternator|stator windings]] of two rectifiers from parallel to series to increase the output voltage.\n\nIn older locomotives, it was necessary for the engine driver to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the [[ammeter|load meter]] (an indicator that shows the engine driver how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better-operating efficiency and to protect the main generator and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.\n\nModern locomotives incorporate traction ''inverters'', AC to DC, capable of delivering 1,200 volts (earlier traction ''generators'', DC to DC, were capable of delivering only 600 volts). This improvement was accomplished largely through improvements in silicon diode technology. With the capability of delivering 1,200 volts to the traction motors, the need for \"transition\" was eliminated.\n\n====Dynamic braking====\n{{Main|Dynamic brake}}\nA common option on diesel\u2013electric locomotives is [[Dynamic braking|dynamic (rheostatic) braking]].\n\nDynamic braking takes advantage of the fact that the [[traction motor]] armatures are always rotating when the locomotive is in motion and that a motor can be made to act as a [[electrical generator|generator]] by separately exciting the field winding.  When dynamic braking is utilized, the traction control circuits are configured as follows:\n* The field winding of each traction motor is connected across the main generator.\n* The armature of each traction motor is connected across a forced-air-cooled [[resistor|resistance grid]] (the dynamic braking grid) in the roof of the locomotive's hood.\n* The prime mover RPM is increased and the main generator field is excited, causing a corresponding excitation of the traction motor fields.\n\nThe aggregate effect of the above is to cause each traction motor to generate electric power and dissipate it as heat in the dynamic braking grid.  A fan connected across the grid provides forced-air cooling.  Consequently, the fan is powered by the output of the traction motors and will tend to run faster and produce more airflow as more energy is applied to the grid.\n\nUltimately, the source of the energy dissipated in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures.  Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake.  As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16&nbsp;km/h (10&nbsp;mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction motors and [[axle]]s.\n\nDynamic braking is particularly beneficial when operating in mountainous regions; where there is always the danger of a runaway due to overheated friction brakes during descent.  In such cases, dynamic brakes are usually applied in conjunction with the [[air brake (rail)|air brakes]], the combined effect being referred to as [[blended brake|blended braking]].  The use of blended braking can also assist in keeping the slack in a long train stretched as it crests a grade, helping to prevent a \"run-in\", an abrupt bunching of train slack that can cause a derailment.  Blended braking is also commonly used with [[commuter train]]s to reduce wear and tear on the mechanical brakes that is a natural result of the numerous stops such trains typically make during a run.\n\n====Electro-diesel====\n[[File:GE Genesis P32AC-DM 202 MNCRR Ossining.jpg|thumb|[[Metro-North]]'s [[GE Genesis#P32AC-DM|GE Genesis P32AC-DM]] electro-diesel locomotive can also operate off of [[third-rail]] electrification.]]\n{{Main|Electro-diesel locomotive}}\nThese special locomotives can operate as an [[electric locomotive]] or as a diesel locomotive.  The [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]] and [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations]] operate dual-mode diesel\u2013electric/third-rail ([[Overhead line|catenary]] on NJTransit) locomotives between non-electrified territory and [[New York City]] because of a local law banning diesel-powered locomotives in [[Manhattan]] tunnels.  For the same reason, [[Amtrak]] operates a fleet of dual-mode locomotives in the New York area.  [[British Rail]] operated dual diesel\u2013electric/electric locomotives designed to run primarily as electric locomotives with reduced power available when running on diesel power.  This allowed railway yards to remain unelectrified, as the third rail power system is extremely hazardous in a yard area.\n\n===Diesel\u2013hydraulic===\n<!-- The material on torque converters is confusing and somewhat inaccurate. The editor should examine the torque converter article for correct terminology. -->\nDiesel\u2013hydraulic locomotives use one or more [[torque converter]]s, in combination with gears, with a mechanical final drive to convey the power from the diesel engine to the wheels.\n\n====Hydrostatic transmission====\n\nHydraulic drive systems using a hydrostatic [[hydraulic drive system]] have been applied to rail use.

A torque converter consists of three main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the [[stator]]) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission in an automobile. Another method is to provide several torque converters each with a range of variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.\n\n=====Locomotives=====\n[[File:Western Warship and Hymek.jpg|thumb|right|British Rail diesel\u2013hydraulic locomotives: [[British Rail Class 52|Class 52 \"Western\"]], [[British Rail Class 42|Class 42 \"Warship\"]] and [[British Rail Class 35|Class 35 \"Hymek\"]]]]\nDiesel-hydraulic locomotives are less efficient than diesel\u2013electrics.

The frame and cylinders of the steam locomotive would be retained and the boiler would be replaced by a diesel engine driving an [[air compressor]].  The problem was low [[thermal efficiency]] because of the large amount of energy wasted as heat in the air compressor.  Attempts were made to compensate for this by using the diesel exhaust to re-heat the compressed air but these had limited success.  A German proposal of 1929 did result in a prototype<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/diesair/diesair.htm |title=A German Diesel-Pneumatic Locomotive |publisher=Douglas-self.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> but a similar British proposal of 1932, to use an [[LNER Class R1]] locomotive, never got beyond the design stage.\n\n==Multiple-unit operation==\n[[File:GM-EMD 2000.jpg|thumb|Diesel\u2013electric locomotive built by EMD for service in the UK and continental Europe.]]\nMost diesel locomotives are capable of [[multiple-unit train control]] (MU) as a means of increasing [[horsepower]] and [[tractive effort]] when hauling heavy trains. All [[North America]]n locomotives, including export models, use a standardized [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] electrical control system interconnected by a 27-pin [[jumper cable]] between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the electrical control connections made common to all units in a [[consist]] are referred to as [[trainline (railroad)|trainlines]]. \nThe result is that all locomotives in a [[consist]] behave as one in response to the engine driver's control movements.\n\nThe ability to couple diesel\u2013electric locomotives in an MU fashion was first introduced in the [[EMD FT]] four-unit demonstrator that toured the United States in 1939. At the time, American railroad work rules required that each operating locomotive in a train had to have on board a full crew. [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] circumvented that requirement by coupling the individual units of the demonstrator with [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbars]] instead of conventional [[Railway coupling|knuckle couplers]] and declaring the combination to be a single locomotive.  Electrical interconnections were made so one engine driver could operate the entire consist from the head-end unit.  Later on, work rules were amended and the semi-permanent coupling of units with drawbars was eliminated in favour of couplers, as servicing had proved to be somewhat cumbersome owing to the total length of the consist (about 200 feet or nearly 61 meters).\n\nIn mountainous regions, it is common to interpose [[helper locomotive]]s in the middle of the train, both to provide the extra power needed to ascend a grade and to limit the amount of [[tensile stress|stress]] applied to the [[Railway coupling#Drawgear|draft gear]] of the car coupled to the head-end power.  The helper units in such [[distributed power]] configurations are controlled from the lead unit's cab through coded radio signals.  Although this is technically not an MU configuration, the behaviour is the same as with physically interconnected units.\n\n===Cab arrangements===\nCab arrangements vary by builder and operator. Practice in the U.S. has traditionally been for a cab at one end of the locomotive with limited visibility if the locomotive is not operated cab forward. This is not usually a problem as U.S. locomotives are usually operated in pairs, or threes, and arranged so that a cab is at each end of each set. European practice is usually for a cab at each end of the locomotive as trains are usually light enough to operate with one locomotive. Early U.S. practice was to add power units without cabs (booster or [[B unit]]s) and the arrangement was often A-B, A-A, A-B-A, A-B-B, or A-B-B-A where A was a unit with a cab. Center cabs were sometimes used for switch locomotives.\n\n===Cow-calf===\n{{Main|Cow-calf}}\nIn North American railroading, a [[cow-calf]] set is a pair of switcher-type locomotives: one (the cow) equipped with a driving cab, the other (the calf) without a cab, and controlled from the cow through cables.  Cow-calf sets are used in heavy switching and [[hump yard]] service. Some are radio controlled without an operating engineer present in the cab. This arrangement is also known as [[Master-slave (technology)|master-slave]]. Where two connected units were present, [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] called these TR-2s (approximately {{convert|2,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}); where three units, TR-3s (approximately {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}).\n\nCow-calves have largely disappeared as these engine combinations exceeded their economic lifetimes many years ago.\n\nPresent North American practice is to pair two {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} [[EMD GP40-2|GP40-2]] or [[EMD SD40-2|SD40-2]] road switchers, often nearly worn-out and very soon ready for rebuilding or scrapping, and to utilize these for so-called \"transfer\" uses, for which the TR-2, TR-3 and TR-4 engines were originally intended, hence the designation TR, for \"transfer\".\n\nOccasionally, the second unit may have its prime-mover and traction alternator removed and replaced by concrete or steel ballast and the power for traction obtained from the master unit.

This involves fitting a water-filled box to the exhaust pipe to quench any red-hot carbon particles that may be emitted.  Other precautions may include a fully insulated electrical system (neither side earthed to the frame) and all electric wiring enclosed in conduit.\n\nThe flameproof diesel locomotive has replaced the [[fireless steam locomotive]] in areas of high fire risk such as [[oil refineries]] and [[ammunition dump]]s.  Preserved examples of flameproof diesel locomotives include:\n* ''Francis Baily of Thatcham'' (ex-[[RAF Welford]]) at [[Southall Railway Centre]]\n* ''Naworth'' (ex-[[National Coal Board]]) at the [[South Tynedale Railway]]<ref>[http://www.strps.org.uk/str/stocklist/locos/04-Naworth.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106030908/http://www.strps.org.uk/str/stocklist/locos/04-Naworth.htm |date=January 6, 2009 }}</ref>\nLatest development of the \"Flameproof Diesel Vehicle Applied New Exhaust Gas Dry Type Treatment System\u201d does not need the water supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200210/000020021002A0274001.php/ |title=Development of the Flameproof Diesel Vehicle Applied New Exhaust Gas Dry Type Treatment System |publisher=Sciencelinks.jp |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2011-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217004508/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200210/000020021002A0274001.php/ |archivedate=2012-02-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Lights===\n[[File:Canadian National diesels southbound on the Norfolk Southern near Polaris Mall in Columbus, Ohio (2092116881).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Canadian National Railway]] train showing the placement of the headlight and ditch lights on the locomotive.]]\nThe lights fitted to diesel locomotives vary from country to country. North American locomotives are fitted with two headlights (for safety in case one malfunctions) and a pair of ditch lights. The latter are fitted low down at the front and are designed to make the locomotive easily visible as it approaches a [[grade crossing]]. Older locomotives may be fitted with a Gyralite or [[Mars Light]] instead of the ditch lights.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{See also|Diesel exhaust}}\nAlthough diesel locomotives generally emit less sulphur dioxide, a major [[Pollution|pollutant]] to the environment, and greenhouse gases than steam locomotives, they are not completely clean in that respect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.niu.edu/northerntoday/2008/sept22/locomotive.shtml |title=Engineering gets $1 million grant to make locomotives leaner, greener |publisher=Northern Illinois University |last=King |first=Joe |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910064330/http://www.niu.edu/northerntoday/2008/sept22/locomotive.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-10 }}</ref> Furthermore, like other diesel powered vehicles, they emit [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]] and [[fine particles]], which are a risk to public health. In fact, in this last respect diesel locomotives may perform worse than steam locomotives.\n\nFor years, it was thought by American government scientists who measure [[air pollution]] that diesel locomotive engines were relatively clean and emitted far less health-threatening emissions than those of diesel trucks or other vehicles; however, the scientists discovered that because they used faulty estimates of the amount of fuel consumed by diesel locomotives, they grossly understated the amount of pollution generated annually. After revising their calculations, they concluded that the annual emissions of nitrogen oxide, a major ingredient in [[smog]] and [[acid rain]], and soot would be by 2030 nearly twice what they originally assumed.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/13/AR2006081300530.html | title = Attention to Locomotives' Emissions Renewed | work = Washington Post | last = Eilperin | first = Juliet | date = 2006-08-14 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-14/news/ct-met-metra-air-testing-20110213_1_scott-fruin-outbound-trains-oldest-trains | title = Metra finds 'alarming' pollution on some trains | work = Chicago Tribune | last = Hawthorne | first = Michael | date = February 14, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}</ref> In Europe, where most major railways have been electrified, there is less concern.\n\nThis would mean that diesel locomotives would be releasing more than 800,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 25,000 tons of soot every year within a quarter of a century, in contrast to the EPA's previous projections of 480,000 tons of [[nitrogen dioxide]] and 12,000 tons of soot. Since this was discovered, to reduce the effects of the diesel locomotive on [[human]]s (who are breathing the noxious emissions) and on [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, it is considered practical to install traps in the diesel engines to reduce pollution levels<ref>{{cite news | url = http://topnews.us/content/238438-study-installed-traps-diesel-engines-reduce-pollution-levels | title = Study: Installed Traps In Diesel Engines Reduce Pollution Levels | work = Top News | last = Wilkins | first = Davell | date = 2011-04-13 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}</ref> and other forms (e.g., use of [[biodiesel]]).\n\nDiesel locomotive pollution has been of particular concern in the city of [[Chicago]].

''See''  [[List of low emissions locomotives]].\n\nOther technologies that are being deployed to reduce locomotive emissions and fuel consumption include \"Genset\" switching locomotives and hybrid [[Green Goat]] designs. Genset locomotives use multiple smaller high-speed diesel engines and generators (generator sets), rather than a single medium-speed diesel engine and a single generator.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.northeastdiesel.org/pdf/low-emissions-switcher-012206.pdf| title=Multi-Engine GenSet Ultra Low Emissions Road-Switcher Locomotive| publisher=National Railway Equipment Company| accessdate=2012-06-03}}</ref> Because of the cost of developing clean engines, these smaller high-speed engines are based on already developed truck engines.

Both designs reduce pollution below EPA Tier II standards and cut or eliminate emissions during idle.\n\n==Advantages over steam==\nAs diesel locomotives advanced, the cost of manufacturing and operating them dropped, and they became cheaper to own and operate than steam locomotives. In North America, [[steam locomotive]]s were custom-made for specific railway routes, so economies of scale were difficult to achieve.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=10}} Though more complex to produce with exacting manufacturing tolerances ({{convert|1/10000|in|adj=on|disp=or}} for diesel, compared with {{convert|1/100|in|adj=on}} for steam), diesel locomotive parts were easier to mass-produce. [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] offered almost five hundred steam models in its heyday, while [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] offered fewer than ten diesel varieties.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=19}} In the United Kingdom, [[British Railways]] built steam locomotives to standard designs from 1951 onwards. These included standard, interchangeable parts, making them cheaper to produce than the diesel locomotives then available. The capital cost per [[Tractive force|drawbar horse power]] was \u00a313 6s (steam), \u00a365 (diesel), \u00a369 7s (turbine) and \u00a317 13s (electric).<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Railway Magazine |date=January 1951 |pages=60\u201361 |title=Standardisation and Comparative Costs of Motive Power on B.R.}}</ref>\n\nDiesel locomotives offer significant operating advantages over steam locomotives.<ref>[http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html], Phil Jern \"How to Boot a Steam Locomotive\" (1990) San Diego Railroad Museum.</ref> They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives continue to have two-person crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked [[multiple working|in multiple]] with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives in a single train \u2013 something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered for use as a single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train. With steam traction, a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to [[double heading]] with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.\n\nDiesel engines can be started and stopped almost instantly, meaning that a diesel locomotive has the potential to incur no fuel costs when not being used. However, it is still the practice of large North American railroads to use straight water as a coolant in diesel engines instead of coolants that incorporate anti-freezing properties; this results in diesel locomotives being left idling when parked in cold climates instead of being completely shut down. A diesel engine can be left idling unattended for hours or even days, especially since practically every diesel engine used in locomotives has systems that automatically shut the engine down if problems such as a loss of oil pressure or coolant loss occur. Automatic start/stop systems are available which monitor coolant and engine temperatures. When the unit is close to having its coolant freeze, the system restarts the diesel engine to warm the coolant and other systems.<ref>[http://www.ztr.com/smartstart.php SmartStart\u00ae IIe \u2013 Automatic Engine Start/Stop System]. Ztr.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.</ref>\n\nSteam locomotives require intensive maintenance, lubrication, and cleaning before, during, and after use. Preparing and firing a steam locomotive for use from cold can take many hours. They can be kept in readiness between uses with a low fire, but this requires regular stoking and frequent attention to maintain the level of water in the boiler. This may be necessary to prevent the water in the boiler freezing in cold climates, so long as the water supply is not frozen.\n\nThe maintenance and operational costs of steam locomotives were much higher than diesels. Annual maintenance costs for steam locomotives accounted for 25% of the initial purchase price. Spare parts were cast from wooden masters for specific locomotives. The sheer number of unique steam locomotives meant that there was no feasible way for spare-part inventories to be maintained.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=12-17}} With diesel locomotives spare parts could be mass-produced and held in stock ready for use and many parts and sub-assemblies could be standardized across an operator's fleet using different models of locomotive from the same builder. Modern diesel locomotive engines are designed to allow the power assemblies (systems of working parts and their block interfaces) to be replaced while keeping the main block in the locomotive, which greatly reduces the time that a locomotive is out of revenue-generating service when it requires maintenance.<ref name=\"Kettering\" />\n\nSteam engines required large quantities of coal and water, which were expensive variable operating costs.<ref name=\"Stover 213\">Stover, 213</ref> Further, the [[thermal efficiency]] of steam was considerably less than that of diesel engines. Diesel's theoretical studies demonstrated potential thermal efficiencies for a compression ignition engine of 36% (compared with 6\u201310% for steam), and an 1897 one-cylinder prototype operated at a remarkable 26% efficiency.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=14}}\n\nHowever, one study published in 1959 suggested that many of the comparisons between diesel and steam locomotives were made unfairly. mostly because diesels were newer. After painstaking analysis of financial records and technological progress, the author found that if research had continued on steam technology instead of diesel, there would be negligible financial benefit in converting to diesel locomotion.<ref>Brown, H.
