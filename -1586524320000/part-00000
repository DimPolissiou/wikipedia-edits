The film was directed by [[Asif Kapadia]] and produced by [[James Gay-Rees]], George Pank, and Paul Bell and co-produced by Krishwerkz Entertainment, On The Corner Films, Playmaker Films, and [[Universal Music]], in association with [[Film4 Productions|Film4]].

[[David Joseph]], CEO of [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music UK]], announced that the documentary entitled simply ''Amy'' would be released later that year. He further stated: \"About two years ago we decided to make a movie about her\u2014her career and her life. It's a very complicated and tender movie.

The rest of the documentary shows the songwriter's life, in a chronological order from her early childhood, to her music career, which attained commercial success through her debut album, ''[[Frank (Amy Winehouse album)|Frank]]'' (2003), and second, final album ''[[Back to Black]]'' (2006), to her troubled relationships, [[self-harm]], [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], the controversial media attention, and her downfall with her drug and alcohol addiction, all until her death in 2011.

The film also shows various interviews, such as with [[Jonathan Ross]], [[Tim Kash]], and a funny video of when Winehouse is interviewed and talked to about singer [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] in 2004, when she promoted her debut album. The documentary also includes when Winehouse was at the [[50th Grammy Awards|Grammy Awards]] in 2008, when she is seen winning the award for \"Record of the Year\".\n\nThe film also features footage from when she was filmed with her ex-husband Blake Fielder-Civil, various performances, and when she auditioned at [[Island Records]] in February 2003, singing \"I Heard Love Is Blind\". Also included is footage from when she was recording her second album in March 2006 and a duet single, \"[[Body and Soul (1930 song)|Body and Soul]]\", with [[Tony Bennett]] in March 2011 as her last recording before her death.

Winehouse's father, who was a fan of the director's previous documentary film ''[[Senna (film)|Senna]]'' (2010), wanted the same treatment to be given to his late daughter's documentary. However, upon watching the completed film about Winehouse, Mitch was unhappy with how the film portrayed him. Feeling he had been portrayed as the villain, Mitch threatened legal action until limited changes were made to the film. However, he has still publicly condemned the final cut of the film, claiming that Kapadia had an agenda to make him the anti-hero from the start.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nMitch requested that he wants the film to be further edited, but the film crew have declined his wish, adding: \"When we were approached to make the film, we came on board with the full backing of the Winehouse family, and we approached the project with total objectivity.\" They said the film reflects findings from around \"100 interviews with people that knew Amy\". On 3 July 2015 (the day ''Amy'' was initially released), the singer's father, Mitch appeared on ''[[Loose Women]]'' to defend his place against the film and announced that himself and Winehouse's former boyfriend, [[Reg Traviss]] are making an alternative film, entitled ''A Letter To Amy'', so it's a \"more accurate\" project, to \"correct all the wrongs and omissions\" that were in Kapadia's film.<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/amy-winehouses-dad-ex-boyfriend-5985040 |title=Amy Winehouse's dad and ex boyfriend want to make their own film of her life |newspaper=The Daily Mirror |date=1 July 2015 |accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref> On 24 February 2016, Winehouse's father, Mitch reappeared on ''This Morning'' once again and stated that he would prefer [[Adele]] to win the award that his late daughter was posthumously nominated for at the [[2016 BRIT Awards]].<ref name=\"''Metro\">{{cite news |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/24/amy-winehouses-dad-doesnt-want-his-late-daughter-to-win-at-the-brits-5714988/ |title=Amy Winehouse's dad wants Adele to win the BRIT over his late daughter |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |first=Tamara |last=Hardingham-Gill |date=24 February 2016 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref> This was because the nomination for \"British Female Solo Artist\" was as a result of the film's success, which he seemed to be unhappy about.\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-  style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!

He further stated: \"About two years ago we decided to make a movie about her\u2014her career and her life. It's a very complicated and tender movie. It tackles lots of things about family and media, fame, addiction, but most importantly, it captures the very heart of what she was about, which is an amazing person and a true musical genius.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/amy-winehouse-documentary-trailer-upcoming-5125655 |title=Amy Winehouse documentary: Trailer for upcoming film debuts at pre-Grammy brunch |first=Simon |last=Keegan |date=8 February 2015 |newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror]] |accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref> The film was shown in the Midnight Screenings section at the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=\"Cannes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/61306.html |title=2015 Official Selection |accessdate=16 April 2015 |website=Cannes Film Festival |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418084150/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/61306.html |archivedate=18 April 2015  }}</ref> and received its UK premiere at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"HWR\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amy-winehouse-doc-uk-premiere-798261 |date=27 May 2015 |first=Alex |last=Ritman |title=Amy Winehouse Doc 'Amy' Getting U.K. Premiere at Edinburgh Film Festival |accessdate=29 May 2015 |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\nThe film was distributed by the [[Altitude Film Distribution]] and [[A24 (company)|A24]], and was released theatrically on 3 July 2015; it received critical acclaim.

He then added: \"Half of me wants to say don't go see it.

Winehouse's father, who was a fan of the director's previous documentary film ''[[Senna (film)|Senna]]'' (2010), wanted the same treatment to be given to his late daughter's documentary. However, upon watching the completed film about Winehouse, Mitch was unhappy with how the film portrayed him. Feeling he had been portrayed as the villain, Mitch threatened legal action until limited changes were made to the film. However, he has still publicly condemned the final cut of the film, claiming that Kapadia had an agenda to make him the anti-hero from the start.<ref name=\"independent.co.uk\"/>\n\nMitch requested that he wants the film to be further edited, but the film crew have declined his wish, adding: \"When we were approached to make the film, we came on board with the full backing of the Winehouse family, and we approached the project with total objectivity.\" They said the film reflects findings from around \"100 interviews with people that knew Amy\". On 3 July 2015 (the day ''Amy'' was initially released), the singer's father, Mitch appeared on ''[[Loose Women]]'' to defend his place against the film and announced that himself and Winehouse's former boyfriend, [[Reg Traviss]] are making an alternative film, entitled ''A Letter To Amy'', so it's a \"more accurate\" project, to \"correct all the wrongs and omissions\" that were in Kapadia's film.<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/amy-winehouses-dad-ex-boyfriend-5985040 |title=Amy Winehouse's dad and ex boyfriend want to make their own film of her life |newspaper=The Daily Mirror |date=1 July 2015 |accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref> On 24 February 2016, Winehouse's father, Mitch reappeared on ''This Morning'' once again and stated that he would prefer [[Adele]] to win the award that his late daughter was posthumously nominated for at the [[2016 BRIT Awards]].<ref name=\"''Metro\">{{cite news |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/24/amy-winehouses-dad-doesnt-want-his-late-daughter-to-win-at-the-brits-5714988/ |title=Amy Winehouse's dad wants Adele to win the BRIT over his late daughter |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |first=Tamara |last=Hardingham-Gill |date=24 February 2016 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref> This was because the nomination for \"British Female Solo Artist\" was as a result of the film's success, which he seemed to be unhappy about.\n\n==Accolades==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-  style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n!
