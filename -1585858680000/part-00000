It was written in the late 1970s and copyrighted in 1978. It traveled a complex and circuitous route to publication, before being officially released in 1984. It remains Acker's most popular and best-selling book. The novel is also considered a [[metafiction]]al text, which is aware of its status as a fictional piece. The novel explores but simultaneously deconstructs the American politics of the time it was written and intercontinental history tying into the novel's subject of [[human trafficking]], while being interspersed with sections of sexually detailed drawings, dream maps, symbolism and non-linear writing.\n\n==Plot and narrative==\n''Blood and Guts in High School'', while having a frequently disrupted and heavily surreal narrative, is the story of Janey Smith, a ten-year-old American girl living in [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]], Mexico, who departs to the US to live on her own. She has an [[incest]]uous sexual relationship with her father, whom she treats as \"boyfriend, brother, sister, money, amusement, and father.\" They live together in Mexico until another woman begins to interest Janey's father, leading Janey to realize he hates her because she limits him by dominating his life, and he wants to have his own life. Her father agrees to let her go and puts her into a school in New York City. For a period of time her father sends her money, but later she begins to work at a [[hippie]] bakery and is appalled by the customers, whose behavior gradually spirals out of control. She ends up having many sexual partners. She ends up pregnant twice and has two abortions; she seems to be furiously addicted to sex and does not care whom she sleeps with. In New York City she joins a gang, the Scorpions. One day, while the gang is driving frantically in a stolen car from the police, they are involved in a car crash: Janey is the only one who survives. Afterwards, she begins to live in the New York slums. Two thieves break into her apartment, kidnap her, and [[forced prostitution|sell her into prostitution]]. She becomes the property of a Persian [[human trafficking|slave trader]] who keeps her locked up, trying to turn her out as a prostitute. We see Janey's dreams and visions, and read her journal entries and poems as the lines between reality and fiction begin to become blurred.\n\nShortly before the kidnapper is to release her to become a prostitute for him, she discovers she has cancer. The slave trader lets her go and she illegally goes to [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]]. There she meets [[Jean Genet]], the iconic French writer, and they develop a relationship while Janey vulgarly and intensely discusses but later becomes attracted to President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Janey and Genet travel through [[North Africa]] and stop in [[Alexandria]]. Genet treats Janey badly and thinks little of her, but the worse he treats her the more she loves him. He decides to leave her. Janey gets arrested for stealing Genet's property, and shortly afterwards, by her luck, he joins her in prison. A rebellion breaks out as the narrative continues to deteriorate while particular figures, collectively named the [[Capitalism|Capitalist]]s, meet to discuss how their society is collapsing. As it peaks, Janey and Genet are both thrown out of Alexandria. After travelling together across North Africa for some time, Genet gives Janey some money and leaves. However, soon after they part company, Janey dies suddenly, leaving time to pass endlessly as the narrative breaks into a final set of dream maps; here, the novel concludes.\n\n==Storytelling technique==\nIn ''Blood and Guts in High School'', Acker uses the technique of [[Collage novel|collage]]. She inserts letters, poems, drama scenes, dream visions and drawings. This creates a challenging text with a disturbed linearity. Acker freely admitted to using plagiarism in her work. The novel is considered an anti-narrative work since it jumps in and out of narration and contains different narrators. The narrative of the story is disrupted with pornographic drawings, letters, and dream maps to further disembody the plot but place the reader in the narrative itself. \u201cAcker\u2019s novel incorporates at least three main threads of [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] discourse into Janey\u2019s narrative. The first is an exploration biopower; the second is a reading of the [[Oedipus complex|oedipal]] family as pathology; and the third is an analysis of the gender politics of language\u201d (Muth 90).\n\n''Blood and Guts in High School'' incorporates the text from one of Acker's previous works, \"Hello, I'm Erica Jong\", a [[chapbook]] written [[Passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive]]ly and vulgarly towards novelist and feminist satirist [[Erica Jong]].\n\n{{Quote|\n...while writing it, I never considered that ''Blood and Guts in High School'' is especially [[misandry|anti-male]], but people have been very upset about it on that ground. When I wrote it I think it was in my mind to do a traditional narrative. I thought it was kind of sweet at the time, but of course it's not.\n|Kathy Acker<ref>{{cite journal|title=A Conversation with Kathy Acker By Ellen G. Friedman|journal=The Review of Contemporary Fiction|date=Fall 1989|volume=9|issue=3|url=http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-kathy-acker-by-ellen-g-friedman/}}</ref>}}\n\nLike the novel's heroine, Janey, Acker also died of breast cancer, twenty years after writing ''Blood and Guts''.  Many of Acker's heroines have or fear getting cancer.\n\n==Critical reception==\nOut of all of Acker's books, ''Blood and Guts in High School'' has received the most diverse criticisms and reviews. Many writers have tried analyzing ''Blood and Guts'' to understand exactly what Acker was trying to accomplish. Katie R. Muth in her article described ''Blood and Guts'' as a novel that draws arguments from [[gender studies]], global capitalism, and theories of subject formation (89). Susan E. Hawkins describes ''Blood and Guts'' as a text that contains [[plagiarism]], [[parody]], [[pastiche]], and other [[anti-realism|antirealist]] techniques that mark her work as postmodern (Hawkins 637). According to Hawkins, Acker is motivated by two discourses: the oedipal and the imperial (642). Using the mechanism of sexual and economic oppression, Acker is able to actualize the taboo surrounding incest by associating it with capitalism to demystify the oedipal formation of desire in the Western culture (Hawkins 646).\n\nAnother critical review that ''Blood and Guts'' received is the narrative technique in the story. Not only is the narrating technique unstable and at times, unreliable, but the narrator herself, Janey, a 10-year-old girl, who lives until 14, experiences things that no little girl should. Kathy Hughes in her analysis takes a look at this approach by Acker and the overall effect of the novel when told from a 10-year-old perspective. Hughes argues that Acker attacks and flips the Freudian theory upside down through sarcasm and irony (Hughes 124). And a 10-year-old can accomplish what society is afraid of doing because of their simple matter of fact speaking,  \u201cJaney, as a child, does not have the socialization to throw the veil of intellectual language over the horrors of her daily life, thus Acker does not utilize poetics when describing her life\u201d (Hughes 127).\n\n''Blood and Guts'' was banned as being pornographic in [[West Germany]] and South Africa. It is featured in Peter Boxall's book, ''[[1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die]]'' and ''The Little Black Book of Books''.\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[Laura Parnes]] created a \"re-imagining\" of the novel as a multi-screen [[video art]] piece in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hi-beam.net/fw/fw30/1780.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311095138/http://www.hi-beam.net/fw/fw30/1780.html |archivedate=2007-03-11 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n*Hawkins, Susan E.

It takes place in a fictional version of the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Golden Age of Piracy|age of piracy]]. The player assumes the role of [[Guybrush Threepwood]], a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles.\n\nThe game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee [[Ron Gilbert]], who designed it with [[Tim Schafer]] and [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]]. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the [[player character]]'s death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] theme park ride. ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' was the fifth game built with the [[SCUMM]] engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.\n\nThe early releases of the game came with copy-protection. A cardboard wheel, named \"Dial-a-Pirate\", was provided, and the player had to match the pirate shown on-screen with that of the wheel.<ref>http://www.oldgames.sk/docs/Dial-A-Pirate/</ref> \n\nCritics praised ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' for its humor, audiovisuals, and gameplay. The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the [[Monkey Island (series)|''Monkey Island'' series]].

It takes place in a fictional version of the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Golden Age of Piracy|age of piracy]]. The player assumes the role of [[Guybrush Threepwood]], a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles.\n\nThe game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee [[Ron Gilbert]], who designed it with [[Tim Schafer]] and [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]]. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the [[player character]]'s death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] theme park ride. ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' was the fifth game built with the [[SCUMM]] engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.\n\nThe early releases of the game came with copy-protection. A cardboard wheel, named \"Dial-a-Pirate\", was provided, and the player had to match the pirate shown on-screen with that of the wheel.<ref>http://www.oldgames.sk/docs/Dial-A-Pirate/</ref> \n\nCritics praised ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' for its humor, audiovisuals, and gameplay. The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the [[Monkey Island (series)|''Monkey Island'' series]]. Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman also led the development of the sequel ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4070/back_in_the_water_the_monkey_.php?print=1 |title=Back in the Water: The Monkey Island Interview |date=July 6, 2009 |author=Chris Remo |website=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=December 10, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214135420/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4070/back_in_the_water_the_monkey_.php?print=1 |archivedate=February 14, 2011 }}</ref> LucasArts released a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the original in 2009, which was also well received by the gaming press.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Secret of Monkey Island'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[adventure game]] played from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]].

In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required.<ref name=\"DThreads\"/> Grossman believed that this benefited the game's writing, as he and Schafer \"were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together\".<ref name=\"MSNBC\"/> Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised.<ref name=\"RGInt\"/> Some of the dialogue was based on the designers' personal experiences, such as Guybrush's line \"I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms\", which came from Schafer's own hatred of fungi.<ref name=\"GG1\"/>\n\nThe game's world and characters were designed primarily by Gilbert. After having read [[Tim Powers]]' historical fantasy novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'', he decided to add [[paranormal]] themes to the game's plot.

{"title_page": "Group 4 element", "text_new": "{{periodic table (group 4)}}\n'''Group 4''' is a [[Group (periodic table)|group]] of [[Chemical element|elements]] in the [[periodic table]].\nIt contains the elements [[titanium]] (Ti), [[zirconium]] (Zr), [[hafnium]] (Hf) and [[rutherfordium]] (Rf). This group lies in the [[d-block]] of the periodic table. The group itself has not acquired a [[trivial name]]; it belongs to the broader grouping of the [[transition metal]]s.\n\nThe three group 4 elements that occur naturally are titanium, zirconium and hafnium. The first three members of the group share similar properties; all three are hard [[refractory metals]] under standard conditions. However, the fourth element rutherfordium (Rf), has been synthesized in the laboratory; none of its isotopes have been found occurring in nature. All isotopes of rutherfordium are [[radioactive]]. So far, no experiments in a [[supercollider]] have been conducted to [[synthetic element|synthesize]] the next member of the group, either unpenthexium (Uph, element 156) or unpentoctium (Upo, element 158), and it is unlikely that they will be synthesized in the near future.\n\n==Characteristics==\n<!--<div align=\"center\">\n<gallery caption=\"Metals made by the [[Crystal bar process|iodide process]]\">\nFile:Titan-crystal_bar.JPG|A titanium crystal bar, 99,995 %\nFile:Zr-crystal-bar.jpg|A zirconium crystal bar, 99,97 %\nFile:Hf-crystal bar.jpg|A hafnium crystal bar, >&nbsp;99,9 %\n</gallery>\n</div>\n\n[[Image:Zirconium rod.jpg|thumb|right|Zirconium rod]]-->\n\n===Chemistry===\nLike other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration, especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

The chemistry of rutherfordium is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a high melting point (1668&nbsp;\u00b0C, 1855&nbsp;\u00b0C, 2233&nbsp;\u00b0C, 2100&nbsp;\u00b0C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides [[Titanium dioxide|TiO<sub>2</sub>]], [[Zirconium dioxide|ZrO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Hafnium(IV) oxide|HfO<sub>2</sub>]] are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.<ref name=\"Holl\">{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91\u2013100|pages=1056\u20131057|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|last2= Wiberg|first2=Egon|last3=Wiberg|first3=Nils|language = German}}</ref>\n\nAs tetravalent transition metals, all three elements form various [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic compounds]], generally in the oxidation state of +4.

At higher temperatures, all three metals react with [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[carbon]], [[boron]], [[sulfur]], and [[silicon]]. Because of the [[lanthanide contraction]] of the elements in the [[period 5 element|fifth period]], zirconium and hafnium have nearly identical [[ionic radius|ionic radii]].

The formation of [[oxide]]s, [[nitride]]s and [[carbide]]s must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the [[Kroll process]]. The oxides (MO<sub>2</sub>) are reacted with [[coal]] and [[chlorine]] to form the chlorides (MCl<sub>4</sub>). The chlorides of the metals are then reacted with magnesium, yielding [[magnesium chloride]] and the metals.\n\nFurther purification is done by a [[chemical transport reaction]] developed by [[Anton Eduard van Arkel]] and [[Jan Hendrik de Boer]]. In a closed vessel, the metal reacts with [[iodine]] at temperatures above 500&nbsp;\u00b0C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of nearly 2000&nbsp;\u00b0C the reverse reaction happens and the iodine and metal are set free. The metal forms a solid coating on the tungsten filament and the iodine can react with additional metal resulting in a steady turnover.<ref name=\"Holl\"/><ref name=\"Ark1925\">{{cite journal|title = Darstellung von reinem Titanium-, Zirkonium-, Hafnium- und Thoriummetall (Production of pure titanium, zirconium, hafnium and Thorium metal)| journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anorganische und Allgemeine Chemie|volume = 148|issue = 1|year = 1925|pages = 345\u2013350|first =A.

The old Nagpur (today called 'Mahal') is situated on north banks of the river Nag. The suffix ''pur'' means \"city\" in many Indian languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/most/p2vidal.htm|title=Management of Social Transformations (MOST) Programme \u2013 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nOne of the earlier names of Nagpur was \"Fanindrapura\". It derives its origin from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''fana'' (\u092b\u0923\u093e; meaning hood of a [[cobra]]). Nagpur's first newspaper was named ''Fanindramani'', which means a jewel that is believed to be suspended over a cobra's hood.

Moore has dinner with Laszlo Kreizler, the famous [[alienist]]. Kreizler is surrounded by those he has rescued, including his black servant, Cyrus Montrose, and a boy named Stevie \"Stevepipe\" Taggert. (Mary Palmer, another patient and Kreizler's housekeeper, is deceased by the time of this dinner.) Together, they reminisce about their times with Roosevelt, but they focus on one moment: the spring of 1896 and their efforts to catch a serial killer on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. The novel is narrated in retrospect, with Moore commenting on the events and how they impacted later history.\n\nAt 2 AM on March 3, 1896, Moore is awakened by one of Kreizler's servants banging incessantly on his door. Stevie, a young boy whom Kreizler had saved from being institutionalized and who is dedicated to Kreizler, brings Moore to the scene of a crime that Kreizler wants Moore to see. Roosevelt, the police commissioner, is already at the scene. When Moore sees the nature of the brutal murder, he is appalled. The victim, Georgio \"Gloria\" Santorelli, is a 13-year-old boy who prostituted himself by dressing up as a girl; the boy's wrists are tied behind his back, and he is kneeling with his face pressed on the steel walkway where he was found. Though makeup paint and powder on his face are still intact, his eyes are gouged out, his right hand is chopped off, his genitals are cut off and stuffed between his jaws, he has huge gashes across his entire body, his throat has been slashed, and his buttocks are \"shorn off\". The policeman at the scene, Detective Sergeant Connor, makes it clear that murders of such victims are usually ignored.\n\n{{Quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote=\"Prior to the twentieth century, persons suffering from mental illness were thought to be 'alienated,' not only from the rest of society but from their own true natures.

Kreizler has examined the body and disagrees with the official coroner's report. He connects the Santorelli killing to that of a second case in which two children, Benjamin and Sofia Zweig, were killed and had their eyes gouged out. Roosevelt announces that there are two more murders that match the pattern. Roosevelt decides to investigate, but because Kreizler has such a dubious reputation as an alienist, and because the investigation will become politically difficult, he establishes a base of operations for them outside the police precinct. Politically, Roosevelt cannot afford to be associated with the investigation and is not involved with the day-to-day operations.\n\nKreizler asks for some young detectives who are open to new methods and receives the help of Sara Howard, the first woman to be hired by the police department, and Marcus and Lucius Isaacson, two Jewish brothers who were hired when Roosevelt began removing corrupt police officers from the force. The Isaacsons bring sophisticated methods, such as the [[Bertillon system]] and fingerprinting, to the investigation, although these were not popular in New York City police departments at the time nor accepted in courts of law.\n\nThe group begins to investigate the victims, hoping to understand the mind of the murderer by understanding his victims. They interview Georgio Santorelli's mother and discover, for example, that there was discord in his family. Georgio's parents had learned of his being manipulated into performing sexual acts for older boys in school, and the father's response was to try to beat it out of the boy. Georgio eventually left home and lived on the streets as a male-for-male prostitute. They also read the emerging science of psychology, such as the works of [[William James]]. Another body is discovered, and the evidence suggests that the victim knew his attacker. The team also deduces that the killer's agility on rooftops suggests that he is familiar with mountain- or rock-climbing.\n\nKreizler, Roosevelt, Moore, and Howard must deal with various interest groups during their investigation who wish to maintain society's status quo, including a corrupt police force, which takes bribes from owners of the brothels whose prostitutes include poor immigrants; the Catholic Church, which is wary of the potential power of an organized immigrant population; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]; and [[J. P. Morgan]].\n\n== Characters ==\n;John Moore: a freelance reporter and the narrator of the novel;\n;Dr. Laszlo Kreizler: the titular alienist of the novel;\n;Sara Howard: Moore's longtime friend, now a secretary at NYPD headquarters;\n;Stevie Taggert: Kreizler's teenage groom and carriage driver;\n;Cyrus Montrose: Kreizler's valet and bodyguard;\n;Mary Palmer: Kreizler's housemaid;\n;Marcus and Lucius Isaacson: twin brother Detective Sergeants with the NYPD;\n\n=== Historical figures ===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Thomas F.

One night, the scoutmaster supposedly made a move on Lucien Carr, and Carr stabbed him in the chest with his boy scout knife. Carr disposed of the body in the [[Hudson River]], and together he and Kerouac got rid of the knife. Carr was sentenced to two years' jail time and Kerouac a few days.<ref name=Capuzzo/>\n\nCaleb Carr was \"fascinated with the psychology of killers, who were subliminally acting out the pain of being controlled by monstrous parents by controlling and killing victims, seeking a release that would never come.\"<ref name=Capuzzo/> As he explains, \"For me it began in New York with the [[Son of Sam]] killings while I was in college...I think I can understand some of the kind of rage that's behind what they do.

Moore has dinner with Laszlo Kreizler, the famous [[alienist]]. Kreizler is surrounded by those he has rescued, including his black servant, Cyrus Montrose, and a boy named Stevie \"Stevepipe\" Taggert. (Mary Palmer, another patient and Kreizler's housekeeper, is deceased by the time of this dinner.) Together, they reminisce about their times with Roosevelt, but they focus on one moment: the spring of 1896 and their efforts to catch a serial killer on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. The novel is narrated in retrospect, with Moore commenting on the events and how they impacted later history.\n\nAt 2 AM on March 3, 1896, Moore is awakened by one of Kreizler's servants banging incessantly on his door. Stevie, a young boy whom Kreizler had saved from being institutionalized and who is dedicated to Kreizler, brings Moore to the scene of a crime that Kreizler wants Moore to see. Roosevelt, the police commissioner, is already at the scene. When Moore sees the nature of the brutal murder, he is appalled. The victim, Georgio \"Gloria\" Santorelli, is a 13-year-old boy who prostituted himself by dressing up as a girl; the boy's wrists are tied behind his back, and he is kneeling with his face pressed on the steel walkway where he was found. Though makeup paint and powder on his face are still intact, his eyes are gouged out, his right hand is chopped off, his genitals are cut off and stuffed between his jaws, he has huge gashes across his entire body, his throat has been slashed, and his buttocks are \"shorn off\". The policeman at the scene, Detective Sergeant Connor, makes it clear that murders of such victims are usually ignored.\n\n{{Quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote=\"Prior to the twentieth century, persons suffering from mental illness were thought to be 'alienated,' not only from the rest of society but from their own true natures.

Kreizler has examined the body and disagrees with the official coroner's report. He connects the Santorelli killing to that of a second case in which two children, Benjamin and Sofia Zweig, were killed and had their eyes gouged out. Roosevelt announces that there are two more murders that match the pattern. Roosevelt decides to investigate, but because Kreizler has such a dubious reputation as an alienist, and because the investigation will become politically difficult, he establishes a base of operations for them outside the police precinct. Politically, Roosevelt cannot afford to be associated with the investigation and is not involved with the day-to-day operations.\n\nKreizler asks for some young detectives who are open to new methods and receives the help of Sara Howard, the first woman to be hired by the police department, and Marcus and Lucius Isaacson, two Jewish brothers who were hired when Roosevelt began removing corrupt police officers from the force. The Isaacsons bring sophisticated methods, such as the [[Bertillon system]] and fingerprinting, to the investigation, although these were not popular in New York City police departments at the time nor accepted in courts of law.\n\nThe group begins to investigate the victims, hoping to understand the mind of the murderer by understanding his victims. They interview Georgio Santorelli's mother and discover, for example, that there was discord in his family. Georgio's parents had learned of his being manipulated into performing sexual acts for older boys in school, and the father's response was to try to beat it out of the boy. Georgio eventually left home and lived on the streets as a male-for-male prostitute. They also read the emerging science of psychology, such as the works of [[William James]]. Another body is discovered, and the evidence suggests that the victim knew his attacker. The team also deduces that the killer's agility on rooftops suggests that he is familiar with mountain- or rock-climbing.\n\nKreizler, Roosevelt, Moore, and Howard must deal with various interest groups during their investigation who wish to maintain society's status quo, including a corrupt police force, which takes bribes from owners of the brothels whose prostitutes include poor immigrants; the Catholic Church, which is wary of the potential power of an organized immigrant population; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]; and [[J. P. Morgan]].\n\n== Characters ==\n;John Moore: a freelance reporter and the narrator of the novel;\n;Dr. Laszlo Kreizler: the titular alienist of the novel;\n;Sara Howard: Moore's longtime friend, now a secretary at NYPD headquarters;\n;Stevie Taggert: Kreizler's teenage groom and carriage driver;\n;Cyrus Montrose: Kreizler's valet and bodyguard;\n;Mary Palmer: Kreizler's housemaid;\n;Marcus and Lucius Isaacson: twin brother Detective Sergeants with the NYPD;\n\n=== Historical figures ===\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Thomas F.

One night, the scoutmaster supposedly made a move on Lucien Carr, and Carr stabbed him in the chest with his boy scout knife.

It is a heavily travelled commuter and truck [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] route with the southwest quadrant serving as a portion of the [[CANAMEX Corridor]] that links Canada to the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]].  Henday is one of the busiest highways in [[Western Canada]], carrying over 108,000 [[Annual average daily traffic|vehicles per day]] near [[West Edmonton Mall]] in 2019.  Rush hour congestion is common on the four-lane section in southwest Edmonton where traffic levels have doubled Alberta Transportation estimates due to rapid suburban development. Alberta has committed to widening this section to six lanes by 2022; work on the $100&nbsp;million project was set to begin in fall 2019.\n\n[[Calgary Trail & Gateway Boulevard|Calgary Trail]] in south Edmonton is designated as the starting point of the ring, with exit numbers increasing clockwise as the freeway proceeds across the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to the [[Cameron Heights, Edmonton|Cameron Heights]] neighbourhood, then north past [[Whitemud Drive]], [[Stony Plain Road]] and [[Yellowhead Trail]] to [[St. Albert, Alberta|St.&nbsp;Albert]].  It continues east past [[97 Street, Edmonton|97&nbsp;Street]] to [[Alberta Highway 15#Manning Drive|Manning Drive]], then south across the North Saskatchewan River a second time.  Entering [[Strathcona County]], it again crosses Yellowhead Trail and Whitemud Drive, passing the community of [[Sherwood Park]].  Continuing south to [[Alberta Highway 14|Highway&nbsp;14]], the road re-enters southeast Edmonton and turns west to complete the ring.\n\nThe freeway was named after 18th&nbsp;century explorer [[Anthony Henday]], one of the first European men to explore central Alberta.  Its designation of 216 is derived from its bypass linkages to Edmonton's two major crossroads, Highways&nbsp;[[Alberta Highway 2|2]] and [[Alberta Highway 16|16]].  Constructed over 26&nbsp;years at a cost of $4.3&nbsp;billion, Henday became the first freeway to surround a major Canadian city when the final segment opened on October&nbsp;1, 2016.  Planning of the ring began in the 1950s, followed by design work and initial land acquisition in the 1970s, and construction of the first [[Limited-access road|expressway]] segment beginning in 1990.  Plans for Henday were developed in tandem with [[Stoney Trail]], a similar ring road freeway around [[Calgary]].\n\n== Route description ==\n===Overview===\nAlberta Transportation describes Anthony Henday Drive as a \"barrier-free, illuminated, high speed, free-flow, fully access controlled facility\" with a posted [[Speed limits in Canada|speed limit]] of {{cvt|100|km/h}} for its entire length around Edmonton,<ref name=Ramsay2/> the first ring road of its type in Canada.<ref name=Taylor/> The majority of [[Edmonton Capital Region|Capital Region]] residents reside within the approximate {{convert|20|km|adj=on}} diameter of the ring and there is extensive suburban development in close proximity to Henday.<ref name=delay/> By physical size, Edmonton is larger than both [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]], but has a relatively low population density. Some have argued that the freeway is a significant contributor to [[urban sprawl]] in the region.<ref name=sprawl/> The city also lacks a free-flowing north&ndash;south route, further increasing traffic levels on Anthony Henday Drive.<ref name=overmap/>\n\nThe road travels primarily through [[suburb]]an residential areas in the south and west of the city, and rural farm lands and [[wetland]]s in the north.<ref name=NEenviro/>{{rp|i}}  The eastern section of the road separates the Sherwood Park portion of [[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]] and other industrial and commercial developments in Edmonton to the west, from the balance of Sherwood Park to the east.<ref name=overmap/>  At its widest point east of Edmonton between Whitemud Drive and Sherwood Park Freeway, Anthony Henday Drive is eight total lanes wide which includes three main travel lanes in each direction plus a fourth lane allowing traffic to merge onto and exit from the roadway.  The highest number of through lanes is seven, between Aurum Road and 153&nbsp;Avenue in northeast Edmonton.<ref name=overmap/>  Most of the road is paved with [[asphalt]], except for an experimental {{cvt|14.4|km}} [[concrete]] segment in southwest Edmonton, the first of its type in the province.<ref name=concrete2/>  Alberta Transportation intended for the section to have lower long-term maintenance costs, but only six years after construction it required significant repairs.<ref name=concrete/> Concrete was not considered for subsequent sections of the road, but overall it was deemed to be a successful experiment that would net long term savings.<ref name=delay/>\n\n===West and north Edmonton===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right || direction = vertical\n| image1 = North Sask Bridge.jpg\n| alt1 = Anthony Henday Drive bridges over the North Saskatchewan River in southwest Edmonton, Alberta.

It ran parallel to the railway line that bisects the interchange.

It is a heavily travelled commuter and truck [[Bypass (road)|bypass]] route with the southwest quadrant serving as a portion of the [[CANAMEX Corridor]] that links Canada to the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]].  Henday is one of the busiest highways in [[Western Canada]], carrying over 108,000 [[Annual average daily traffic|vehicles per day]] near [[West Edmonton Mall]] in 2019.  Rush hour congestion is common on the four-lane section in southwest Edmonton where traffic levels have doubled Alberta Transportation estimates due to rapid suburban development. Alberta has committed to widening this section to six lanes by 2022; work on the $100&nbsp;million project was set to begin in fall 2019.\n\n[[Calgary Trail & Gateway Boulevard|Calgary Trail]] in south Edmonton is designated as the starting point of the ring, with exit numbers increasing clockwise as the freeway proceeds across the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to the [[Cameron Heights, Edmonton|Cameron Heights]] neighbourhood, then north past [[Whitemud Drive]], [[Stony Plain Road]] and [[Yellowhead Trail]] to [[St. Albert, Alberta|St.&nbsp;Albert]].  It continues east past [[97 Street, Edmonton|97&nbsp;Street]] to [[Alberta Highway 15#Manning Drive|Manning Drive]], then south across the North Saskatchewan River a second time.  Entering [[Strathcona County]], it again crosses Yellowhead Trail and Whitemud Drive, passing the community of [[Sherwood Park]].  Continuing south to [[Alberta Highway 14|Highway&nbsp;14]], the road re-enters southeast Edmonton and turns west to complete the ring.\n\nThe freeway was named after 18th&nbsp;century explorer [[Anthony Henday]], one of the first European men to explore central Alberta.  Its designation of 216 is derived from its bypass linkages to Edmonton's two major crossroads, Highways&nbsp;[[Alberta Highway 2|2]] and [[Alberta Highway 16|16]].  Constructed over 26&nbsp;years at a cost of $4.3&nbsp;billion, Henday became the first freeway to surround a major Canadian city when the final segment opened on October&nbsp;1, 2016.  Planning of the ring began in the 1950s, followed by design work and initial land acquisition in the 1970s, and construction of the first [[Limited-access road|expressway]] segment beginning in 1990.  Plans for Henday were developed in tandem with [[Stoney Trail]], a similar ring road freeway around [[Calgary]].\n\n== Route description ==\n===Overview===\nAlberta Transportation describes Anthony Henday Drive as a \"barrier-free, illuminated, high speed, free-flow, fully access controlled facility\" with a posted [[Speed limits in Canada|speed limit]] of {{cvt|100|km/h}} for its entire length around Edmonton,<ref name=Ramsay2/> the first ring road of its type in Canada.<ref name=Taylor/> The majority of [[Edmonton Capital Region|Capital Region]] residents reside within the approximate {{convert|20|km|adj=on}} diameter of the ring and there is extensive suburban development in close proximity to Henday.<ref name=delay/> By physical size, Edmonton is larger than both [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]], but has a relatively low population density. Some have argued that the freeway is a significant contributor to [[urban sprawl]] in the region.<ref name=sprawl/> The city also lacks a free-flowing north&ndash;south route, further increasing traffic levels on Anthony Henday Drive.<ref name=overmap/>\n\nThe road travels primarily through [[suburb]]an residential areas in the south and west of the city, and rural farm lands and [[wetland]]s in the north.<ref name=NEenviro/>{{rp|i}}  The eastern section of the road separates the Sherwood Park portion of [[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]] and other industrial and commercial developments in Edmonton to the west, from the balance of Sherwood Park to the east.<ref name=overmap/>  At its widest point east of Edmonton between Whitemud Drive and Sherwood Park Freeway, Anthony Henday Drive is eight total lanes wide which includes three main travel lanes in each direction plus a fourth lane allowing traffic to merge onto and exit from the roadway.

Only minor aesthetic work remained such as landscaping, completion of [[mechanically stabilized earth]] walls, and painting of [[wing wall]]s, [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], and [[abutment]]s.<ref name=abringopen/>\n\n== Future ==\nThe entire freeway road was built with expansion in mind; almost all bridges were built wide enough for expansion to the ultimate stage which includes as many as six main travel lanes in one direction, depending on location.<ref name=NWS18/><ref name=Ramsay/>  In June 2018, Alberta committed $100&nbsp;million to the widening of the southwest leg of the road.<ref name=SWwiden/><ref name=SWwiden2/>  The plans included widening both directions from two to three travel lanes in the congested southwest section between 111&nbsp;Street and Whitemud Drive, and the more extensive work required to widen the bridges over the North Saskatchewan River and Wedgewood Ravine which are currently two lanes of travel per bridge each way.<ref name=budget/>{{rp|53}}  In September 2019, [[Executive_Council_of_Alberta#Ministries|Minister of Transportation]] [[Ric McIver]] announced that a contract for the work had been awarded, with work set to begin in fall 2019.<ref name=SWwiden3/><ref name=SWwiden4/> Capacity of the section will be increased to 120,000 vehicles per day.<ref name=SWwiden3/> In 2015, city councillor Michael Oshry had stated that he was unhappy with the way the road was initially constructed, and Alberta should have done a better job of anticipating the rapid growth in southwest Edmonton.<ref name=delay/> Project manager Bill van der Meer disagreed, saying, \"If we built a six-lane divided road that was virtually empty for 10&nbsp;years, that wouldn't be money well spent.\"<ref name=delay/>\n[[File:Anthony Henday Drive Northeast.jpg|upright=1.2|left|thumb|The final section of Anthony Henday Drive to be completed is the widest, carrying no less than six lanes from Manning Drive to Highway 14. Between Aurum Rd and 153 Ave it is seven lanes wide.]]\nAs part of initial construction, [[grading (engineering)|grading]] has been completed for several future interchanges/flyovers and higher capacity directional ramps at existing interchanges, to reduce construction time and costs for those structures when traffic volumes require them.<ref name=NWS13/>  For example, the directional ramps constructed at the northwest Henday/Yellowhead Trail interchange were built one lane wide initially, but all bridge decks are wide enough to accommodate a second lane.<ref name=NWS18/>  Edmonton proposes to upgrade Terwillegar Drive to a freeway at an estimated cost of $1&nbsp;billion, after which two directional ramps are proposed; they would carry traffic from northbound Terwillegar Drive to westbound Anthony Henday Drive, and from southbound to eastbound.<ref name=terw/> On November&nbsp;1, 2016, Alberta announced the intended closure of the [[right-in/right-out]] access at 127&nbsp;Street in southwest Edmonton, citing safety concerns.<ref name=127close/> However, in the following days, the city requested that the access remain open indefinitely until alternatives were explored, and the province agreed.<ref name=127open/>  It was ultimately closed in May 2019, and a new right-in/right-out connection several hundred metres to the west opened at 135&nbsp;Street in October 2019.<ref name=135open/>  In the southeast, a directional ramp from eastbound Whitemud Drive to northbound Anthony Henday Drive is proposed, when traffic volumes warrant its construction.<ref name=ISL/>\n\nTo meet long-term requirements, Alberta Transportation also proposes to construct a high capacity directional ramp carrying traffic from eastbound Anthony Henday Dive to northbound Ray Gibbon Drive after the latter is twinned and upgraded to a freeway.<ref name=NWS18A/>  Ray Gibbon Drive is proposed as a major corridor that will carry the Highway&nbsp;2 designation in the future.<ref name=RGDfreeway/>  One kilometre further down the road at 137&nbsp;Avenue, grading was initially completed for a partial cloverleaf interchange but in 2008 Alberta elected not to spend $7&nbsp;million to complete paving of the ramps because development did not yet require it. St.&nbsp;Albert mayor Nolan Crouse was unhappy with the decision, stating that his city would not pay for it either. \"It's going to sit there until there's another plan, and right now we don't have a plan... we have taken the position that we think it's the province's responsibility, and they say they won't,\" Crouse said.<ref name=137int/> {{As of|2018}}, there is no timeline for completion of the interchange.\n\nAlberta proposes to construct a second ring road around Edmonton to support future growth, approximately {{cvt|8|km|0}} beyond Anthony Henday Drive.<ref name=Parrish/> The road would not be constructed for roughly 40&nbsp;years, and could cost upwards of $11&nbsp;billion. [[Parkland County]] mayor Rod Shaigec voiced his support for the plan in 2014, stating, \"if we don't implement and have another ring road, it's going to be further traffic congestion and have environmental impacts as well.\"<ref name=BarnesK/>  Edmonton mayor [[Don Iveson]] called the plan a bad idea, instead favouring expansion to [[Edmonton Light Rail Transit|Light Rail Transit]] and upgrades to existing roadways in the Edmonton area such as Yellowhead Trail.  Both projects could be completed for the cost of the proposed outer ring road, he argued,<ref name=Parrish/> and in 2016 the city announced that Yellowhead Trail would be upgraded to a freeway after the federal and provincial governments agreed to fund half of the $1&nbsp;billion project.<ref name=yellowfund/>  In May&nbsp;2017, Edmonton Police Chief Rod Knecht expressed his support for an increase in the speed limit on Anthony Henday Drive from 100&nbsp;km/h to {{cvt|110|kph}}.<ref name=Ramsay2/>\n\n== Exit list ==\nExit numbering begins at Calgary Trail and increases clockwise.

While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011</ref> In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market.

Without a high share{{quantify|date=October 2019}} of low-carbon electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.<ref>[http://www.energysolutionscenter.org/assets/1/Page/GHP_Position_Paper_and_apndx_031710.pdf pg 7]</ref>\n\n==Energy conservation==\n\n\n===Energy efficiency===\n{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called \"energy efficiency\", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n===Smart grid===\n{{Main|Smart grid}}\nExpanding intermittent electrical sources, such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

A (2008) Evaluating the Global Environment Facility: A goodwill gesture or a serious attempt to deliver global benefits?, Global Environmental Change 18, 800\u2013810</ref>\n\n====Problems====\nThere are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment.

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n===Smart grid===\n{{Main|Smart grid}}\nExpanding intermittent electrical sources, such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

Several scientific studies have shown that when relatively rich people wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are a few key actions they can take such as living [[car-free movement|car-free]] (2.4 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>), avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes) and eating a [[plant-based diet]] (0.8 tonnes).<ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017>{{cite journal |title= The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions |journal= Environmental Research Letters |first1= Seth |last1= Wynes |first2= Kimberly A |last2= Nicholas |date= 12 July 2017 |volume= 12 |page= 074024 |number= 7 |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541 |bibcode= 2017ERL....12g4024W}}</ref>\n\nThese appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for \"greening\" one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the \"low-impact\" category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, school textbooks, etc.<ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/><ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05>{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul P |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089\u2013E6096|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

The [[Riddles|riddle]] was a major, prestigious literary genre in Anglo-Saxon England, and riddles were written both in Latin and Old English verse. The most famous Anglo-Saxon riddles are in Old English and found in the tenth-century [[Exeter Book]], while the pre-eminent Anglo-Saxon composer of Latin riddles was the seventh- to eighth-century scholar [[Aldhelm]].\n\nSurviving riddles range from theological and scholarly to comical and obscene and attempt to provide new perspectives and viewpoints in describing the world. Some at least were probably meant to be performed rather than merely read to oneself and give us a glimpse into the life and culture of the era.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\nThe Old English riddles have been much more studied than the Latin ones, but recent work has argued that the two groups need to be understood together as 'a vigorous, common tradition of Old English and Anglo-Latin enigmatography'.<ref>Dieter Bitterli, ''Say what I am Called: The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book and the Anglo-Latin Riddle Tradition'', Toronto Anglo-Saxon Series, 2 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009).</ref> Much past work on the Old English riddles has focused on finding and debating solutions,<ref>E.g. Patrick J. Murphy, ''Unriddling the Exteter Riddles'' (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2011), p. 16, citing Glorie and Sorrell.</ref> but a new wave of work has started using riddles as a way to study Anglo-Saxon [[world-view]]s through the critical approaches of [[eco-criticism]].<ref>E.g.

H.  \u2018Medieval Riddling: Factors Underlying Its Development\u2019, ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 71 (1970), 177\u201385.</ref> The riddles generally become more metrically and linguistically complex as the collection proceeds. The first eight riddles deal with cosmology. Riddles 9-82 are more heterogeneous, covering a wide variety of animals, plants, artefacts, materials and phenomena, but can be seen to establish purposeful contrasts (for example between the light of a candle in Enigma 52 and that of the Great Bear in 53) or sequences (for example the animals of Enigmata 34-39: locust, screech-owl, midge, crab, pond-skater, lion). Riddles 81-99 seem all to concern monsters and wonders. Finally, the long hundredth riddle is \"Creatura\", the whole of Creation.<ref>Mercedes Salvador-Bello, 'Patterns of Compilation in Anglo-Latin ''Enigmata'' and the Evidence of A Source-Collection in Riddles 1-40 of the ''Exeter Book'', ''Viator'', 43 (2012), 339\u2013374 (pp. 341-46). 10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.102554.</ref> His most prominent themes were 'the natural world, daily life, church furniture, and the classroom.

There is speculation that there may once have been, or have been intended to be, 100 riddles in the book, since this would match the Latin collections discussed above. The riddles are all written in [[alliterative verse]], and frequently end with an injunction to 'say what I am called', suggesting that they were indeed recited as verbal entertainment; yet they clearly have diverse origins.<ref name=\"Broadview\">Black, Joseph, et al., eds. ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: Volume 1: The Medieval Period''. 2nd ed. Ontario, Canada: Broadview Press,2009. Print.</ref><ref name=\"Lind\">Lind, Carol. ''Riddling the voices of others: The Old English Exeter Book riddles and a pedagogy of the anonymous''. Diss. Illinois State University, 2007.</ref> The Exeter Book riddles can be situated within a wider tradition of 'speaking objects' in Anglo-Saxon culture and have much in common with poems such as ''The Dream of the Rood'' and ''The Husband's Message'' and with artefacts such as the Alfred Jewel or the Brussels Cross, which endow inanimate things with first-person voices.<ref>James Paz, ''Nonhuman Voices in Anglo-Saxon Literature and Material Culture'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2017), pp. 17-26; http://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=631090.</ref>\n\nThe Exeter Book riddles are varied in theme, but they are all used to engage and challenge the readers mentally. By representing the familiar, material world from an oblique angle, many not only draw on but also complicate or challenge social norms such as martial masculinity, patriarchal attitudes to women, lords' dominance over their servants, and humans' over animals.<ref>Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Leeds, 2014), esp. ch. 2; http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/; https://www.academia.edu/6827866.</ref> Thirteen, for example, have as their solution an implement, which speaks of itself through the riddle as a servant to its lord; but these sometimes also suggest the power of the servant to define the master.<ref>Jennifer Neville, 'The Unexpected Treasure of the \"Implement Trope\": Hierarchical Relationships in the Old English Riddles', ''Review of English Studies'', 62 [256] (2011), 505-519. doi: 10.1093/res/hgq131.</ref> Unlike the Latin Anglo-Saxon riddles, the Old English ones tend not to rely on intellectual obscurity to make the riddle more difficult for the reader,<ref name=\"Broadview\"/> rather focusing on describing processes of manufacture and transformation. The reader must be observant to any double meanings or \"hinge words\" in order to discover the answer to the riddle.<ref name=\"Lind\"/><ref>John D. Niles, '' Old English Enigmatic Poems and the Play of the Texts'', Studies in the early Middle Ages, 13 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2006).</ref> The search for answers to the riddles has been addressed at length by Patrick J. Murphy, focusing on thought patterns of the period, but there is still no unanimous agreement on some of them.<ref>Patrick J. Murphy. 2011. ''Unriddling the Exeter Riddles''.  University Park: Penn State University Press.</ref> Some of the riddles are translated from Latin, such as the [[Leiden Riddle]] (which is preserved both outside and within the Exeter Book); others seem to have come directly from vernacular tradition.\n\nThe Anglo Saxon riddles are notable for their use of compound nouns and adjectives. These word combinations became what could be considered riddles within the riddle itself. They offered a new perspective and would poetically personify their subject.<ref name=Rios>Rios, Alberto. [http://www.public.asu.edu/~aarios/formsofverse/furtherreading/page3.html Anglo-Saxon Prosody, \"Forms of Verse\".] Fall, 2000.</ref>\n\nThe majority of the riddles have religious themes and answers. Some of the religious contexts within the riddles are \"manuscript book (or Bible),\" \"soul and body,\" \"fish and river\" (fish are often used to symbolize Christ).<ref name=\"Broadview\"/> The riddles also were written about common objects, and even animals were used as inspiration for some of the riddles. One example of a typical, religious riddle is Riddle 41, which describes the soul and body:\n\n:A noble guest of great lineage dwells\n:In the house of man.  Grim hunger\n:Cannot harm him, nor feverish thirst,\n:Nor age, nor illness.  If the servant\n:Of the guest who rules, serves well\n:On the journey, they will find together\n:Bliss and well-being, a feast of fate;\n:If the slave will not as a brother be ruled\n:By a lord he should fear and follow\n:Then both will suffer and sire a family\n:Of sorrows when, springing from the world,\n:They leave the bright bosom of one kinswoman,\n:Mother and sister, who nourished them.\n:Let the man who knows noble words\n:Say what the guest and servant are called.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\nWhile the Exeter Book was found in a cathedral library, and while it is clear that religious scribes worked on the riddles, not all of the riddles in the book are religiously themed.  Many of the answers to the riddles are everyday, common objects. There are also many double entendres, which can lead to an answer that is obscene. One example of this is Riddle 23:\n\n:I am wonderful help to women,\n:The hope of something to come. I harm\n:No citizen except my slayer.\n:Rooted I stand on a high bed.\n:I am shaggy below. Sometimes the beautiful\n:Peasant's daughter, an eager-armed,\n:Proud woman grabs my body,\n:Rushes my red skin, holds me hard,\n:Claims my head. The curly-haired\n:Woman who catches me fast will feel\n:Our meeting. Her eye will be wet.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\nOne of the first answers that readers might think of would be an onion. If the reader pays close attention to the wording in the latter half of the riddle, however, he or she may be led to believe that the answer is a man's penis. Both of these answers are perfectly legitimate answers to this riddle, but one is very innocent where the other is very obscene.  Even though some of the riddles contained obscene meanings, that is not to say that the majority of riddles in the Exeter Book were obscene. There were more religious and animalistic riddles than obscene riddles.\n\nSince the riddles were crammed into the pages of the manuscript with hardly any organization, many of the riddles vary in structure.  The boundaries between riddles were often unclear and translations are relatively rough.<ref name=Rios/> The object of the riddles is generally preserved despite these possible errors.  Notably, not a single one of the riddles found in the Exeter book were accompanied with answers.  In fact, some remain unanswered to this day, such as Riddle 91:\n\n:I am noble, known to rest in the quiet\n:Keeping of many men, humble and high born.\n:The plunderers\u2019 joy, hauled far from friends,\n:Rides richly on me, shines signifying power,\n:Whether I proclaim the grandeur of halls,\n:The wealth of cities, or the glory of God.\n:Now wise men love most my strange way\n:Of offering wisdom to many without voice.\n:Though the children of earth eagerly seek\n:To trace my trail, sometimes my tracks are dim.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\n===Types of riddles in the Exeter Book===\nAccording to [[Archer Taylor]],<ref name=\"Lind\"/> most riddles from the Exeter Book are 'true riddles' and can be placed into five categories: \n* the true riddle \n* the [[neck-riddle]]\n* the arithmetical puzzle \n* the clever question\n* the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] ([[joke riddle]])\n\n[[Nigel F.

The [[Riddles|riddle]] was a major, prestigious literary genre in Anglo-Saxon England, and riddles were written both in Latin and Old English verse. The most famous Anglo-Saxon riddles are in Old English and found in the tenth-century [[Exeter Book]], while the pre-eminent Anglo-Saxon composer of Latin riddles was the seventh- to eighth-century scholar [[Aldhelm]].\n\nSurviving riddles range from theological and scholarly to comical and obscene and attempt to provide new perspectives and viewpoints in describing the world. Some at least were probably meant to be performed rather than merely read to oneself and give us a glimpse into the life and culture of the era.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\nThe Old English riddles have been much more studied than the Latin ones, but recent work has argued that the two groups need to be understood together as 'a vigorous, common tradition of Old English and Anglo-Latin enigmatography'.<ref>Dieter Bitterli, ''Say what I am Called: The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book and the Anglo-Latin Riddle Tradition'', Toronto Anglo-Saxon Series, 2 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2009).</ref> Much past work on the Old English riddles has focused on finding and debating solutions,<ref>E.g. Patrick J. Murphy, ''Unriddling the Exteter Riddles'' (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2011), p. 16, citing Glorie and Sorrell.</ref> but a new wave of work has started using riddles as a way to study Anglo-Saxon [[world-view]]s through the critical approaches of [[eco-criticism]].<ref>E.g. Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished PhD thesis, University of Leeds, 2013), http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/.</ref>\n\n==Anglo-Latin ''enigmata''==\n\nThe earliest attested riddles in Anglo-Saxon England are in Latin, where they are known as ''enigmata'' ('enigmas') and formed a thriving literary genre which is likely to have inspired the later collection of vernacular riddles in the Exeter Book.<ref>Andy Orchard, \"Enigma Variations: The Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Tradition,\" in ''Latin Learning and English Lore: Studies in Anglo-Saxon Literature for Michael Lapidge'', ed. by Andy Orchard and Katherine O\u2019Brien O\u2019Keeffe, 2 vols (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005), I 284-304.</ref> Unlike the Exeter Book riddles, the Anglo-Saxon ''enigmata'' are presented in manuscripts with their solutions as their title, and seldom close with a challenge to the reader to guess their solution.<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\">Andy Orchard, 'Enigmata', in ''The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', ed. by Michael Lapidge, John Blair, Simon Keynes, and Donald Scragg, 2nd edn (Chichester: Wiley Blackwell, 2013), s.v.</ref>\n\nApparently inspired by the hundred ''Aenigmata'' of [[Symphosius]], another collection of metrical Latin riddles called [[Bern Riddles]], along with Byzantine literary riddling, the Anglo-Saxon aristocrat, scholar, abbot and bishop [[Aldhelm]] composed his own collection of a hundred (hexa)metrical ''enigmata''.<ref>Milovanovi\u0107-Barham, \u010celica, 'Aldhelm's ''Enigmata'' and Byzantine Riddles', ''Anglo-Saxon England'', 22 (1993), 51-64, {{DOI|10.1017/S0263675100004300}}.</ref> He included it in his ''Epistola ad Acircium'', a study of poetry dedicated to one Acircius, understood to be King [[Aldfrith of Northumbria]], and therefore presumably written during his reign (685-704/5); Aldhelm records that his riddles were composed early in his career 'as scholarly illustrations of the principles of Latin versification', and may have been the work where he established his poetic skill in Latin.<ref name=\"Andy Orchard 2013\"/> The letter consists of three treatises:\n*''De septenario'', treatise on the number seven in [[arithmology]].\n*''De metris'', treatise on metre, including the ''Enigmata''.\n*''De pedum regulis'', didactive treatise on [[metrical feet]], such as iambs and spondees.\nMany were directly inspired by Symphosius's, but overall, Aldhelm's collection is quite different in tone and purpose: as well as being an exposition of Latin poetic metres, diction, and techniques, it seems to be intended as an exploration of the wonders of God's creation.<ref>Whitman, F. H.  \u2018Medieval Riddling: Factors Underlying Its Development\u2019, ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 71 (1970), 177\u201385.</ref> The riddles generally become more metrically and linguistically complex as the collection proceeds. The first eight riddles deal with cosmology. Riddles 9-82 are more heterogeneous, covering a wide variety of animals, plants, artefacts, materials and phenomena, but can be seen to establish purposeful contrasts (for example between the light of a candle in Enigma 52 and that of the Great Bear in 53) or sequences (for example the animals of Enigmata 34-39: locust, screech-owl, midge, crab, pond-skater, lion). Riddles 81-99 seem all to concern monsters and wonders. Finally, the long hundredth riddle is \"Creatura\", the whole of Creation.<ref>Mercedes Salvador-Bello, 'Patterns of Compilation in Anglo-Latin ''Enigmata'' and the Evidence of A Source-Collection in Riddles 1-40 of the ''Exeter Book'', ''Viator'', 43 (2012), 339\u2013374 (pp. 341-46). 10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.102554.</ref> His most prominent themes were 'the natural world, daily life, church furniture, and the classroom.

Juster (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2015), pp. 69-71.</ref>\n\n==The Exeter Book Riddles==\n\nThe Exeter Book contains [[secular]] and religious poems and other writings, along with a collection of around 94 riddles (scholars debate precisely how many there are because divisions between poems are not always clear). There is speculation that there may once have been, or have been intended to be, 100 riddles in the book, since this would match the Latin collections discussed above. The riddles are all written in [[alliterative verse]], and frequently end with an injunction to 'say what I am called', suggesting that they were indeed recited as verbal entertainment; yet they clearly have diverse origins.<ref name=\"Broadview\">Black, Joseph, et al., eds. ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: Volume 1: The Medieval Period''. 2nd ed. Ontario, Canada: Broadview Press,2009. Print.</ref><ref name=\"Lind\">Lind, Carol. ''Riddling the voices of others: The Old English Exeter Book riddles and a pedagogy of the anonymous''. Diss. Illinois State University, 2007.</ref> The Exeter Book riddles can be situated within a wider tradition of 'speaking objects' in Anglo-Saxon culture and have much in common with poems such as ''The Dream of the Rood'' and ''The Husband's Message'' and with artefacts such as the Alfred Jewel or the Brussels Cross, which endow inanimate things with first-person voices.<ref>James Paz, ''Nonhuman Voices in Anglo-Saxon Literature and Material Culture'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2017), pp. 17-26; http://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=631090.</ref>\n\nThe Exeter Book riddles are varied in theme, but they are all used to engage and challenge the readers mentally. By representing the familiar, material world from an oblique angle, many not only draw on but also complicate or challenge social norms such as martial masculinity, patriarchal attitudes to women, lords' dominance over their servants, and humans' over animals.<ref>Helen Price, 'Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology' (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Leeds, 2014), esp. ch. 2; http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/6607/; https://www.academia.edu/6827866.</ref> Thirteen, for example, have as their solution an implement, which speaks of itself through the riddle as a servant to its lord; but these sometimes also suggest the power of the servant to define the master.<ref>Jennifer Neville, 'The Unexpected Treasure of the \"Implement Trope\": Hierarchical Relationships in the Old English Riddles', ''Review of English Studies'', 62 [256] (2011), 505-519. doi: 10.1093/res/hgq131.</ref> Unlike the Latin Anglo-Saxon riddles, the Old English ones tend not to rely on intellectual obscurity to make the riddle more difficult for the reader,<ref name=\"Broadview\"/> rather focusing on describing processes of manufacture and transformation. The reader must be observant to any double meanings or \"hinge words\" in order to discover the answer to the riddle.<ref name=\"Lind\"/><ref>John D. Niles, '' Old English Enigmatic Poems and the Play of the Texts'', Studies in the early Middle Ages, 13 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2006).</ref> The search for answers to the riddles has been addressed at length by Patrick J. Murphy, focusing on thought patterns of the period, but there is still no unanimous agreement on some of them.<ref>Patrick J. Murphy. 2011. ''Unriddling the Exeter Riddles''.  University Park: Penn State University Press.</ref> Some of the riddles are translated from Latin, such as the [[Leiden Riddle]] (which is preserved both outside and within the Exeter Book); others seem to have come directly from vernacular tradition.\n\nThe Anglo Saxon riddles are notable for their use of compound nouns and adjectives. These word combinations became what could be considered riddles within the riddle itself. They offered a new perspective and would poetically personify their subject.<ref name=Rios>Rios, Alberto. [http://www.public.asu.edu/~aarios/formsofverse/furtherreading/page3.html Anglo-Saxon Prosody, \"Forms of Verse\".] Fall, 2000.</ref>\n\nThe majority of the riddles have religious themes and answers. Some of the religious contexts within the riddles are \"manuscript book (or Bible),\" \"soul and body,\" \"fish and river\" (fish are often used to symbolize Christ).<ref name=\"Broadview\"/> The riddles also were written about common objects, and even animals were used as inspiration for some of the riddles. One example of a typical, religious riddle is Riddle 41, which describes the soul and body:\n\n:A noble guest of great lineage dwells\n:In the house of man.  Grim hunger\n:Cannot harm him, nor feverish thirst,\n:Nor age, nor illness.  If the servant\n:Of the guest who rules, serves well\n:On the journey, they will find together\n:Bliss and well-being, a feast of fate;\n:If the slave will not as a brother be ruled\n:By a lord he should fear and follow\n:Then both will suffer and sire a family\n:Of sorrows when, springing from the world,\n:They leave the bright bosom of one kinswoman,\n:Mother and sister, who nourished them.\n:Let the man who knows noble words\n:Say what the guest and servant are called.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\nWhile the Exeter Book was found in a cathedral library, and while it is clear that religious scribes worked on the riddles, not all of the riddles in the book are religiously themed.  Many of the answers to the riddles are everyday, common objects. There are also many double entendres, which can lead to an answer that is obscene. One example of this is Riddle 23:\n\n:I am wonderful help to women,\n:The hope of something to come. I harm\n:No citizen except my slayer.\n:Rooted I stand on a high bed.\n:I am shaggy below. Sometimes the beautiful\n:Peasant's daughter, an eager-armed,\n:Proud woman grabs my body,\n:Rushes my red skin, holds me hard,\n:Claims my head. The curly-haired\n:Woman who catches me fast will feel\n:Our meeting. Her eye will be wet.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\nOne of the first answers that readers might think of would be an onion. If the reader pays close attention to the wording in the latter half of the riddle, however, he or she may be led to believe that the answer is a man's penis. Both of these answers are perfectly legitimate answers to this riddle, but one is very innocent where the other is very obscene.  Even though some of the riddles contained obscene meanings, that is not to say that the majority of riddles in the Exeter Book were obscene. There were more religious and animalistic riddles than obscene riddles.\n\nSince the riddles were crammed into the pages of the manuscript with hardly any organization, many of the riddles vary in structure.  The boundaries between riddles were often unclear and translations are relatively rough.<ref name=Rios/> The object of the riddles is generally preserved despite these possible errors.  Notably, not a single one of the riddles found in the Exeter book were accompanied with answers.  In fact, some remain unanswered to this day, such as Riddle 91:\n\n:I am noble, known to rest in the quiet\n:Keeping of many men, humble and high born.\n:The plunderers\u2019 joy, hauled far from friends,\n:Rides richly on me, shines signifying power,\n:Whether I proclaim the grandeur of halls,\n:The wealth of cities, or the glory of God.\n:Now wise men love most my strange way\n:Of offering wisdom to many without voice.\n:Though the children of earth eagerly seek\n:To trace my trail, sometimes my tracks are dim.<ref name=\"Broadview\"/>\n\n:<sup>Trans. by Craig Williamson, ''A Feast of Creatures: Anglo-Saxon Riddle-Songs'' (1982)</sup>\n\n===Types of riddles in the Exeter Book===\nAccording to [[Archer Taylor]],<ref name=\"Lind\"/> most riddles from the Exeter Book are 'true riddles' and can be placed into five categories: \n* the true riddle \n* the [[neck-riddle]]\n* the arithmetical puzzle \n* the clever question\n* the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] ([[joke riddle]])\n\n[[Nigel F.
