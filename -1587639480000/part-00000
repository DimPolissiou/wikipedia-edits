Of the tower's remains were a massive five-storey structure with turrets at the north and west angles; that at the north angle containing a winding staircase opening through pointed arches into each storey. The principal entrance was under a semicircular archway. In the war of 1688 the castle is said to have been strongly garrisoned, and to have sustained an attack.<ref>{{cite book|author=Samuel Lewis|publisher=S.

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

Ritter's character, Paul Hennessy, was said to have died after collapsing in a grocery store while buying milk. ABC aired the first three episodes of the show's second season that had been taped before his death, each of which was introduced by Katey Sagal. The remainder of the show dealt with the family trying to grapple with Paul's death. New male characters, played by [[James Garner]] and [[David Spade]], were later added to the main cast as Ritter's replacements. Shortly before his death, Ritter had done a week-long taping with ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', which was aired as a tribute to him, introduced by [[Henry Winkler]], the executive producer of the show and very close friend of Ritter's.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The [[Dyle (river)|Dyle]] (Dijle) river is {{convert|86|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, from Houtain-le-Val through [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]; Gamelin intended French, British and Belgian troops to halt a German invasion force along the line of the river. The [[Franco-Belgian Accord of 1920]] had co-ordinated [[communication]] and [[fortification]] efforts of both armies. The Belgian government let the accord lapse after the German [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]] on 7 March 1936, to adopt a policy of strict [[Neutral country|neutrality]], with the German Army ({{lang|de|[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]}}) on the Belgian border.\n\nFrench doubts about the Belgian army led to uncertainty about whether French troops could move fast enough into Belgium to avoid an encounter battle and fight a defensive battle from prepared positions. The Escaut Plan/Plan E and Dyle Plan/Plan D were devised for a forward defence in Belgium, along with a possible deployment on the French\u2013Belgian border to Dunkirk. Gamelin chose the Escaut Plan, then substituted Plan D for an advance to the line of the Dyle, which was {{convert|70|\u2013|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} shorter. Some officers at {{lang|fr|[[Grand Quartier G\u00e9n\u00e9ral (1939\u20131940)|Grand Quartier G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]}} (GQG, [[Headquarters|general headquarters]] of the French Army) doubted that the French could arrive before the Germans.\n\nGerman dissatisfaction with the campaign plan {{lang|de|[[Fall Gelb]]}} (Case Yellow), increased over the winter of 1939\u20131940. On 10 January 1940, a German aircraft landed at [[Maasmechelen]] in Belgium, carrying plans for the invasion. The [[Mechelen Incident]] was a catalyst for the doubts about {{lang|de|Fall Gelb}} and led to the [[Manstein Plan]], a bold, almost reckless, gamble for an attack further south through the Ardennes. The attack on the Low Countries became a decoy to lure the Allied armies northwards, more easily to outflank them from the south.\n\nOver the winter of 1939\u20131940, Gamelin altered Plan D with the [[Breda]] variant, an advance into the [[Netherlands]] to Breda in [[North Brabant]]. The Seventh Army, the most powerful element of the French strategic reserve, was added to the 1st Army Group close to the coast, to rush to the Scheldt Estuary and Holland, link with the Dutch army at Tilburg or Breda. Some of the best divisions of the French army were moved north, when elite units of the German army were being transferred south for the new version of {{lang|de|Fall Gelb}}, an invasion through the Ardennes.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===French defence policy===\n\nAfter the territorial changes in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (28 June 1919) transferred the provinces of [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine]] to France, natural resources, industry and population close to the frontier, vital for the prosecution of another war of exhaustion, meant that the French army would not be able to gain time by retreating into the interior as it had in 1914. By the 1930s, the importance of the two provinces and north-west France the French economy had grown. The French Army was responsible for frontier protection under the {{lang|fr|Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de la guerre]]}} (CSG, Supreme War Council), which was revived on 23 January 1920. By 1922, two schools of thought had emerged, one led by General [[Edmond Buat]] that advocated the building of continuous fortifications along the frontier for a relatively static defence and one supported by Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] and Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], which wanted fortified regions to be built as centres of resistance for offensive action. Armies would manoeuvre around the centres until the most favourable time and conditions for attack. By the end of 1922, majority opinion in the CSG favoured a system that could be used offensively and defensively.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=48, 50\u201351}}\n\n===Manpower===\n\nBy 1918 French conscripts were receiving no more than three months' training and after the war, it was considered that the size of the army should be determined by the number of divisions needed for security. The number of professional soldiers and conscripts necessary was derived by multiplication and the quantity of men was more important than their education or training. In 1920, the CSG decided on 41 active divisions, plus five [[French Algeria|Algerian]] and three [[Troupes coloniales|colonial]] divisions, with a mobilisation potential of 80 divisions. The government imposed a 32-division limit with 150,000 full-time soldiers but in 1926, the government imposed a limit on the size of the army of 20 active divisions, with 106,000 professional soldiers to comprise a reservoir of trained men, on which reservists could form a mobilised wartime army. Reducing the size of the active army allowed a reduction in the number of conscripts and the term of compulsory service, from two years to one year by 1928. In 1928 a comprehensive series of laws had been passed for the recruitment and organisation of the army, which determined its peacetime nature; the cadre of professionals maintained the army ready for the mobilisation of a mass of reservists.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nThe French army expected that another war would be won by a mass army, even if it was full of short service and sketchily trained men and the period of twelve-month conscription lasted from 1928 until 1935. An army of one-year conscripts was accepted by the army, because a big, fairly well trained army in wartime was considered more important than a highly trained, quick responding and offensively minded army in peacetime. From 220,000\u2013230,000 men were trained each year, half being called up every six months, the previous group moving to the active army as the new men began training. The 106,000-man regular army was capable only of manning frontier defences, training recruits and providing planning staffs; when the garrison in the [[Occupation of the Rhineland|Rhineland]] returned, the army lost the capacity for independent or limited action in Europe without mobilisation. In the context of the later 1920s, the decline in the readiness of the standing army did not seem to be a disadvantage. By the time the one-year law affected numbers in 1932, there were 358,000 soldiers in [[metropolitan France]], of whom 232,000 men were trained enough for operations. By 1933, there were 320,000 soldiers in mainland France, with 226,000 having had more than six months' training; the French army was only twice the size of the German {{lang|de|[[Reichswehr]]}}, which was staffed with highly trained soldiers because of the long term period of service imposed by the treaty of Versailles.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=21\u201323}}\n\n===Belgium===\n\n[[File:Rhineland.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The [[Rhineland]] as defined by the Treaty of Versailles, part contiguous with the Belgian frontier.}}]]\nIn September 1920, the CSG made a strategic decision that the defence of the northern frontier must begin with a rush into Belgium. The French army never deviated from the belief that the loss of the agricultural, mining and industrial resources could never be repeated. In September, the [[Franco-Belgian Accord of 1920]] was signed, for military co-operation; if international tension increased, the Belgians would request assistance and the French would send an army to the Belgian-German border, making it the main line of French resistance to a German attack. As the policy was studied, it became clear that a force moving to the Belgo-German border would have to be mobile if it were to forestall the Germans for a defensive battle from prepared positions. Motorised transport would be necessary to rush forward French troops, then ferry engineer stores to fortify the positions. The French army created mobile fortification parks stocked with material for fortification, ready to be moved by road and rail but if the Belgian army was overwhelmed, the French might be forced into an encounter battle and a war of movement in the central Belgian plain. French strategy was to avoid a decisive battle early on, after the disaster of the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] in 1914 but the necessity of avoiding a war on French soil, meant that a forward move could not be avoided.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|p=63}}\n\n===Maginot Line===\n\n{{main article|Maginot Line}}\n\n[[File:Maginot Linie Karte.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the principal fortified section of the Maginot Line}}]]\nStudies made by the General Staff in 1919 were reported to the CSG in 1920 and a commission of 1922, chaired by Marshal [[Joseph Joffre]] reported in December 1925, in favour of centres of resistance built in peacetime, not a continuous fortified front. From 17 December 1926 to 12 October 1927, the Frontier Defence Commission reported to the CSG that fortifications should be built from Metz to Thionville and Longwy, to protect the [[Moselle Valley]] and the mineral resources and industry of Lorraine. The area around the [[Lauter (Rhine)|River Lauter]], the most north-eastern part of the common border with Germany, should be fortified as an obvious invasion route but there was no need to fortify the Rhine, because of the Vosges mountains further west and the small number of railways on the German side. [[Belfort]] was near the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] frontier and partly protected by the Rhine but there was an avenue of invasion to the west, which should be protected. The commission gave emphasis to defence against a surprise attack, with the limited objective of capturing the [[Metz]] and Lauter areas.{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=59\u201360}}{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=52\u201354}}\n\nThe commission recommended that priority be given to protecting the resources and industries of Lorraine that were vital for the French economy and would become more important for a war economy. The nature of fixed defences was debated during the 1920s, with advocates of the offensive use of fortifications, deep or shallow defences and centralised and decentralised designs. On 12 October 1927, the CSG adopted the system recommended by P\u00e9tain, of large and elaborately fortified defences from Metz to [[Thionville]] and [[Longwy]], at Lauter and Belfort, on the north-east frontier, with covered infantry positions between the main fortifications. The [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of War]] [[Andr\u00e9 Maginot]] (1922\u20131924, 1929\u20131930 and 1931\u20131932) became the driving force for obtaining the money to fortify the north-eastern frontier, sufficient to resist a German invasion for three weeks, to give time for the French army to mobilise. Work began in 1929 on the {{lang|fr|R\u00e9gion Fortifi\u00e9e de Metz}} (Metz Fortified Region) through the Moselle valley to the Nied at Teting, then the {{lang|fr|R\u00e9gion Fortifi\u00e9e de Lauter}}, east of Hagenau from Bitche to the Rhine, the extension of the Metz region to Longuyon and the Lauter region from Bitche to the Sarre at Wittring.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=52\u201354, 59\u201361}}{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=61\u201363}}\n\nThe requirements for the fortifications were natural cover, sites nearby for observation posts, the minimum of dead ground, a maximum arc of fire, ground suitable for anti-tank obstacles and infantry positions and ground on which paved roads could be built, to eliminate wheel marks. {{lang|fr|Maisons Fortes}} were to be built near the frontier as permanently garrisoned works, whose men would alert the army, blow bridges and erect roadblocks, for which materials were dumped. About {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} back were concrete {{lang|fr|Avant-postes}} with permanent garrisons armed with {{nowrap|47 mm or}} {{nowrap|65 mm guns,}} intended to delay an attacker so that buried casemates and {{lang|fr|ouvrages}} (fortresses) further back could be manned. Artificial obstacles of 4\u20136 rows of upright railway line, {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}-long set in concrete and of random depth and covered by barbed wire. A barbed wire obstruction {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} further back covered a field of anti-tank mines overlooked by twin machine-guns and anti-tank guns in casemates. The casemates were distributed in series and were the only defensive works along the Rhine; on other stretches, casemates were interspersed with {{lang|fr|ouvrages}}, every {{convert|3|\u2013|5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Interval Troops of infantry, gunners, engineers and mechanised light cavalry with field artillery, could manoeuvre between the fortifications, advancing to defend casemate approaches and relieve outposts or retiring to protect fortress entrances, the troops provided continuity, depth and mobility to the static defences.{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=60\u201364}}{{efn|The main fortifications were single- and double-casemates, dug into hills from {{convert|0.25|\u2013|1.25|mi|km|abbr=on}} apart, with firing chambers containing machine-guns and anti-tank guns to [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] the anti-tank and anti-infantry obstacles further forward. An upper floor was roofed by {{convert|5|\u2013|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} of concrete and living quarters for {{nowrap|25\u201335 men}} were built below with walls {{convert|2|\u2013|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick behind an earth overing; a trench {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep surrounded by barbed wire and grenade-throwers protected the work. Power came from diesel engines and the largest forts ({{lang|fr|ouvrages}}) had 1,000\u20131,200 infantry, gunners and engineers.{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=65\u201367}}}}\n\n===Ardennes===\n\n{{see also|Ardennes}}\n\n[[File:Ardennen03.png|thumb|{{centre|Map showing the Ardennes}}]]\nThe Ardennes was considered to be easily defended and in 1927, the [[Adolphe Guillaumat|Guillaumat Commission]] concluded that the few narrow serpentine roads, through wooded hills could be blocked easily with felled trees, minefields and roadblocks. The swift advance of a large force, particularly a road-bound one, through natural and artificial obstacles, could be easily made slow and arduous. Once an invader managed to get through the Ardennes, the depth and width of the river Meuse made it a considerable obstacle. The resources and equipment needed to use the Ardennes route would take so long that the French army expected to have ample time to reinforce the area.{{efn|It was expected that a German advance would take nine days to reach the Meuse but in 1940 it took under three days.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=61\u201362}}}} During the 1930s, the possibility of an attack through the Ardennes was re-considered and in 1934, P\u00e9tain called the area \"not dangerous\" and in 1936, Gamelin and the Belgian chief of staff General Cumont, the Ardennes were not vulnerable if the French held the [[Arlon]] shoulder and the Belgians the opposite one at [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Compared to the terrain and resources behind the north-eastern border and the lack of defensible ground on the northern frontier, the connecting ground of the Ardennes was less vulnerable to attack.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===Northern border===\n\n[[File:Maginot Line ln-en.svg|thumb|{{centre|Course of the Maginot Line and the defences along the Belgian borders.}}]]\nThe CSG considered the defence of the frontier from Luxembourg to Dunkirk to be the most difficult and inseparable from the defence of the north-east border with Germany. Fortifying the north-eastern frontier would economise on troops, allowing a larger force to operate on the northern border with Belgium. In the north, the flat and open country on the Franco-Belgian border would need far more extensive fortification than the hill country of Alsace and Lorraine and the high [[water table]] would mean that defences would have to be built upwards rather than dug down. A fortified defence in depth would be impractical, because the industrial [[conurbation]] of [[Lille]], [[Tourcoing]], [[Roubaix]] and [[Valenciennes]] and its railway communications, obstructed the construction of a prepared battlefield with barbed wire, trenches and tank traps. Along with the lack of geographical obstacles, there were many roads and railways straight to Paris. Fortifying the frontier might also create doubts about French intentions among the Belgians, when the Belgian route was the obvious avenue of invasion, pointing at Paris. From May 1920, the CSG considered Belgium the main route of a possible invasion, particularly as the fortification of the north-eastern frontier would deprive German planners of an alternative and force them into a version of the 1914 invasion.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=62\u201363}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Escaut Plan/Plan E, 1939\u20131940===\n\nOn the French declaration of war on 3 September 1939, French military strategy had been settled, taking in analysis of geography, resources and manpower. The French army would defend on the right and advance into Belgium on the left, to fight forward of the French frontier. The extent of the forward move was dependent on events, which had been complicated in 1936 by the Belgian repudiation of the accord of 1920. As a neutral, the Belgian state was reluctant to co-operate openly with France but did communicate information about Belgian defences. By May 1940, there had been an exchange of the general nature of French and Belgian defence plans but little co-ordination, especially against a possible German offensive west through Luxembourg and the east of Belgium. The French expected Germany to breach Belgian neutrality first, providing a pretext for French intervention or the Belgians to request support when an invasion was imminent. Most of the French mobile forces were assembled along the Belgian border, ready to make a quick move forward and take up defensive positions before the Germans arrived.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nAn early appeal for help might give the French time to reach the German\u2013Belgian frontier but if not, there were three feasible defensive lines further back: A line from [[Givet]], to [[Namur]], across the [[Gembloux|Gembloux Gap]] (la trou\u00e9e de Gembloux), [[Wavre]], [[Louvain-la-Neuve|Louvain]] and along the Dyle river to [[Antwerp]], later termed Dyle Plan/Plan D could be reached, which was {{convert|70|\u2013|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} shorter than the alternatives. A second possibility was a line from the French border to [[Cond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut|Cond\u00e9]], [[Tournai]], along the Escaut ([[Scheldt]]) to [[Ghent]] and thence to [[Zeebrugge]] on the [[North Sea]] coast, possibly further along the Scheldt (Escaut) to Antwerp, which became Escaut Plan/Plan E. The third potential defensive line was along field defences along the French border from Luxembourg to [[Dunkirk]]. For the first fortnight of the war, [[Maurice Gamelin]], [[Army general (France)|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e]] and [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[French Armed Forces]], favoured Plan E, because of the example of the fast German advances in Poland after the invasion of 1 September 1939. Gamelin and the other French commanders doubted that they could advance any further forward before the Germans arrived and in late September, Gamelin issued {{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e}} [[Gaston Billotte]], commander of the 1st Army Group a directive for,\n\n{{quote|assuring the integrity of the national territory and defending without withdrawing the position of resistance organised along the frontier....|Gamelin{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|p=7}}}}\n\nthe 1st Army Group had permission to enter Belgium and deploy along the Escaut according to Plan E. On 24 October, Gamelin directed that an advance beyond the Escaut could only be possible if the French moved fast enough to forestall the Germans.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n===Allied intelligence===\n\nBy October 1939, the Germans had prepared {{lang|de|[[Fall Gelb]]}} (Case Yellow) for an offensive in the west over the Belgian plain. The intention was to inflict a big defeat on the Allies and occupy as much of the Netherlands, Belgium and northern France as possible, to conduct an air war against Britain and protect the Ruhr against an Allied invasion of Germany. Several times over the winter Hitler ordered the plan to be implemented, with several tip-offs reaching the Allies through agents and [[Ultra]] signals intelligence. A warning that the German offensive would begin on 12 November was received from various sources, with the main panzer effort to be made against the [[Low Countries]] (Belgium and the Netherlands) and the Allied forces were alerted. It was later discovered that the {{lang|de|[[Wehrmacht]]}} ([[Commander-in-Chief]] [[Adolf Hitler]]) had been ordered to a state of readiness on 5 November, then Hitler cancelled the operation on 7 November. Several other German alerts eluded Allied military intelligence and the German invasion of Denmark and Norway caught the Allies by surprise. An agent report that the German invasion in the west was set for mid-December was received from a Czech source in the {{lang|de|[[Abwehr]]}} (German military intelligence) and another Allied alert was called, after reports that the attack would begin on 13 January. (Hitler had ordered the attack on 17 January and then postponed it again). French and British intelligence were certain that the Germans could begin an invasion quickly and that there would be little time, after the first German move forward, to discover the time and place.{{sfn|Hinsley|1979|pp=113\u2013114, 128}}\n\n===Mechelen Incident===\n\n{{main article|Mechelen Incident}}\n\nOn 10 January 1940 a German aircraft made a forced landing near [[Maasmechelen]] (Mechelen) in Belgium. The aircraft carried an officer passenger, carrying the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} plans for an offensive through central Belgium to the North Sea. The documents were seized by the Belgian authorities and passed on to Allied intelligence, but they were thought to be a plant. In the April full moon period, another Allied alert was called in case of an attack on the Low Countries or only The Netherlands, an offensive through the Low Countries, outflanking the Maginot Line from the north, an attack on the Maginot Line, or an invasion through Switzerland.

The Germans assumed that the captured documents had reinforced the Allied appreciation of their intentions and on 30 January some details of {{lang|de|Aufmarschanweisung}} N\u00b03, {{lang|de|Fall Gelb}} were amended; on 24 February, the main German effort was moved south to the Ardennes.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=76}} Twenty divisions (including seven panzer and three motorised) were transferred from [[Army Group B|''Heeresgruppe'' B]] (Army Group B) opposite The Netherlands and Belgium to [[Army Group A|''Heeresgruppe'' A]] (Army Group A) facing the Ardennes. French intelligence uncovered a transfer of German divisions from the Saar to the north of the Moselle but failed to detect the redeployment from the Netherlands frontier to the [[Eifel|Eiffel]]\u2013[[Moselle]] area.{{sfn|Hinsley|1979|pp=114, 130, 128}}\n\n===Dyle Plan/Plan D, 1940===\n\nBy late 1939, the Belgians had improved the defences along the [[Albert Canal]] and increased the readiness of the army, Gamelin and GQG began to consider the possibility of advancing further than the Escaut. By November, GQG had decided that a defence along the Dyle Line was feasible, despite the doubts of General [[Alphonse Georges]], commander of the North-Eastern Front about reaching the Dyle before the Germans. The British had been lukewarm about an advance into Belgium but Gamelin talked them round and on 9 November, the Dyle Plan was adopted. On 17 November, a session of the [[Anglo-French Supreme War Council|Supreme War Council]] deciding that it was essential to occupy the Dyle Line and Gamelin issued a directive that day detailing a line from Givet to Namur, the Gembloux Gap, Wavre, Louvain and Antwerp. For the next four months, the Dutch and Belgian armies laboured over their defences, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF, General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]]) expanded, while the French army received more equipment and training.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=7\u20138}}{{efn|Gamelin also considered a move towards [[Breda]] in the Netherlands; if the Allies prevented a German occupation of Holland, the ten divisions of the Dutch army would join the Allied armies, North Sea communications would be protected and the Germans denied air bases for attacks on Britain.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=7\u20138}}}}\n\nIn May 1940, the 1st Army Group was responsible for the defence of France from the Channel coast to the west end of the Maginot Line. The [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh Army]] ({{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e}} [[Henri Giraud]]), BEF, First Army ({{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e}} [[Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard]]) and Ninth Army ({{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e}} [[Andr\u00e9 Corap]]) were ready to advance to the Dyle Line, by pivoting on the right (southern) Second Army.{{efn|It is a French convention to list military forces from left to right.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|p=267}}}} The Seventh Army would take over west of Antwerp, ready to move into Holland and the Belgians were expected to delay a German advance at the Albert Canal and then retire to the Dyle, from Antwerp to Louvain. On the Belgian right, the BEF was to defend about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} of the Dyle from Louvain to Wavre with nine divisions and the First Army on the right of the BEF was to hold {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} with ten divisions, from Wavre across the Gembloux Gap to Namur. The gap from the Dyle to Namur north of the Sambre, with Maastricht and Mons on either side, had few natural obstacles and was a traditional route of invasion, leading straight to Paris. {{sfn|Doughty|2014a|p=11}}\n\nThe Ninth Army would take post south of Namur, along the Meuse to the left (northern) flank of the Second Army, which was the right (eastern) flank army of the 1st Army Group, holding the line from [[Pont \u00e0 Bar]] {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} west of Sedan to [[Longuyon]]. GQG considered that the Second and Ninth armies had the easiest task of the army group, dug in on the west bank of the Meuse on ground that was easily defended and behind the Ardennes, with plenty of warning of a German attack in the centre of the French front. After the transfer of the Seventh Army to the 1st Army Group, seven divisions remained behind the Second and Ninth armies and other divisions could be moved from behind the Maginot Line. All but one division were either side of the junction of the two armies, GQG being more concerned about a possible German attack past the north end of the Maginot Line and then south-east through the Stenay Gap, for which the divisions behind the Second Army were well placed.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|p=12}}\n\n====Breda variant====\n\nIf the Allies could control the Scheldt Estuary, supplies could be transported to Antwerp by ship and contact established with the Dutch army along the river. On 8 November, Gamelin directed that a German invasion of the Netherlands must not be allowed to pass round the west of Antwerp by gaining the south bank of the Scheldt. The left flank of the 1st Army Group was reinforced by the Seventh Army, containing some of the best and most mobile French divisions, which moved from the general reserve by December. The role of the army was to occupy the south bank of the Scheldt, to be ready to move into Holland and protect the estuary, by holding the north bank along the Beveland Peninsula (now the [[Walcheren]]\u2013[[Zuid-Beveland]]\u2013Noord-Beveland [[peninsula]]) in the \"Holland Hypothesis\". On 12 March 1940, Gamelin discounted dissenting opinion at GQG and decided that the Seventh Army would advance as far as Breda, to link with the Dutch. Georges was told that the Seventh Army role on the left flank of the Dyle manoeuvre would be linked to it and Georges notified Billotte, that if it were ordered to cross into the Netherlands, the left flank of the army group was to advance to [[Tilburg]] if possible and certainly to Breda. The Seventh Army was to take post between the Belgian and Dutch armies, by passing the Belgians along the Albert Canal and then turning east, a distance of {{convert|175|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}, against German armies only {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} distant from Breda. On 16 April, Gamelin also made provision for a German invasion of only the Netherlands, by changing the area to be reached by the Seventh Army; the Escaut Plan was to be followed only if the Germans forestalled the French move into Belgium.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n== Battle ==\n\n===Dyle Plan, 10\u201320 May 1940===\n\n====1st Army Group====\n\n{{see also|Battle of France|Order of battle for the Battle of France}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1981-070-15, Frankreich, Panzer IV.jpg|thumb|{{centre|German [[Panzer IV]] (photographed on 22 June 1940)}}]]\nFrom {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.,}} GQG received information from Brussels and Luxembourg, that the German invasion was about to begin and at {{nowrap|4:35 a.m.,}} the invasion of France and the Low Countries commenced.

The French collided with the 9th Panzer Division and the advance of the [[25th Motorized Division (France)|25e ''Division d'Infanterie Motoris\u00e9e'']] (25th Motorised Infantry Division) was stopped by German infantry, tanks and [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ({{lang|de|Stuka}})]] dive-bombers.\n\nThe [[1st Light Mechanized Division (France)|1e ''Division L\u00e9g\u00e8re M\u00e9canis\u00e9e'']] (1st Mechanised Light Division) was forced to retreat as the French heavy tanks were still on trains south of Antwerp. The Breda variant had been thwarted in fewer than two days and on 12 May, Gamelin ordered the Seventh Army to cancel the plan and cover Antwerp, retiring from the Bergen op Zoom\u2013Turnhout Canal Line {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Antwerp, to Lierre {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} away.

Anti-tank defences had not been built and there were no trenches or concrete fortifications; there were some [[Cointet-element]]s (steel barriers) but none of the anti-tank mines supposed to protect them. Some of the Cointet-elements were so poorly sited that a French officer wondered if the Germans had been asked where to put them. Prioux tried to persuade Billotte and Georges to scrap the Dyle Plan and revert to the Escaut Plan but with the 1st Army Group on the move, Georges decided against changing the plan; Blanchard was ordered to accelerate the advance of the First Army, to arrive on 14 May, a day earlier than the schedule.{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nThe {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}} made contact with the Germans at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} and fought a delaying action against the XVI Panzer Corps in the [[Battle of Hannut]] {{nowrap|(12\u201314 May).}} Hannut was the first tank-against-tank encounter of the campaign and the French {{nowrap|Somua S35s}} proved superior to the German tanks in firepower and armour protection.

Allied forces in Belgium continued the retreat on 18 May to the Escaut and towards the French border further south. The Germans followed up the Allied retreat on Sunday 19 May but made a much greater effort in the south from the Meuse, along the Somme river valley, towards the Channel coast.

The most advanced German units reached the Meuse in the afternoon but the local French commanders thought that they were far ahead of the main body and would wait before trying to cross the Meuse.

At {{nowrap|7:00 a.m.}} on 13 May, the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} began bombing the French defences around Sedan and continued for eight hours with about {{nowrap|1,000 aircraft,}} the biggest air attack in history.

In the French 55e Division at Sedan, some troops began to straggle to the rear; in the evening panic spread through the division. German troops attacked across the river at {{nowrap|3:00 p.m.}} and had gained three footholds on the west bank by nightfall.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|pp=42\u201346}}\n\n[[File:16May-21May Battle of Belgium.PNG|thumb|The German advance up to 21 May 1940]]\nThe French and the RAF managed to fly {{nowrap|152 bomber}} and {{nowrap|250 fighter}} sorties on the Sedan bridges on 14 May but only in formations of {{nowrap|10\u201320 aircraft.}} The attackers suffered a loss of 11 percent, the RAF losing {{nowrap|30 of 71}} aircraft and the French being reduced to sending obsolete bombers to attack in the afternoon, also with many losses. The 1e DCr, which had been intended to form part of the First Army reserve, was sent to [[Charleroi]] at the north side of the German salient on 10 May. Billotte was still unsure of the main German effort and hesitated to direct it to the Ninth Army until 14 May; the order took until the afternoon to arrive and the march was obstructed by refugees on the roads. When the 4th {{lang|fr|[[4th North African Infantry Division|Division d'infanterie nord-africaine]]}} (DINA, North African Infantry Division) counter-attacked that day, 1e DCr was still struggling forward and was caught refuelling by the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]]. The 1e DCr knocked out about {{nowrap|100 panzers}} but was defeated in detail and ceased to exist as a division.

A defensive line was to be created from Maubeuge along the Sambre and Oise but German troops got across the Sambre at Landrecies and the Oise at several points on 18 May and by evening had reached St Quentin and advanced towards Cambrai, which fell on 19 May, followed by Amiens on 20 May.

Staff studies of the Breda variant caused some senior French generals to question the plan; Georges requested that the Seventh Army be replaced by two divisions and returned to the General Reserve and warned against sending the bulk of the French mobile forces against an attack on the northern flank that was a diversion for a German attack through the centre. Doughty wrote that Gamelin gained confidence in the capacity of the Allied armies, adopting a grand strategy of dubious value over the objections of some of the most senior French generals. For control of the Scheldt Estuary and the possibility of adding ten Dutch divisions to the Allied order of battle, Gamelin committed the best divisions of the General Reserve, leaving little to confront a German surprise. Gamelin imposed the Breda variant unilaterally, without consultation with the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, which refused to make detailed arrangements for joint military action, unless invaded.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nGamelin was an officer who had risen through the French military hierarchy with a reputation for caution, yet he took a great gamble with the Dyle Plan, which was not inherently reckless until the Breda variant. Doughty wrote that had the Germans been aware of the French plan, it would have greatly relieved them of apprehensions about their huge gamble in the Ardennes. Some of the best French divisions were wasted on the Breda variant, leaving few reserves from the Rhine to the Channel, the best divisions on the flanks, leaving France vulnerable to an attack through the centre. Georges was responsible for the placement of the divisions behind the 1st Army Group but Gamelin devised the Breda variant and forced it on some reluctant subordinates.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=12\u201313}} The Dyle Plan was laid down in thick document volumes for each headquarters, Prioux complaining of \"enormous dossiers...full of corrections, additions, annexes, appendices, etc\". Motorised units in the Seventh and First armies had orders for vehicle speeds, distances to be maintained and the formalities to be observed with the Belgian authorities. Had the divisions followed their instructions, the rapid deployment to the Dyle Line would have been reduced to {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} per day.{{sfn|May|2000|p=391}}\n\n===Hannut===\nAt the Battle of Hannut, the 2nd and 3rd DLM of the {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}} with 239 Hotchkiss light tanks and 176 Somua S35s had faced the 3rd Panzer Division with 280 tanks and the 4th Panzer Division with 343 tanks. The German units had only 73 Panzer III and 52 Panzer IV, while the French also had 90 [[Panhard 178]] armoured cars, carrying [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|25 mm SA 35]] anti-tank guns, capable of penetrating any German panzer. The [[3.7 cm KwK 36|37 mm gun]] carried by the Panzer III was ineffective against the French tanks and the [[7.5 cm KwK 37|75 mm KwK 37]] of the Panzer IV could only penetrate a Somua at close-range. By fighting on the defensive, the French tanks also had the advantage of hiding in villages and engaging from cover. A lack of operational radios was a tactical disadvantage and a report from Panzer Regiment 35 called the French \"leaderless, aimless, poorly-led and tactically inferior. The French still managed to inflict a considerable number of tank casualties on the Germans at Hannut (and later at Gembloux), the 4th Panzer Division being reduced to 137 operational tanks on 16 May with only four Panzer IV, a reduction of 45\u201350 percent. The 3rd Panzer Division lost 20\u201325 percent and despite the lightly damaged tanks being quickly repaired, the fighting power of the XVI Panzer Corps was substantially reduced.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=241\u2013242, 245\u2013246}}\n\nThe Battle of Hannut was a French [[Military tactics|tactical success]], the stand of the {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}} providing time for the rest of the First Army to dig on the Dyle Line by the fifth day of operations (14 May); the German attack on the Dyle Line could not be organised in any strength until the sixth day (15 May). At the [[operational level of war]], that the Battle of Hannut had been fought at all was a big success for the German decoy operation in central Belgium, which made the French victory irrelevant in the context of the campaign. The {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}}, with its organisation and equipment, would have been invaluable for a counter-attack against the German divisions over the Meuse at Sedan. When local French counter-attacks at Sedan failed on 14 May, Gamelin contemplated ordering the {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}} to counter-attack southwards but the XVI Panzer Corps and the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} had inflicted such losses that the corps was incapable of such a manoeuvre. With no forces available against the penetration at Sedan, the XVI Panzer Corps was no longer needed for the [[feint]] in Belgium and was transferred to {{lang|de|Heeresgruppe A}} (Army Group A) on 18 May.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=241\u2013242, 245\u2013246}}\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:German losses after WWI.svg| German territorial losses after the Treaty of Versailles\nFile:MapMeuse1.jpg| Map showing the course of the Meuse\nFile:Meuse, in the french ardennes.JPG| View of the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] in the French Ardennes\nFile:Schelde Relief (de).svg| Relief map showing the Escaut/Scheldt river\nImage:KaartDijle.jpg| Diagram of the course of the Dyle (Dijle) river\nFile:LocationAlbertcanal.PNG| Diagram of the course of the Albert Canal\nFile:Map provinces Netherlands-en.svg| Map of the Netherlands, showing Breda in North Brabant\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Cull|1999}}\n|last1=Cull |first1=B. |first2=Bruce |last2=Lander |first3=Heinrich |last3=Weiss |title=Twelve Days: The Air Battle for Northern France and the Low Countries, 10\u201321 May 1940, As Seen Through the Eyes of the Fighter Pilots Involved |place=London |publisher=Grub Street |year=1999 |orig-year=1995 |isbn=978-1-902304-12-0 |display-authors=1}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Doughty|2014}}\n|series=Stackpole Military History |title=The Breaking Point: Sedan and the Fall of France, 1940 |last=Doughty |first=R.

The [[Dyle (river)|Dyle]] (Dijle) river is {{convert|86|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, from Houtain-le-Val through [[Flemish Brabant]] and [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]; Gamelin intended French, British and Belgian troops to halt a German invasion force along the line of the river. The [[Franco-Belgian Accord of 1920]] had co-ordinated [[communication]] and [[fortification]] efforts of both armies. The Belgian government let the accord lapse after the German [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]] on 7 March 1936, to adopt a policy of strict [[Neutral country|neutrality]], with the German Army ({{lang|de|[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]}}) on the Belgian border.\n\nFrench doubts about the Belgian army led to uncertainty about whether French troops could move fast enough into Belgium to avoid an encounter battle and fight a defensive battle from prepared positions. The Escaut Plan/Plan E and Dyle Plan/Plan D were devised for a forward defence in Belgium, along with a possible deployment on the French\u2013Belgian border to Dunkirk. Gamelin chose the Escaut Plan, then substituted Plan D for an advance to the line of the Dyle, which was {{convert|70|\u2013|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} shorter. Some officers at {{lang|fr|[[Grand Quartier G\u00e9n\u00e9ral (1939\u20131940)|Grand Quartier G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]}} (GQG, [[Headquarters|general headquarters]] of the French Army) doubted that the French could arrive before the Germans.\n\nGerman dissatisfaction with the campaign plan {{lang|de|[[Fall Gelb]]}} (Case Yellow), increased over the winter of 1939\u20131940. On 10 January 1940, a German aircraft landed at [[Maasmechelen]] in Belgium, carrying plans for the invasion. The [[Mechelen Incident]] was a catalyst for the doubts about {{lang|de|Fall Gelb}} and led to the [[Manstein Plan]], a bold, almost reckless, gamble for an attack further south through the Ardennes. The attack on the Low Countries became a decoy to lure the Allied armies northwards, more easily to outflank them from the south.\n\nOver the winter of 1939\u20131940, Gamelin altered Plan D with the [[Breda]] variant, an advance into the [[Netherlands]] to Breda in [[North Brabant]]. The Seventh Army, the most powerful element of the French strategic reserve, was added to the 1st Army Group close to the coast, to rush to the Scheldt Estuary and Holland, link with the Dutch army at Tilburg or Breda. Some of the best divisions of the French army were moved north, when elite units of the German army were being transferred south for the new version of {{lang|de|Fall Gelb}}, an invasion through the Ardennes.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n\n===French defence policy===\n\nAfter the territorial changes in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (28 June 1919) transferred the provinces of [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine]] to France, natural resources, industry and population close to the frontier, vital for the prosecution of another war of exhaustion, meant that the French army would not be able to gain time by retreating into the interior as it had in 1914. By the 1930s, the importance of the two provinces and north-west France the French economy had grown. The French Army was responsible for frontier protection under the {{lang|fr|Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de la guerre]]}} (CSG, Supreme War Council), which was revived on 23 January 1920. By 1922, two schools of thought had emerged, one led by General [[Edmond Buat]] that advocated the building of continuous fortifications along the frontier for a relatively static defence and one supported by Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] and Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], which wanted fortified regions to be built as centres of resistance for offensive action. Armies would manoeuvre around the centres until the most favourable time and conditions for attack. By the end of 1922, majority opinion in the CSG favoured a system that could be used offensively and defensively.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=48, 50\u201351}}\n\n===Manpower===\n\nBy 1918 French conscripts were receiving no more than three months' training and after the war, it was considered that the size of the army should be determined by the number of divisions needed for security. The number of professional soldiers and conscripts necessary was derived by multiplication and the quantity of men was more important than their education or training. In 1920, the CSG decided on 41 active divisions, plus five [[French Algeria|Algerian]] and three [[Troupes coloniales|colonial]] divisions, with a mobilisation potential of 80 divisions. The government imposed a 32-division limit with 150,000 full-time soldiers but in 1926, the government imposed a limit on the size of the army of 20 active divisions, with 106,000 professional soldiers to comprise a reservoir of trained men, on which reservists could form a mobilised wartime army. Reducing the size of the active army allowed a reduction in the number of conscripts and the term of compulsory service, from two years to one year by 1928. In 1928 a comprehensive series of laws had been passed for the recruitment and organisation of the army, which determined its peacetime nature; the cadre of professionals maintained the army ready for the mobilisation of a mass of reservists.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nThe French army expected that another war would be won by a mass army, even if it was full of short service and sketchily trained men and the period of twelve-month conscription lasted from 1928 until 1935. An army of one-year conscripts was accepted by the army, because a big, fairly well trained army in wartime was considered more important than a highly trained, quick responding and offensively minded army in peacetime. From 220,000\u2013230,000 men were trained each year, half being called up every six months, the previous group moving to the active army as the new men began training. The 106,000-man regular army was capable only of manning frontier defences, training recruits and providing planning staffs; when the garrison in the [[Occupation of the Rhineland|Rhineland]] returned, the army lost the capacity for independent or limited action in Europe without mobilisation. In the context of the later 1920s, the decline in the readiness of the standing army did not seem to be a disadvantage. By the time the one-year law affected numbers in 1932, there were 358,000 soldiers in [[metropolitan France]], of whom 232,000 men were trained enough for operations. By 1933, there were 320,000 soldiers in mainland France, with 226,000 having had more than six months' training; the French army was only twice the size of the German {{lang|de|[[Reichswehr]]}}, which was staffed with highly trained soldiers because of the long term period of service imposed by the treaty of Versailles.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=21\u201323}}\n\n===Belgium===\n\n[[File:Rhineland.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The [[Rhineland]] as defined by the Treaty of Versailles, part contiguous with the Belgian frontier.}}]]\nIn September 1920, the CSG made a strategic decision that the defence of the northern frontier must begin with a rush into Belgium. The French army never deviated from the belief that the loss of the agricultural, mining and industrial resources could never be repeated. In September, the [[Franco-Belgian Accord of 1920]] was signed, for military co-operation; if international tension increased, the Belgians would request assistance and the French would send an army to the Belgian-German border, making it the main line of French resistance to a German attack. As the policy was studied, it became clear that a force moving to the Belgo-German border would have to be mobile if it were to forestall the Germans for a defensive battle from prepared positions. Motorised transport would be necessary to rush forward French troops, then ferry engineer stores to fortify the positions. The French army created mobile fortification parks stocked with material for fortification, ready to be moved by road and rail but if the Belgian army was overwhelmed, the French might be forced into an encounter battle and a war of movement in the central Belgian plain. French strategy was to avoid a decisive battle early on, after the disaster of the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] in 1914 but the necessity of avoiding a war on French soil, meant that a forward move could not be avoided.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|p=63}}\n\n===Maginot Line===\n\n{{main article|Maginot Line}}\n\n[[File:Maginot Linie Karte.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the principal fortified section of the Maginot Line}}]]\nStudies made by the General Staff in 1919 were reported to the CSG in 1920 and a commission of 1922, chaired by Marshal [[Joseph Joffre]] reported in December 1925, in favour of centres of resistance built in peacetime, not a continuous fortified front. From 17 December 1926 to 12 October 1927, the Frontier Defence Commission reported to the CSG that fortifications should be built from Metz to Thionville and Longwy, to protect the [[Moselle Valley]] and the mineral resources and industry of Lorraine. The area around the [[Lauter (Rhine)|River Lauter]], the most north-eastern part of the common border with Germany, should be fortified as an obvious invasion route but there was no need to fortify the Rhine, because of the Vosges mountains further west and the small number of railways on the German side. [[Belfort]] was near the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] frontier and partly protected by the Rhine but there was an avenue of invasion to the west, which should be protected. The commission gave emphasis to defence against a surprise attack, with the limited objective of capturing the [[Metz]] and Lauter areas.{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=59\u201360}}{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=52\u201354}}\n\nThe commission recommended that priority be given to protecting the resources and industries of Lorraine that were vital for the French economy and would become more important for a war economy. The nature of fixed defences was debated during the 1920s, with advocates of the offensive use of fortifications, deep or shallow defences and centralised and decentralised designs. On 12 October 1927, the CSG adopted the system recommended by P\u00e9tain, of large and elaborately fortified defences from Metz to [[Thionville]] and [[Longwy]], at Lauter and Belfort, on the north-east frontier, with covered infantry positions between the main fortifications. The [[Minister of Defence (France)|Minister of War]] [[Andr\u00e9 Maginot]] (1922\u20131924, 1929\u20131930 and 1931\u20131932) became the driving force for obtaining the money to fortify the north-eastern frontier, sufficient to resist a German invasion for three weeks, to give time for the French army to mobilise. Work began in 1929 on the {{lang|fr|R\u00e9gion Fortifi\u00e9e de Metz}} (Metz Fortified Region) through the Moselle valley to the Nied at Teting, then the {{lang|fr|R\u00e9gion Fortifi\u00e9e de Lauter}}, east of Hagenau from Bitche to the Rhine, the extension of the Metz region to Longuyon and the Lauter region from Bitche to the Sarre at Wittring.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=52\u201354, 59\u201361}}{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=61\u201363}}\n\nThe requirements for the fortifications were natural cover, sites nearby for observation posts, the minimum of dead ground, a maximum arc of fire, ground suitable for anti-tank obstacles and infantry positions and ground on which paved roads could be built, to eliminate wheel marks. {{lang|fr|Maisons Fortes}} were to be built near the frontier as permanently garrisoned works, whose men would alert the army, blow bridges and erect roadblocks, for which materials were dumped. About {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} back were concrete {{lang|fr|Avant-postes}} with permanent garrisons armed with {{nowrap|47 mm or}} {{nowrap|65 mm guns,}} intended to delay an attacker so that buried casemates and {{lang|fr|ouvrages}} (fortresses) further back could be manned. Artificial obstacles of 4\u20136 rows of upright railway line, {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}-long set in concrete and of random depth and covered by barbed wire. A barbed wire obstruction {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} further back covered a field of anti-tank mines overlooked by twin machine-guns and anti-tank guns in casemates. The casemates were distributed in series and were the only defensive works along the Rhine; on other stretches, casemates were interspersed with {{lang|fr|ouvrages}}, every {{convert|3|\u2013|5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Interval Troops of infantry, gunners, engineers and mechanised light cavalry with field artillery, could manoeuvre between the fortifications, advancing to defend casemate approaches and relieve outposts or retiring to protect fortress entrances, the troops provided continuity, depth and mobility to the static defences.{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=60\u201364}}{{efn|The main fortifications were single- and double-casemates, dug into hills from {{convert|0.25|\u2013|1.25|mi|km|abbr=on}} apart, with firing chambers containing machine-guns and anti-tank guns to [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] the anti-tank and anti-infantry obstacles further forward. An upper floor was roofed by {{convert|5|\u2013|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} of concrete and living quarters for {{nowrap|25\u201335 men}} were built below with walls {{convert|2|\u2013|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick behind an earth overing; a trench {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep surrounded by barbed wire and grenade-throwers protected the work. Power came from diesel engines and the largest forts ({{lang|fr|ouvrages}}) had 1,000\u20131,200 infantry, gunners and engineers.{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=65\u201367}}}}\n\n===Ardennes===\n\n{{see also|Ardennes}}\n\n[[File:Ardennen03.png|thumb|{{centre|Map showing the Ardennes}}]]\nThe Ardennes was considered to be easily defended and in 1927, the [[Adolphe Guillaumat|Guillaumat Commission]] concluded that the few narrow serpentine roads, through wooded hills could be blocked easily with felled trees, minefields and roadblocks. The swift advance of a large force, particularly a road-bound one, through natural and artificial obstacles, could be easily made slow and arduous. Once an invader managed to get through the Ardennes, the depth and width of the river Meuse made it a considerable obstacle. The resources and equipment needed to use the Ardennes route would take so long that the French army expected to have ample time to reinforce the area.{{efn|It was expected that a German advance would take nine days to reach the Meuse but in 1940 it took under three days.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=61\u201362}}}} During the 1930s, the possibility of an attack through the Ardennes was re-considered and in 1934, P\u00e9tain called the area \"not dangerous\" and in 1936, Gamelin and the Belgian chief of staff General Cumont, the Ardennes were not vulnerable if the French held the [[Arlon]] shoulder and the Belgians the opposite one at [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Compared to the terrain and resources behind the north-eastern border and the lack of defensible ground on the northern frontier, the connecting ground of the Ardennes was less vulnerable to attack.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===Northern border===\n\n[[File:Maginot Line ln-en.svg|thumb|{{centre|Course of the Maginot Line and the defences along the Belgian borders.}}]]\nThe CSG considered the defence of the frontier from Luxembourg to Dunkirk to be the most difficult and inseparable from the defence of the north-east border with Germany. Fortifying the north-eastern frontier would economise on troops, allowing a larger force to operate on the northern border with Belgium. In the north, the flat and open country on the Franco-Belgian border would need far more extensive fortification than the hill country of Alsace and Lorraine and the high [[water table]] would mean that defences would have to be built upwards rather than dug down. A fortified defence in depth would be impractical, because the industrial [[conurbation]] of [[Lille]], [[Tourcoing]], [[Roubaix]] and [[Valenciennes]] and its railway communications, obstructed the construction of a prepared battlefield with barbed wire, trenches and tank traps. Along with the lack of geographical obstacles, there were many roads and railways straight to Paris. Fortifying the frontier might also create doubts about French intentions among the Belgians, when the Belgian route was the obvious avenue of invasion, pointing at Paris. From May 1920, the CSG considered Belgium the main route of a possible invasion, particularly as the fortification of the north-eastern frontier would deprive German planners of an alternative and force them into a version of the 1914 invasion.{{sfn|Doughty|2014|pp=62\u201363}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Escaut Plan/Plan E, 1939\u20131940===\n\nOn the French declaration of war on 3 September 1939, French military strategy had been settled, taking in analysis of geography, resources and manpower. The French army would defend on the right and advance into Belgium on the left, to fight forward of the French frontier. The extent of the forward move was dependent on events, which had been complicated in 1936 by the Belgian repudiation of the accord of 1920. As a neutral, the Belgian state was reluctant to co-operate openly with France but did communicate information about Belgian defences. By May 1940, there had been an exchange of the general nature of French and Belgian defence plans but little co-ordination, especially against a possible German offensive west through Luxembourg and the east of Belgium. The French expected Germany to breach Belgian neutrality first, providing a pretext for French intervention or the Belgians to request support when an invasion was imminent. Most of the French mobile forces were assembled along the Belgian border, ready to make a quick move forward and take up defensive positions before the Germans arrived.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nAn early appeal for help might give the French time to reach the German\u2013Belgian frontier but if not, there were three feasible defensive lines further back: A line from [[Givet]], to [[Namur]], across the [[Gembloux|Gembloux Gap]] (la trou\u00e9e de Gembloux), [[Wavre]], [[Louvain-la-Neuve|Louvain]] and along the Dyle river to [[Antwerp]], later termed Dyle Plan/Plan D could be reached, which was {{convert|70|\u2013|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} shorter than the alternatives. A second possibility was a line from the French border to [[Cond\u00e9-sur-l'Escaut|Cond\u00e9]], [[Tournai]], along the Escaut ([[Scheldt]]) to [[Ghent]] and thence to [[Zeebrugge]] on the [[North Sea]] coast, possibly further along the Scheldt (Escaut) to Antwerp, which became Escaut Plan/Plan E. The third potential defensive line was along field defences along the French border from Luxembourg to [[Dunkirk]]. For the first fortnight of the war, [[Maurice Gamelin]], [[Army general (France)|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e]] and [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[French Armed Forces]], favoured Plan E, because of the example of the fast German advances in Poland after the invasion of 1 September 1939. Gamelin and the other French commanders doubted that they could advance any further forward before the Germans arrived and in late September, Gamelin issued {{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e}} [[Gaston Billotte]], commander of the 1st Army Group a directive for,\n\n{{quote|assuring the integrity of the national territory and defending without withdrawing the position of resistance organised along the frontier....|Gamelin{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|p=7}}}}\n\nthe 1st Army Group had permission to enter Belgium and deploy along the Escaut according to Plan E. On 24 October, Gamelin directed that an advance beyond the Escaut could only be possible if the French moved fast enough to forestall the Germans.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=6\u20137}}\n\n===Allied intelligence===\n\nBy October 1939, the Germans had prepared {{lang|de|[[Fall Gelb]]}} (Case Yellow) for an offensive in the west over the Belgian plain. The intention was to inflict a big defeat on the Allies and occupy as much of the Netherlands, Belgium and northern France as possible, to conduct an air war against Britain and protect the Ruhr against an Allied invasion of Germany. Several times over the winter Hitler ordered the plan to be implemented, with several tip-offs reaching the Allies through agents and [[Ultra]] signals intelligence. A warning that the German offensive would begin on 12 November was received from various sources, with the main panzer effort to be made against the [[Low Countries]] (Belgium and the Netherlands) and the Allied forces were alerted. It was later discovered that the {{lang|de|[[Wehrmacht]]}} ([[Commander-in-Chief]] [[Adolf Hitler]]) had been ordered to a state of readiness on 5 November, then Hitler cancelled the operation on 7 November. Several other German alerts eluded Allied military intelligence and the German invasion of Denmark and Norway caught the Allies by surprise. An agent report that the German invasion in the west was set for mid-December was received from a Czech source in the {{lang|de|[[Abwehr]]}} (German military intelligence) and another Allied alert was called, after reports that the attack would begin on 13 January. (Hitler had ordered the attack on 17 January and then postponed it again). French and British intelligence were certain that the Germans could begin an invasion quickly and that there would be little time, after the first German move forward, to discover the time and place.{{sfn|Hinsley|1979|pp=113\u2013114, 128}}\n\n===Mechelen Incident===\n\n{{main article|Mechelen Incident}}\n\nOn 10 January 1940 a German aircraft made a forced landing near [[Maasmechelen]] (Mechelen) in Belgium. The aircraft carried an officer passenger, carrying the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} plans for an offensive through central Belgium to the North Sea. The documents were seized by the Belgian authorities and passed on to Allied intelligence, but they were thought to be a plant. In the April full moon period, another Allied alert was called in case of an attack on the Low Countries or only The Netherlands, an offensive through the Low Countries, outflanking the Maginot Line from the north, an attack on the Maginot Line, or an invasion through Switzerland. No contingency anticipated a German attack through the Ardennes. The Germans assumed that the captured documents had reinforced the Allied appreciation of their intentions and on 30 January some details of {{lang|de|Aufmarschanweisung}} N\u00b03, {{lang|de|Fall Gelb}} were amended; on 24 February, the main German effort was moved south to the Ardennes.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=76}} Twenty divisions (including seven panzer and three motorised) were transferred from [[Army Group B|''Heeresgruppe'' B]] (Army Group B) opposite The Netherlands and Belgium to [[Army Group A|''Heeresgruppe'' A]] (Army Group A) facing the Ardennes. French intelligence uncovered a transfer of German divisions from the Saar to the north of the Moselle but failed to detect the redeployment from the Netherlands frontier to the [[Eifel|Eiffel]]\u2013[[Moselle]] area.{{sfn|Hinsley|1979|pp=114, 130, 128}}\n\n===Dyle Plan/Plan D, 1940===\n\nBy late 1939, the Belgians had improved the defences along the [[Albert Canal]] and increased the readiness of the army, Gamelin and GQG began to consider the possibility of advancing further than the Escaut. By November, GQG had decided that a defence along the Dyle Line was feasible, despite the doubts of General [[Alphonse Georges]], commander of the North-Eastern Front about reaching the Dyle before the Germans. The British had been lukewarm about an advance into Belgium but Gamelin talked them round and on 9 November, the Dyle Plan was adopted. On 17 November, a session of the [[Anglo-French Supreme War Council|Supreme War Council]] deciding that it was essential to occupy the Dyle Line and Gamelin issued a directive that day detailing a line from Givet to Namur, the Gembloux Gap, Wavre, Louvain and Antwerp. For the next four months, the Dutch and Belgian armies laboured over their defences, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF, General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Lord Gort]]) expanded, while the French army received more equipment and training.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=7\u20138}}{{efn|Gamelin also considered a move towards [[Breda]] in the Netherlands; if the Allies prevented a German occupation of Holland, the ten divisions of the Dutch army would join the Allied armies, North Sea communications would be protected and the Germans denied air bases for attacks on Britain.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=7\u20138}}}}\n\nIn May 1940, the 1st Army Group was responsible for the defence of France from the Channel coast to the west end of the Maginot Line. The [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh Army]] ({{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e}} [[Henri Giraud]]), BEF, First Army ({{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e}} [[Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard]]) and Ninth Army ({{lang|fr|G\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'arm\u00e9e}} [[Andr\u00e9 Corap]]) were ready to advance to the Dyle Line, by pivoting on the right (southern) Second Army.{{efn|It is a French convention to list military forces from left to right.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|p=267}}}} The Seventh Army would take over west of Antwerp, ready to move into Holland and the Belgians were expected to delay a German advance at the Albert Canal and then retire to the Dyle, from Antwerp to Louvain. On the Belgian right, the BEF was to defend about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} of the Dyle from Louvain to Wavre with nine divisions and the First Army on the right of the BEF was to hold {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} with ten divisions, from Wavre across the Gembloux Gap to Namur. The gap from the Dyle to Namur north of the Sambre, with Maastricht and Mons on either side, had few natural obstacles and was a traditional route of invasion, leading straight to Paris. {{sfn|Doughty|2014a|p=11}}\n\nThe Ninth Army would take post south of Namur, along the Meuse to the left (northern) flank of the Second Army, which was the right (eastern) flank army of the 1st Army Group, holding the line from [[Pont \u00e0 Bar]] {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} west of Sedan to [[Longuyon]]. GQG considered that the Second and Ninth armies had the easiest task of the army group, dug in on the west bank of the Meuse on ground that was easily defended and behind the Ardennes, with plenty of warning of a German attack in the centre of the French front. After the transfer of the Seventh Army to the 1st Army Group, seven divisions remained behind the Second and Ninth armies and other divisions could be moved from behind the Maginot Line. All but one division were either side of the junction of the two armies, GQG being more concerned about a possible German attack past the north end of the Maginot Line and then south-east through the Stenay Gap, for which the divisions behind the Second Army were well placed.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|p=12}}\n\n====Breda variant====\n\nIf the Allies could control the Scheldt Estuary, supplies could be transported to Antwerp by ship and contact established with the Dutch army along the river. On 8 November, Gamelin directed that a German invasion of the Netherlands must not be allowed to pass round the west of Antwerp by gaining the south bank of the Scheldt. The left flank of the 1st Army Group was reinforced by the Seventh Army, containing some of the best and most mobile French divisions, which moved from the general reserve by December. The role of the army was to occupy the south bank of the Scheldt, to be ready to move into Holland and protect the estuary, by holding the north bank along the Beveland Peninsula (now the [[Walcheren]]\u2013[[Zuid-Beveland]]\u2013Noord-Beveland [[peninsula]]) in the \"Holland Hypothesis\". On 12 March 1940, Gamelin discounted dissenting opinion at GQG and decided that the Seventh Army would advance as far as Breda, to link with the Dutch. Georges was told that the Seventh Army role on the left flank of the Dyle manoeuvre would be linked to it and Georges notified Billotte, that if it were ordered to cross into the Netherlands, the left flank of the army group was to advance to [[Tilburg]] if possible and certainly to Breda. The Seventh Army was to take post between the Belgian and Dutch armies, by passing the Belgians along the Albert Canal and then turning east, a distance of {{convert|175|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}, against German armies only {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} distant from Breda. On 16 April, Gamelin also made provision for a German invasion of only the Netherlands, by changing the area to be reached by the Seventh Army; the Escaut Plan was to be followed only if the Germans forestalled the French move into Belgium.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n== Battle ==\n\n===Dyle Plan, 10\u201320 May 1940===\n\n====1st Army Group====\n\n{{see also|Battle of France|Order of battle for the Battle of France}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1981-070-15, Frankreich, Panzer IV.jpg|thumb|{{centre|German [[Panzer IV]] (photographed on 22 June 1940)}}]]\nFrom {{nowrap|1:00 a.m.,}} GQG received information from Brussels and Luxembourg, that the German invasion was about to begin and at {{nowrap|4:35 a.m.,}} the invasion of France and the Low Countries commenced.

Some of the Cointet-elements were so poorly sited that a French officer wondered if the Germans had been asked where to put them. Prioux tried to persuade Billotte and Georges to scrap the Dyle Plan and revert to the Escaut Plan but with the 1st Army Group on the move, Georges decided against changing the plan; Blanchard was ordered to accelerate the advance of the First Army, to arrive on 14 May, a day earlier than the schedule.{{sfn|Rowe|1959|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nThe {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}} made contact with the Germans at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} and fought a delaying action against the XVI Panzer Corps in the [[Battle of Hannut]] {{nowrap|(12\u201314 May).}} Hannut was the first tank-against-tank encounter of the campaign and the French {{nowrap|Somua S35s}} proved superior to the German tanks in firepower and armour protection.

Staff studies of the Breda variant caused some senior French generals to question the plan; Georges requested that the Seventh Army be replaced by two divisions and returned to the General Reserve and warned against sending the bulk of the French mobile forces against an attack on the northern flank that was a diversion for a German attack through the centre. Doughty wrote that Gamelin gained confidence in the capacity of the Allied armies, adopting a grand strategy of dubious value over the objections of some of the most senior French generals. For control of the Scheldt Estuary and the possibility of adding ten Dutch divisions to the Allied order of battle, Gamelin committed the best divisions of the General Reserve, leaving little to confront a German surprise. Gamelin imposed the Breda variant unilaterally, without consultation with the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, which refused to make detailed arrangements for joint military action, unless invaded.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nGamelin was an officer who had risen through the French military hierarchy with a reputation for caution, yet he took a great gamble with the Dyle Plan, which was not inherently reckless until the Breda variant. Doughty wrote that had the Germans been aware of the French plan, it would have greatly relieved them of apprehensions about their huge gamble in the Ardennes. Some of the best French divisions were wasted on the Breda variant, leaving few reserves from the Rhine to the Channel, the best divisions on the flanks, leaving France vulnerable to an attack through the centre. Georges was responsible for the placement of the divisions behind the 1st Army Group but Gamelin devised the Breda variant and forced it on some reluctant subordinates.{{sfn|Doughty|2014a|pp=12\u201313}} The Dyle Plan was laid down in thick document volumes for each headquarters, Prioux complaining of \"enormous dossiers...full of corrections, additions, annexes, appendices, etc\". Motorised units in the Seventh and First armies had orders for vehicle speeds, distances to be maintained and the formalities to be observed with the Belgian authorities. Had the divisions followed their instructions, the rapid deployment to the Dyle Line would have been reduced to {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} per day.{{sfn|May|2000|p=391}}\n\n===Hannut===\nAt the Battle of Hannut, the 2nd and 3rd DLM of the {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}} with 239 Hotchkiss light tanks and 176 Somua S35s had faced the 3rd Panzer Division with 280 tanks and the 4th Panzer Division with 343 tanks. The German units had only 73 Panzer III and 52 Panzer IV, while the French also had 90 [[Panhard 178]] armoured cars, carrying [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|25 mm SA 35]] anti-tank guns, capable of penetrating any German panzer. The [[3.7 cm KwK 36|37 mm gun]] carried by the Panzer III was ineffective against the French tanks and the [[7.5 cm KwK 37|75 mm KwK 37]] of the Panzer IV could only penetrate a Somua at close-range. By fighting on the defensive, the French tanks also had the advantage of hiding in villages and engaging from cover. A lack of operational radios was a tactical disadvantage and a report from Panzer Regiment 35 called the French \"leaderless, aimless, poorly-led and tactically inferior. The French still managed to inflict a considerable number of tank casualties on the Germans at Hannut (and later at Gembloux), the 4th Panzer Division being reduced to 137 operational tanks on 16 May with only four Panzer IV, a reduction of 45\u201350 percent. The 3rd Panzer Division lost 20\u201325 percent and despite the lightly damaged tanks being quickly repaired, the fighting power of the XVI Panzer Corps was substantially reduced.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=241\u2013242, 245\u2013246}}\n\nThe Battle of Hannut was a French [[Military tactics|tactical success]], the stand of the {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}} providing time for the rest of the First Army to dig on the Dyle Line by the fifth day of operations (14 May); the German attack on the Dyle Line could not be organised in any strength until the sixth day (15 May). At the [[operational level of war]], that the Battle of Hannut had been fought at all was a big success for the German decoy operation in central Belgium, which made the French victory irrelevant in the context of the campaign. The {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}}, with its organisation and equipment, would have been invaluable for a counter-attack against the German divisions over the Meuse at Sedan. When local French counter-attacks at Sedan failed on 14 May, Gamelin contemplated ordering the {{lang|fr|Corps de Cavalerie}} to counter-attack southwards but the XVI Panzer Corps and the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} had inflicted such losses that the corps was incapable of such a manoeuvre. With no forces available against the penetration at Sedan, the XVI Panzer Corps was no longer needed for the [[feint]] in Belgium and was transferred to {{lang|de|Heeresgruppe A}} (Army Group A) on 18 May.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=241\u2013242, 245\u2013246}}\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:German losses after WWI.svg| German territorial losses after the Treaty of Versailles\nFile:MapMeuse1.jpg| Map showing the course of the Meuse\nFile:Meuse, in the french ardennes.JPG| View of the [[Meuse River|Meuse]] in the French Ardennes\nFile:Schelde Relief (de).svg| Relief map showing the Escaut/Scheldt river\nImage:KaartDijle.jpg| Diagram of the course of the Dyle (Dijle) river\nFile:LocationAlbertcanal.PNG| Diagram of the course of the Albert Canal\nFile:Map provinces Netherlands-en.svg| Map of the Netherlands, showing Breda in North Brabant\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Cull|1999}}\n|last1=Cull |first1=B. |first2=Bruce |last2=Lander |first3=Heinrich |last3=Weiss |title=Twelve Days: The Air Battle for Northern France and the Low Countries, 10\u201321 May 1940, As Seen Through the Eyes of the Fighter Pilots Involved |place=London |publisher=Grub Street |year=1999 |orig-year=1995 |isbn=978-1-902304-12-0 |display-authors=1}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Doughty|2014}}\n|series=Stackpole Military History |title=The Breaking Point: Sedan and the Fall of France, 1940 |last=Doughty |first=R.

Instead, the system offered something completely different by introducing motion-based controls to the console market in an attempt to change the ways video games are played, and consequently, to widen the audience for video games in general - which it successfully did. This strategy demonstrated Nintendo's belief that graphical advancement isn't the only way to make progress in gaming technology; indeed, after the Wii's overwhelming initial success, Sony and Microsoft released their own motion control peripherals. Nintendo's emphasis on peripherals for the Wii has also been pointed to as an example of Yokoi's \"lateral thinking\" at work.<ref>Jones, Steven E. and Thiruvathukal, George K.

Instead, the system offered something completely different by introducing motion-based controls to the console market in an attempt to change the ways video games are played, and consequently, to widen the audience for video games in general - which it successfully did. This strategy demonstrated Nintendo's belief that graphical advancement isn't the only way to make progress in gaming technology; indeed, after the Wii's overwhelming initial success, Sony and Microsoft released their own motion control peripherals. Nintendo's emphasis on peripherals for the Wii has also been pointed to as an example of Yokoi's \"lateral thinking\" at work.<ref>Jones, Steven E. and Thiruvathukal, George K.

The basis of all the treasures dating back to this period were foreign [[silver]] [[coin]]s.\n\nTogether with the emergence of the first ancient settlements in the late 8th to early [[9th century]], foreign coins appeared on [[Slavs|Slavic]] lands of [[Eastern Europe]]. The formation of money circulation started when active trade in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] with the countries of the [[Caliphate]] began. [[Eastern European]] countries, deprived of large ore reserves of monetary [[metal]], actively imported [[silver]]. In the first third of the 9th century, [[coin]]s ([[dirham]]s) which were minted in the [[Africa]]n centers of the [[Caliphate]] and which reached [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]]' via the [[Caucasus]] and [[Silk Road|Central Asian trade routes]] became widespread in ancient [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Dirham]]s were used as a means of payment, worn as jewelry and melted down. In the northern regions, [[Western Europe]]an [[denarius]] of [[Germany|German]], [[England|English]] and [[Scandinavia]]n coinage came to replace [[dirham]]s. They were in [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] until the beginning of the 12th century, when the [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] of foreign coins ceased, most likely due to a decrease in the [[silver]] sample, and replaced by silver bars ([[Grivna|hryvnia]]), held out until the middle of the 14th century.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe main means of circulation of [[Southern Russia]] ([[Kiev]], [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]], [[Smolensk]], etc.) were cuttings from [[dirham]]s weighing 1.38 grams (Rezanas), which were 1/200 of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[litra]]s. Similar cuttings were used on the lands of [[Northern Russia]], but their weight was 1.04 grams or 1/200 silver [[Grivna|hryvnia]].\n\nAt the turn of the 10th to 11th centuries at the time of [[Vladimir the Great]] and [[Sviatopolk I of Kiev|Svyatopolk]] was made an attempt to [[Coining (mint)|stamp]] [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] coins.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Hryvnia - Kuna monetary system ===\n\n==== Kuna ====\nKuna is a weight and monetary unit, as well as the name of the [[coin]]s used in [[Russia]] in the 9th to 15th centuries. Russian money [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] arose at the beginning of the IX century due to the massive penetration into the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] lands of the eastern [[dirham]] weighing 2.73 g which gets the name \"Kuna\".

When dirham received the name \u201cKuna\u201d, the equivalent of a part of kuna was called \u201crezana\u201d. Fragments of [[dirhams]] (1/2, 1/4, etc.) are often found in ancient Russian treasures. The fragmentation of dirhams indicates that the whole coin was too large for small trade transactions.\n\nIn the IX century. Rezana was equal to 1/50 of the [[Grivna|hryvnia]], in the XII century equated to kuna due to the fact that kuna became twice as light and was not 1/25, but 1/50 [[Grivna|hryvnia]]. Kuna and rezana existed in parallel, but gradually the counting on the kuna became more common. Rezanas existed until the XII century, when the flow of silver [[dirhams]] from [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] finally dried up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.russian-money.ru/|title=Russian coins and banknotes of all time|website=en.russian-money.ru|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Rus' coins ===\n[[File:\u0417\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 (\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446 X - \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e XI \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430).jpg|thumb|Zlatnik]]\n\n==== Zlatnik ====\nZlatnik (also - zolotnik) - the first ancient Russian [[gold]] [[coin]], minted in [[Kiev]] in the late 10th and early 11th centuries, shortly after the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Baptism of Russia]] by [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]].\n\nThe real name of these coins is unknown, the term \u201czlatnik\u201d is used in [[numismatics]] traditionally and is known from the text of the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty|Rus'-Byzantine treaty]]{{dn|date=February 2020}} of the year 912 of the Prophetic [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]]. 1 zlatnik was 1/35 of kievan gold [[Grivna|hryvnia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212131/http://www.ukrmuseum.org.ua/ua/main/treasures/show/1426.html|title=\u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438|date=2007-10-13|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> The mass of Zlatnik (about 4.2 g) was later used as the basis for the Russian weight unit, the Zolotnik.\n\nThe appearance of Russian coinage was the result of the revival of trade and cultural ties with [[Byzantium]]. The obvious model for Vladimir's Zlatniks was the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]] of the emperors [[Basil II]] and [[Constantine VIII]], which are similar to the Zlatniks by weight (about 4.2 grams) and the arrangement of images.\n\n===== General information =====\nIt has been repeatedly suggested that the start of minting in Russia of its own [[coin]] ([[gold]] and [[silver]]) did not so much meet the requirements of the [[economy]] (money circulation in Russia was provided by imported [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Arab world|Arab]] and [[Western Europe]]an coins; there were no sources of monetary metal in [[Russia]]) but the significance of the [[Russia]]n state. Silver coinage continued at the beginning of the XI century under the reign of [[Sviatopolk I of Kiev|Svyatopolk]] and [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]], however, the coinage of Zlatniks after the death of [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] no longer resumed. Judging by the small number of copies that have come down to us, the release of Zlatniks was extremely short in time (perhaps one or two years) and small in volume. However, all currently known copies of Zlatniks found in treasures, along with other coins of that time, bear traces of being in circulation - therefore, these coins were not ritual, award or gift. In the 11th century, judging by the findings of these coins in the treasures in [[Pinsk]] and [[Kienberg, Switzerland|Kienburg]], Zlatniks also participated in international money circulation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0418\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442 X\u2014XI \u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u042d\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0435|last=\u0421\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u041c. \u041f.|first=|publisher=\u0410\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430, 1977|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===== Description of the coin type =====\nReverse: a chest portrait of [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]] in a hat with pendants topped with a cross.

Srebreniks of the first issues basically repeated the type of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] coins (the front side is the image of the prince, the back side is the image of [[Jesus|Christ]]). In the 11th century, the image of [[Jesus|Christ]] was replaced by a large patrimonial sign of [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikovich]]. A legend was placed around the portrait of the prince: \u201c[[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] on the throne, and here is his silver\u201d.\n\nSrebrenik of [[Yaroslav the Wise]] differed from the described appearance. On one side, instead of [[Jesus|Christ]], there was an image of [[Saint George|St. Georgy]] (Christian patron of [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]), on the other - the patrimonial sign of [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikovich]] and the inscription: \u201c[[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslavs]] silver\u201d without the words \u201con the throne\u201d, which gives reason to attribute their release to the period of [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]'s reign in [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] during the life of [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir Svyatoslavovich]]. [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]\u2019s Srebrenik is a unique phenomenon in the coin production of Europe of the XI century in relation to the masterful execution of a coin stamp, sometimes even causing suspicions that these are later fakes. A completely different type is represented by the [[Tmutarakan]] coins, on one side of which was an image of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]], and on the other side the inscription: \u201cLord, help Michael\u201d. The technique of making Srebrenik has its own characteristics. Circles were not cut from the plate (as in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Arab world|Arabic]] coins), but were molded.\n\n== Coinless period from the 12th century (commodity-money) ==\n==== Description of the period ====\nThe coinless period is a period in the history of the currency of Ancient Russia, characterized by an almost complete absence of both foreign and domestic coins. After the extinction of the inflow of eastern coins to Russia due to the weakening of the [[Caliphate]], they were replaced by [[Commodity money|commodity-money]]. This period began in the 12th century and ended in the 14th century. Commodity money were used as a medium of circulation. Large calculations were made with the help of [[cattle]] and [[silver]] [[ingot]]s - [[Grivna|hryvnias]]; for small calculations was used fur, sometimes glass bracelets, beads, spindling, and other standard products of ancient Russian crafts. In some cases, even the [[Shell money|cowry shells]], which in [[Siberia]] retained their value as a small change coin until the beginning of the 19th century.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nStarting with the establishment of the [[Tatar-Mongol yoke]], the economy of the ancient Russian principalities is increasingly acquiring natural features. The main function of money became the function in the means of accumulation: coins were hoarding and deposit in treasures. This period was called coinless, covering the 12th through 14th centuries.\n\nOwn silver deposits were discovered in Russia only in the 18th century, therefore the country's monetary economy depended entirely on the influx of this metal, primarily in the form of a coin, from abroad. In the 12th century, this influx began to shorten from the western direction (presumably due to the strengthening of the [[Germany|German]] knight orders in the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]] and the beginning of regular hostilities between them and the western principalities; see the article \u201c[[Ostsiedlung]]\u201d), and in the 13th century from the eastern (presumably, this was caused by the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Tatar-Mongol invasion]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?hl=ru&id=WI9NAQAAIAAJ&dq=%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD+%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD|title=\u0411\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043e-\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 XII-XV \u0432\u0432|last=\u041c\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432|first=\u0410\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0440 \u0413\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|date=1983|publisher=\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the coinless period is associated with the gradual restoration of trade relations (both internal and external), with the beginning of the spread of Juchi coins (silver [[dirham]]s and copper pools of the [[Golden Horde]])\n[[File:Bulryasia.jpg|thumb|Ovruch slate spindle whorl]]\n\n==== Ovruch slate spindle whorl ====\nOvruch slate spindle whorl - [[spindle whorl]], carved out of pink and red slate stone ([[Pyrophyllite|pyrophyllite slate]]), which was mined in the territory of present-day [[Ukraine]], near the town of [[Ovruch]] in the 10th through 13th centuries.

For this period coins disappeared in Russia. For large payments were used [[Grivna|hryvnia-ingots]].\n\nThe original theory of commodity-money was proposed by [[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]]. The scientist stated that the role of money for small payments could be fulfilled by some uniform and widespread products in Ancient Russia - such as crystal and cornelian beads, often marked in hoards with coins, multi-colored glass bracelets, and ovruch slate spindle whorls. These [[spindle whorl]]s were repeatedly met in hoards along with ingots, and during excavations in [[Pskov]], for example, they were found in a wallet with [[Western Europe]]an [[coin]]s. When [[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]] combined the distribution maps of glass bracelets and [[slate]] [[Spindle whorl|spindles whorls]], and also plotted the boundaries of the monetary circulation area before the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]], their detailed coincidence was discovered. Slate [[spindle whorl]] could well play the role of a coin. It was impossible to fake it, because the [[Slate|pink slate]] deposit in [[Ovruch]] was the only one in [[Eastern Europe]].

It was highly valued in other countries, which allowed for a profitable trade. Also known as a substitute for money were [[Shell money|small cowries shells]] ([[Monetaria moneta|Cypraea]]). But nevertheless finds of skins and shells come across not so often. The basis of all the treasures dating back to this period were foreign [[silver]] [[coin]]s.\n\nTogether with the emergence of the first ancient settlements in the late VIII - early [[9th century|IX century]], foreign coins appeared on [[Slavs|Slavic]] lands of [[Eastern Europe]]. The formation of money circulation started when active trade in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] with the countries of the [[Caliphate]] began. [[Eastern European]] countries, deprived of large ore reserves of monetary [[metal]], actively imported [[silver]]. In the first third of the IX century, [[coin]]s ([[dirham]]s) which were minted in the [[Africa]]n centers of the [[Caliphate]] and which reached [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]]' via the [[Caucasus]] and [[Silk Road|Central Asian trade routes]] became widespread in ancient [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Dirham]]s were used as a means of payment, worn as jewelry and melted down. In the northern regions, [[Western Europe]]an [[denarius]] of [[Germany|German]], [[England|English]] and [[Scandinavia]]n coinage came to replace [[dirham]]s. They were in [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] until the beginning of the XII century, when the [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] of foreign coins ceased, most likely due to a decrease in the [[silver]] sample, and replaced by silver bars ([[Grivna|hryvnia]]), held out until the middle of the XIV century.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe main means of circulation of [[Southern Russia]] ([[Kiev]], [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]], [[Smolensk]], etc.) were cuttings from [[dirham]]s weighing 1.38 grams (Rezanas), which were 1/200 of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[litra]]s.

Judging by the small number of copies that have come down to us, the release of Zlatniks was extremely short in time (perhaps one or two years) and small in volume. However, all currently known copies of Zlatniks found in treasures, along with other coins of that time, bear traces of being in circulation - therefore, these coins were not ritual, award or gift. In the XI century, judging by the findings of these coins in the treasures in [[Pinsk]] and [[Kienberg, Switzerland|Kienburg]], Zlatniks also participated in international money circulation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0418\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442 X\u2014XI \u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u042d\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0435|last=\u0421\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u041c. \u041f.|first=|publisher=\u0410\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430, 1977|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===== Description of the coin type =====\nReverse: a chest portrait of [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]] in a hat with pendants topped with a cross.

Srebreniks of the first issues basically repeated the type of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] coins (the front side is the image of the prince, the back side is the image of [[Jesus|Christ]]). In the XI century, the image of [[Jesus|Christ]] was replaced by a large patrimonial sign of [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikovich]]. A legend was placed around the portrait of the prince: \u201c[[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] on the throne, and here is his silver\u201d.\n\nSrebrenik of [[Yaroslav the Wise]] differed from the described appearance. On one side, instead of [[Jesus|Christ]], there was an image of [[Saint George|St. Georgy]] (Christian patron of [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]), on the other - the patrimonial sign of [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikovich]] and the inscription: \u201c[[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslavs]] silver\u201d without the words \u201con the throne\u201d, which gives reason to attribute their release to the period of [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]'s reign in [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] during the life of [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir Svyatoslavovich]]. [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]\u2019s Srebrenik is a unique phenomenon in the coin production of Europe of the XI century in relation to the masterful execution of a coin stamp, sometimes even causing suspicions that these are later fakes. A completely different type is represented by the [[Tmutarakan]] coins, on one side of which was an image of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]], and on the other side the inscription: \u201cLord, help Michael\u201d. The technique of making Srebrenik has its own characteristics. Circles were not cut from the plate (as in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Arab world|Arabic]] coins), but were molded.\n\n== Coinless period from XII century (commodity-money) ==\n==== Description of the period ====\nThe coinless period is a period in the history of the currency of Ancient Russia, characterized by an almost complete absence of both foreign and domestic coins. After the extinction of the inflow of eastern coins to Russia due to the weakening of the [[Caliphate]], they were replaced by [[Commodity money|commodity-money]]. This period began in the XII century and ended in the XIV century. Commodity money were used as a medium of circulation. Large calculations were made with the help of [[cattle]] and [[silver]] [[ingot]]s - [[Grivna|hryvnias]]; for small calculations was used fur, sometimes glass bracelets, beads, spindling, and other standard products of ancient Russian crafts. In some cases, even the [[Shell money|cowry shells]], which in [[Siberia]] retained their value as a small change coin until the beginning of the XIX century.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nStarting with the establishment of the [[Tatar-Mongol yoke]], the economy of the ancient Russian principalities is increasingly acquiring natural features. The main function of money became the function in the means of accumulation: coins were hoarding and deposit in treasures. This period was called coinless, covering the XII, XIII and XIV centuries.\n\nOwn silver deposits were discovered in Russia only in the XVIII century, therefore the country's monetary economy depended entirely on the influx of this metal, primarily in the form of a coin, from abroad. In the XII century, this influx began to shorten from the western direction (presumably due to the strengthening of the [[Germany|German]] knight orders in the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]] and the beginning of regular hostilities between them and the western principalities; see the article \u201c[[Ostsiedlung]]\u201d), and in the XIII century from the eastern (presumably, this was caused by the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Tatar-Mongol invasion]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?hl=ru&id=WI9NAQAAIAAJ&dq=%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD+%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD|title=\u0411\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043e-\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 XII-XV \u0432\u0432|last=\u041c\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432|first=\u0410\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0440 \u0413\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|date=1983|publisher=\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the coinless period is associated with the gradual restoration of trade relations (both internal and external), with the beginning of the spread of Juchi coins (silver [[dirham]]s and copper pools of the [[Golden Horde]])\n[[File:Bulryasia.jpg|thumb|Ovruch slate spindle whorl]]\n\n==== Ovruch slate spindle whorl ====\nOvruch slate spindle whorl - [[spindle whorl]], carved out of pink and red slate stone ([[Pyrophyllite|pyrophyllite slate]]), which was mined in the territory of present-day [[Ukraine]], near the town of [[Ovruch]] in the X - XIII centuries.

For this period coins disappeared in Russia. For large payments were used [[Grivna|hryvnia-ingots]].\n\nThe original theory of commodity-money was proposed by [[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]]. The scientist stated that the role of money for small payments could be fulfilled by some uniform and widespread products in Ancient Russia - such as crystal and cornelian beads, often marked in hoards with coins, multi-colored glass bracelets, and ovruch slate spindle whorls. These [[spindle whorl]]s were repeatedly met in hoards along with ingots, and during excavations in [[Pskov]], for example, they were found in a wallet with [[Western Europe]]an [[coin]]s. When [[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]] combined the distribution maps of glass bracelets and [[slate]] [[Spindle whorl|spindles whorls]], and also plotted the boundaries of the monetary circulation area before the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]], their detailed coincidence was discovered. Slate [[spindle whorl]] could well play the role of a coin. It was impossible to fake it, because the [[Slate|pink slate]] deposit in [[Ovruch]] was the only one in [[Eastern Europe]]. In [[China]], according to one of the versions, the spindle became the prototype of the first coins with a square hole.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Cowry coin ====\nAnd one more find attracted the attention of scientists: [[Monetaria moneta|Cypraea's shell]] - the [[Shell money|cowry coin]]. These beautiful porcelain shells were mined only around the [[Maldives]] and [[Lakshadweep|Laccadives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]. From ancient times they were exported to [[India]], from where they spread throughout the world. Shells have been used for thousands of years in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] as small money. In [[Russia]], [[cowry]] has been known under the name of \"snake heads\". In Russian trade in [[Siberia]], they retained their product value until the XIX century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historic.ru/books/item/f00/s00/z0000082/st005.shtml|title=\u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 (\u0422\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u041c.\u041d.)|website=historic.ru|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Kievan Rus']]\n[[Category:Economic history of Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Economic history of Belarus]]\n[[Category:Economic history of Russia]]\n[[Category:History of money]]\n", "name_user": "CaptainAnarchy", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_of_Kievan_Rus%27"}

The provisional government had taken power after being proclaimed by [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]]'s younger brother, declined to take power after the Tsar had stepped down.\n\nDuring this time, urban workers began to organize into councils ([[soviet (council)|soviet]]s) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions. After the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|Congress of Soviets]], the new governing body, had its second session it elected members of the Bolsheviks and other left-wing groups such as the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] (Left SR) to important positions within the new state of affairs. This immediately initiated the establishment of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Russian Soviet Republic]]. On 17 July 1918,{{efn|the Gregorian Calendar [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|came into effect in Russia]] on 24 January 1918}} the Tsar and [[Romanov dynasty|his family]], including his five children aged 13 to 22, were [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed]].\n\nThe revolution was led by the Bolsheviks, who used their influence in the [[Petrograd Soviet]] to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] forces under the [[Military-Revolutionary Committee]] began the occupation of government buildings on 25 October (O.S.; 7 November, N.S.), 1917. The following day, the [[Winter Palace]] (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia) was captured.\n\nThe slogan of the October revolution was All Power to the Soviets, meaning all power to grassroots democratically elected councils. For a time, this was observed, with the interim Bolshevik-only Sovnarkom or Soviet government replaced by a Bolshevik-Left SR coalition government with an All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets composed of all representatives of all factions who supported Soviet power and legally entrenching the peasant land seizures. Throughout 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which resulted in a Left SR walkout, and other policies disputed by both the other pro-soviet parties and minority factions of the Bolsheviks progressively dissipated until 1920, where there were no free elections, but delegates were appointed by a party state.\n\nThe long-awaited [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] [[1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election|elections]] were held on 12 November (O.S., 25 November, (N.S.)) 1917. In contrast to their majority in the Soviets, the Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715-seat legislative body, coming in second behind the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], which won 370 seats, although the SR Party no longer existed as a whole party by that time, as the Left SRs had gone into coalition with the Bolsheviks from October 1917 to March 1918 (a cause of dispute of the legitimacy of the returned seating of the Constituent Assembly, as the old lists, were drawn up by the old SR Party leadership, and thus represented mostly Right SRs, whereas the peasant soviet deputies had returned majorities for the pro-Bolshevik Left SRs). The Constituent Assembly was to first meet on 28 November (O.S.) 1917, but its convocation was delayed until 5 January (O.S.; 18 January, N.S.) 1918 by the Bolsheviks. On its first and only day in session, the Constituent Assembly came into conflict with the Soviets, and it rejected Soviet decrees on peace and land, resulting in the Constituent Assembly being dissolved the next day by order of the Congress of Soviets.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://alphahistory.com/russianrevolution/constituent-assembly/| author=Jennifer Llewellyn, John Rae, and Steve Thompson| title=The Constituent Assembly| publisher=Alpha History| date=2014}}</ref>\n\nAs the revolution was not universally recognized, there followed the struggles of the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917\u201322) and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922.\n\n==Etymology==\nAt first, the event was referred to as the \"October coup\" (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442) or the \"Uprising of the 3rd\", as seen in contemporary documents (for example, in the first editions of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s complete works). However, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 has a meaning similar to \"revolution\" and also means \"upheaval\" or \"overturn\", so \"coup\" is not necessarily the correct translation. With time, the term \"October Revolution\" (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f) came into use. It is also known as the \"November Revolution\" having occurred in November, according to the Gregorian Calendar{{Sfn|Bunyan|Fisher|1934| p=385}} (for details, see [[Soviet calendar]]).\n\n==Background==\n\n===February Revolution===\n{{main|February Revolution}}\n\nThe [[February Revolution]] had toppled Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and replaced his government with the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. However, the provisional government was weak and riven by internal dissension. It continued to wage [[World War I]], which became increasingly unpopular. There was a nationwide crisis affecting social, economic, and political relations. Disorder in industry and transport had intensified, and difficulties in obtaining provisions had increased. Gross industrial production in 1917 decreased by over 36% of what it had been in 1914. In the autumn, as much as 50% of all enterprises in the [[Ural (region)|Urals]], the [[Donbas]], and other industrial centers were closed down, leading to mass unemployment. At the same time, the cost of living increased sharply. Real wages fell to about 50% of what they had been in 1913. By October 1917, Russia's national debt had risen to 50 billion rubles. Of this, debts to foreign governments constituted more than 11 billion rubles. The country faced the threat of financial [[bankruptcy]].\n\n===Unrest by workers, peasants, and soldiers===\nThroughout June, July, and August 1917, it was common to hear working-class Russians speak about their lack of confidence in the Provisional Government. Factory workers around Russia felt unhappy with the growing shortages of food, supplies, and other materials. They blamed their managers or foremen and would even attack them in the factories. The workers blamed many rich and influential individuals for the overall shortage of food and poor living conditions. Workers saw these rich and powerful individuals as opponents of the Revolution, and called them \"bourgeois\", \"capitalist\", and \"imperialist\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Russian Revolution 1905-1917|last=Steinberg|first=Mark|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-19-922762-4|location=New York|pages=143\u2013146}}</ref>\n\nIn September and October 1917, there were mass [[strike action]]s by the Moscow and Petrograd workers, miners in the Donbas, metalworkers in the Urals, oil workers in [[Baku]], textile workers in the Central Industrial Region, and railroad workers on 44 railway lines. In these months alone, more than a million workers took part in strikes. Workers established control over production and distribution in many factories and plants in a [[social revolution]].<ref>David Mandel, ''The Petrograd workers and the seizure of soviet power'', London, 1984</ref> Workers organized these strikes through factory committees. The factory committees represented the workers and were able to negotiate better working conditions, pay, and hours. Even though workplace conditions may have been increasing in quality, the overall quality of life for workers was not improving. There were still shortages of food and the increased wages workers had obtained did little to provide for their families.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy October 1917, peasant uprisings were common. By autumn the peasant movement against the landowners had spread to 482 of 624 counties, or 77% of the country. As 1917 progressed, the peasantry increasingly began to lose faith that the land would be distributed to them by the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Social Revolutionaries]] and the [[Mensheviks]]. Refusing to continue living as before, they increasingly took measures into their own hands, as can be seen by the increase in the number and militancy of the peasant's actions. From the beginning of September to the October Revolution there were over a third as many peasant actions than since March. Over 42% of all the cases of destruction (usually burning down and seizing property from the landlord's estate) recorded between February and October occurred in October.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=History of the Russian Revolution|date=1934|publisher=The Camelot Press ltd|location=London|pages=859\u2013864}}</ref> While the uprisings varied in severity, complete uprisings and seizures of the land were not uncommon. Less robust forms of protest included marches on landowner manors and government offices, as well as withholding and storing grains rather than selling them.<ref>\"Steinberg, Mark (2017).

In September, the garrisons in Petrograd, Moscow, and other cities, the Northern and Western fronts, and the sailors of the [[Baltic Fleet]] declared through their elected representative body [[Tsentrobalt]] that they did not recognize the authority of the Provisional Government and would not carry out any of its commands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-iTqvnpRXDEC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89|title=The Finnish Revolution: 1917-1918|last=Upton|first=Anthony F.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1980|isbn=9781452912394|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|pages=89|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSoldiers' wives were key players in the unrest in the villages. From 1914 to 1917, almost 50% of healthy men were sent to war, and many were killed on the front, resulting in many females being head of the household. Often \u2013 when government allowances were late and were not sufficient to match the rising costs of goods \u2013 soldiers' wives sent masses of appeals to the government, which went largely unanswered. Frustration resulted, and these women were influential in inciting \"subsistence riots\" \u2013 also referred to as \"hunger riots\", \"pogroms\", or \"baba riots\". In these riots, citizens seized food and resources from shop owners, who they believed to be charging unfair prices.

The Central Committee of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] provided leadership to the spontaneous movements. On 17 July, over 500,000 people participated in what was intended to be a peaceful demonstration in Petrograd, the so-called [[July Days]]. The Provisional Government, with the support of [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]]-[[Menshevik]] leaders of the All-Russian Executive Committee of the Soviets, ordered an armed attack against the demonstrators, killing hundreds.<ref>The Soviet Colossus: History and Aftermath.

On 5\u20136 July, attacks were made on the editorial offices and printing presses of ''[[Pravda]]'' and on the [[Museum of Political History of Russia (St. Petersburg)|Palace of Kshesinskaya]], where the Central Committee and the Petrograd Committee of the Bolsheviks were located. On 7 July, the government ordered the arrest and trial of [[Vladimir Lenin]], who was forced to go underground, as he had done under the [[Tsarist]] regime. Bolsheviks were arrested, workers were disarmed, and revolutionary military units in Petrograd were disbanded or sent to the war front. On 12 July, the Provisional Government published a law introducing the death penalty at the front. The second coalition government was formed on 24 July, chaired by [[Alexander Kerensky]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael C.

By contrast, historian Richard Pipes has argued that the episode was engineered by Kerensky.<ref>Pipes, 1997. p. 51. \"There is no evidence of a Kornilov plot, but there is plenty of evidence of Kerensky's duplicity.\"</ref> On 27 August, feeling betrayed by the government, Kornilov pushed on towards Petrograd. With few troops to spare at the front, Kerensky turned to the Petrograd Soviet for help. Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, and Socialist Revolutionaries confronted the army and convinced them to stand down.<ref>{{harvnb|Service|2005|p=54}}</ref> The Bolsheviks' influence over railroad and telegraph workers also proved vital in stopping the movement of troops. Right-wingers felt betrayed, and the left-wing was resurgent.\n\nWith Kornilov defeated, the Bolsheviks' popularity in the soviets grew significantly, both in the central and local areas. On 31 August, the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies\u2014and, on 5 September, the Moscow Soviet Workers Deputies\u2014adopted the Bolshevik resolutions on the question of power. The Bolsheviks won a majority in the soviets of [[Briansk]], [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], [[Saratov]], [[Tsaritsyn]], [[Minsk]], Kiev, [[Tashkent]], and other cities.\n\n===German support===\nVladimir Lenin, who had been living in exile in [[Switzerland]], with other dissidents organized a plan to negotiate a passage for them through [[German Empire|Germany]], with whom Russia was then at war. Recognizing that these dissidents could cause problems for their Russian enemies, the German government agreed to permit 32 Russian citizens, among them Lenin and his wife, to travel in a [[sealed train]] carriage through their territory. According to ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\"On November 7, 1917, a coup d'\u00e9tat went down in history as the October Revolution.

Shortly thereafter, the government announced the immediate closure of not only ''Rabochiy put'' but also the left-wing ''Soldat'', as well as the far-right newspapers ''Zhivoe slovo'' and ''Novaia Rus''.

The event coincided with the arrival of a pro-Bolshevik flotilla\u2014consisting primarily of five destroyers and their crews, as well as marines\u2014in Petrograd harbor. At Kronstadt, sailors announced their allegiance to the Bolshevik insurrection. In the early morning, from its heavily guarded and picketed headquarters in Smolny Palace, the Military-Revolutionary Committee designated the last of the locations to be assaulted or seized. The [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] systematically captured major government facilities, key communication installations, and vantage points with little opposition. The [[Petrograd Garrison]] and most of the city's military units joined the insurrection against the Provisional Government.<ref name=suny /> The insurrection was timed and organized to hand state power to the Second [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which began on this day.\n\nKerensky and the Provisional Government were virtually helpless to offer significant resistance. Railways and railway stations had been controlled by Soviet workers and soldiers for days, making rail travel to and from Petrograd impossible for Provisional Government officials. The Provisional Government was also unable to locate any serviceable vehicles. On the morning of the insurrection, Kerensky desperately searched for a means of reaching military forces he hoped would be friendly to the Provisional Government outside the city and ultimately borrowed a [[Renault]] car from the American embassy, which he drove from the Winter Palace, along with a [[Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company|Pierce Arrow]].

The proclamation was sent by telegraph throughout Russia, even as the pro-Soviet soldiers were seizing important control centers throughout the city.

A history of twentieth-century Russia. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-40347-9}} p 65</ref> When the fall of the Winter Palace was announced, the Congress adopted a decree transferring power to the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, thus ratifying the Revolution.\n\nThe transfer of power was not without disagreement. The center and right wings of the Socialist Revolutionaries, as well as the Mensheviks, believed that Lenin and the Bolsheviks had [[coup d'\u00e9tat|illegally seized power]] and they walked out before the resolution was passed. As they exited, they were taunted by [[Leon Trotsky]] who told them \"You are pitiful isolated individuals; you are bankrupts; your role is played out.

New York: St. Martin's Press. p 217</ref>\n\nThe following day, 26 October, the Congress elected a new cabinet of Bolsheviks, pending the convocation of a [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]]. This new Soviet government was known as the Council (Soviet) of People's Commissars ([[Sovnarkom]]), with Lenin as a leader. Lenin allegedly approved of the name, reporting that it \"smells of revolution\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Voices of Revolution, 1917|last=Steinberg|first=Mark D.|publisher=Yale University|year=2001|isbn=978-0300101690|location=|pages=251}}</ref> The cabinet quickly passed the [[Decree on Peace]] and the [[Decree on Land]]. This new government was also officially called \"provisional\" until the Assembly was dissolved.\n\n===Anti-Bolshevik sentiment===\nThat same day, posters were pinned on walls and fences by the Right Socialist Revolutionaries, describing the takeover as a \"crime against the motherland\" and \"revolution\"; this signaled the next wave of anti-Bolshevik sentiment. The next day, the Mensheviks seized power in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and declared it an independent republic; the [[Don Cossacks]] also claimed control of their government. The Bolshevik strongholds were in the cities, particularly Petrograd, with support much more mixed in rural areas. The peasant-dominated Left SR party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. There were reports that the Provisional Government had not conceded defeat and were meeting with the army at the Front.\n\nAnti-Bolshevik sentiment continued to grow as posters and newspapers started criticizing the actions of the Bolsheviks and refuted their authority. The [[Executive Committee of Peasants Soviets]] \"[refuted] with indignation all participation of the organized peasantry in this criminal violation of the will of the working class\".<ref>Reed, John (1997) ''Ten Days that Shook the World''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p 369</ref> This eventually developed into major counter-revolutionary action, as on the 30th (12 November, N.S) when cossacks, welcomed by church bells, entered [[Tsarskoye Selo]] on the outskirts of Petrograd with Kerensky riding on a white horse. Kerensky gave an ultimatum to the rifle garrison to lay down weapons, which was promptly refused. They were then fired upon by Kerensky's cossacks, which resulted in 8 deaths. This turned soldiers in Petrograd against Kerensky as being the Tsarist regime. Kerensky's failure to assume authority over troops was described by John Reed as a \"fatal blunder\" that signaled the final end of his government.<ref>Reed, John (1997) ''Ten Days that Shook the World''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p 410</ref> Over the following days, the battle against the anti-Bolsheviks continued. The Red Guard fought against cossacks at Tsarskoye Selo, with the cossacks breaking rank and fleeing, leaving their artillery behind. On 31 October 1917 (13 November, N.S), the Bolsheviks gained control of Moscow after a week of bitter street-fighting. Artillery had been freely used, with an estimated 700 casualties. However, there was continued support for Kerensky in some of the provinces.\n\nAfter the fall of Moscow, there was only minor public anti-Bolshevik sentiment, such as the newspaper ''[[Novaya Zhizn]]'', which criticized the Bolsheviks' lack of manpower and organization in running their party, let alone a government. Lenin confidently claimed that there is \"not a shadow of hesitation in the masses of Petrograd, Moscow and the rest of Russia\" in accepting Bolshevik rule.<ref>Reed, John (1997) ''Ten Days that Shook the World''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p 565</ref>\n\n===Governmental reforms===\nOn 10 November 1917 (23 November, N.S.), the government applied the term \"citizens of the Russian Republic\" to Russians, whom they sought to make equal in all possible respects, by the nullification of all \"legal designations of civil inequality, such as estates, titles, and ranks.\"<ref name=\"Steinberg 2001 257\">{{Cite book|title=Voices of Revolution|last=Steinberg|first=Mark D.|publisher=Yale University|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=257}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 November (25 November, N.S.), a [[1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election|Constituent Assembly]] was elected. In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee, and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets.\n\nOn 16 December 1917 (29 December, N.S.), the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated.<ref name=\"Steinberg 2001 257\"/>\n\nOn 20 December 1917 (2 January 1918, N.S.), the [[Cheka]] was created by Lenin's decree.<ref>Figes, 1996.</ref> These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The [[Red Terror]] began in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin. The French [[Reign of Terror|Jacobin Terror]] was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. [[Leon Trotsky]] had compared Lenin to [[Maximilien Robespierre]] as early as 1904.<ref>[[Richard Pipes]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=XtE54LuhFzEC&pg=PA789&hl=en&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f The Russian Revolution]</ref>\n\nThe Decree on Land ratified the actions of the [[peasant]]s who throughout Russia had taken private land and redistributed it among themselves. The Bolsheviks viewed themselves as representing an alliance of workers and peasants signified by the [[Hammer and Sickle]] on the flag and the coat of arms of the Soviet Union.\nOther decrees:\n*All private property was nationalized by the government.\n*All Russian banks were [[Nationalization|nationalized]].\n*Private [[bank account]]s were expropriated.\n*The properties of the Church (including bank accounts) were expropriated.\n*All foreign debts were repudiated.\n*Control of the factories was given to the soviets.\n*Wages were fixed at higher rates than during the war, and a shorter, eight-hour working day was introduced.\n\nNot all private property was nationalized by the government in the days, weeks, and months that followed the revolution of 25 October. The government of the Bolshevik party and Left SR did not support the workers taking over large corporations and collectively organizing the economy. As chairman of the government, Lenin negotiated with factions of the upper bourgeoisie, so that the bourgeoisie would manage the corporations according to orders from the new government. This failed utterly, because it presupposed the masses would accept class cooperation in a revolutionary situation. In this context the Bolshevik party understood \"workers' control\" as checking and supervision by the employees to ensure that orders from the government were followed. Some factories continued in private hands because the masses either had no managerial competence or they hesitated to support the Bolshevik party. Other factories were taken over by the employees and some by the government, after pressure from below or by governmental initiative. There was a lack of class consciousness of the masses who put their hands in an authoritarian political party. Only a minority of the working-class population fought to establish a democratic rule over the main capitalist factories.\n\n===Dictatorial approach===\nThe Bolshevik party opposed the masses ruling the economy from below as it opposed political institutions being ruled from below. Through democratic elections to the soviets in autumn 1917, the Bolshevik party built its power to control the trade unions which became state institutions. Later the same year, the factory committees were subordinated to the trade unions. From this base it was not difficult to establish one-man-rule over the factories. One administrative and one technical manager had daily control, the technical manager having the last word relating to the economy, independent of what the employees wanted, based on orders from higher ups in the state. The system of one-man-management was fiercely defended by Lenin at a trade union congress in spring 1918, where he said that if the party is not in charge the whole point of a party ceased to exist and thereby the revolution itself would cease.\n\nA system of appointment from above was established step by step. Local soviets resisting this policy were either met with armed Cheka troops and forced to submit, or the soviets were denied access to ration cards for food and fuel. The Bolshevik party blocked democratic elections to the soviets, factory committees, the trade unions, and other institutions, which made this transfer of power easier.\n\nThe October Revolution enabled a political revolution by taking down the old regime but failed to establish a democratic system. That the economy was not transferred to the masses reflected what happened in the political institutions. The political elite saw itself as crucial to world revolution but blocked power being exerted from below. When that same elite also got control of the economy, answering only it transformed itself into a ruling state capitalist class. Later the Bolshevik party went further by placing the working class under martial law to force obedience \u2013 [[Sovnarkom]]. This development led to a totalitarian state where Stalin had even greater power than Lenin and Trotsky.\n\n==Timeline of the spread of Soviet power ([[Gregorian calendar]] dates)==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* 5 November 1917: Tallinn.\n* 7 November 1917: [[Petrograd]], [[Minsk]], [[Novgorod]], [[Ivanovo-Voznesensk]] and [[Tartu]]\n* 8 November 1917: Ufa, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, and Narva; ([[Kyiv Bolshevik Uprising|failed]] in [[Kyiv]])\n* 9 November 1917: Vitebsk, Yaroslavl, Saratov, Samara, and Izhevsk\n* 10 November 1917: Rostov, Tver, and Nizhny Novgorod\n* 12 November 1917: Voronezh, Smolensk, and Gomel\n* 13 November 1917: Tambov\n* 14 November 1917: Orel and Perm\n* 15 November 1917: Pskov, Moscow, and Baku\n* 27 November 1917: [[Tsaritsyn]]\n* 1 December 1917: Mogilev\n* 8 December 1917: Vyatka\n* 10 December 1917: Kishinev\n* 11 December 1917: Kaluga\n* 14 December 1917: Novorossisk\n* 15 December 1917: Kostroma\n* 20 December 1917: Tula\n* 24 December 1917: Kharkiv (invasion of Ukraine by the Muravyov Red Guard forces, the establishment of Soviet Ukraine and [[Ukrainian-Soviet war|hostilities in the region]])\n* 29 December 1917: Sevastopol (invasion of Crimea by the Red Guard forces, the establishment of the Taurida Soviet republic)\n* 4 January 1918: Penza\n* 11 January 1918: Yekaterinoslav\n* 17 January 1918: Petrozavodsk\n* 19 January 1918: Poltava\n* 22 January 1918: Zhitomir\n* 26 January 1918: Simferopol\n* 27 January 1918: Nikolayev\n* 28 January 1918: Helsinki (the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] overthrow the [[Senate of Finland|White Senate]], the [[Finnish Civil War]] begins)\n* 29 January 1918: ([[Kyiv Arsenal January Uprising|failed]] again in Kyiv)\n* 31 January 1918: Odesa and Orenburg (establishment of the [[Odesa Soviet Republic]])\n* 7 February 1918: Astrakhan\n* 8 February 1918: Kyiv and Vologda (defeat of the Ukrainian government)\n* 17 February 1918: Arkhangelsk\n* 25 February 1918: Novocherkassk\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Russian Civil War==\n[[File: Russian civil war in the west.svg|thumb|European theatre of the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918]]\n\nBolshevik-led attempts to gain power in other parts of the [[Russian Empire]] were largely successful in Russia proper\u2014although the fighting in Moscow lasted for two weeks\u2014but they were less successful in ethnically non-Russian parts of the Empire, which had been clamoring for independence since the February Revolution. For example, the Ukrainian [[Rada]], which had declared autonomy on 23 June 1917, created the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] on 20 November, which was supported by the Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. This led to an armed conflict with the Bolshevik government in Petrograd and, eventually, a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia on 25 January 1918.<ref>See [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/S/T/StruggleforIndependence1917hD720.htm Encyclopedia of Ukraine] online</ref> In [[Estonia]], two rival governments emerged: the [[1917 Estonian Provincial Assembly election|Estonian Provincial Assembly]], established in April 1917, proclaimed itself the supreme legal authority of Estonia on 28 November 1917 and issued the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on 24 February 1918;<ref>Miljan, Toivo. \"Historical Dictionary of Estonia.\" Historical Dictionary of Estonia, Rowman & Littlefield, 2015, p. 169</ref> but Soviet Russia recognized the Executive Committee of the Soviets of Estonia as the legal authority in [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|the province]], although the Soviets in Estonia controlled only the capital and a few other major towns.<ref>Raun, Toivo U. \"The Emergence of Estonian Independence 1917-1920.\" Estonia and the Estonians, Hoover Inst.

Many of the initial Soviet interpreters of the Revolution were themselves Bolshevik revolutionaries.<ref>Kotkin, Stephen, \"1991 and the Russian Revolution: Sources, Conceptual Categories, Analytical Frameworks,\" ''The Journal of Modern History'' 70 (October 1998): 392.</ref> After the initial wave of revolutionary narratives, Soviet historians worked within \"narrow guidelines\" defined by the Soviet government. The rigidity of interpretive possibilities reached its height under [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"Acton, Critical Companion, 7\">Acton, Critical Companion, 7.</ref>\n\nSoviet historians of the Revolution interpreted the October Revolution as being about establishing the legitimacy of Marxist ideology and the Bolshevik government. To establish the accuracy of Marxist ideology, Soviet historians generally described the Revolution as the product of class struggle and that itn was the supreme event in a world history governed by historical laws. The Bolshevik Party is placed at the center of the Revolution, as it exposes the errors of both the moderate Provisional Government and the spurious \"socialist\" Mensheviks in the Petrograd Soviet. Guided by [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s leadership and his firm grasp of scientific Marxist theory, the Party led the \"logically predetermined\" events of the October Revolution from beginning to end. The events were, according to these historians, logically predetermined because of the socio-economic development of Russia, where monopolistic industrial capitalism had alienated the masses. In this view, the Bolshevik party took the leading role in organizing these alienated industrial workers, and thereby established the construction of the first socialist state.<ref name=\"Acton, Critical Companion, 8\">Acton, Critical Companion, 8.</ref>\n\nAlthough Soviet historiography of the October Revolution stayed relatively constant until 1991, it did undergo some changes. Following Stalin's death, historians such as E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Burdzhalov and P.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Volobuev published historical research that deviated significantly from the party line in refining the doctrine that the Bolshevik victory \"was predetermined by the state of Russia's socio-economic development\".<ref>Alter Litvin, ''Writing History in Twentieth-Century Russia'', (New York: Palgrave, 2001), 49\u201350.</ref> These historians, who constituted the \"New Directions Group\", posited that the complex nature of the October Revolution \"could only be explained by a multi-causal analysis, not by recourse to the mono-causality of monopoly capitalism\".<ref>Roger Markwick, ''Rewriting History in Soviet Russia: The Politics of Revisionist Historiography'', (New York: Palgrave, 2001), 97.</ref> For them, the central actor is still the Bolshevik party, but this party triumphed \"because it alone could solve the preponderance of 'general democratic' tasks the country faced\" (such as the struggle for peace and the exploitation of landlords).<ref>Markwick, Rewriting History, 102.</ref>\n\nDuring the late Soviet period, the opening of select Soviet archives during glasnost sparked innovative research that broke away from some aspects of Marxism\u2013Leninism, though the key features of the orthodox Soviet view remained intact.<, ref name=\"Acton, Critical Companion, 7\"/>\n\nFollowing the turn of the 21st century, some Soviet historians began to implement an \"anthropological turn\" in their historiographical analysis of the Russian Revolution. This method of analysis focuses on the average person's experience of day-to-day life during the revolution, and pulls the analytical focus away from larger events, notable revolutionaries, and overarching claims about party views.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=S.

As a result, Western historians exposed what they believed were flaws in the Soviet view, thereby undermining the Bolsheviks' original legitimacy, as well as the precepts of Marxism.<ref>Acton, Critical Companion, 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nThese Western historians described the revolution as the result of a chain of contingent accidents. Examples of these accidental and contingent factors they say precipitated the Revolution included [[World War&nbsp;I]]'s timing, chance, and the poor leadership of Tsar Nicholas&nbsp;II as well as that of liberal and moderate socialists.<ref name=\"Acton, Critical Companion, 7\"/> According to Western historians, it was not popular support, but rather a manipulation of the masses, ruthlessness, and the party discipline of the Bolsheviks that enabled their triumph. For these historians, the Bolsheviks' defeat in the Constituent Assembly elections of November\u2013December 1917 demonstrated popular opposition to the Bolsheviks' coup, as did the scale and breadth of the Civil War.<ref>Acton, Critical Companion, 7\u20139.</ref>\n\nWestern historians saw the organization of the Bolshevik party as proto-totalitarian. Their interpretation of the October Revolution as a violent coup organized by a proto-totalitarian party reinforced for them the idea that totalitarianism was an inherent part of Soviet history. The democratic promise of the February Revolution came to an end with the forced dissolution of the Constituent Assembly.<ref>Norbert Francis, \"[http://www.ijors.net/issue6_2_2017/pdf/__www.ijors.net_issue6_2_2017_article_2_francis.pdf Revolution in Russia and China]: 100 Years,\" ''International Journal of Russian Studies'' 6 (July 2017): 130-143.</ref> Thus, Stalinist totalitarianism developed as a natural progression from Leninism and the Bolshevik party's tactics and organization.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen E.

While the disintegration essentially helped solidify the Western and Revisionist views, post-USSR Russian historians largely repudiated the former Soviet historical interpretation of the Revolution.<ref>Litvin, Alter, Writing History, 47.</ref> As Stephen Kotkin argues, 1991 prompted \"a return to political history and the apparent resurrection of totalitarianism, the interpretive view that, in different ways\u2026revisionists sought to bury\".<ref>Kotkin, \"1991 and the Russian Revolution,\" 385.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}<!--only the first item has a citation-->\n[[File: R\u012bga, 1988.g. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|240px|Anniversary of October Revolution in [[Riga]], Soviet Union in 1988]]\n\nThe October Revolution marks the inception of the first communist government in Russia, and thus the first large-scale [[socialist state]] in world history. After this, Russia became the Russian SFSR and, later, part of the USSR, which dissolved in late 1991.\n\nThe October Revolution also made the ideology of communism influential on a global scale in the 20th century. Communist parties would start to form in certain countries after 1917.\n\n''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]]'', a book written by American journalist [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and first published in 1919, gives a firsthand exposition of the events. Reed died in 1920, shortly after the book was finished.\n\n[[Dmitri Shostakovich]] wrote his ''[[Symphony No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 2 in B major]]'', Op. 14, and subtitled it ''To October'', for the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution. The choral finale of the work, \"To October\", is set to a text by Alexander Bezymensky, which praises [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and the revolution. The ''Symphony No. 2'' was first performed on 5 November 1927 by the [[Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra|Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the Academy Capella Choir under the direction of [[Nikolai Malko]].\n\n[[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Grigori Aleksandrov]]'s film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'', first released on 20 January 1928 in the USSR and on 2 November 1928 in New York City, describes and glorifies the revolution, having been commissioned to commemorate the event.\n\nThe term \"Red October\" (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c, ''Krasnyy Oktyabr'') has been used to signify the October Revolution. \"Red October\" was given to a steel factory that was made notable by the [[Battle of Stalingrad]],<ref>Ivanov, Mikhail (2007).

It took place through an armed [[insurrection]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] on 25 October ([[Old Style]], O.S.; 7 November, New Style or N.S.) 1917.\n\nThe October Revolution had followed and capitalized on the [[February Revolution]]  earlier in the year. The February Revolution had overthrown the [[Tsarist autocracy]], resulting in a [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]]. The provisional government had taken power after being proclaimed by [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]]'s younger brother, declined to take power after the Tsar had stepped down.\n\nDuring this time, urban workers began to organize into councils ([[soviet (council)|soviet]]s) wherein revolutionaries criticized the provisional government and its actions. After the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|Congress of Soviets]], the new governing body, had its second session it elected members of the Bolsheviks and other left-wing groups such as the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] (Left SR) to important positions within the new state of affairs. This immediately initiated the establishment of the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Russian Soviet Republic]]. On 17 July 1918,{{efn|the Gregorian Calendar [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar|came into effect in Russia]] on 24 January 1918}} the Tsar and [[Romanov dynasty|his family]], including his five children aged 13 to 22, were [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed]].\n\nThe revolution was led by the Bolsheviks, who used their influence in the [[Petrograd Soviet]] to organize the armed forces. Bolshevik [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] forces under the [[Military-Revolutionary Committee]] began the occupation of government buildings on 25 October (O.S.; 7 November, N.S.), 1917. The following day, the [[Winter Palace]] (the seat of the Provisional government located in Petrograd, then capital of Russia) was captured.\n\nThe slogan of the October revolution was All Power to the Soviets, meaning all power to grassroots democratically elected councils. For a time, this was observed, with the interim Bolshevik-only Sovnarkom or Soviet government replaced by a Bolshevik-Left SR coalition government with an All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets composed of all representatives of all factions who supported Soviet power and legally entrenching the peasant land seizures. Throughout 1918, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which resulted in a Left SR walkout, and other policies disputed by both the other pro-soviet parties and minority factions of the Bolsheviks progressively dissipated until 1920, where there were no free elections, but delegates were appointed by a party state.\n\nThe long-awaited [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] [[1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election|elections]] were held on 12 November (O.S., 25 November, (N.S.)) 1917. In contrast to their majority in the Soviets, the Bolsheviks only won 175 seats in the 715-seat legislative body, coming in second behind the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], which won 370 seats, although the SR Party no longer existed as a whole party by that time, as the Left SRs had gone into coalition with the Bolsheviks from October 1917 to March 1918 (a cause of dispute of the legitimacy of the returned seating of the Constituent Assembly, as the old lists, were drawn up by the old SR Party leadership, and thus represented mostly Right SRs, whereas the peasant soviet deputies had returned majorities for the pro-Bolshevik Left SRs). The Constituent Assembly was to first meet on 28 November (O.S.) 1917, but its convocation was delayed until 5 January (O.S.; 18 January, N.S.) 1918 by the Bolsheviks. On its first and only day in session, the Constituent Assembly came into conflict with the Soviets, and it rejected Soviet decrees on peace and land, resulting in the Constituent Assembly being dissolved the next day by order of the Congress of Soviets.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://alphahistory.com/russianrevolution/constituent-assembly/| author=Jennifer Llewellyn, John Rae, and Steve Thompson| title=The Constituent Assembly| publisher=Alpha History| date=2014}}</ref>\n\nAs the revolution was not universally recognized, there followed the struggles of the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917\u201322) and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922.\n\n==Etymology==\nAt first, the event was referred to as the \"October coup\" (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442) or the \"Uprising of the 3rd\", as seen in contemporary documents (for example, in the first editions of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s complete works). However, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 has a meaning similar to \"revolution\" and also means \"upheaval\" or \"overturn\", so \"coup\" is not necessarily the correct translation. With time, the term \"October Revolution\" (\u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u044f) came into use. It is also known as the \"November Revolution\" having occurred in November, according to the Gregorian Calendar{{Sfn|Bunyan|Fisher|1934| p=385}} (for details, see [[Soviet calendar]]).\n\n==Background==\n\n===February Revolution===\n{{main|February Revolution}}\n\nThe [[February Revolution]] had toppled Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and replaced his government with the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. However, the provisional government was weak and riven by internal dissension. It continued to wage [[World War I]], which became increasingly unpopular. There was a nationwide crisis affecting social, economic, and political relations. Disorder in industry and transport had intensified, and difficulties in obtaining provisions had increased. Gross industrial production in 1917 decreased by over 36% of what it had been in 1914. In the autumn, as much as 50% of all enterprises in the [[Ural (region)|Urals]], the [[Donbas]], and other industrial centers were closed down, leading to mass unemployment. At the same time, the cost of living increased sharply. Real wages fell to about 50% of what they had been in 1913. By October 1917, Russia's national debt had risen to 50 billion rubles. Of this, debts to foreign governments constituted more than 11 billion rubles. The country faced the threat of financial [[bankruptcy]].\n\n===Unrest by workers, peasants, and soldiers===\nThroughout June, July, and August 1917, it was common to hear working-class Russians speak about their lack of confidence in the Provisional Government. Factory workers around Russia felt unhappy with the growing shortages of food, supplies, and other materials. They blamed their managers or foremen and would even attack them in the factories. The workers blamed many rich and influential individuals for the overall shortage of food and poor living conditions. Workers saw these rich and powerful individuals as opponents of the Revolution, and called them \"bourgeois\", \"capitalist\", and \"imperialist\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Russian Revolution 1905-1917|last=Steinberg|first=Mark|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0-19-922762-4|location=New York|pages=143\u2013146}}</ref>\n\nIn September and October 1917, there were mass [[strike action]]s by the Moscow and Petrograd workers, miners in the Donbas, metalworkers in the Urals, oil workers in [[Baku]], textile workers in the Central Industrial Region, and railroad workers on 44 railway lines. In these months alone, more than a million workers took part in strikes. Workers established control over production and distribution in many factories and plants in a [[social revolution]].<ref>David Mandel, ''The Petrograd workers and the seizure of soviet power'', London, 1984</ref> Workers organized these strikes through factory committees. The factory committees represented the workers and were able to negotiate better working conditions, pay, and hours. Even though workplace conditions may have been increasing in quality, the overall quality of life for workers was not improving. There were still shortages of food and the increased wages workers had obtained did little to provide for their families.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy October 1917, peasant uprisings were common. By autumn the peasant movement against the landowners had spread to 482 of 624 counties, or 77% of the country. As 1917 progressed, the peasantry increasingly began to lose faith that the land would be distributed to them by the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Social Revolutionaries]] and the [[Mensheviks]]. Refusing to continue living as before, they increasingly took measures into their own hands, as can be seen by the increase in the number and militancy of the peasant's actions. From the beginning of September to the October Revolution there were over a third as many peasant actions than since March. Over 42% of all the cases of destruction (usually burning down and seizing property from the landlord's estate) recorded between February and October occurred in October.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trotsky|first1=Leon|title=History of the Russian Revolution|date=1934|publisher=The Camelot Press ltd|location=London|pages=859\u2013864}}</ref> While the uprisings varied in severity, complete uprisings and seizures of the land were not uncommon.

The Central Committee of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] provided leadership to the spontaneous movements. On 17 July, over 500,000 people participated in what was intended to be a peaceful demonstration in Petrograd, the so-called [[July Days]].

On 7 July, the government ordered the arrest and trial of [[Vladimir Lenin]], who was forced to go underground, as he had done under the [[Tsarist]] regime. Bolsheviks were arrested, workers were disarmed, and revolutionary military units in Petrograd were disbanded or sent to the war front.

Right-wingers felt betrayed, and the left-wing was resurgent.\n\nWith Kornilov defeated, the Bolsheviks' popularity in the soviets grew significantly, both in the central and local areas. On 31 August, the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers Deputies\u2014and, on 5 September, the Moscow Soviet Workers Deputies\u2014adopted the Bolshevik resolutions on the question of power. The Bolsheviks won a majority in the soviets of [[Briansk]], [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], [[Saratov]], [[Tsaritsyn]], [[Minsk]], Kiev, [[Tashkent]], and other cities.\n\n===German support===\nVladimir Lenin, who had been living in exile in [[Switzerland]], with other dissidents organized a plan to negotiate a passage for them through [[German Empire|Germany]], with whom Russia was then at war.

Shortly thereafter, the government announced the immediate closure of not only ''Rabochiy put'' but also the left-wing ''Soldat'', as well as the far-right newspapers ''Zhivoe slovo'' and ''Novaia Rus''.

The event coincided with the arrival of a pro-Bolshevik flotilla\u2014consisting primarily of five destroyers and their crews, as well as marines\u2014in Petrograd harbor. At Kronstadt, sailors announced their allegiance to the Bolshevik insurrection. In the early morning, from its heavily guarded and picketed headquarters in Smolny Palace, the Military-Revolutionary Committee designated the last of the locations to be assaulted or seized. The [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] systematically captured major government facilities, key communication installations, and vantage points with little opposition. The [[Petrograd Garrison]] and most of the city's military units joined the insurrection against the Provisional Government.<ref name=suny /> The insurrection was timed and organized to hand state power to the Second [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]] of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which began on this day.\n\nKerensky and the Provisional Government were virtually helpless to offer significant resistance. Railways and railway stations had been controlled by Soviet workers and soldiers for days, making rail travel to and from Petrograd impossible for Provisional Government officials. The Provisional Government was also unable to locate any serviceable vehicles. On the morning of the insurrection, Kerensky desperately searched for a means of reaching military forces he hoped would be friendly to the Provisional Government outside the city and ultimately borrowed a [[Renault]] car from the American embassy, which he drove from the Winter Palace, along with a [[Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company|Pierce Arrow]]. Kerensky was able to evade the pickets going up around the palace and to drive to meet approaching soldiers.<ref name=rabinowitch />\n\nAs Kerensky left Petrograd, Lenin wrote a proclamation ''To the Citizens of Russia'', stating that the Provisional Government had been overthrown by the Military-Revolutionary Committee. The proclamation was sent by telegraph throughout Russia, even as the pro-Soviet soldiers were seizing important control centers throughout the city. One of Lenin's intentions was to present members of the Soviet congress, who would assemble that afternoon, with a ''fait accompli'' and thus forestall further debate on the wisdom or legitimacy of taking power.<ref name=rabinowitch />\n\n===Assault on the Winter Palace===\nA final assault against the [[Winter Palace]]\u2014against 3,000 cadets, officers, cossacks, and female soldiers\u2014was bloodless.<ref name=rabinowitch>{{cite book|last1=Rabinowitch|first1=Alexander|title=The Bolsheviks Come to Power: The Revolution of 1917 in Petrograd|date=2004|publisher=Pluto Press|pages=273\u2013305}}</ref><ref name=\"beckett528\">{{harvnb|Beckett||p=528}}</ref> The Bolsheviks delayed the assault because they could not find functioning artillery and acted with restraint to avoid needless violence.<ref>Alexander Rabinowitch, The Bolsheviks Come to Power: the Revolution of 1917 in Petrograd (Haymarket Books: Chicago Illinois 2004)</ref> At 6:15{{nbsp}}p.m., a large group of artillery cadets abandoned the palace, taking their artillery with them.

The center and right wings of the Socialist Revolutionaries, as well as the Mensheviks, believed that Lenin and the Bolsheviks had [[coup d'\u00e9tat|illegally seized power]] and they walked out before the resolution was passed. As they exited, they were taunted by [[Leon Trotsky]] who told them \"You are pitiful isolated individuals; you are bankrupts; your role is played out.

This new Soviet government was known as the Council (Soviet) of People's Commissars ([[Sovnarkom]]), with Lenin as a leader. Lenin allegedly approved of the name, reporting that it \"smells of revolution\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Voices of Revolution, 1917|last=Steinberg|first=Mark D.|publisher=Yale University|year=2001|isbn=978-0300101690|location=|pages=251}}</ref> The cabinet quickly passed the [[Decree on Peace]] and the [[Decree on Land]]. This new government was also officially called \"provisional\" until the Assembly was dissolved.\n\n===Anti-Bolshevik sentiment===\nThat same day, posters were pinned on walls and fences by the Right Socialist Revolutionaries, describing the takeover as a \"crime against the motherland\" and \"revolution\"; this signaled the next wave of anti-Bolshevik sentiment. The next day, the Mensheviks seized power in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and declared it an independent republic; the [[Don Cossacks]] also claimed control of their government. The Bolshevik strongholds were in the cities, particularly Petrograd, with support much more mixed in rural areas. The peasant-dominated Left SR party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. There were reports that the Provisional Government had not conceded defeat and were meeting with the army at the Front.\n\nAnti-Bolshevik sentiment continued to grow as posters and newspapers started criticizing the actions of the Bolsheviks and refuted their authority. The [[Executive Committee of Peasants Soviets]] \"[refuted] with indignation all participation of the organized peasantry in this criminal violation of the will of the working class\".<ref>Reed, John (1997) ''Ten Days that Shook the World''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p 369</ref> This eventually developed into major counter-revolutionary action, as on the 30th (12 November, N.S) when cossacks, welcomed by church bells, entered [[Tsarskoye Selo]] on the outskirts of Petrograd with Kerensky riding on a white horse. Kerensky gave an ultimatum to the rifle garrison to lay down weapons, which was promptly refused. They were then fired upon by Kerensky's cossacks, which resulted in 8 deaths. This turned soldiers in Petrograd against Kerensky as being the Tsarist regime. Kerensky's failure to assume authority over troops was described by John Reed as a \"fatal blunder\" that signaled the final end of his government.<ref>Reed, John (1997) ''Ten Days that Shook the World''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p 410</ref> Over the following days, the battle against the anti-Bolsheviks continued. The Red Guard fought against cossacks at Tsarskoye Selo, with the cossacks breaking rank and fleeing, leaving their artillery behind. On 31 October 1917 (13 November, N.S), the Bolsheviks gained control of Moscow after a week of bitter street-fighting. Artillery had been freely used, with an estimated 700 casualties. However, there was continued support for Kerensky in some of the provinces.\n\nAfter the fall of Moscow, there was only minor public anti-Bolshevik sentiment, such as the newspaper ''[[Novaya Zhizn]]'', which criticized the Bolsheviks' lack of manpower and organization in running their party, let alone a government. Lenin confidently claimed that there is \"not a shadow of hesitation in the masses of Petrograd, Moscow and the rest of Russia\" in accepting Bolshevik rule.<ref>Reed, John (1997) ''Ten Days that Shook the World''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p 565</ref>\n\n===Governmental reforms===\nOn 10 November 1917 (23 November, N.S.), the government applied the term \"citizens of the Russian Republic\" to Russians, whom they sought to make equal in all possible respects, by the nullification of all \"legal designations of civil inequality, such as estates, titles, and ranks.\"<ref name=\"Steinberg 2001 257\">{{Cite book|title=Voices of Revolution|last=Steinberg|first=Mark D.|publisher=Yale University|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=257}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 November (25 November, N.S.), a [[1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election|Constituent Assembly]] was elected. In these elections, 26 mandatory delegates were proposed by the Bolshevik Central Committee, and 58 were proposed by the Socialist Revolutionaries. The outcome of the election gave the majority to the Socialist Revolutionary Party, which no longer existed as a full party by that time, as the Left SR Party was in coalition with the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, when it came into conflict with the Soviets.\n\nOn 16 December 1917 (29 December, N.S.), the government ventured to eliminate hierarchy in the army, removing all titles, ranks, and uniform decorations. The tradition of saluting was also eliminated.<ref name=\"Steinberg 2001 257\"/>\n\nOn 20 December 1917 (2 January 1918, N.S.), the [[Cheka]] was created by Lenin's decree.<ref>Figes, 1996.</ref> These were the beginnings of the Bolsheviks' consolidation of power over their political opponents. The [[Red Terror]] began in September 1918, following a failed assassination attempt on Lenin. The French [[Reign of Terror|Jacobin Terror]] was an example for the Soviet Bolsheviks. [[Leon Trotsky]] had compared Lenin to [[Maximilien Robespierre]] as early as 1904.<ref>[[Richard Pipes]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=XtE54LuhFzEC&pg=PA789&hl=en&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f The Russian Revolution]</ref>\n\nThe Decree on Land ratified the actions of the [[peasant]]s who throughout Russia had taken private land and redistributed it among themselves. The Bolsheviks viewed themselves as representing an alliance of workers and peasants signified by the [[Hammer and Sickle]] on the flag and the coat of arms of the Soviet Union.\nOther decrees:\n*All private property was nationalized by the government.\n*All Russian banks were [[Nationalization|nationalized]].\n*Private [[bank account]]s were expropriated.\n*The properties of the Church (including bank accounts) were expropriated.\n*All foreign debts were repudiated.\n*Control of the factories was given to the soviets.\n*Wages were fixed at higher rates than during the war, and a shorter, eight-hour working day was introduced.\n\nNot all private property was nationalized by the government in the days, weeks, and months that followed the revolution of 25 October. The government of the Bolshevik party and Left SR did not support the workers taking over large corporations and collectively organizing the economy. As chairman of the government, Lenin negotiated with factions of the upper bourgeoisie, so that the bourgeoisie would manage the corporations according to orders from the new government. This failed utterly, because it presupposed the masses would accept class cooperation in a revolutionary situation. In this context the Bolshevik party understood \"workers' control\" as checking and supervision by the employees to ensure that orders from the government were followed. Some factories continued in private hands because the masses either had no managerial competence or they hesitated to support the Bolshevik party. Other factories were taken over by the employees and some by the government, after pressure from below or by governmental initiative. There was a lack of class consciousness of the masses who put their hands in an authoritarian political party. Only a minority of the working-class population fought to establish a democratic rule over the main capitalist factories.\n\n===Dictatorial approach===\nThe Bolshevik party opposed the masses ruling the economy from below as it opposed political institutions being ruled from below. Through democratic elections to the soviets in autumn 1917, the Bolshevik party built its power to control the trade unions which became state institutions. Later the same year, the factory committees were subordinated to the trade unions. From this base it was not difficult to establish one-man-rule over the factories. One administrative and one technical manager had daily control, the technical manager having the last word relating to the economy, independent of what the employees wanted, based on orders from higher ups in the state. The system of one-man-management was fiercely defended by Lenin at a trade union congress in spring 1918, where he said that if the party is not in charge the whole point of a party ceased to exist and thereby the revolution itself would cease.\n\nA system of appointment from above was established step by step. Local soviets resisting this policy were either met with armed Cheka troops and forced to submit, or the soviets were denied access to ration cards for food and fuel. The Bolshevik party blocked democratic elections to the soviets, factory committees, the trade unions, and other institutions, which made this transfer of power easier.\n\nThe October Revolution enabled a political revolution by taking down the old regime but failed to establish a democratic system. That the economy was not transferred to the masses reflected what happened in the political institutions. The political elite saw itself as crucial to world revolution but blocked power being exerted from below. When that same elite also got control of the economy, answering only it transformed itself into a ruling state capitalist class. Later the Bolshevik party went further by placing the working class under martial law to force obedience \u2013 [[Sovnarkom]]. This development led to a totalitarian state where Stalin had even greater power than Lenin and Trotsky.\n\n==Timeline of the spread of Soviet power ([[Gregorian calendar]] dates)==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* 5 November 1917: Tallinn.\n* 7 November 1917: [[Petrograd]], [[Minsk]], [[Novgorod]], [[Ivanovo-Voznesensk]] and [[Tartu]]\n* 8 November 1917: Ufa, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, and Narva; ([[Kyiv Bolshevik Uprising|failed]] in [[Kyiv]])\n* 9 November 1917: Vitebsk, Yaroslavl, Saratov, Samara, and Izhevsk\n* 10 November 1917: Rostov, Tver, and Nizhny Novgorod\n* 12 November 1917: Voronezh, Smolensk, and Gomel\n* 13 November 1917: Tambov\n* 14 November 1917: Orel and Perm\n* 15 November 1917: Pskov, Moscow, and Baku\n* 27 November 1917: [[Tsaritsyn]]\n* 1 December 1917: Mogilev\n* 8 December 1917: Vyatka\n* 10 December 1917: Kishinev\n* 11 December 1917: Kaluga\n* 14 December 1917: Novorossisk\n* 15 December 1917: Kostroma\n* 20 December 1917: Tula\n* 24 December 1917: Kharkiv (invasion of Ukraine by the Muravyov Red Guard forces, the establishment of Soviet Ukraine and [[Ukrainian-Soviet war|hostilities in the region]])\n* 29 December 1917: Sevastopol (invasion of Crimea by the Red Guard forces, the establishment of the Taurida Soviet republic)\n* 4 January 1918: Penza\n* 11 January 1918: Yekaterinoslav\n* 17 January 1918: Petrozavodsk\n* 19 January 1918: Poltava\n* 22 January 1918: Zhitomir\n* 26 January 1918: Simferopol\n* 27 January 1918: Nikolayev\n* 28 January 1918: Helsinki (the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] overthrow the [[Senate of Finland|White Senate]], the [[Finnish Civil War]] begins)\n* 29 January 1918: ([[Kyiv Arsenal January Uprising|failed]] again in Kyiv)\n* 31 January 1918: Odesa and Orenburg (establishment of the [[Odesa Soviet Republic]])\n* 7 February 1918: Astrakhan\n* 8 February 1918: Kyiv and Vologda (defeat of the Ukrainian government)\n* 17 February 1918: Arkhangelsk\n* 25 February 1918: Novocherkassk\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Russian Civil War==\n[[File: Russian civil war in the west.svg|thumb|European theatre of the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918]]\n\nBolshevik-led attempts to gain power in other parts of the [[Russian Empire]] were largely successful in Russia proper\u2014although the fighting in Moscow lasted for two weeks\u2014but they were less successful in ethnically non-Russian parts of the Empire, which had been clamoring for independence since the February Revolution. For example, the Ukrainian [[Rada]], which had declared autonomy on 23 June 1917, created the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] on 20 November, which was supported by the Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. This led to an armed conflict with the Bolshevik government in Petrograd and, eventually, a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia on 25 January 1918.<ref>See [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/S/T/StruggleforIndependence1917hD720.htm Encyclopedia of Ukraine] online</ref> In [[Estonia]], two rival governments emerged: the [[1917 Estonian Provincial Assembly election|Estonian Provincial Assembly]], established in April 1917, proclaimed itself the supreme legal authority of Estonia on 28 November 1917 and issued the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on 24 February 1918;<ref>Miljan, Toivo. \"Historical Dictionary of Estonia.\" Historical Dictionary of Estonia, Rowman & Littlefield, 2015, p. 169</ref> but Soviet Russia recognized the Executive Committee of the Soviets of Estonia as the legal authority in [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|the province]], although the Soviets in Estonia controlled only the capital and a few other major towns.<ref>Raun, Toivo U. \"The Emergence of Estonian Independence 1917-1920.\" Estonia and the Estonians, Hoover Inst.

In an attempt to intervene in the civil war after the Bolsheviks' separate peace with the Central Powers, the Allied powers (United Kingdom, France, Italy, United States, and Japan) occupied parts of the Soviet Union for over two years before finally withdrawing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=With the \"Die-Hards\" in Siberia|last=Ward|first=John|publisher=Dodo Press|year=2004|isbn=1409906809|location=|pages=91}}</ref> The United States did not recognize the new Russian government until 1933.

Many of the initial Soviet interpreters of the Revolution were themselves Bolshevik revolutionaries.<ref>Kotkin, Stephen, \"1991 and the Russian Revolution: Sources, Conceptual Categories, Analytical Frameworks,\" ''The Journal of Modern History'' 70 (October 1998): 392.</ref> After the initial wave of revolutionary narratives, Soviet historians worked within \"narrow guidelines\" defined by the Soviet government. The rigidity of interpretive possibilities reached its height under [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"Acton, Critical Companion, 7\">Acton, Critical Companion, 7.</ref>\n\nSoviet historians of the Revolution interpreted the October Revolution as being about establishing the legitimacy of Marxist ideology and the Bolshevik government. To establish the accuracy of Marxist ideology, Soviet historians generally described the Revolution as the product of class struggle and that itn was the supreme event in a world history governed by historical laws. The Bolshevik Party is placed at the center of the Revolution, as it exposes the errors of both the moderate Provisional Government and the spurious \"socialist\" Mensheviks in the Petrograd Soviet. Guided by [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s leadership and his firm grasp of scientific Marxist theory, the Party led the \"logically predetermined\" events of the October Revolution from beginning to end. The events were, according to these historians, logically predetermined because of the socio-economic development of Russia, where monopolistic industrial capitalism had alienated the masses. In this view, the Bolshevik party took the leading role in organizing these alienated industrial workers, and thereby established the construction of the first socialist state.<ref name=\"Acton, Critical Companion, 8\">Acton, Critical Companion, 8.</ref>\n\nAlthough Soviet historiography of the October Revolution stayed relatively constant until 1991, it did undergo some changes. Following Stalin's death, historians such as E.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Burdzhalov and P.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Volobuev published historical research that deviated significantly from the party line in refining the doctrine that the Bolshevik victory \"was predetermined by the state of Russia's socio-economic development\".<ref>Alter Litvin, ''Writing History in Twentieth-Century Russia'', (New York: Palgrave, 2001), 49\u201350.</ref> These historians, who constituted the \"New Directions Group\", posited that the complex nature of the October Revolution \"could only be explained by a multi-causal analysis, not by recourse to the mono-causality of monopoly capitalism\".<ref>Roger Markwick, ''Rewriting History in Soviet Russia: The Politics of Revisionist Historiography'', (New York: Palgrave, 2001), 97.</ref> For them, the central actor is still the Bolshevik party, but this party triumphed \"because it alone could solve the preponderance of 'general democratic' tasks the country faced\" (such as the struggle for peace and the exploitation of landlords).<ref>Markwick, Rewriting History, 102.</ref>\n\nDuring the late Soviet period, the opening of select Soviet archives during glasnost sparked innovative research that broke away from some aspects of Marxism\u2013Leninism, though the key features of the orthodox Soviet view remained intact.<, ref name=\"Acton, Critical Companion, 7\"/>\n\nFollowing the turn of the 21st century, some Soviet historians began to implement an \"anthropological turn\" in their historiographical analysis of the Russian Revolution. This method of analysis focuses on the average person's experience of day-to-day life during the revolution, and pulls the analytical focus away from larger events, notable revolutionaries, and overarching claims about party views.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=S.

As a result, Western historians exposed what they believed were flaws in the Soviet view, thereby undermining the Bolsheviks' original legitimacy, as well as the precepts of Marxism.<ref>Acton, Critical Companion, 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nThese Western historians described the revolution as the result of a chain of contingent accidents. Examples of these accidental and contingent factors they say precipitated the Revolution included [[World War&nbsp;I]]'s timing, chance, and the poor leadership of Tsar Nicholas&nbsp;II as well as that of liberal and moderate socialists.<ref name=\"Acton, Critical Companion, 7\"/> According to Western historians, it was not popular support, but rather a manipulation of the masses, ruthlessness, and the party discipline of the Bolsheviks that enabled their triumph. For these historians, the Bolsheviks' defeat in the Constituent Assembly elections of November\u2013December 1917 demonstrated popular opposition to the Bolsheviks' coup, as did the scale and breadth of the Civil War.<ref>Acton, Critical Companion, 7\u20139.</ref>\n\nWestern historians saw the organization of the Bolshevik party as proto-totalitarian. Their interpretation of the October Revolution as a violent coup organized by a proto-totalitarian party reinforced for them the idea that totalitarianism was an inherent part of Soviet history. The democratic promise of the February Revolution came to an end with the forced dissolution of the Constituent Assembly.<ref>Norbert Francis, \"[http://www.ijors.net/issue6_2_2017/pdf/__www.ijors.net_issue6_2_2017_article_2_francis.pdf Revolution in Russia and China]: 100 Years,\" ''International Journal of Russian Studies'' 6 (July 2017): 130-143.</ref> Thus, Stalinist totalitarianism developed as a natural progression from Leninism and the Bolshevik party's tactics and organization.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen E.

While the disintegration essentially helped solidify the Western and Revisionist views, post-USSR Russian historians largely repudiated the former Soviet historical interpretation of the Revolution.<ref>Litvin, Alter, Writing History, 47.</ref> As Stephen Kotkin argues, 1991 prompted \"a return to political history and the apparent resurrection of totalitarianism, the interpretive view that, in different ways\u2026revisionists sought to bury\".<ref>Kotkin, \"1991 and the Russian Revolution,\" 385.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}<!--only the first item has a citation-->\n[[File: R\u012bga, 1988.g. - panoramio.jpg|thumb|240px|Anniversary of October Revolution in [[Riga]], Soviet Union in 1988]]\n\nThe October Revolution marks the inception of the first communist government in Russia, and thus the first large-scale [[socialist state]] in world history. After this, Russia became the Russian SFSR and, later, part of the USSR, which dissolved in late 1991.\n\nThe October Revolution also made the ideology of communism influential on a global scale in the 20th century. Communist parties would start to form in certain countries after 1917.\n\n''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]]'', a book written by American journalist [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]] and first published in 1919, gives a firsthand exposition of the events.

The choral finale of the work, \"To October\", is set to a text by Alexander Bezymensky, which praises [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] and the revolution. The ''Symphony No. 2'' was first performed on 5 November 1927 by the [[Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra|Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the Academy Capella Choir under the direction of [[Nikolai Malko]].\n\n[[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Grigori Aleksandrov]]'s film ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'', first released on 20 January 1928 in the USSR and on 2 November 1928 in New York City, describes and glorifies the revolution, having been commissioned to commemorate the event.\n\nThe term \"Red October\" (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c, ''Krasnyy Oktyabr'') has been used to signify the October Revolution. \"Red October\" was given to a steel factory that was made notable by the [[Battle of Stalingrad]],<ref>Ivanov, Mikhail (2007).
