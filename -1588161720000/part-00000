{"title_page": "List of Mayday episodes", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=March 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'', known as ''Air Crash Investigation(s)'' outside of the United States and Canada and also known as ''Air Emergency''  or ''Air Disasters '' ([[Smithsonian Channel]]) in the United States, is a Canadian [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[television show|television series]] produced by [[Cineflix]] that recounts [[air crash]]es, near-crashes, fires, [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackings]], [[:Category:Airliner bombings|bombings]], and other mainly flight-related [[disaster]]s and crises. It reveals the events that led to each crisis or disaster, their causes as determined by the official investigating body or bodies, and the measures they recommended to prevent a similar incident from happening again. The programs use [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]s, [[interviews]], [[eyewitness testimony]], [[computer-generated imagery]], [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recording]]s, and official reports to reconstruct the sequences of events.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2020|03|12|num=180|title=Mayday|uk=yes}} This includes five ''Science of Disaster'' specials, each examining multiple crashes with similar causes. For broadcasters that do not use the series name ''Mayday'', three Season 3 episodes were labeled as ''Crash Scene Investigation'' spin-offs, examining marine or rail disasters.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==

It reveals the events that led to each crisis or disaster, their causes as determined by the official investigating body or bodies, and the measures they recommended to prevent a similar incident from happening again. The programs use [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]s, [[interviews]], [[eyewitness testimony]], [[computer-generated imagery]], [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recording]]s, and official reports to reconstruct the sequences of events.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2020|03|12|num=180|title=Mayday|uk=yes}} This includes five ''Science of Disaster'' specials, each examining multiple crashes with similar causes. For broadcasters that do not use the series name ''Mayday'', three Season 3 episodes were labeled as ''Crash Scene Investigation'' spin-offs, examining marine or rail disasters.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==

They were the product of clergy who aimed to break up the [[Bedouin]] tribes and settle them around the wells and oases of the sedentary [[Arab]] populations, mainly those of the [[Najd]], on the grounds that nomadic life was incompatible with the strict conformity of their interpretation of Islam. The newly Islamicized Bedouin would be converted from nomad raiders to soldiers for Islam. The cleric/teachers of the Ikhwan were dedicated to their idea of the purification and the unification of Islam, and some of the newly converted Ikhwan rebelled against their emir Ibn Saud, accusing him of religious laxity. The conquest of the [[Hejaz]] in 1924 brought all of the current Saudi state under Ibn Saud's control.  The monarch then found himself in conflict with elements of the Ikhwan. He crushed their power at the [[Battle of Sabilla]] in 1929,<ref>See [[Wilfred Thesiger]]'s book ''[[Arabian Sands]]'', Penguin, 1991, pps 248\u2013249</ref> following which the militia was reorganised into the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]].<ref name=commins-92>{{cite book|last=Commins |first=David |title=The Mission and Saudi Arabia |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2009 |page=92|quote=Rank and file Ikhwan fighters formed units in a new military institution, initially the White Army, eventually the National Guard ...}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Sultan Al-Otaibi.jpg|150px|thumb|One of the leaders of Ikhwan [[Sultan bin Bajad Al-Otaibi]]]]\n\nAccording to scholar David Commins, around 1913, the same time that Ibn Saud regained [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|al-Hasa]], there emerged in obscure circumstances a zealous movement known as the Ikhwan (Brethren). Salafi [[ulama]] went out to domesticate nomadic tribesmen, to convert them from idolatry to Islam and to make them soldiers for Saudi expansion. The Ikhwan became zealous religious warriors united and motivated by idealism more than allegiance to Ibn Saud. The result was a rebellion by some of the Ikhwan against their creator, who crushed them and in so doing reasserted dynastic power over the religious mission.<ref>{{cite book|last=Commins |first=David|title=The Sunni Mission and Saudi Arabia |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2009 |page=80}}</ref>\n\nThe arid, remote region of [[Najd]] had been ruled by the [[House of Saud]] and religiously dominated by the Islamic revival movement known as ''Ikhwan-men-tah-allah'' (with some exceptions) since the mid-18th century. Ikhwant-men-tah-allah was a movement of townspeople, and traditionally thought of the beduin nomadic herders as \"bearers of religious ignorance, ''[[jahiliyyah]]'', and thus as raw material for conversion\". \n<ref>{{cite book|last=Commins |first=David |title=The Mission and Saudi Arabia |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2009 |page=80|quote=ulama had always viewed the nomads as bearers of religious ignorance, jahiliyya and thus as raw material for conversion to Islam. In this respect, the notion that developed from and somehow reflected a tribal nomadic setting is utterly wrong.}}</ref> To remedy this situation, the beduin were gathered in agricultural settlements known as ''hijra'', where they were to be taught farming, crafts or trades and how to be \"proper Muslims\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Commins |first=David |title=The Mission and Saudi Arabia |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2009 |page=81}}</ref> There were 52 ''hujar'' (plural of ''hijra'') by 1920 and 120 by 1929.<ref>Vassiliev, ''History of Saudi Arabia'', p.225</ref> Ikhwan were known for wearing white turbans rather than the traditional Arab [[Keffiyeh|''Kufiya'']] (roped headcloth), and for covering their faces when they encountered Europeans or Arabs from outside Saudi Arabia.<ref>Gold, Dore, ''Hatred's Kingdom'', (Regnery Publishing, 2003), p.45</ref>\n\nThe pacification of the tribesmen was not entirely a success, and the former nomads continued their raids, which now had religious sanction and were bloodier than before.

They were the product of clergy who aimed to break up the [[Bedouin]] tribes and settle them around the wells and oases of the sedentary [[Arab]] populations, mainly those of the [[Najd]], on the grounds that nomadic life was incompatible with the strict conformity of their interpretation of Islam. The newly Islamicized Bedouin would be converted from nomad raiders to soldiers for Islam.

It reveals the events that led to each crisis or disaster, their causes as determined by the official investigating body or bodies, and the measures they recommended to prevent a similar incident from happening again. The programs use [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]s, [[interviews]], [[eyewitness testimony]], [[computer-generated imagery]], [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recording]]s, and official reports to reconstruct the sequences of events.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2020|03|12|num=180|title=Mayday|uk=yes}} This includes five ''Science of Disaster'' specials, each examining multiple crashes with similar causes. For broadcasters that do not use the series name ''Mayday'', three Season 3 episodes were labeled as ''Crash Scene Investigation'' spin-offs, examining marine or rail disasters.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==

It reveals the events that led to each crisis or disaster, their causes as determined by the official investigating body or bodies, and the measures they recommended to prevent a similar incident from happening again. The programs use [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]s, [[interviews]], [[eyewitness testimony]], [[computer-generated imagery]], [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recording]]s, and official reports to reconstruct the sequences of events.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2020|03|12|num=180|title=Mayday|uk=yes}} This includes five ''Science of Disaster'' specials, each examining multiple crashes with similar causes. For broadcasters that do not use the series name ''Mayday'', three Season 3 episodes were labeled as ''Crash Scene Investigation'' spin-offs, examining marine or rail disasters.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==
