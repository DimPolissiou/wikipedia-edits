It is devoted to the works of artist [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]].  The only song heard in the short is \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".  Bing Crosby's Decca recording is used to illustrate Hamilton's painting ''I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas''.  The painting is of Bing in negative and the effects of color reversal create a snow scene effect to the Crosby features.\n* ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' (1973)  \u2013 [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s film relies solely on commercial recordings and radio programs to provide background music for this film which is set in the US in the 1930s.  Crosby's recording of \"Just One More Chance\" is featured.\n* ''[[Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? (film)|Brother, Can You Spare a Dime]]'' (1975) \u2013 [[David Puttnam]] was involved in this 109 minute compilation of 1930s film footage.  As well as singing the title song we hear Bing's recording of \"[[Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)]].\"  The film's closing credits wrongly title the latter song \"When the Blue...\".\n* ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' (1976)  \u2013 In this Crosby can be heard singing \"[[True Love (Cole Porter song)|True Love]]\".  At the film's end, [[Candy Clark]], playing [[David Bowie]]'s girlfriend, goes to Bowie's apartment in a Father Christmas outfit.  As the two move around the apartment, part of the Capitol recording of \"True Love\" is heard on the soundtrack.\n* ''[[Tracks (1977 film)|Tracks]]'' (1977) \u2013 Director [[Henry Jaglom]] makes use of two of Crosby's American Decca recordings: \"[[These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)|These Foolish Things]]\" and \"[[Hot Time in the Town of Berlin|(There'll Be a) Hot Time in the Town of Berlin]]\", the latter performed with [[The Andrews Sisters]].\n* ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'' (1978) \u2013 In the early part of the film the U.S. Decca recording of \"[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]\" by Crosby and the Andrews Sisters is heard on the soundtrack.  The song is playing on the radio in a scene where a Chicago businessman is visited during the Christmas holiday by union representatives.\n* ''[[The Brink's Job]]'' (1978) \u2013 In an early scene set in Boston, the American Decca recording of \"[[Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive]]\" by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters is heard.  This serves to indicate the era without resorting to a caption or explanatory dialogue.  At the end of the film the same recording is heard as the gang of robbers depicted in the film ascend the courthouse steps for a trial prior to imprisonment.\n* ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies From Heaven]]'' (1981) \u2013 This version uses recordings from the 1930s to advance the story-line.  The film's setting is the thirties with the actors miming to 78s from that decade.  Crosby's contribution is \"[[Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?]]\".\n* ''[[Frances (film)|Frances]]'' (1982) \u2013 Bing Crosby is heard singing \"Love Is So Terrific\" as background music in this screen biography of Crosby's one time leading lady [[Frances Farmer]].  This song is taken from the [[Philco Radio Time]] broadcast of March 31, 1948.\n* ''[[Some Kind of Hero]]'' (1982) \u2013 Towards the end of the main character's imprisonment, the public address system broadcasts the Bing and [[Carol Richards]] Decca recording of \"[[Silver Bells]]\".\n* ''[[A Christmas Story]]'' (1983) \u2013 Crosby's Decca 78s are used to give a seasonal early 1940s atmosphere to the film by the playing of \"[[Jingle Bells]]\", \"[[It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas]]\" and \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\".\n* ''[[Racing with the Moon]]'' (1984) \u2013 Popular songs of the era are played on the soundtrack including Crosby's Decca recording of \"[[Moonlight Becomes You (song)|Moonlight Becomes You]]\". \n* ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'' (1985) \u2013 Crosby's recording of \"Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?\" is heard on the soundtrack of this American horror film about a teenager suffering from nightmares.\n* ''[[One Magic Christmas]]'' (1985) \u2013 Bing's Decca recording of \"[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]\" adds poignancy to a scene where the characters have a heart to heart talk in their kitchen. \n* ''[[Tough Guys]]'' (1986) \u2013 Crosby sings \"[[Don't Get Around Much Anymore]]\" on the soundtrack.  It is Crosby's 1977 recording made for a Concord CD, although [[Burt Lancaster]] is shown placing a 78 on the record turntable.\n* ''[[Radio Days]]'' (1987) \u2013 [[Woody Allen]]'s affectionate tribute to the golden days of American radio crams loads of music from the 1930s and 1940s onto the nostalgia provoking soundtrack.  Bing Crosby's contribution is part of the Decca recording of \"[[Pistol Packin' Mama]]\" sung with the Andrews Sisters.\n* ''[[Someone to Love (1987 film)|Someone to Love]]'' (1987) \u2013 Director Henry Jaglom selected Bing's Decca recording of \"[[Long Ago (and Far Away)]]\" to help capture the mood of one of the film's introspective moments.\n* ''[[Lady in White]]'' (1988) \u2013 Bing sings \"Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?\" as the film's main character, young Frankie, played by [[Lukas Haas]], descends the stairs and sees the ghost of a murdered girl.  The song has a significant part to play in the film's plot.  As the end credits roll the Crosby vocal is reprised, followed by the lyrics being picked up by a childish voice intended to be that of the murdered girl.\n* ''[[Christmas in Tattertown]]'' (1988) \u2013 This thirty minute cartoon was first shown on television in the US in 1988. The plot concerns a doll called Muffet who hates Christmas and the sentiment surrounding the season of goodwill.  She is supported in her beliefs by a spider and a fly. When Debbie, the doll's owner, plays Crosby's recording of \"White Christmas\" both spider and fly are reduced to tears.\n* ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989) \u2013 Crosby sings \"[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]\" as the story moves towards a happy conclusion.\n* ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'' (1989) \u2013 The Hawaiian song \"[[Mele Kalikimaka]]\", sung by Crosby and the Andrews Sisters is used to illustrate a dream sequence.  A further nod to the Crosby influence on Christmas comes at Griswold's darkest hour when the family guests pack to leave the disaster stricken house.  [[Chevy Chase]] bars their way, grits his teeth and says, \"Nobody leaves.  This is going to be the happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap danced with Danny Kaye.\" \n* ''The Road Home'' (1989) \u2013 Crosby's 1943 recording of \"San Fernando Valley\" is incongruously included on the soundtrack where recordings by the likes of [[Happy Mondays]], Raheem, [[The Pogues]] and [[The Cure]] predominate.\n* ''[[Avalon (1990 film)|Avalon]]'' (1990) \u2013 Bing's soundtrack contribution is \"Silver Bells\" which he duets with Carol Richards.\n* ''[[Henry & June]]'' (1990) \u2013 Director Philip Kaufman decided to use French and American recordings of the period alongside an orchestral score of 1930s classical compositions. One of his contemporary selections was Crosby's recording of \"[[I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)|I Found a Million Dollar Baby]]\".\n* ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'' (1991) This American comedy thriller was the first major financial disaster of the 1990s as far as Hollywood was concerned.  Bing's recording of \"[[Swinging on a Star]]\" plays a major part in the plot.  [[Bruce Willis]] as the Hudson Hawk of the title plans to steal a Leonardo da Vinci from a New York auction house.  He estimates the heist will take the length of time it takes to sing \"Swinging on a Star\".\n* ''[[Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar]]'' (1991) \u2013 In a scene in the first reel, [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s daughter ([[Ornella Muti]]) is showing her rebellious side.  She is in retreat in her bedroom smoking and listening to Crosby's 1932 recording of \"[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]\".\n* ''November Days'' (1991) \u2013 Parts of Bing's May 1942 recording of \"Song of Freedom\" are used throughout the film.  [[Antisemitism|Anti-Semitism]] is an issue explored in the film and Crosby's vocal gives added poignancy in a sequence when a Neo-Nazi is interviewed.\n* ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'' (1993) \u2013 This Warner Bros. film includes Crosby's Warner Bros. released recording of \"[[Winter Wonderland]]\".\n* ''[[Trapped in Paradise]]'' (1994) \u2013 There is a scene in the town's bank where customers are conducting business while Bing Crosby's 1963 recording of \"[[Do You Hear What I Hear?]]\" is playing over the public address system.\n* ''The Troubles We've Seen'' (1994) \u2013 Crosby is heard singing \"White Christmas\" to film footage of sledding in the Bosnian mountains.\n* ''[[Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead]]'' (1995) \u2013 The American Decca recording of \"Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive\" by Bing and the Andrews Sisters accompanies a scene after [[Andy Garcia]], the film's leading man, is the subject of a vicious beating.\n* ''[[Mother Night (film)|Mother Night]]'' (1996) \u2013 The Crosby Decca recording of \"White Christmas\" is played unedited over the credit titles at the film's beginning.  Then, forty minutes into the action, there is a sequence set in New York in 1960.  \"White Christmas\" is heard on the soundtrack. A display of Decca 78s is shown as the [[Nick Nolte]] character explains he has 26 copies of the Crosby disc which he obtained via the U.S. Armed Forces. \n* ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997) \u2013 About twenty minutes into the film there is a scene in a liquor store.  Crosby and the Andrews Sisters are heard singing \"Mele Kalikimaka\" when [[Kim Basinger]] and a cop visit the store.\n* ''[[The Locusts (film)|The Locusts]]'' (1997) \u2013 The film's songs are almost all late 1950s recordings with the notable exception of Crosby's \"Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?\". That song starts up as background music some thirteen minutes into the story.\n* ''[[The Myth of Fingerprints]]'' (1997) \u2013 A snatch of Crosby's recording of \"Don't Be That Way\" and a lengthy excerpt from \"[[O Come, All Ye Faithful|Adeste Fideles]]\" are heard on the soundtrack. The latter song is used two-thirds through the story when actors [[Roy Scheider]] and [[Blythe Danner]] are preparing a turkey for the oven.\n* ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' (1998) \u2013 Bing's 1947 Decca recording of \"[[They Can't Take That Away from Me]]\" is played over the credits.\n* ''Forever Hollywood'' (1999) \u2013 This fifty minute compilation ends with Crosby singing \"Going Hollywood\" from the film of the same name.\n* ''[[Snow Falling on Cedars (film)|Snow Falling on Cedars]]'' (2000) \u2013 Bing's Decca recording of \"Would You\" plays in the background of a flashback scene.\n* ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (2000) \u2013 In one scene, Robin Williams is seen repairing a phonograph.  The 78 that is played is Crosby's \"I Found a Million Dollar Baby\".\n* ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2001) \u2013 This Woody Allen film makes use of Bing's recording of \"Going Hollywood\".\n* ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002) \u2013 Crosby and the Andrews Sisters are heard singing \"Mele Kalikimaka\".\n* ''[[Bad Santa]]'' (2003) \u2013 About twenty minutes before the end of the film, there is a scene which takes place on Christmas Eve.  Prior to carrying out another robbery [[Billy Bob Thornton]] is assisting in dressing a Christmas tree and hanging Christmas stockings.  The film's soundtrack plays Bing singing \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\".  Almost all of the 1962 Warner Bros. recording is used. \n* ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' (2004) \u2013 Three-quarters of the way into the film there is footage of U.S. military stationed in Iraq.  It is just before Christmas, presumably in the year 2002.  Crosby and the Andrews Sisters can be heard singing \"[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]\" on two occasions during the sequence.\n* ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' (2004) \u2013 Both \"White Christmas\" and \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" can be heard on the soundtrack.\n* ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004) \u2013 Bing Crosby is heard twice on the film's soundtrack during the drama's first half.  \"Thanks\" is played shortly after the sequence depicting the premiere of the film \"[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]\" and \"[[Some of These Days]]\" is featured when [[Howard Hughes]], played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], visits the home of [[Katharine Hepburn]] ([[Cate Blanchett]]).\n* ''[[Run Fatboy Run]]'' (2007) \u2013 Crosby's recording of \"[[Nice Work If You Can Get It (song)|Nice Work If You Can Get It]]\" with accompaniment by [[Buddy Bregman]] can be heard over the pre-credit sequence of this British comedy.\n* ''[[Four Christmases]]'' (2008). \u2013 The first song heard in this seasonal comedy is \"White Christmas\" sung by Bing. It is heavily overdubbed and is referred to as \"the Declan mix\" when acknowledging that it is licensed from the current owners of Crosby's Decca catalog.\n* ''[[Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang]]'' (2010) \u2013 The  soundtrack features Crosby singing \"[[The Best Things in Life Are Free (Ray Henderson song)|The Best Things in Life Are Free]]\". It is the first use in a film of a [[Ken Barnes (writer)|Ken Barnes]] session recording. Bing was in London to record the song in 1975.\n* ''[[The Music Never Stopped]]'' (2011) \u2013 Bing is heard singing the version of \"[[Young at Heart (Frank Sinatra song)|Young at Heart]]\" recorded for the [[The Bing Crosby Show for General Electric|GE show]] on the soundtrack.\n* ''[[Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger]]'' (2012) A worried new teacher has to juggle a pregnant wife and a class of children on a road trip to the National 'Song for Christmas' Competition. Crosby and [[The Andrews Sisters]] can be heard singing \u201c[[Jingle Bells]]\u201d.\n* ''[[Serena (2014 film)|Serena]]'' (2014) \u2013 Around two-thirds through the film the characters attend a business dinner and [[The Rhythm Boys]] recording of \"There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth the Salt of My Tears\" starts up. This February 8, 1928 recording with the [[Paul Whiteman]] Orchestra is the earliest instance of the Crosby voice being used on screen.\n* ''[[Get Santa]]'' (2014) A father and son team up to save Christmas once they discover Santa Claus sleeping in their garage after crashing his sleigh and finding himself on the run from the police. \u201c[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]\u201d, \u201c[[Deck the Halls]]\u201d, \u201c[[Away in a Manger]]\u201d and \u201c[[I Saw Three Ships]]\u201d are all heard.\n* ''[[Krampus (film)|Krampus]]'' (2015) A boy who has a bad Christmas ends up accidentally summoning a festive demon to his family home.  The seasonal theme inevitably means that Bing Crosby will be included on the soundtrack and he pops up with \u201c[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]\u201d and \u201c[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]\u201d.\n* ''[[Brooklyn (film)|Brooklyn]]'' (2015) \u2013 A brief snatch of \"[[Zing a Little Zong]]\" is played over Coney Island's public address system.  This is the version featuring Crosby duetting with [[Rosemary Clooney]] and is taken from the Chesterfield broadcast of June 11, 1952.  [[Jasmine Records]] are credited with making the recording available.\n* ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' (2016) A fast-talking mercenary, played by [[Ryan Reynolds]], with a morbid sense of humour is subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers and a quest for revenge.

The film opens and closes with the duet by Bing and Grace Kelly of \u201c[[True Love (Cole Porter song)|True Love]]\u201d from \u201c[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]].\u201d\n* Sonja: The White Swan (2018) - the story of [[Sonja Henie]], one of the world's greatest athletes and the inventor of modern figure skating, who decides to go to Hollywood in 1936 to become a movie star.

It is devoted to the works of artist [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]].  The only song heard in the short is \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".  Bing Crosby's Decca recording is used to illustrate Hamilton's painting ''I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas''.  The painting is of Bing in negative and the effects of color reversal create a snow scene effect to the Crosby features.\n* ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'' (1973)  \u2013 [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s film relies solely on commercial recordings and radio programs to provide background music for this film which is set in the US in the 1930s.  Crosby's recording of \"Just One More Chance\" is featured.\n* ''[[Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? (film)|Brother, Can You Spare a Dime]]'' (1975) \u2013 [[David Puttnam]] was involved in this 109 minute compilation of 1930s film footage.  As well as singing the title song we hear Bing's recording of \"[[Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)]].\"  The film's closing credits wrongly title the latter song \"When the Blue...\".\n* ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' (1976)  \u2013 In this Crosby can be heard singing \"[[True Love (Cole Porter song)|True Love]]\".  At the film's end, [[Candy Clark]], playing [[David Bowie]]'s girlfriend, goes to Bowie's apartment in a Father Christmas outfit.  As the two move around the apartment, part of the Capitol recording of \"True Love\" is heard on the soundtrack.\n* ''[[Tracks (1977 film)|Tracks]]'' (1977) \u2013 Director [[Henry Jaglom]] makes use of two of Crosby's American Decca recordings: \"[[These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)|These Foolish Things]]\" and \"[[Hot Time in the Town of Berlin|(There'll Be a) Hot Time in the Town of Berlin]]\", the latter performed with [[The Andrews Sisters]].\n* ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'' (1978) \u2013 In the early part of the film the U.S. Decca recording of \"[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]\" by Crosby and the Andrews Sisters is heard on the soundtrack.  The song is playing on the radio in a scene where a Chicago businessman is visited during the Christmas holiday by union representatives.\n* ''[[The Brink's Job]]'' (1978) \u2013 In an early scene set in Boston, the American Decca recording of \"[[Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive]]\" by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters is heard.  This serves to indicate the era without resorting to a caption or explanatory dialogue.  At the end of the film the same recording is heard as the gang of robbers depicted in the film ascend the courthouse steps for a trial prior to imprisonment.\n* ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies From Heaven]]'' (1981) \u2013 This version uses recordings from the 1930s to advance the story-line.  The film's setting is the thirties with the actors miming to 78s from that decade.  Crosby's contribution is \"[[Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?]]\".\n* ''[[Frances (film)|Frances]]'' (1982) \u2013 Bing Crosby is heard singing \"Love Is So Terrific\" as background music in this screen biography of Crosby's one time leading lady [[Frances Farmer]].  This song is taken from the [[Philco Radio Time]] broadcast of March 31, 1948.\n* ''[[Some Kind of Hero]]'' (1982) \u2013 Towards the end of the main character's imprisonment, the public address system broadcasts the Bing and [[Carol Richards]] Decca recording of \"[[Silver Bells]]\".\n* ''[[A Christmas Story]]'' (1983) \u2013 Crosby's Decca 78s are used to give a seasonal early 1940s atmosphere to the film by the playing of \"[[Jingle Bells]]\", \"[[It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas]]\" and \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\".\n* ''[[Racing with the Moon]]'' (1984) \u2013 Popular songs of the era are played on the soundtrack including Crosby's Decca recording of \"[[Moonlight Becomes You (song)|Moonlight Becomes You]]\". \n* ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]'' (1985) \u2013 Crosby's recording of \"Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?\" is heard on the soundtrack of this American horror film about a teenager suffering from nightmares.\n* ''[[One Magic Christmas]]'' (1985) \u2013 Bing's Decca recording of \"[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]\" adds poignancy to a scene where the characters have a heart to heart talk in their kitchen. \n* ''[[Tough Guys]]'' (1986) \u2013 Crosby sings \"[[Don't Get Around Much Anymore]]\" on the soundtrack.  It is Crosby's 1977 recording made for a Concord CD, although [[Burt Lancaster]] is shown placing a 78 on the record turntable.\n* ''[[Radio Days]]'' (1987) \u2013 [[Woody Allen]]'s affectionate tribute to the golden days of American radio crams loads of music from the 1930s and 1940s onto the nostalgia provoking soundtrack.  Bing Crosby's contribution is part of the Decca recording of \"[[Pistol Packin' Mama]]\" sung with the Andrews Sisters.\n* ''[[Someone to Love (1987 film)|Someone to Love]]'' (1987) \u2013 Director Henry Jaglom selected Bing's Decca recording of \"[[Long Ago (and Far Away)]]\" to help capture the mood of one of the film's introspective moments.\n* ''[[Lady in White]]'' (1988) \u2013 Bing sings \"Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?\" as the film's main character, young Frankie, played by [[Lukas Haas]], descends the stairs and sees the ghost of a murdered girl.  The song has a significant part to play in the film's plot.  As the end credits roll the Crosby vocal is reprised, followed by the lyrics being picked up by a childish voice intended to be that of the murdered girl.\n* ''[[Christmas in Tattertown]]'' (1988) \u2013 This thirty minute cartoon was first shown on television in the US in 1988. The plot concerns a doll called Muffet who hates Christmas and the sentiment surrounding the season of goodwill.  She is supported in her beliefs by a spider and a fly. When Debbie, the doll's owner, plays Crosby's recording of \"White Christmas\" both spider and fly are reduced to tears.\n* ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989) \u2013 Crosby sings \"[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]\" as the story moves towards a happy conclusion.\n* ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'' (1989) \u2013 The Hawaiian song \"[[Mele Kalikimaka]]\", sung by Crosby and the Andrews Sisters is used to illustrate a dream sequence.  A further nod to the Crosby influence on Christmas comes at Griswold's darkest hour when the family guests pack to leave the disaster stricken house.  [[Chevy Chase]] bars their way, grits his teeth and says, \"Nobody leaves.  This is going to be the happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap danced with Danny Kaye.\" \n* ''The Road Home'' (1989) \u2013 Crosby's 1943 recording of \"San Fernando Valley\" is incongruously included on the soundtrack where recordings by the likes of [[Happy Mondays]], Raheem, [[The Pogues]] and [[The Cure]] predominate.\n* ''[[Avalon (1990 film)|Avalon]]'' (1990) \u2013 Bing's soundtrack contribution is \"Silver Bells\" which he duets with Carol Richards.\n* ''[[Henry & June]]'' (1990) \u2013 Director Philip Kaufman decided to use French and American recordings of the period alongside an orchestral score of 1930s classical compositions. One of his contemporary selections was Crosby's recording of \"[[I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)|I Found a Million Dollar Baby]]\".\n* ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'' (1991) This American comedy thriller was the first major financial disaster of the 1990s as far as Hollywood was concerned.  Bing's recording of \"[[Swinging on a Star]]\" plays a major part in the plot.  [[Bruce Willis]] as the Hudson Hawk of the title plans to steal a Leonardo da Vinci from a New York auction house.  He estimates the heist will take the length of time it takes to sing \"Swinging on a Star\".\n* ''[[Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar]]'' (1991) \u2013 In a scene in the first reel, [[Sylvester Stallone]]'s daughter ([[Ornella Muti]]) is showing her rebellious side.  She is in retreat in her bedroom smoking and listening to Crosby's 1932 recording of \"[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]\".\n* ''November Days'' (1991) \u2013 Parts of Bing's May 1942 recording of \"Song of Freedom\" are used throughout the film.  [[Antisemitism|Anti-Semitism]] is an issue explored in the film and Crosby's vocal gives added poignancy in a sequence when a Neo-Nazi is interviewed.\n* ''[[Grumpy Old Men (film)|Grumpy Old Men]]'' (1993) \u2013 This Warner Bros. film includes Crosby's Warner Bros. released recording of \"[[Winter Wonderland]]\".\n* ''[[Trapped in Paradise]]'' (1994) \u2013 There is a scene in the town's bank where customers are conducting business while Bing Crosby's 1963 recording of \"[[Do You Hear What I Hear?]]\" is playing over the public address system.\n* ''The Troubles We've Seen'' (1994) \u2013 Crosby is heard singing \"White Christmas\" to film footage of sledding in the Bosnian mountains.\n* ''[[Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead]]'' (1995) \u2013 The American Decca recording of \"Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive\" by Bing and the Andrews Sisters accompanies a scene after [[Andy Garcia]], the film's leading man, is the subject of a vicious beating.\n* ''[[Mother Night (film)|Mother Night]]'' (1996) \u2013 The Crosby Decca recording of \"White Christmas\" is played unedited over the credit titles at the film's beginning.  Then, forty minutes into the action, there is a sequence set in New York in 1960.  \"White Christmas\" is heard on the soundtrack. A display of Decca 78s is shown as the [[Nick Nolte]] character explains he has 26 copies of the Crosby disc which he obtained via the U.S. Armed Forces. \n* ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997) \u2013 About twenty minutes into the film there is a scene in a liquor store.  Crosby and the Andrews Sisters are heard singing \"Mele Kalikimaka\" when [[Kim Basinger]] and a cop visit the store.\n* ''[[The Locusts (film)|The Locusts]]'' (1997) \u2013 The film's songs are almost all late 1950s recordings with the notable exception of Crosby's \"Did You Ever See a Dream Walking?\". That song starts up as background music some thirteen minutes into the story.\n* ''[[The Myth of Fingerprints]]'' (1997) \u2013 A snatch of Crosby's recording of \"Don't Be That Way\" and a lengthy excerpt from \"[[O Come, All Ye Faithful|Adeste Fideles]]\" are heard on the soundtrack. The latter song is used two-thirds through the story when actors [[Roy Scheider]] and [[Blythe Danner]] are preparing a turkey for the oven.\n* ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' (1998) \u2013 Bing's 1947 Decca recording of \"[[They Can't Take That Away from Me]]\" is played over the credits.\n* ''Forever Hollywood'' (1999) \u2013 This fifty minute compilation ends with Crosby singing \"Going Hollywood\" from the film of the same name.\n* ''[[Snow Falling on Cedars (film)|Snow Falling on Cedars]]'' (2000) \u2013 Bing's Decca recording of \"Would You\" plays in the background of a flashback scene.\n* ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'' (2000) \u2013 In one scene, Robin Williams is seen repairing a phonograph.  The 78 that is played is Crosby's \"I Found a Million Dollar Baby\".\n* ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2001) \u2013 This Woody Allen film makes use of Bing's recording of \"Going Hollywood\".\n* ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002) \u2013 Crosby and the Andrews Sisters are heard singing \"Mele Kalikimaka\".\n* ''[[Bad Santa]]'' (2003) \u2013 About twenty minutes before the end of the film, there is a scene which takes place on Christmas Eve.  Prior to carrying out another robbery [[Billy Bob Thornton]] is assisting in dressing a Christmas tree and hanging Christmas stockings.  The film's soundtrack plays Bing singing \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\".  Almost all of the 1962 Warner Bros. recording is used. \n* ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' (2004) \u2013 Three-quarters of the way into the film there is footage of U.S. military stationed in Iraq.  It is just before Christmas, presumably in the year 2002.  Crosby and the Andrews Sisters can be heard singing \"[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]\" on two occasions during the sequence.\n* ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' (2004) \u2013 Both \"White Christmas\" and \"Here Comes Santa Claus\" can be heard on the soundtrack.\n* ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004) \u2013 Bing Crosby is heard twice on the film's soundtrack during the drama's first half.  \"Thanks\" is played shortly after the sequence depicting the premiere of the film \"[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]\" and \"[[Some of These Days]]\" is featured when [[Howard Hughes]], played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], visits the home of [[Katharine Hepburn]] ([[Cate Blanchett]]).\n* ''[[Run Fatboy Run]]'' (2007) \u2013 Crosby's recording of \"[[Nice Work If You Can Get It (song)|Nice Work If You Can Get It]]\" with accompaniment by [[Buddy Bregman]] can be heard over the pre-credit sequence of this British comedy.\n* ''[[Four Christmases]]'' (2008). \u2013 The first song heard in this seasonal comedy is \"White Christmas\" sung by Bing. It is heavily overdubbed and is referred to as \"the Declan mix\" when acknowledging that it is licensed from the current owners of Crosby's Decca catalog.\n* ''[[Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang]]'' (2010) \u2013 The  soundtrack features Crosby singing \"[[The Best Things in Life Are Free (Ray Henderson song)|The Best Things in Life Are Free]]\". It is the first use in a film of a [[Ken Barnes (writer)|Ken Barnes]] session recording. Bing was in London to record the song in 1975.\n* ''[[The Music Never Stopped]]'' (2011) \u2013 Bing is heard singing the version of \"[[Young at Heart (Frank Sinatra song)|Young at Heart]]\" recorded for the [[The Bing Crosby Show for General Electric|GE show]] on the soundtrack.\n* ''[[Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger]]'' (2012) A worried new teacher has to juggle a pregnant wife and a class of children on a road trip to the National 'Song for Christmas' Competition. Crosby and [[The Andrews Sisters]] can be heard singing \u201c[[Jingle Bells]]\u201d.\n* ''[[Serena (2014 film)|Serena]]'' (2014) \u2013 Around two-thirds through the film the characters attend a business dinner and [[The Rhythm Boys]] recording of \"There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth the Salt of My Tears\" starts up. This February 8, 1928 recording with the [[Paul Whiteman]] Orchestra is the earliest instance of the Crosby voice being used on screen.\n* ''[[Get Santa]]'' (2014) A father and son team up to save Christmas once they discover Santa Claus sleeping in their garage after crashing his sleigh and finding himself on the run from the police. \u201c[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]\u201d, \u201c[[Deck the Halls]]\u201d, \u201c[[Away in a Manger]]\u201d and \u201c[[I Saw Three Ships]]\u201d are all heard.\n* ''[[Krampus (film)|Krampus]]'' (2015) A boy who has a bad Christmas ends up accidentally summoning a festive demon to his family home.  The seasonal theme inevitably means that Bing Crosby will be included on the soundtrack and he pops up with \u201c[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]\u201d and \u201c[[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]\u201d.\n* ''[[Brooklyn (film)|Brooklyn]]'' (2015) \u2013 A brief snatch of \"[[Zing a Little Zong]]\" is played over Coney Island's public address system.

It stars [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] and was directed by [[Barbet Schroeder]].\n\n==Plot==\nAllison \"Allie\" Jones is a software designer in [[New York City]], engaged to Sam Rawson. Sam's ex-wife calls, and it is revealed that he slept with her recently. Allie throws Sam out, breaking off their engagement, and is comforted by neighbor Graham Knox, an aspiring actor. The next morning, Allie attends a business lunch with Mitchell Myerson, a fashion house owner looking to buy Allie's revolutionary new program. He manipulates her into significantly reducing the price; as he is her first and only client, she accepts.\n\nAllie advertises for a new roommate to share her apartment in [[the Ansonia]]. She settles on Hedra Carlson, whom she nicknames \"Hedy\", and they become friends. Hedy explains that her twin was stillborn, leaving her with constant loneliness. Hedy becomes overly protective of Allie, erasing Sam's voice-mail asking Allie for a reconciliation. She buys a puppy named Buddy to bond with Allie, but becomes jealous when Sam wins Allie back and they seek a new apartment for themselves. Buddy falls to his death from the balcony, and Allie accuses Hedy of leaving the window open.\n\nMyerson attempts to coerce Allie into performing fallatio on him on completion of their deal, threatening to warn off future clients and not pay her, but she fights back and escapes. To comfort Allie, Hedy takes her to get a haircut, but after Hedy appears dressed exactly like her, including her haircut, Allie is unnerved. That night, Allie follows Hedy to an underground nightclub and witnesses Hedy passing herself off as Allie. Allie finds a shoebox containing letters addressed to Ellen Besch \u2013 Hedy's real name \u2013 along with a letter from Sam to Allie, and a newspaper clipping on the accidental drowning of Hedy's twin sister when she was nine years old.\n\nWhile Allie tells Graham the truth about Hedy, they are unaware Hedy is listening. Allie leaves, and Hedy attacks Graham. When Sam returns the following night, Hedy impersonates Allie and performs oral sex on him. She begs him to leave Allie alone, but he refuses and insists on telling Allie the truth. Furious, Hedy kills him by gouging his eye with her stiletto heel.\n\nHedy tells Allie she is about to leave. Allie sees a news report on Sam's death and realizes what has happened. She tries to leave, but Hedy takes her hostage at gunpoint, explaining that everyone will believe Allie killed Sam. To \"protect\" Allie, Hedy tries to convince her that they must run away. Allie attempts to send a distress message, but Hedy catches her.\n\nMyerson notices his files being erased, and rushes to find Allie. He finds her tied up, but is killed by Hedy. She attempts to persuade Allie to commit suicide via drug overdose, but Allie resists. Hedy points the gun at Allie as she tries to run, begging Allie not to leave her. Allie coldly tells her, \"I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not anymore. I'm like you now.\" Graham regains consciousness and assists Allie. Allie drags Hedy off her friend, flees, and is shot in the shoulder by Hedy. After seemingly strangling Allie to death, Hedy drags her towards the incinerator, but Allie recovers and escapes. Screaming for Allie to come out, Hedy lashes out at a mirror inside a closet. Allie stabs her in the back, and they struggle before Allie watches in horror and sadness as Hedy dies.\n\nIn an epilogue, Allie narrates that she has finally moved on. She forgives Hedy for killing Sam, and tries to forgive herself for Hedy's death, stating that Hedy's [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]] was her downfall.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bridget Fonda]] as Allison \"Allie\" Jones\n* [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]] as Hedra \"Hedy\" Carlson / Ellen Besch\n* [[Steven Weber]] as Sam Rawson\n* [[Peter Friedman]] as Graham Knox\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Mitch Myerson\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Elderly Neighbor\n* [[Jessica Lundy]] as Talkative applicant\n* [[Kenneth Tobey|Ken Tobey]] as Desk Clerk\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe film debuted at No. 2 at the US box office on its opening weekend behind ''[[Unforgiven]]'',<ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office Eastwood Still Tall in the Saddle |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-18/entertainment/ca-5744_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Weekend Box Office 'Unforgiven' at Top for Third Week|publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-25/entertainment/ca-6052_1_weekend-box-office|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}</ref> and grossed $48 million at the box office in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=singlewhitefemale.htm |title=Single White Female |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher= |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}</ref> It grossed $36 million overseas<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 22, 1993|page=85|title=Hollywood Wows World Wickets|last=Groves|first=Don}}</ref> for a worldwide total of $84 million.\n\nThe film received a 54% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 48 reviews (26 positive, 22 negative).

Allie coldly tells her, \"I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not anymore. I'm like you now.\" Graham regains consciousness and assists Allie. Allie drags Hedy off her friend, flees, and is shot in the shoulder by Hedy. After seemingly strangling Allie to death, Hedy drags her towards the incinerator, but Allie recovers and escapes. Screaming for Allie to come out, Hedy lashes out at a mirror inside a closet. Allie stabs her in the back, and they struggle before Allie watches in horror and sadness as Hedy dies.\n\nIn an epilogue, Allie narrates that she has finally moved on.

Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation, and eventually led [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] during the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] against [[Kingdom of England|England]]. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent country and is today revered in Scotland as a national hero.\n\nHis paternal fourth great-grandfather was [[David I of Scotland|King David I]]. Robert's grandfather, [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale]], was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the \"[[Great Cause]]\". As [[Earl of Carrick]], Robert the Bruce supported his family's claim to the Scottish throne and took part in [[William Wallace]]'s revolt against [[Edward I of England]]. Appointed in 1298 as a [[Guardian of Scotland]] alongside his chief rival for the throne, [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]], and [[William Lamberton]], [[Bishop of St Andrews]], Robert later resigned in 1300 due to his quarrels with Comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of [[John Balliol]] to the Scottish throne. After submitting to Edward I in 1302 and returning to \"the king's peace\", Robert inherited his family's claim to the Scottish throne upon his father's death.\n\nIn February 1306, Bruce, having wounded Comyn, rushed from the church where they had met and encountered his attendants outside.\nHe told them what had happened and said, \"I must be off, for I doubt I have slain the Red Comyn.\" \"Doubt?\", [[Roger de Kirkpatrick]] of Closeburn answered. \"I mak sikker,\" (\"I'll make sure,\" or \"I make sure\"). [[Roger de Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick]] then rushed into the church and killed Comyn. For this, Bruce was then [[excommunicated]] by the Pope (although he received [[absolution]] from [[Robert Wishart]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]]). Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne, and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306. Edward I's forces defeated Robert in battle, forcing him to flee into hiding before re-emerging in 1307 to defeat an English army at [[Battle of Loudoun Hill|Loudoun Hill]] and wage a highly successful [[guerrilla war]] against the English. Bruce defeated his other Scots enemies, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands, and in 1309 held his first [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]]. A series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland, and at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314, Robert defeated a much larger English army under [[Edward II of England]], confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish kingdom. The battle marked a significant turning point, with Robert's armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout [[northern England]], while also extending his war against the English to [[Lordship of Ireland|Ireland]] by sending an army to invade there and by appealing to the Irish to rise against Edward II's rule.\n\nDespite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in 1318, Edward II refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish nobility submitted the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] to [[Pope John XXII]], declaring Robert as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland's status as an independent kingdom. In 1324, the Pope recognised Robert I as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the [[Auld Alliance|Franco-Scottish alliance]] was renewed in the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|Treaty of Corbeil]]. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, [[Edward III]], and peace was concluded between Scotland and England with the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]] in 1328, by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland.\n\nRobert died in June 1329. His body is buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]], while his heart was interred in [[Melrose Abbey]] and his internal organs embalmed and placed in St Serf's Chapel, [[Dumbarton]], site of the medieval [[Cardross]] Parish church.\n\n==Background==\n[[Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale]], the first of the Bruce (de Brus) line, arrived in Scotland with [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1124 and was given the lands of Annandale in Dumfries and Galloway.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Scottish History: Robert The Bruce|last = Ntungwa|first = Arnold|publisher = Heinemann Library|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0431058832|location = |pages = }}</ref> Several members of the [[House of Bruce|Bruce family]] were called Robert, the future king was one of ten children, and the eldest son, of [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale]], and [[Marjorie, Countess of Carrick]], and claimed the Scottish throne as a fourth great-grandson of [[David I of Scotland|David I]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wHZcIRMhSEMC&pg=PA733&dq=bruce+and+Broadoak&sig=_1iJsPKVqilBVmDkwuV2Afapp7o Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families By Douglas Richardson, Kimball G.

[[Lochmaben]] has a claim, as a possession of the Bruce family, but is not supported by a medieval source. Contemporary claims of the Bruce estate at [[Writtle]], Essex, during the coronation of Edward, have been discounted by [[G.W.S. Barrow]].|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n===Childhood===\nVery little is known of his youth. He was probably brought up in a mixture of the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] culture of northern England and south-eastern Scotland, and the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture of south-west Scotland and most of Scotland north of the [[River Forth]]. [[Annandale]] was thoroughly [[Feudalism|feudalised]] and the form of Northern [[Middle English]] that would later develop into the [[Scots language]] was spoken throughout the region. [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]] was historically an integral part of [[Galloway]], and though the earls of Carrick had achieved some feudalisation, the society of Carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nRobert the Bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age. He would have been schooled to speak, read and possibly write in the [[Anglo-Norman language]] of his Scots-Norman peers and his father's family. He would also have spoken both the Gaelic language of his Carrick birthplace and his mother's family, and the early Scots language.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|pp=34\u201335}}</ref><ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 12\">{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=12}}</ref><ref name=\"Penman 2014 16\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=16}}</ref> As the heir to a considerable estate and a pious layman, Robert would also have been given working knowledge of [[Latin]], the language of charter lordship, liturgy and prayer. This would have afforded Robert and his brothers access to basic education in the [[law]], [[politics]], [[scripture]], saints' Lives (''vitae''), [[philosophy]], [[history]] and chivalric instruction and romance.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 12\"/><ref name=\"Penman 2014 16\"/> That Robert took personal pleasure in such learning and leisure is suggested in a number of ways. Barbour reported that Robert read aloud to his band of supporters in 1306, reciting from memory tales from a twelfth-century romance of [[Charlemagne]], ''[[Fierabras]]'', as well as relating examples from history such as [[Hannibal]]'s defiance of [[Rome]].<ref name=\"Penman 2014 16\"/>\n\nAs king, Robert certainly commissioned verse to commemorate [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] and his subjects' military deeds. Contemporary chroniclers [[Jean Le Bel]] and [[Thomas Grey (chronicler)|Thomas Grey]] would both assert that they had read a history of his reign 'commissioned by King Robert himself.' In his last years, Robert would pay for [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]]s to tutor his son, [[David II of Scotland|David]], for whom he would also purchase books.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 16\"/> A parliamentary briefing document of c.1364 would also assert that Robert 'used continually to read, or have read in his presence, the histories of ancient kings and princes, and how they conducted themselves in their times, both in wartime and in peacetime; from these he derived information about aspects of his own rule.'<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 12\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|pp=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nTutors for the young Robert and his brothers were most likely drawn from unbeneficed clergy or mendicant friars associated with the churches patronised by their family. However, as growing noble youths, outdoor pursuits and great events would also have held a strong fascination for Robert and his brothers. They would have had masters drawn from their parents' household to school them in the arts of horsemanship, swordsmanship, the joust, hunting and perhaps aspects of courtly behaviour, including dress, protocol, speech, table etiquette, music and dance, some of which may have been learned before the age of ten while serving as [[Page (servant)|pages]] in their father's or grandfather's household.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 18\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=18}}</ref> As many of these personal and leadership skills were bound up within a code of chivalry, Robert's chief tutor was surely a reputable, experienced knight, drawn from his grandfather's crusade retinue. This grandfather, known to contemporaries as [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale|Robert the Noble]], and to history as \"Bruce the Competitor\", seems to have been an immense influence on the future king.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 14\">{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=14}}</ref> Robert's later performance in war certainly underlines his skills in tactics and single combat.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 18\"/>\n\nThe family would have moved between the castles of their lordships\u2014[[Lochmaben Castle]], the main castle of the lordship of Annandale, and Turnberry and [[Loch Doon Castle]], the castles of the earldom of Carrick. A significant and profound part of the childhood experience of Robert, [[Edward Bruce|Edward]] and possibly the other Bruce brothers (Neil, Thomas and Alexander), was also gained through the Gaelic tradition of being fostered to allied Gaelic kindreds\u2014a traditional practice in Carrick, south-west and western Scotland, the [[Hebrides]] and [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"Penman 2014 18\"/> There were a number of Carrick, Ayrshire, Hebridean and Irish families and kindreds affiliated with the Bruces who might have performed such a service (Robert's foster-brother is referred to by Barbour as sharing Robert's precarious existence as an outlaw in Carrick in 1307\u201308).<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 14\"/> This Gaelic influence has been cited as a possible explanation for Robert the Bruce's apparent affinity for \"[[hobelar]]\" warfare, using smaller sturdy ponies in mounted raids, as well as for sea-power, ranging from oared war-galleys (\"[[birlinn]]s\") to boats.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 19\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=19}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historians such as Barrow and Penman, it is also likely that when Robert and Edward Bruce reached the male age of consent of twelve and began training for full knighthood, they were sent to reside for a period with one or more allied English noble families, such as the [[de Clare]]s of Gloucester, or perhaps even in the English royal household.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 19\"/> [[Thomas Grey (chronicler)|Sir Thomas Grey]] asserted in his ''[[Scalacronica]]'' that in about 1292, Robert the Bruce, then aged eighteen, was a \"young bachelor of [[Edward I of England|King Edward]]'s Chamber\".<ref name=\"Penman 2014 20\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=20}}</ref> While there remains little firm evidence of Robert's presence at Edward's court, on 8 April 1296, both Robert and his father were pursued through the English [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]] for their private household debts of \u00a360 by several merchants of [[Winchester]]. This raises the possibility that young Robert the Bruce was on occasion resident in a royal centre which Edward I himself would visit frequently during his reign.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 20\"/>\n\nRobert's first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by [[Alexander Og MacDonald, Lord of Islay]]. His name appears in the company of the [[Bishop of Argyll]], the vicar of [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], a [[Kintyre]] clerk, his father, and a host of Gaelic notaries from Carrick.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|p=35}}</ref> Robert Bruce, the king to be, was sixteen years of age when [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] died in 1290. It is also around this time that Robert would have been knighted, and he began to appear on the political stage in the Bruce dynastic interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=30}}</ref>\n\n===The \"Great Cause\"===\n\nRobert's mother died early in 1292. In November of the same year, [[Edward I of England]], on behalf of the [[Guardians of Scotland#Guardians of Scotland during the First Interregnum 1290\u20131292|Guardians of Scotland]] and following the [[Great Cause]], awarded the vacant Crown of Scotland to his grandfather's first cousin once removed, [[John Balliol]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=29}}</ref> Almost immediately, [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale]], resigned his lordship of Annandale and transferred his claim to the Scottish throne to his son, antedating this statement to 7 November. In turn, that son, [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale]], resigned his earldom of Carrick to his eldest son, Robert, the future king, so as to protect the Bruce's kingship claim while their middle lord (Robert the Bruce's father) now held only English lands.<ref>{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=49}}</ref> While the Bruces' bid for the throne had ended in failure, the Balliols' triumph propelled the eighteen-year-old Robert the Bruce onto the political stage in his own right.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|pp=36\u201337}}</ref>\n\n==Earl of Carrick (1292\u20131306)==\n\n===The Bruces regroup===\n[[File:Robert I and Isabella of Mar.jpg|thumb|Robert the Bruce and his first wife [[Isabella of Mar]], as depicted in the 1562 Forman Armorial.]]\n\nEven after John's accession, Edward still continued to assert his authority over Scotland and relations between the two kings soon began to deteriorate.

The Bruces and the earls of [[Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus|Angus]] and [[Patrick IV, Earl of March|March]] refused, and the Bruce family withdrew temporarily from Scotland, while the Comyns seized their estates in Annandale and Carrick, granting them to [[John Comyn, Earl of Buchan]].<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 50\"/> Edward I thereupon provided a safe refuge for the Bruces, having appointed the Lord of Annandale to the command of [[Carlisle Castle]] in October 1295.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 53\">{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=53}}</ref> At some point in early 1296, Robert married his first wife, [[Isabella of Mar]], the daughter of [[Domhnall I, Earl of Mar]] and his wife Helen.\n\n===Beginning of the Wars of Independence===\n\nAlmost the first blow in the [[First War of Scottish Independence|war between Scotland and England]] was a direct attack on the Bruces. On 26 March 1296, Easter Monday, seven Scottish earls made a surprise attack on the walled city of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], which was not so much an attack against England as the Comyn Earl of Buchan and their faction attacking their Bruce enemies.<ref>Duncan, Kingship, p. 322.</ref> Both his father and grandfather were at one time Governors of the Castle, and following the loss of Annandale to Comyn in 1295, it was their principal residence.

It appears that Robert Bruce had fallen under the influence of his grandfather's friends, Wishart and Stewart, who had inspired him to resistance.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 63\"/> With the outbreak of the revolt, Robert left Carlisle and made his way to Annandale, where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and, according to the English chronicler [[Walter of Guisborough]], addressed them thus:\n\n<blockquote>No man holds his own flesh and blood in hatred and I am no exception. I must join my own people and the nation in which I was born. I ask that you please come with me and you will be my councillors and close comrades\"<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 63\"/><ref>from The Chronicle of Walter of Guisborough (previously edited as the Chronicle of Walter of Hemingford or Hemingburgh)</ref></blockquote>\n\nUrgent letters were sent ordering Bruce to support Edward's commander, [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey]] (to whom Bruce was related), in the summer of 1297; but instead of complying, Bruce continued to support the revolt against Edward I. That Bruce was in the forefront of inciting rebellion is shown in a letter written to Edward by [[Hugh Cressingham]] on 23 July 1292, which reports the opinion that \"if you had the earl of Carrick, the Steward of Scotland and his brother...you would think your business done\".<ref>{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=64}}</ref> On 7 July, Bruce and his friends made terms with Edward by a treaty called the [[Capitulation of Irvine]]. The Scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to King Edward. The Bishop of Glasgow, James the Steward, and Sir Alexander Lindsay became sureties for Bruce until he delivered his infant daughter [[Marjorie Bruce|Marjorie]] as a hostage, which he never did.<ref>{{cite book|title=Robert Bruce: Our Most Valiant, Prince, KIng, and Lord|date=2006|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|page=101|url=http://history-books.weebly.com/uploads/6/9/9/0/6990231/robert_bruce__our_most_valiant_prince_kin_-_mcnamee_colm.pdf}}</ref>\n\nWhen King Edward returned to England after his victory at the [[Battle of Falkirk]], the Bruce's possessions were excepted from the Lordships and lands that Edward assigned to his followers. The reason for this is uncertain, though Fordun records Robert fighting for Edward, at Falkirk, under the command of [[Antony Bek (bishop of Durham)|Antony Bek]], [[Bishop of Durham]], [[Annandale, Dumfries and Galloway|Annandale]] and [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]. This participation is contested as no Bruce appears on the [[Battle of Falkirk#The Falkirk Roll of Arms|Falkirk roll]] of nobles present in the English army, and two 19th Century antiquarians, Alexander Murison and George Chalmers, have stated Bruce did not participate and in the following month decided to lay waste to Annandale and burn Ayr Castle, to prevent it being garrisoned by the English.\n\n===Guardian===\n[[William Wallace]] resigned as [[Guardian of Scotland]] after his defeat at the [[Battle of Falkirk]]. He was succeeded by Robert Bruce and [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] as joint Guardians, but they could not see past their personal differences. As a nephew and supporter of King John, and as someone with a serious claim to the Scottish throne, Comyn was Bruce's enemy. In 1299, [[William Lamberton]], [[Bishop of St. Andrews]], was appointed as a third, neutral Guardian to try to maintain order between Bruce and Comyn. The following year, Bruce finally resigned as joint Guardian and was replaced by Sir [[Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus]]. In May 1301, Umfraville, Comyn, and Lamberton also resigned as joint Guardians and were replaced by Sir [[John de Soules (died 1310)|John de Soules]] as sole Guardian. Soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the Bruce nor the Comyn camps and was a patriot. He was an active Guardian and made renewed efforts to have King John returned to the Scottish throne.\n[[File:Wallace Monument 20080505 Bust Robert the Bruce.jpg|thumb|Bust of Robert the Bruce at the [[National Wallace Monument]]]]\nIn July 1301 King Edward I launched his sixth campaign into Scotland. Though he captured the castles of [[Bothwell Castle|Bothwell]] and [[Turnberry Castle|Turnberry]], he did little to damage the Scots' fighting ability, and in January 1302 he agreed to a nine-month truce. It was around this time that Robert the Bruce submitted to Edward, along with other nobles, even though he had been on the side of the Scots until then. There were rumours that [[John Balliol]] would return to regain the Scottish throne. Soules, who had probably been appointed by John, supported his return, as did most other nobles. But it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it.\n\nIn March 1302, Bruce sent a letter to the monks at [[Melrose Abbey]] apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national call-up. Bruce pledged that, henceforth, he would \"never again\" require the monks to serve unless it was to \"the common army of the whole realm\", for national defence. Bruce also married his second wife that year, [[Elizabeth de Burgh]], the daughter of [[Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster]]. By Elizabeth he had four children: [[David II of Scotland|David II]], John (died in childhood), Matilda (who married Thomas Isaac and died at Aberdeen 20 July 1353), and Margaret (who married [[William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland]] in 1345).\n\nIn 1303, Edward invaded again, reaching [[Edinburgh]] before marching to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]. Edward stayed in Perth until July, then proceeded via [[Dundee]], [[Brechin]], and [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] to [[Aberdeen]], where he arrived in August. From there he marched through [[Moray]] to [[Badenoch]] before re-tracing his path back south to [[Dunfermline]]. With the country now under submission, all the leading Scots, except for William Wallace, surrendered to Edward in February 1304. John Comyn, who was by now Guardian again, submitted to Edward. The laws and liberties of Scotland were to be as they had been in the days of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of King Edward and the advice of the Scots nobles.\n\nOn 11 June 1304, Bruce and William Lamberton made a pact that bound them, each to the other, in \"friendship and alliance against all men.\" If one should break the secret pact, he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds. The pact is often interpreted{{by whom|date=July 2015}} as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the English. Homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs, and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the English parliament to establish rules for the governance of Scotland. The [[Earl of Richmond]], Edward's nephew, was to head up the subordinate government of Scotland. While all this took place, William Wallace was finally captured near [[Glasgow]], and he was hanged, drawn, and quartered in London on 23 August 1305.\n\nIn September 1305, Edward ordered Robert Bruce to put his [[Kildrummy Castle|castle at Kildrummy]], \"in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for,\" suggesting that King Edward suspected Robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back. However, an identical phrase appears in an agreement between Edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend, [[Aymer de Valence]]. A further sign of Edward's distrust occurred on 10 October 1305, when Edward revoked his gift of Sir Gilbert de Umfraville's lands to Bruce that he had made only six months before.<ref name=\"Scott 1982 72\">{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=72}}</ref>\n\nRobert Bruce as [[Earl of Carrick]], and now 7th [[Lord of Annandale]], held huge estates and property in Scotland and a barony and some minor properties in England, and a strong claim to the Scottish throne.\n\n===Murder of John Comyn===\n[[File:Death of Comyn.jpg|thumb|The killing of Comyn in the [[Greyfriars, Dumfries|Greyfriars church]] in Dumfries, as imagined by [[Henri F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux|Felix Philippoteaux]], a 19th-century illustrator]]\n\nBruce, like all his family, had a complete belief in his right to the throne. His ambition was further thwarted by [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]], who supported John Balliol. Comyn was the most powerful noble in Scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within Scotland and England, including relatives that held the earldoms of Buchan, Mar, Ross, Fife, Angus, Dunbar, and Strathearn; the Lordships of Kilbride, Kirkintilloch, Lenzie, Bedrule, and Scraesburgh; and sheriffdoms in Banff, Dingwall, Wigtown, and Aberdeen. He also had a powerful claim to the Scottish throne through his descent from [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald III]] on his father's side and [[David I of Scotland|David I]] on his mother's side. Comyn was the nephew of [[John Balliol]].\n\nAccording to Barbour and Fordoun, in the late summer of 1305, in a secret agreement sworn, signed, and sealed, John Comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the Scottish throne in favour of Robert Bruce upon receipt of the Bruce lands in Scotland should an uprising occur led by Bruce.<ref>Fordun, ''Scotichronicon'', p. 330; Barbour, ''The Bruce'', p. 13.</ref> Whether the details of the agreement with Comyn are correct or not, King Edward moved to arrest Bruce while Bruce was still at the English court. [[Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer|Ralph de Monthermer]] learned of Edward's intention and warned Bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs. Bruce took the hint, and he and a squire fled the English court during the night. They made their way quickly for Scotland.<ref name=\"Scott 1982 72\"/>\n\nAccording to Barbour, Comyn betrayed his agreement with Bruce to King Edward I, and when Bruce arranged a meeting for 10 February 1306 with Comyn in the Chapel of [[Greyfriars, Dumfries|Greyfriars]] Monastery in [[Dumfries]] and accused him of treachery, they came to blows.<ref>Barbour, ''The Bruce'', p. 15.</ref> Bruce stabbed Comyn before the high altar. The [[Scotichronicon]] says that on being told that Comyn had survived the attack and was being treated, two of Bruce's supporters, [[Roger de Kirkpatrick]] (uttering the words \"I mak siccar\" (\"I make sure\")) and John Lindsay, went back into the church and finished Bruce's work. Barbour, however, tells no such story. The Flores Historiarum which was written c. 1307 says Bruce and Comyn disagreed and Bruce drew his sword and struck Comyn over the head. Bruce supporters then ran up and stabbed Comyn with their swords.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flores Historiarum |url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/1307bruce.asp}}</ref> Bruce asserted his claim to the Scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of Scotland.\n\nBruce and his party then attacked Dumfries Castle where the English garrison surrendered. Bruce hurried from Dumfries to Glasgow, where his friend and supporter Bishop Robert Wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to Bruce.<ref>{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=74}}</ref> Nonetheless, Bruce was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for this crime.<ref>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] 17 May 2006.</ref>\n\n==Early reign (1306\u20131314)==\n\n===War of Robert the Bruce===\n[[File:Robert The Bruce Crowned King of Scots.jpg|thumb|230px|Bruce crowned King of Scots; modern tableau at Edinburgh Castle]]\nSix weeks after Comyn was killed in Dumfries, Bruce was crowned King of Scots by [[Bishop William de Lamberton]] at [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]], near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], on [[Palm Sunday]]<ref name=battle>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js5mfeOdl3A \"Battle of Bannockburn 1314 Line of Fire\" History Channel]</ref> 25 March 1306 with all formality and solemnity. The royal robes and vestments that Robert Wishart had hidden from the English were brought out by the bishop and set upon King Robert. The bishops of Moray and Glasgow were in attendance, as were the earls of Atholl, Menteith, Lennox, and Mar. The great banner of the kings of Scotland was planted behind Bruce's throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=75}}</ref>\n\n[[Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan]] and wife of [[John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan]] (a cousin of the murdered John Comyn) arrived the next day, too late for the coronation. She claimed the right of her family, the MacDuff [[Earl of Fife]], to crown the Scottish king for her brother, [[Donnchadh IV, Earl of Fife]], who was not yet of age, and in English hands. So a second coronation was held and once more the crown was placed on the brow of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, Lord of Annandale, [[King of the Scots]].\n\nIn June 1306 Bruce was defeated at the [[Battle of Methven]]. His wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to Kildrummy in August 1306 under the protection of Bruce's brother, [[Nigel de Brus|Neil Bruce]], and the [[Earl of Atholl]] and most of his remaining men.<ref name=\"Scott 1982 84\u201385\">{{harvnb|Scott|1982|pp=84\u201385}}</ref> Bruce fled with a small following of his most faithful men, including [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]] and [[Gilbert II de la Hay|Gilbert Hay]], Bruce's brothers [[Thomas de Brus|Thomas]], [[Alexander de Brus|Alexander]], and [[Edward Bruce|Edward]], as well as Sir [[Niall mac Cailein|Neil Campbell]] and the [[Earl of Lennox]].<ref name=\"Scott 1982 84\u201385\"/>\n\nA strong force under Edward, Prince of Wales, captured Kildrummy Castle on 13 September taking prisoner the King's youngest brother, Nigel de Bruce, as well as Robert Boyd and Alexander Lindsay, and Sir Simon Fraser. Boyd managed to escape but both Nigel de Bruce and Lindsay were executed shortly after at Berwick following King Edward's orders to execute all followers of Robert de Bruce. Fraser was taken to London to suffer the same fate. Shortly before the fall of Kildrummy Castle, the Earl of Athol made a desperate attempt to take Queen Elizabeth de Burgh, Margery de Bruce, as well as King Robert's sisters and Isabella of Fife. They were betrayed a few days later and also fell into English hands, Atholl to be executed in London and the women to be held under the harshest possible circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barron |first1=Evan MacLeod |title=The Scottish War of Independence |date=1997 |publisher=Barnes & Noble Books |page=246}}</ref>\nEdward I marched north again in the spring. On his way, he granted the Scottish estates of Bruce and his adherents to his own followers and had published a bill excommunicating Bruce.\n\nOn 7 July 1307, King Edward I died, leaving Bruce opposed by the king's son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]].\n[[File:At night when they gathered round the watch-fires, the king would read stories of the old books.jpg|thumb|Bruce reading stories to his followers; from a 19th-century Scottish history book]]\nIt is still uncertain where Bruce spent the winter of 1306\u201307. Most likely he spent it in the [[Hebrides]], possibly sheltered by [[Christina of the Isles]]. The latter was married to a member of the [[Mar kindred]], a family to which Bruce was related (not only was his first wife a member of this family but her brother, [[Gartnait, Earl of Mar|Gartnait]], was married to a sister of Bruce). Ireland is also a serious possibility, and [[Orkney]] (under Norwegian rule at the time) or Norway proper (where his sister [[Isabel Bruce]] was queen dowager) are unlikely but not impossible.<ref>Traquair, Peter ''Freedom's Sword'' pp. 139-140</ref> Bruce and his followers returned to the Scottish mainland in February in two groups. One, led by Bruce and his brother [[Edward Bruce|Edward]], landed at [[Turnberry Castle]] and began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] in south-west Scotland. The other, led by his brothers Thomas and Alexander, landed slightly further south in [[Loch Ryan]], but they were soon captured and executed. In April, Bruce won a small victory over the English at the [[Battle of Glen Trool]], before defeating [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], at the [[Battle of Loudoun Hill]]. At the same time, James Douglas made his first foray for Bruce into south-western Scotland, attacking and burning his own castle in Douglasdale. Leaving his brother Edward in command in [[Galloway]], Bruce travelled north, capturing [[Inverlochy Castle|Inverlochy]] and [[Urquhart Castle|Urquhart]] Castles, burning to the ground [[Inverness Castle]] and [[Nairn]], then unsuccessfully threatening [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].\n\nTransferring operations to [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]] in late 1307, he threatened [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] before falling seriously ill, probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign. Recovering, leaving [[John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan]] unsubdued at his rear, Bruce returned west to take [[Balvenie Castle|Balvenie]] and [[Duffus Castle|Duffus]] Castles, then Tarradale Castle on the [[Black Isle]]. Looping back via the hinterlands of Inverness and a second failed attempt to take Elgin, Bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of Comyn at the [[Battle of Inverurie (1308)|Battle of Inverurie]] in May 1308; he then overran Buchan and defeated the English garrison at [[Aberdeen]]. The [[Harrying of Buchan]] in 1308 was ordered by Bruce to make sure all Comyn family support was extinguished. Buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern Scotland, and much of its population was loyal to the Comyn family even after the defeat of the Earl of Buchan. Most of the Comyn castles in Moray, Aberdeen and Buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed. In less than a year Bruce had swept through the north and destroyed the power of the Comyns who had held vice-regal power in the north for nearly one hundred years. How this dramatic success was achieved, especially the taking   of northern castles so quickly, is difficult to understand. Bruce lacked siege weapons and it's unlikely his army had substantially greater numbers or was better armed than his opponents. The morale and leadership of the Comyns and their northern allies appeared to be inexplicably lacking in the face of their direst challenge. He then crossed to [[Argyll]] and defeated the isolated MacDougalls (allies of the Comyns) at the [[Battle of Pass of Brander]] and took [[Dunstaffnage Castle]], the last major stronghold of the Comyns and their allies.<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|p=444}}</ref> Bruce then ordered harryings in Argyle and Kintyre, in the territories of [[Clan MacDougall]]\n\nIn March 1309, Bruce held his first parliament at [[St. Andrews]] and by August he controlled all of Scotland north of the [[River Tay]]. The following year, the clergy of Scotland recognised Bruce as king at a general council. The support given him by the church, in spite of his excommunication, was of great political importance. On 1 October 1310 Bruce wrote [[Edward II of England]] from Kildrum<ref>{{cite web|title=Dumbarton Sheet XXVI.1 (Cumbernauld) 1864 map|url=http://maps.nls.uk/geo/find/index.cfm#zoom=14&lat=55.9535&lon=-3.9670&layers=7&b=1&point=55.9572,-3.9877|website=National Library of Scotland|publisher=O.S.|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> in [[Cumbernauld]] Parish in an unsuccessful attempt to establish peace between Scotland and England.<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter from Robert the Bruce to Edward II reveals power struggle in the build-up to Bannockburn|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2013/june/headline_279405_en.html|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> Over the next three years, one English-held castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced: [[Linlithgow]] in 1310, [[Dumbarton]] in 1311, and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], by Bruce himself, in January 1312. Bruce also made raids into northern England and, landing at Ramsey in the [[Isle of Man]], laid siege to [[Castle Rushen]] in Castletown, capturing it on 21 June 1313 and denying the English the island's strategic importance.\n\nThe eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the English on even ground have caused many to consider Bruce one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age.

Bruce also drove back a subsequent English expedition north of the border and launched raids into [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. Buoyed by his military successes, Bruce's forces also invaded Ireland in 1315, in an attempt to free the country from English rule (having received a reply to offers of assistance from Domhnall \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, king of [[T\u00edr Eoghain]]), and to open a second front in the continuing wars with England. Bruce was even crowned as [[High King of Ireland]] in 1316. Robert later went there with another army to assist his brother.\n\nIn conjunction with the invasion, Bruce popularised an ideological vision of a \"Pan-Gaelic Greater Scotia\" with his lineage ruling over both Ireland and Scotland. This propaganda campaign was aided by two factors. The first was his marriage alliance from 1302 with the de Burgh family of the [[Earldom of Ulster]] in Ireland; second, Bruce himself, on his mother's side of Carrick, was descended from Gaelic royalty in Scotland as well as Ireland. Bruce's Irish ancestors included [[Aoife MacMurrough|Aoife of Leinster]] (d.1188), whose ancestors included [[Brian Boru]] of [[Munster]] and the [[List of Kings of Leinster|kings of Leinster]]. Thus, lineally and geopolitically, Bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pan-Gaelic alliance between Scottish-Irish Gaelic populations, under his kingship. This is revealed by a letter he sent to the Irish chiefs, where he calls the Scots and Irish collectively ''nostra nacio'' (our nation), stressing the common language, customs and heritage of the two peoples:\n\n{{quote|Whereas we and you and our people and your people, free since ancient times, share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom, we have sent you our beloved kinsman, the bearers of this letter, to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you, so that with God's will our nation (''nostra nacio'') may be able to recover her ancient liberty.}}\n\nThe diplomacy worked to a certain extent, at least in Ulster, where the Scots had some support. The Irish chief, Domhnall \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, for instance, later justified his support for the Scots to [[Pope John XXII]] by saying \"the Kings of Lesser Scotia all trace their blood to our ''Greater Scotia'' and retain to some degree our language and customs.\"<ref>Remonstrance of the Irish Chiefs to Pope John XXII, p. 46.</ref>\n\nThe Bruce campaign in Ireland was characterised by some initial military success. However, the Scots failed to win over the non-Ulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island, where people couldn't see the difference between English and Scottish occupation. Eventually it was defeated when Edward Bruce was killed at the [[Battle of Faughart]]. The Irish Annals of the period described the defeat of the Bruces by the English as one of the greatest things ever done for the Irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the Irish by both the Scots and the English.<ref>The Annals of Connacht.</ref>\n\n==Later reign (1320\u20131329)==\n[[File:Declaration of Arbroath statue (geograph 695366).jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of [[:Bernard de Linton]] and Robert raising the Declaration. ]]\n\nThe reign of Robert Bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements. The [[Declaration of Arbroath]] of 1320 strengthened his position, particularly in relation to the [[Papacy]], and [[Pope John XXII]] eventually lifted Bruce's excommunication. In May 1328 King [[Edward III of England]] signed the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]], which recognised Scotland as an independent kingdom, and Bruce as its king.\n\nIn 1325 Robert I exchanged lands at [[Cardross, Argyll|Cardross]] for those of [[Montrose, Angus|Old Montrose]] in [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] with Sir David Graham.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|pp=260\u201361}}</ref> It was to be here that Robert would build the manor house that would serve as his favoured residence during the final years of his reign. The extant chamberlain's accounts for 1328 detail a manor house at Cardross with king's and queen's chambers and glazed windows, a chapel, kitchens, bake- and brew-houses, falcon [[aviary]], medicinal garden, gatehouse, protective [[moat]] and a hunting park. There was also a [[jetty]] and beaching area for the 'king's coble' (for fishing) alongside the 'king's great ship'.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=261}}</ref>{{refn|The exact location of Cardross manor house is uncertain. Excavations of 2008\u201309 identified the likely site of the manor house at 'Pillanflatt', [[Renton, West Dunbartonshire]], beside the River Leven, opposite [[Dumbarton]] and some 4 miles east of the modern village of Cardross; however, historic cultivated land, quarry and canal works at Mains of Cardross may also point to a possible location for Robert's manor.|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nAs most of mainland Scotland's major royal castles had remained in their razed state since around 1313\u201314, Cardross manor was perhaps built as a modest residence sympathetic to Robert's subjects' privations through a long war, repeated famines and livestock pandemics. Before Cardross became habitable in 1327, Robert's main residence had been [[Scone Abbey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=391}}</ref>\n\nRobert had been suffering from a serious illness from at least 1327. The ''[[Lanercost Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Scalacronica]]'' state that the king was said to have contracted and died of [[leprosy]].<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\"/> [[Jean Le Bel]] also stated that in 1327 the king was a victim of 'la grosse maladie', which is usually taken to mean leprosy.<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\"/> However, the ignorant use of the term 'leprosy' by fourteenth-century writers meant that almost any major skin disease might be called leprosy. The earliest mention of this illness is to be found in an original letter written by an eye-witness in [[Ulster]] at the time the king made a truce with Sir Henry Mandeville on 12 July 1327. The writer of this letter reported that Robert was so feeble and struck down by illness that he would not live, 'for he can scarcely move anything but his tongue'.<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\"/> Barbour writes of the king's illness that 'it began through a benumbing brought on by his cold lying', during the months of wandering from 1306 to 1309.<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 445\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|p=445}}</ref> It has been proposed that, alternatively, he may have suffered from [[eczema]], [[tuberculosis]], [[syphilis]], [[motor neurone disease]], [[cancer]] or a series of [[stroke]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=400}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Robert the Bruce and Leprosy |author=Kaufman MH, MacLennan WJ |work=History of Dentistry Research Newsletter |date=1 April 2001 |accessdate=24 September 2012 |url=http://www.historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2001Apr5.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201191517/http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2001Apr5.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2013  }}</ref> There does not seem to be any evidence as to what the king himself or his physicians believed his illness to be.

With Moray by his side, Robert set off from his manor at [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]] for [[Tarbert, Argyll and Bute|Tarbert]] on his 'great ship', thence to the [[Isle of Arran]], where he celebrated Christmas of 1328 at the hall of Glenkill near [[Lamlash]]. Thence he sailed to the mainland to visit his son and his bride, both mere children, now installed at Turnberry Castle, the head of the earldom of Carrick and once his own main residence.<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\"/><ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 276\"/> He journeyed overland, being carried on a [[litter (vehicle)|litter]], to [[Inch, Wigtownshire|Inch]] in [[Wigtownshire]]: houses were built there and supplies brought to that place, as though the king's condition had deteriorated. At the end of March 1329 he was staying at [[Glenluce Abbey]] and at [[Monreith]], from where St Ninian's cave was visited.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 276\"/> Early in April he arrived at the shrine of St Ninian at Whithorn. He fasted four or five days and prayed to the saint, before returning by sea to Cardross.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 276\"/>\n\nBarbour and other sources relate that Robert summoned his prelates and barons to his bedside for a final council at which he made copious gifts to religious houses, dispensed silver to religious foundations of various orders, so that they might pray for his soul, and repented of his failure to fulfil a vow to undertake a [[Crusades|crusade]] to fight the '[[Saracens]]' in the [[Holy Land]].<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\"/><ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 276\"/> Robert's final wish reflected conventional piety, and was perhaps intended to perpetuate his memory. After his death his heart was to be removed from his body and, accompanied by a company of knights led by [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]], taken on [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], before being interred in [[Melrose Abbey]] upon its return from the [[Holy Land]]:<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\"/><ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 276\"/><ref name=\"Penman 2014 300\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=300}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I will that as soone as I am trespassed out of this worlde that ye take my harte owte of my body, and embawme it, and take of my treasoure as ye shall thynke sufficient for that enterprise, both for your selfe and suche company as ye wyll take with you, and present my hart to the holy Sepulchre where as our Lorde laye, seyng my body can nat come there\".<ref>from Froissart's Chronicles, translated by John Bourchier, Lord Berners (1467\u20131533), E.M.

Apart from failing to fulfill a vow to undertake a [[Crusades|crusade]] he died utterly fulfilled, in that the goal of his lifetime's struggle\u2014untrammelled recognition of the Bruce right to the crown\u2014had been realised, and confident that he was leaving the kingdom of Scotland safely in the hands of his most trusted lieutenant, Moray, until his infant son reached adulthood.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 271\">{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=271}}</ref> Six days after his death, to complete his triumph still further, [[papal bull]]s were issued granting the privilege of [[unction]] at the [[coronation]] of future Kings of Scots.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 271\"/>\n\nIt remains unclear just what caused the death of Robert, a month before his fifty-fifth birthday. Contemporary accusations that Robert suffered from leprosy, the \"unclean sickness\"\u2014the present-day, treatable [[leprosy|Hansen's disease]]\u2014derived from English and Hainault chroniclers. None of the Scottish accounts of his death hint at leprosy. Penman states that it is very difficult to accept the notion of Robert as a functioning king serving in war, performing face-to-face acts of lordship, holding parliament and court, travelling widely and fathering several children, all while displaying the infectious symptoms of a leper.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|pp=302\u201303}}</ref> Along with suggestions of eczema, tuberculosis, syphilis, [[motor neurone disease]], cancer or stroke, a diet of rich court food has also been suggested as a possible contributory factor in Robert's death. His Milanese physician, [[Maino De Maineri]], did criticise the king's eating of [[eel]]s as dangerous to his health in advancing years.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=304}}</ref>\n\nA team of researchers, headed by Professor Andrew Nelson from [[University of Western Ontario]] have determined that Robert the Bruce did not have leprosy. They examined the original casting of the skull belonging to Robert the Bruce's descendant Lord Andrew Douglas Alexander Thomas Bruce, and a foot bone that had not been re-interred. They determined that skull and foot bone showed no signs of leprosy, such as an eroded nasal spine and a pencilling of the foot bone.<ref>{{cite web|last1=University|first1=Department of Communications and Public Affairs, Western|title= A rumour at rest: Western researcher clears a king's reputation|url=http://news.westernu.ca/2017/02/rumour-rest-western-researcher-clears-kings-reputation/|website=Western News|accessdate=2 March 2017|date=16 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Burial===\nThe king's body was [[embalming|embalmed]], and his [[sternum]] sawn open to allow extraction of the heart, which [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]] placed in a silver casket to be worn on a chain around his neck, with Sir [[Simon Locard]] holding the key.

A canopy chapel or 'hearse' of imported Baltic wood was erected over the grave.

The following [[Latin]] epitaph was inscribed around the top of the tomb: ''Hic jacet invictus Robertus Rex benedictus qui sua gesta legit repetit quot bella peregit ad libertatem perduxit per probitatem regnum scottorum: nunc vivat in arce polorum'' (\"Here lies the invincible blessed King Robert / Whoever reads about his feats will repeat the many battles he fought / By his integrity he guided to liberty the Kingdom of the Scots: May he now live in Heaven\").<ref>{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=278}}</ref><ref name=\"Penman 2014 308\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=308}}</ref> Ten alabaster fragments from the tomb are on display in the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and traces of gilding still remain on some of them.<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\"/><ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 271\"/> Robert had bequeathed sufficient funds to pay for thousands of obituary [[Mass (Catholic Church)|masses]] in Dunfermline Abbey and elsewhere, and his tomb would thus be the site of daily [[Votive offering|votive]] prayers.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 308\"/>\n\nWhen a projected international crusade failed to materialise, Sir James Douglas and his company, escorting the casket containing Bruce's heart, sailed to Spain where [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] was mounting a campaign against the [[Moors|Moorish]] kingdom of [[Granada]]. According to John Barbour, Douglas and his companions, including [[Sir William de Keith]], Sir [[Kenneth Moir]], Sir [[Simon Locard]], Sir William de St. Clair and John de St. Clair of [[Roslin, Midlothian|Rosslyn]] and the brothers Sir Robert Logan of [[Restalrig]] and Sir Walter Logan, were welcomed cordially by King Alfonso. In August 1330 the Scots contingent formed part of the Castilian army besieging the frontier castle of [[Battle of Teba|Teba]]. Under circumstances which are still disputed, Sir James and most of his companions were killed. The sources all agree that, outnumbered and separated from the main Christian army, a group of Scots knights led by Douglas was overwhelmed and wiped out. The surviving members including Sir [[Simon Locard]] of the company recovered Douglas' body together with the casket containing Bruce's heart. The heart, together with Douglas' bones were brought back to Scotland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn accordance with Bruce's written request, the heart was buried at [[Melrose Abbey]] in [[Roxburghshire]].<ref>Acts of Robert I, king of Scots, 1306\u20131329, ed.

His tomb, imported from [[Paris]], was extremely elaborate, carved from gilded [[alabaster]]. It was destroyed at the [[Reformation]], but some fragments were discovered in the 19th century (now in the [[Museum of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]]).\n\nThe site of the tomb in Dunfermline Abbey was marked by large carved stone letters spelling out \"King Robert the Bruce\" around the top of the [[bell tower]], when the eastern half of the abbey church was rebuilt in the first half of the 19th century. In 1974 the Bruce Memorial Window was installed in the north [[transept]], commemorating the 700th anniversary of the year of his birth. It depicts [[stained glass]] images of the Bruce flanked by his chief men, [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], and [[Christian saint|saints]] associated with Scotland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dunfermlineabbey.co.uk/index.php?ID=1853&CATEGORY=4-History |title=Dunfermline Abbey History |publisher=The Church of Scotland |accessdate=20 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert the Bruce, Edinburgh Castle.jpg|thumb|Bruce statue at the entrance to Edinburgh Castle]]\n\nA 1929 statue of Robert the Bruce is set in the wall of Edinburgh Castle at the entrance, along with one of William Wallace. In Edinburgh also, the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] has statues of Bruce and Wallace in niches flanking the main entrance. The building also contains several frescos depicting scenes from Scots history by [[William Brassey Hole]] in the entrance foyer, including a large example of Bruce marshalling his men at Bannockburn.\n\nA bust of Bruce is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]].\n\nA statue of Robert Bruce stands in the High Street in Lochmaben and another in Annan (erected 2010) in front of the town's Victorian hall.\n\nAn annual commemorative dinner has been held in his honour in [[Stirling]] since 2006.\n\n===Legends===\nAccording to a legend, at some point while he was on the run after the 1305 Battle of Methven, Bruce hid in a cave where he observed a spider spinning a web, trying to make a connection from one area of the cave's roof to another. It tried and failed twice, but began again and succeeded on the third attempt. Inspired by this, Bruce returned to inflict a series of defeats on the English, thus winning him more supporters and eventual victory. The story serves to illustrate the maxim: \"if at first you don't succeed, try try try again.\" Other versions have Bruce in a small house watching the spider try to make its connection between two roof beams.<ref name=battle/>\n\nThis legend first appears in a much later account, ''[[Tales of a Grandfather]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]] (published between 1828 and 1830).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/etexts/etexts/grandfather1.PDF|title=Tales of a Grandfather|last=Scott|first=Walter|website=Edinburgh University Library, The Walter Scott Digital Archive|access-date=28 January 2019}}</ref> This may have originally been told about his companion-in-arms Sir [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|James Douglas]] (the \"Black Douglas\"), who had spent time hiding out in caves within his manor of Lintalee, which was then occupied by the English.

Riding with the heavy cavalry, de Bohun caught sight of Bruce, who was armed only with his battle-axe. De Bohun lowered his lance and charged, and Bruce stood his ground. At the last moment, Bruce swiftly dodged the lance, raised in his saddle, and with one mighty swing of his axe, struck Bohun so hard that he split de Bohun's iron helmet and his head in two, a blow so powerful that it shattered the very weapon into pieces. Afterwards the King merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe.

Briuis}}''; [[Scottish Gaelic|modern Scottish Gaelic]]: ''{{lang|gd|Raibeart Brus}}''; [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]]: ''{{lang|xno|Robert de Brus}}'' or ''{{lang|xno|Robert de Bruys}}''; [[Early Scots]]: ''Robert Brus''; {{lang-la|Robertus Brussius}}), was [[King of Scotland]] from 1306 until his death in 1329. Robert was one of the most famous warriors of his generation, and eventually led [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] during the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] against [[Kingdom of England|England]]. He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent country and is today revered in Scotland as a national hero.\n\nHis paternal fourth great-grandfather was [[David I of Scotland|King David I]]. Robert's grandfather, [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale]], was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the \"[[Great Cause]]\". As [[Earl of Carrick]], Robert the Bruce supported his family's claim to the Scottish throne and took part in [[William Wallace]]'s revolt against [[Edward I of England]]. Appointed in 1298 as a [[Guardian of Scotland]] alongside his chief rival for the throne, [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]], and [[William Lamberton]], [[Bishop of St Andrews]], Robert later resigned in 1300 due to his quarrels with Comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of [[John Balliol]] to the Scottish throne. After submitting to Edward I in 1302 and returning to \"the king's peace\", Robert inherited his family's claim to the Scottish throne upon his father's death.\n\nIn February 1306, Bruce, having wounded Comyn, rushed from the church where they had met and encountered his attendants outside.\nHe told them what had happened and said, \"I must be off, for I doubt I have slain the Red Comyn.\" \"Doubt?\", [[Roger de Kirkpatrick]] of Closeburn answered. \"I mak sikker,\" (\"I'll make sure,\" or \"I make sure\"). [[Roger de Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick]] then rushed into the church and killed Comyn. For this, Bruce was then [[excommunicated]] by the Pope (although he received [[absolution]] from [[Robert Wishart]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]]). Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne, and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306. Edward I's forces defeated Robert in battle, forcing him to flee into hiding before re-emerging in 1307 to defeat an English army at [[Battle of Loudoun Hill|Loudoun Hill]] and wage a highly successful [[guerrilla war]] against the English. Bruce defeated his other Scots enemies, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands, and in 1309 held his first [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]]. A series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland, and at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314, Robert defeated a much larger English army under [[Edward II of England]], confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish kingdom. The battle marked a significant turning point, with Robert's armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout [[northern England]], while also extending his war against the English to [[Lordship of Ireland|Ireland]] by sending an army to invade there and by appealing to the Irish to rise against Edward II's rule.\n\nDespite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in 1318, Edward II refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish nobility submitted the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] to [[Pope John XXII]], declaring Robert as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland's status as an independent kingdom. In 1324, the Pope recognised Robert I as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the [[Auld Alliance|Franco-Scottish alliance]] was renewed in the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|Treaty of Corbeil]]. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, [[Edward III]], and peace was concluded between Scotland and England with the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]] in 1328, by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland.\n\nRobert died in June 1329. His body is buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]], while his heart was interred in [[Melrose Abbey]] and his internal organs embalmed and placed in St Serf's Chapel, [[Dumbarton]], site of the medieval [[Cardross]] Parish church.\n\n==Background==\n[[Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale]], the first of the Bruce (de Brus) line, arrived in Scotland with [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1124 and was given the lands of Annandale in Dumfries and Galloway.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Scottish History: Robert The Bruce|last = Ntungwa|first = Arnold|publisher = Heinemann Library|year = 1996|isbn = 978-0431058832|location = |pages = }}</ref> Several members of the [[House of Bruce|Bruce family]] were called Robert, the future king was one of ten children, and the eldest son, of [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale]], and [[Marjorie, Countess of Carrick]], and claimed the Scottish throne as a fourth great-grandson of [[David I of Scotland|David I]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wHZcIRMhSEMC&pg=PA733&dq=bruce+and+Broadoak&sig=_1iJsPKVqilBVmDkwuV2Afapp7o Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families By Douglas Richardson, Kimball G.

From his mother, he inherited the [[Earldom of Carrick]], and through his father, a royal lineage that would give him a claim to the Scottish throne.

[[Lochmaben]] has a claim, as a possession of the Bruce family, but is not supported by a medieval source. Contemporary claims of the Bruce estate at [[Writtle]], Essex, during the coronation of Edward, have been discounted by [[G.W.S. Barrow]].|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n===Childhood===\nVery little is known of his youth. He was probably brought up in a mixture of the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] culture of northern England and south-eastern Scotland, and the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture of south-west Scotland and most of Scotland north of the [[River Forth]]. [[Annandale]] was thoroughly [[Feudalism|feudalised]] and the form of Northern [[Middle English]] that would later develop into the [[Scots language]] was spoken throughout the region. [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]] was historically an integral part of [[Galloway]], and though the earls of Carrick had achieved some feudalisation, the society of Carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nRobert the Bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age. He would have been schooled to speak, read and possibly write in the [[Anglo-Norman language]] of his Scots-Norman peers and his father's family. He would also have spoken both the Gaelic language of his Carrick birthplace and his mother's family, and the early Scots language.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|pp=34\u201335}}</ref><ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 12\">{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=12}}</ref><ref name=\"Penman 2014 16\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=16}}</ref> As the heir to a considerable estate and a pious layman, Robert would also have been given working knowledge of [[Latin]], the language of charter lordship, liturgy and prayer. This would have afforded Robert and his brothers access to basic education in the [[law]], [[politics]], [[scripture]], saints' Lives (''vitae''), [[philosophy]], [[history]] and chivalric instruction and romance.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 12\"/><ref name=\"Penman 2014 16\"/> That Robert took personal pleasure in such learning and leisure is suggested in a number of ways. Barbour reported that Robert read aloud to his band of supporters in 1306, reciting from memory tales from a twelfth-century romance of [[Charlemagne]], ''[[Fierabras]]'', as well as relating examples from history such as [[Hannibal]]'s defiance of [[Rome]].<ref name=\"Penman 2014 16\"/>\n\nAs king, Robert certainly commissioned verse to commemorate [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] and his subjects' military deeds. Contemporary chroniclers [[Jean Le Bel]] and [[Thomas Grey (chronicler)|Thomas Grey]] would both assert that they had read a history of his reign 'commissioned by King Robert himself.' In his last years, Robert would pay for [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]]s to tutor his son, [[David II of Scotland|David]], for whom he would also purchase books.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 16\"/> A parliamentary briefing document of c.1364 would also assert that Robert 'used continually to read, or have read in his presence, the histories of ancient kings and princes, and how they conducted themselves in their times, both in wartime and in peacetime; from these he derived information about aspects of his own rule.'<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 12\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|pp=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nTutors for the young Robert and his brothers were most likely drawn from unbeneficed clergy or mendicant friars associated with the churches patronised by their family. However, as growing noble youths, outdoor pursuits and great events would also have held a strong fascination for Robert and his brothers. They would have had masters drawn from their parents' household to school them in the arts of horsemanship, swordsmanship, the joust, hunting and perhaps aspects of courtly behaviour, including dress, protocol, speech, table etiquette, music and dance, some of which may have been learned before the age of ten while serving as [[Page (servant)|pages]] in their father's or grandfather's household.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 18\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=18}}</ref> As many of these personal and leadership skills were bound up within a code of chivalry, Robert's chief tutor was surely a reputable, experienced knight, drawn from his grandfather's crusade retinue. This grandfather, known to contemporaries as [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale|Robert the Noble]], and to history as \"Bruce the Competitor\", seems to have been an immense influence on the future king.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 14\">{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=14}}</ref> Robert's later performance in war certainly underlines his skills in tactics and single combat.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 18\"/>\n\nThe family would have moved between the castles of their lordships\u2014[[Lochmaben Castle]], the main castle of the lordship of Annandale, and Turnberry and [[Loch Doon Castle]], the castles of the earldom of Carrick. A significant and profound part of the childhood experience of Robert, [[Edward Bruce|Edward]] and possibly the other Bruce brothers (Neil, Thomas and Alexander), was also gained through the Gaelic tradition of being fostered to allied Gaelic kindreds\u2014a traditional practice in Carrick, south-west and western Scotland, the [[Hebrides]] and [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"Penman 2014 18\"/> There were a number of Carrick, Ayrshire, Hebridean and Irish families and kindreds affiliated with the Bruces who might have performed such a service (Robert's foster-brother is referred to by Barbour as sharing Robert's precarious existence as an outlaw in Carrick in 1307\u201308).<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 14\"/> This Gaelic influence has been cited as a possible explanation for Robert the Bruce's apparent affinity for \"[[hobelar]]\" warfare, using smaller sturdy ponies in mounted raids, as well as for sea-power, ranging from oared war-galleys (\"[[birlinn]]s\") to boats.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 19\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=19}}</ref>\n\nAccording to historians such as Barrow and Penman, it is also likely that when Robert and Edward Bruce reached the male age of consent of twelve and began training for full knighthood, they were sent to reside for a period with one or more allied English noble families, such as the [[de Clare]]s of Gloucester, or perhaps even in the English royal household.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 19\"/> [[Thomas Grey (chronicler)|Sir Thomas Grey]] asserted in his ''[[Scalacronica]]'' that in about 1292, Robert the Bruce, then aged eighteen, was a \"young bachelor of [[Edward I of England|King Edward]]'s Chamber\".<ref name=\"Penman 2014 20\">{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=20}}</ref> While there remains little firm evidence of Robert's presence at Edward's court, on 8 April 1296, both Robert and his father were pursued through the English [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]] for their private household debts of \u00a360 by several merchants of [[Winchester]]. This raises the possibility that young Robert the Bruce was on occasion resident in a royal centre which Edward I himself would visit frequently during his reign.<ref name=\"Penman 2014 20\"/>\n\nRobert's first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by [[Alexander Og MacDonald, Lord of Islay]]. His name appears in the company of the [[Bishop of Argyll]], the vicar of [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], a [[Kintyre]] clerk, his father, and a host of Gaelic notaries from Carrick.<ref>{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|p=35}}</ref> Robert Bruce, the king to be, was sixteen years of age when [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] died in 1290. It is also around this time that Robert would have been knighted, and he began to appear on the political stage in the Bruce dynastic interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=30}}</ref>\n\n===The \"Great Cause\"===\n\nRobert's mother died early in 1292. In November of the same year, [[Edward I of England]], on behalf of the [[Guardians of Scotland#Guardians of Scotland during the First Interregnum 1290\u20131292|Guardians of Scotland]] and following the [[Great Cause]], awarded the vacant Crown of Scotland to his grandfather's first cousin once removed, [[John Balliol]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=29}}</ref> Almost immediately, [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale]], resigned his lordship of Annandale and transferred his claim to the Scottish throne to his son, antedating this statement to 7 November. In turn, that son, [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale]], resigned his earldom of Carrick to his eldest son, Robert, the future king, so as to protect the Bruce's kingship claim while their middle lord (Robert the Bruce's father) now held only English lands.<ref>{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=49}}</ref> While the Bruces' bid for the throne had ended in failure, the Balliols' triumph propelled the eighteen-year-old Robert the Bruce onto the political stage in his own right.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|pp=36\u201337}}</ref>\n\n==Earl of Carrick (1292\u20131306)==\n\n===The Bruces regroup===\n[[File:Robert I and Isabella of Mar.jpg|thumb|Robert the Bruce and his first wife [[Isabella of Mar]], as depicted in the 1562 Forman Armorial.]]\n\nEven after John's accession, Edward still continued to assert his authority over Scotland and relations between the two kings soon began to deteriorate. The Bruces sided with King Edward against King John and his Comyn allies.

The Bruces and the earls of [[Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus|Angus]] and [[Patrick IV, Earl of March|March]] refused, and the Bruce family withdrew temporarily from Scotland, while the Comyns seized their estates in Annandale and Carrick, granting them to [[John Comyn, Earl of Buchan]].<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 50\"/> Edward I thereupon provided a safe refuge for the Bruces, having appointed the Lord of Annandale to the command of [[Carlisle Castle]] in October 1295.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 53\">{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=53}}</ref> At some point in early 1296, Robert married his first wife, [[Isabella of Mar]], the daughter of [[Domhnall I, Earl of Mar]] and his wife Helen.\n\n===Beginning of the Wars of Independence===\n\nAlmost the first blow in the [[First War of Scottish Independence|war between Scotland and England]] was a direct attack on the Bruces. On 26 March 1296, Easter Monday, seven Scottish earls made a surprise attack on the walled city of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], which was not so much an attack against England as the Comyn Earl of Buchan and their faction attacking their Bruce enemies.<ref>Duncan, Kingship, p. 322.</ref> Both his father and grandfather were at one time Governors of the Castle, and following the loss of Annandale to Comyn in 1295, it was their principal residence. Robert Bruce would have gained first-hand knowledge of the city's defences. The next time Carlisle was besieged, in 1315, Robert the Bruce would be leading the attack.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 53\"/>\n\nEdward I responded to King John's alliance with France and the attack on Carlisle by invading Scotland at the end of March 1296 and taking the town of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in a particularly [[Capture of Berwick (1296)|bloody attack]] upon the flimsy palisades.<ref>M.

It appears that Robert Bruce had fallen under the influence of his grandfather's friends, Wishart and Stewart, who had inspired him to resistance.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 63\"/> With the outbreak of the revolt, Robert left Carlisle and made his way to Annandale, where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and, according to the English chronicler [[Walter of Guisborough]], addressed them thus:\n\n<blockquote>No man holds his own flesh and blood in hatred and I am no exception. I must join my own people and the nation in which I was born. I ask that you please come with me and you will be my councillors and close comrades\"<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 63\"/><ref>from The Chronicle of Walter of Guisborough (previously edited as the Chronicle of Walter of Hemingford or Hemingburgh)</ref></blockquote>\n\nUrgent letters were sent ordering Bruce to support Edward's commander, [[John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey]] (to whom Bruce was related), in the summer of 1297; but instead of complying, Bruce continued to support the revolt against Edward I. That Bruce was in the forefront of inciting rebellion is shown in a letter written to Edward by [[Hugh Cressingham]] on 23 July 1292, which reports the opinion that \"if you had the earl of Carrick, the Steward of Scotland and his brother...you would think your business done\".<ref>{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=64}}</ref> On 7 July, Bruce and his friends made terms with Edward by a treaty called the [[Capitulation of Irvine]]. The Scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to King Edward. The Bishop of Glasgow, James the Steward, and Sir Alexander Lindsay became sureties for Bruce until he delivered his infant daughter [[Marjorie Bruce|Marjorie]] as a hostage, which he never did.<ref>{{cite book|title=Robert Bruce: Our Most Valiant, Prince, KIng, and Lord|date=2006|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|page=101|url=http://history-books.weebly.com/uploads/6/9/9/0/6990231/robert_bruce__our_most_valiant_prince_kin_-_mcnamee_colm.pdf}}</ref>\n\nWhen King Edward returned to England after his victory at the [[Battle of Falkirk]], the Bruce's possessions were excepted from the Lordships and lands that Edward assigned to his followers. The reason for this is uncertain, though Fordun records Robert fighting for Edward, at Falkirk, under the command of [[Antony Bek (bishop of Durham)|Antony Bek]], [[Bishop of Durham]], [[Annandale, Dumfries and Galloway|Annandale]] and [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]. This participation is contested as no Bruce appears on the [[Battle of Falkirk#The Falkirk Roll of Arms|Falkirk roll]] of nobles present in the English army, and two 19th Century antiquarians, Alexander Murison and George Chalmers, have stated Bruce did not participate and in the following month decided to lay waste to Annandale and burn Ayr Castle, to prevent it being garrisoned by the English.\n\n===Guardian===\n[[William Wallace]] resigned as [[Guardian of Scotland]] after his defeat at the [[Battle of Falkirk]]. He was succeeded by Robert Bruce and [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] as joint Guardians, but they could not see past their personal differences. As a nephew and supporter of King John, and as someone with a serious claim to the Scottish throne, Comyn was Bruce's enemy. In 1299, [[William Lamberton]], [[Bishop of St. Andrews]], was appointed as a third, neutral Guardian to try to maintain order between Bruce and Comyn. The following year, Bruce finally resigned as joint Guardian and was replaced by Sir [[Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus]]. In May 1301, Umfraville, Comyn, and Lamberton also resigned as joint Guardians and were replaced by Sir [[John de Soules (died 1310)|John de Soules]] as sole Guardian. Soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the Bruce nor the Comyn camps and was a patriot. He was an active Guardian and made renewed efforts to have King John returned to the Scottish throne.\n[[File:Wallace Monument 20080505 Bust Robert the Bruce.jpg|thumb|Bust of Robert the Bruce at the [[National Wallace Monument]]]]\nIn July 1301 King Edward I launched his sixth campaign into Scotland. Though he captured the castles of [[Bothwell Castle|Bothwell]] and [[Turnberry Castle|Turnberry]], he did little to damage the Scots' fighting ability, and in January 1302 he agreed to a nine-month truce. It was around this time that Robert the Bruce submitted to Edward, along with other nobles, even though he had been on the side of the Scots until then. There were rumours that [[John Balliol]] would return to regain the Scottish throne. Soules, who had probably been appointed by John, supported his return, as did most other nobles. But it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it.\n\nIn March 1302, Bruce sent a letter to the monks at [[Melrose Abbey]] apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national call-up. Bruce pledged that, henceforth, he would \"never again\" require the monks to serve unless it was to \"the common army of the whole realm\", for national defence. Bruce also married his second wife that year, [[Elizabeth de Burgh]], the daughter of [[Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster]]. By Elizabeth he had four children: [[David II of Scotland|David II]], John (died in childhood), Matilda (who married Thomas Isaac and died at Aberdeen 20 July 1353), and Margaret (who married [[William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland]] in 1345).\n\nIn 1303, Edward invaded again, reaching [[Edinburgh]] before marching to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]. Edward stayed in Perth until July, then proceeded via [[Dundee]], [[Brechin]], and [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] to [[Aberdeen]], where he arrived in August. From there he marched through [[Moray]] to [[Badenoch]] before re-tracing his path back south to [[Dunfermline]]. With the country now under submission, all the leading Scots, except for William Wallace, surrendered to Edward in February 1304. John Comyn, who was by now Guardian again, submitted to Edward. The laws and liberties of Scotland were to be as they had been in the days of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of King Edward and the advice of the Scots nobles.\n\nOn 11 June 1304, Bruce and William Lamberton made a pact that bound them, each to the other, in \"friendship and alliance against all men.\" If one should break the secret pact, he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds. The pact is often interpreted{{by whom|date=July 2015}} as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the English. Homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs, and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the English parliament to establish rules for the governance of Scotland. The [[Earl of Richmond]], Edward's nephew, was to head up the subordinate government of Scotland. While all this took place, William Wallace was finally captured near [[Glasgow]], and he was hanged, drawn, and quartered in London on 23 August 1305.\n\nIn September 1305, Edward ordered Robert Bruce to put his [[Kildrummy Castle|castle at Kildrummy]], \"in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for,\" suggesting that King Edward suspected Robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back. However, an identical phrase appears in an agreement between Edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend, [[Aymer de Valence]]. A further sign of Edward's distrust occurred on 10 October 1305, when Edward revoked his gift of Sir Gilbert de Umfraville's lands to Bruce that he had made only six months before.<ref name=\"Scott 1982 72\">{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=72}}</ref>\n\nRobert Bruce as [[Earl of Carrick]], and now 7th [[Lord of Annandale]], held huge estates and property in Scotland and a barony and some minor properties in England, and a strong claim to the Scottish throne.\n\n===Murder of John Comyn===\n[[File:Death of Comyn.jpg|thumb|The killing of Comyn in the [[Greyfriars, Dumfries|Greyfriars church]] in Dumfries, as imagined by [[Henri F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux|Felix Philippoteaux]], a 19th-century illustrator]]\n\nBruce, like all his family, had a complete belief in his right to the throne. His ambition was further thwarted by [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]], who supported John Balliol. Comyn was the most powerful noble in Scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within Scotland and England, including relatives that held the earldoms of Buchan, Mar, Ross, Fife, Angus, Dunbar, and Strathearn; the Lordships of Kilbride, Kirkintilloch, Lenzie, Bedrule, and Scraesburgh; and sheriffdoms in Banff, Dingwall, Wigtown, and Aberdeen. He also had a powerful claim to the Scottish throne through his descent from [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald III]] on his father's side and [[David I of Scotland|David I]] on his mother's side. Comyn was the nephew of [[John Balliol]].\n\nAccording to Barbour and Fordoun, in the late summer of 1305, in a secret agreement sworn, signed, and sealed, John Comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the Scottish throne in favour of Robert Bruce upon receipt of the Bruce lands in Scotland should an uprising occur led by Bruce.<ref>Fordun, ''Scotichronicon'', p. 330; Barbour, ''The Bruce'', p. 13.</ref> Whether the details of the agreement with Comyn are correct or not, King Edward moved to arrest Bruce while Bruce was still at the English court. [[Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer|Ralph de Monthermer]] learned of Edward's intention and warned Bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs. Bruce took the hint, and he and a squire fled the English court during the night. They made their way quickly for Scotland.<ref name=\"Scott 1982 72\"/>\n\nAccording to Barbour, Comyn betrayed his agreement with Bruce to King Edward I, and when Bruce arranged a meeting for 10 February 1306 with Comyn in the Chapel of [[Greyfriars, Dumfries|Greyfriars]] Monastery in [[Dumfries]] and accused him of treachery, they came to blows.<ref>Barbour, ''The Bruce'', p. 15.</ref> Bruce stabbed Comyn before the high altar. The [[Scotichronicon]] says that on being told that Comyn had survived the attack and was being treated, two of Bruce's supporters, [[Roger de Kirkpatrick]] (uttering the words \"I mak siccar\" (\"I make sure\")) and John Lindsay, went back into the church and finished Bruce's work. Barbour, however, tells no such story. The Flores Historiarum which was written c. 1307 says Bruce and Comyn disagreed and Bruce drew his sword and struck Comyn over the head. Bruce supporters then ran up and stabbed Comyn with their swords.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flores Historiarum |url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/1307bruce.asp}}</ref> Bruce asserted his claim to the Scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of Scotland.\n\nBruce and his party then attacked Dumfries Castle where the English garrison surrendered. Bruce hurried from Dumfries to Glasgow, where his friend and supporter Bishop Robert Wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to Bruce.<ref>{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=74}}</ref> Nonetheless, Bruce was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for this crime.<ref>[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] 17 May 2006.</ref>\n\n==Early reign (1306\u20131314)==\n\n===War of Robert the Bruce===\n[[File:Robert The Bruce Crowned King of Scots.jpg|thumb|230px|Bruce crowned King of Scots; modern tableau at Edinburgh Castle]]\nSix weeks after Comyn was killed in Dumfries, Bruce was crowned King of Scots by [[Bishop William de Lamberton]] at [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]], near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], on [[Palm Sunday]]<ref name=battle>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js5mfeOdl3A \"Battle of Bannockburn 1314 Line of Fire\" History Channel]</ref> 25 March 1306 with all formality and solemnity.

The great banner of the kings of Scotland was planted behind Bruce's throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Scott|1982|p=75}}</ref>\n\n[[Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan]] and wife of [[John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan]] (a cousin of the murdered John Comyn) arrived the next day, too late for the coronation. She claimed the right of her family, the MacDuff [[Earl of Fife]], to crown the Scottish king for her brother, [[Donnchadh IV, Earl of Fife]], who was not yet of age, and in English hands. So a second coronation was held and once more the crown was placed on the brow of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, Lord of Annandale, [[King of the Scots]].\n\nIn June 1306 Bruce was defeated at the [[Battle of Methven]]. His wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to Kildrummy in August 1306 under the protection of Bruce's brother, [[Nigel de Brus|Neil Bruce]], and the [[Earl of Atholl]] and most of his remaining men.<ref name=\"Scott 1982 84\u201385\">{{harvnb|Scott|1982|pp=84\u201385}}</ref> Bruce fled with a small following of his most faithful men, including [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]] and [[Gilbert II de la Hay|Gilbert Hay]], Bruce's brothers [[Thomas de Brus|Thomas]], [[Alexander de Brus|Alexander]], and [[Edward Bruce|Edward]], as well as Sir [[Niall mac Cailein|Neil Campbell]] and the [[Earl of Lennox]].<ref name=\"Scott 1982 84\u201385\"/>\n\nA strong force under Edward, Prince of Wales, captured Kildrummy Castle on 13 September taking prisoner the King's youngest brother, Nigel de Bruce, as well as Robert Boyd and Alexander Lindsay, and Sir Simon Fraser. Boyd managed to escape but both Nigel de Bruce and Lindsay were executed shortly after at Berwick following King Edward's orders to execute all followers of Robert de Bruce. Fraser was taken to London to suffer the same fate. Shortly before the fall of Kildrummy Castle, the Earl of Athol made a desperate attempt to take Queen Elizabeth de Burgh, Margery de Bruce, as well as King Robert's sisters and Isabella of Fife. They were betrayed a few days later and also fell into English hands, Atholl to be executed in London and the women to be held under the harshest possible circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barron |first1=Evan MacLeod |title=The Scottish War of Independence |date=1997 |publisher=Barnes & Noble Books |page=246}}</ref>\nEdward I marched north again in the spring. On his way, he granted the Scottish estates of Bruce and his adherents to his own followers and had published a bill excommunicating Bruce.\n\nOn 7 July 1307, King Edward I died, leaving Bruce opposed by the king's son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]].\n[[File:At night when they gathered round the watch-fires, the king would read stories of the old books.jpg|thumb|Bruce reading stories to his followers; from a 19th-century Scottish history book]]\nIt is still uncertain where Bruce spent the winter of 1306\u201307. Most likely he spent it in the [[Hebrides]], possibly sheltered by [[Christina of the Isles]]. The latter was married to a member of the [[Mar kindred]], a family to which Bruce was related (not only was his first wife a member of this family but her brother, [[Gartnait, Earl of Mar|Gartnait]], was married to a sister of Bruce). Ireland is also a serious possibility, and [[Orkney]] (under Norwegian rule at the time) or Norway proper (where his sister [[Isabel Bruce]] was queen dowager) are unlikely but not impossible.<ref>Traquair, Peter ''Freedom's Sword'' pp. 139-140</ref> Bruce and his followers returned to the Scottish mainland in February in two groups. One, led by Bruce and his brother [[Edward Bruce|Edward]], landed at [[Turnberry Castle]] and began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] in south-west Scotland. The other, led by his brothers Thomas and Alexander, landed slightly further south in [[Loch Ryan]], but they were soon captured and executed. In April, Bruce won a small victory over the English at the [[Battle of Glen Trool]], before defeating [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], at the [[Battle of Loudoun Hill]]. At the same time, James Douglas made his first foray for Bruce into south-western Scotland, attacking and burning his own castle in Douglasdale. Leaving his brother Edward in command in [[Galloway]], Bruce travelled north, capturing [[Inverlochy Castle|Inverlochy]] and [[Urquhart Castle|Urquhart]] Castles, burning to the ground [[Inverness Castle]] and [[Nairn]], then unsuccessfully threatening [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].\n\nTransferring operations to [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]] in late 1307, he threatened [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] before falling seriously ill, probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign. Recovering, leaving [[John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan]] unsubdued at his rear, Bruce returned west to take [[Balvenie Castle|Balvenie]] and [[Duffus Castle|Duffus]] Castles, then Tarradale Castle on the [[Black Isle]]. Looping back via the hinterlands of Inverness and a second failed attempt to take Elgin, Bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of Comyn at the [[Battle of Inverurie (1308)|Battle of Inverurie]] in May 1308; he then overran Buchan and defeated the English garrison at [[Aberdeen]]. The [[Harrying of Buchan]] in 1308 was ordered by Bruce to make sure all Comyn family support was extinguished. Buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern Scotland, and much of its population was loyal to the Comyn family even after the defeat of the Earl of Buchan. Most of the Comyn castles in Moray, Aberdeen and Buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed. In less than a year Bruce had swept through the north and destroyed the power of the Comyns who had held vice-regal power in the north for nearly one hundred years. How this dramatic success was achieved, especially the taking   of northern castles so quickly, is difficult to understand. Bruce lacked siege weapons and it's unlikely his army had substantially greater numbers or was better armed than his opponents. The morale and leadership of the Comyns and their northern allies appeared to be inexplicably lacking in the face of their direst challenge. He then crossed to [[Argyll]] and defeated the isolated MacDougalls (allies of the Comyns) at the [[Battle of Pass of Brander]] and took [[Dunstaffnage Castle]], the last major stronghold of the Comyns and their allies.<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|p=444}}</ref> Bruce then ordered harryings in Argyle and Kintyre, in the territories of [[Clan MacDougall]]\n\nIn March 1309, Bruce held his first parliament at [[St. Andrews]] and by August he controlled all of Scotland north of the [[River Tay]]. The following year, the clergy of Scotland recognised Bruce as king at a general council. The support given him by the church, in spite of his excommunication, was of great political importance. On 1 October 1310 Bruce wrote [[Edward II of England]] from Kildrum<ref>{{cite web|title=Dumbarton Sheet XXVI.1 (Cumbernauld) 1864 map|url=http://maps.nls.uk/geo/find/index.cfm#zoom=14&lat=55.9535&lon=-3.9670&layers=7&b=1&point=55.9572,-3.9877|website=National Library of Scotland|publisher=O.S.|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> in [[Cumbernauld]] Parish in an unsuccessful attempt to establish peace between Scotland and England.<ref>{{cite web|title=Letter from Robert the Bruce to Edward II reveals power struggle in the build-up to Bannockburn|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2013/june/headline_279405_en.html|website=University of Glasgow|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> Over the next three years, one English-held castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced: [[Linlithgow]] in 1310, [[Dumbarton]] in 1311, and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], by Bruce himself, in January 1312. Bruce also made raids into northern England and, landing at Ramsey in the [[Isle of Man]], laid siege to [[Castle Rushen]] in Castletown, capturing it on 21 June 1313 and denying the English the island's strategic importance.\n\nThe eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the English on even ground have caused many to consider Bruce one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age.

Bruce also drove back a subsequent English expedition north of the border and launched raids into [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. Buoyed by his military successes, Bruce's forces also invaded Ireland in 1315, in an attempt to free the country from English rule (having received a reply to offers of assistance from Domhnall \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, king of [[T\u00edr Eoghain]]), and to open a second front in the continuing wars with England. Bruce was even crowned as [[High King of Ireland]] in 1316. Robert later went there with another army to assist his brother.\n\nIn conjunction with the invasion, Bruce popularised an ideological vision of a \"Pan-Gaelic Greater Scotia\" with his lineage ruling over both Ireland and Scotland. This propaganda campaign was aided by two factors. The first was his marriage alliance from 1302 with the de Burgh family of the [[Earldom of Ulster]] in Ireland; second, Bruce himself, on his mother's side of Carrick, was descended from Gaelic royalty in Scotland as well as Ireland. Bruce's Irish ancestors included [[Aoife MacMurrough|Aoife of Leinster]] (d.1188), whose ancestors included [[Brian Boru]] of [[Munster]] and the [[List of Kings of Leinster|kings of Leinster]]. Thus, lineally and geopolitically, Bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pan-Gaelic alliance between Scottish-Irish Gaelic populations, under his kingship. This is revealed by a letter he sent to the Irish chiefs, where he calls the Scots and Irish collectively ''nostra nacio'' (our nation), stressing the common language, customs and heritage of the two peoples:\n\n{{quote|Whereas we and you and our people and your people, free since ancient times, share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom, we have sent you our beloved kinsman, the bearers of this letter, to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you, so that with God's will our nation (''nostra nacio'') may be able to recover her ancient liberty.}}\n\nThe diplomacy worked to a certain extent, at least in Ulster, where the Scots had some support. The Irish chief, Domhnall \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, for instance, later justified his support for the Scots to [[Pope John XXII]] by saying \"the Kings of Lesser Scotia all trace their blood to our ''Greater Scotia'' and retain to some degree our language and customs.\"<ref>Remonstrance of the Irish Chiefs to Pope John XXII, p. 46.</ref>\n\nThe Bruce campaign in Ireland was characterised by some initial military success. However, the Scots failed to win over the non-Ulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island, where people couldn't see the difference between English and Scottish occupation. Eventually it was defeated when Edward Bruce was killed at the [[Battle of Faughart]]. The Irish Annals of the period described the defeat of the Bruces by the English as one of the greatest things ever done for the Irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the Irish by both the Scots and the English.<ref>The Annals of Connacht.</ref>\n\n==Later reign (1320\u20131329)==\n[[File:Declaration of Arbroath statue (geograph 695366).jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of [[:Bernard de Linton]] and Robert raising the Declaration. ]]\n\nThe reign of Robert Bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements. The [[Declaration of Arbroath]] of 1320 strengthened his position, particularly in relation to the [[Papacy]], and [[Pope John XXII]] eventually lifted Bruce's excommunication. In May 1328 King [[Edward III of England]] signed the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]], which recognised Scotland as an independent kingdom, and Bruce as its king.\n\nIn 1325 Robert I exchanged lands at [[Cardross, Argyll|Cardross]] for those of [[Montrose, Angus|Old Montrose]] in [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] with Sir David Graham.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|pp=260\u201361}}</ref> It was to be here that Robert would build the manor house that would serve as his favoured residence during the final years of his reign. The extant chamberlain's accounts for 1328 detail a manor house at Cardross with king's and queen's chambers and glazed windows, a chapel, kitchens, bake- and brew-houses, falcon [[aviary]], medicinal garden, gatehouse, protective [[moat]] and a hunting park. There was also a [[jetty]] and beaching area for the 'king's coble' (for fishing) alongside the 'king's great ship'.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=261}}</ref>{{refn|The exact location of Cardross manor house is uncertain.

Before Cardross became habitable in 1327, Robert's main residence had been [[Scone Abbey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=391}}</ref>\n\nRobert had been suffering from a serious illness from at least 1327.

The earliest mention of this illness is to be found in an original letter written by an eye-witness in [[Ulster]] at the time the king made a truce with Sir Henry Mandeville on 12 July 1327. The writer of this letter reported that Robert was so feeble and struck down by illness that he would not live, 'for he can scarcely move anything but his tongue'.<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 444\"/> Barbour writes of the king's illness that 'it began through a benumbing brought on by his cold lying', during the months of wandering from 1306 to 1309.<ref name=\"Barrow 2005 445\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2005|p=445}}</ref> It has been proposed that, alternatively, he may have suffered from [[eczema]], [[tuberculosis]], [[syphilis]], [[motor neurone disease]], [[cancer]] or a series of [[stroke]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=400}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Robert the Bruce and Leprosy |author=Kaufman MH, MacLennan WJ |work=History of Dentistry Research Newsletter |date=1 April 2001 |accessdate=24 September 2012 |url=http://www.historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2001Apr5.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201191517/http://historyofdentistry.co.uk/index_htm_files/2001Apr5.pdf |archivedate=1 February 2013  }}</ref> There does not seem to be any evidence as to what the king himself or his physicians believed his illness to be.

Apart from failing to fulfill a vow to undertake a [[Crusades|crusade]] he died utterly fulfilled, in that the goal of his lifetime's struggle\u2014untrammelled recognition of the Bruce right to the crown\u2014had been realised, and confident that he was leaving the kingdom of Scotland safely in the hands of his most trusted lieutenant, Moray, until his infant son reached adulthood.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 271\">{{harvnb|Macnamee|2006|p=271}}</ref> Six days after his death, to complete his triumph still further, [[papal bull]]s were issued granting the privilege of [[unction]] at the [[coronation]] of future Kings of Scots.<ref name=\"Macnamee 2006 271\"/>\n\nIt remains unclear just what caused the death of Robert, a month before his fifty-fifth birthday. Contemporary accusations that Robert suffered from leprosy, the \"unclean sickness\"\u2014the present-day, treatable [[leprosy|Hansen's disease]]\u2014derived from English and Hainault chroniclers. None of the Scottish accounts of his death hint at leprosy. Penman states that it is very difficult to accept the notion of Robert as a functioning king serving in war, performing face-to-face acts of lordship, holding parliament and court, travelling widely and fathering several children, all while displaying the infectious symptoms of a leper.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|pp=302\u201303}}</ref> Along with suggestions of eczema, tuberculosis, syphilis, [[motor neurone disease]], cancer or stroke, a diet of rich court food has also been suggested as a possible contributory factor in Robert's death. His Milanese physician, [[Maino De Maineri]], did criticise the king's eating of [[eel]]s as dangerous to his health in advancing years.<ref>{{harvnb|Penman|2014|p=304}}</ref>\n\nA team of researchers, headed by Professor Andrew Nelson from [[University of Western Ontario]] have determined that Robert the Bruce did not have leprosy. They examined the original casting of the skull belonging to Robert the Bruce's descendant Lord Andrew Douglas Alexander Thomas Bruce, and a foot bone that had not been re-interred. They determined that skull and foot bone showed no signs of leprosy, such as an eroded nasal spine and a pencilling of the foot bone.<ref>{{cite web|last1=University|first1=Department of Communications and Public Affairs, Western|title= A rumour at rest: Western researcher clears a king's reputation|url=http://news.westernu.ca/2017/02/rumour-rest-western-researcher-clears-kings-reputation/|website=Western News|accessdate=2 March 2017|date=16 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Burial===\nThe king's body was [[embalming|embalmed]], and his [[sternum]] sawn open to allow extraction of the heart, which [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]] placed in a silver casket to be worn on a chain around his neck, with Sir [[Simon Locard]] holding the key.

A canopy chapel or 'hearse' of imported Baltic wood was erected over the grave.

According to John Barbour, Douglas and his companions, including [[Sir William de Keith]], Sir [[Kenneth Moir]], Sir [[Simon Locard]], Sir William de St. Clair and John de St. Clair of [[Roslin, Midlothian|Rosslyn]] and the brothers Sir Robert Logan of [[Restalrig]] and Sir Walter Logan, were welcomed cordially by King Alfonso. In August 1330 the Scots contingent formed part of the Castilian army besieging the frontier castle of [[Battle of Teba|Teba]]. Under circumstances which are still disputed, Sir James and most of his companions were killed. The sources all agree that, outnumbered and separated from the main Christian army, a group of Scots knights led by Douglas was overwhelmed and wiped out. The surviving members including Sir [[Simon Locard]] of the company recovered Douglas' body together with the casket containing Bruce's heart. The heart, together with Douglas' bones were brought back to Scotland.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn accordance with Bruce's written request, the heart was buried at [[Melrose Abbey]] in [[Roxburghshire]].<ref>Acts of Robert I, king of Scots, 1306\u20131329, ed.

At the last moment, Bruce swiftly dodged the lance, raised in his saddle, and with one mighty swing of his axe, struck Bohun so hard that he split de Bohun's iron helmet and his head in two, a blow so powerful that it shattered the very weapon into pieces.

''Sea of Love'' was a box-office success, grossing over $110 million.\n\n==Plot==\nNew York City homicide detective Frank Keller is a burned-out alcoholic. His wife left him and married one of his colleagues, and he is depressed about reaching his 20th year on the police force. He is assigned to investigate the murder of a man in [[Manhattan]], shot dead while face down in his bed, naked, listening to an old [[45rpm]] recording of \"[[Sea of Love (song)|Sea of Love]].\" Keller has three clues \u2014 a lipstick-smeared cigarette, a want-ad that the dead man placed in a newspaper, and fingerprints of the perpetrator.\n\nA second man dies in the same manner in [[Queens]]. Detective Sherman Touhey from the local precinct suggests that he and Frank collaborate. Both victims had placed rhyming ads in the lonely hearts column of the newspaper, seeking dates. The detectives track down Raymond Brown, the only other man with a rhyming ad. He's a married man who admits placing the ad but swears that he threw away all the letters and never saw anyone.  Frank gets an idea to place a rhyming ad in the paper, meet women who respond in a restaurant and take the prints from their drinking glasses. Frank's precinct chief is skeptical, but changes his mind when Brown turns up dead in the same manner as the other two murder victims.\n\nFrank has dinner with several women, while Sherman \u2014 posing as a waiter \u2014 puts their glasses into evidence bags. One woman, divorcee Helen Cruger, shows no interest in Frank and leaves without taking a drink, so Frank is unable to get her fingerprints. Frank bumps into her again at a market, but this time she is more friendly. Helen manages a chic upscale shoe store. Frank does not reveal his true occupation.\n\nFrank takes her to his place, against his better judgment and a warning from Sherman not to do so. They start getting passionate, but Frank panics after finding a gun in her purse and treats her roughly. Helen explains she keeps the starting pistol because she's been scared. Frank apologizes, and they have sex.\n\nFrank and Helen begin a romance. He has a chance to obtain Helen's fingerprints on a glass but decides to wipe the glass clean. Their relationship becomes strained when she discovers that he is a cop. One night when he is drunk, he nearly gives away the fact that Helen was involved in a sting. He starts to confess his feelings for her, but then discovers that she responded to each of the victims' ads. When he confronts her, Helen refuses to admit to anything, so he throws her out.\n\nMoments later, the real killer bursts into the apartment: Helen's ex-husband Terry, who has been stalking Helen and murdering the men she dates. At gunpoint, he makes Frank lie on his bed and show how he made love to Helen, just as he had done to his other victims before murdering them. Frank manages to overpower Terry and tries to call the police, but Terry  lunges at him and, in the ensuing struggle, Frank throws Terry through the bedroom window to his death.\n\nSeveral weeks later, a newly sober Frank meets Sherman in a bar and later reunites with Helen. She forgives him, and they resume their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Detective Frank Keller\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Helen Cruger\n* [[John Goodman]] as Detective Sherman Touhey\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Terry Cruger\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Frank Keller Sr.\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Gruber\n* [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]] as Precinct Chief\n* [[Michael O'Neill (actor)|Michael O'Neill]] as Raymond Brown\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Lorraine Bracco]] filmed scenes as Keller's ex-wife Denice, which were cut from the theatrical release print, but were restored for television versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2008/10/15/sea-of-love-1989/|title=Sea of Love (1989)|website=thisdistractedglobe.com|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref> [[Samuel L.

One woman, divorcee Helen Cruger, shows no interest in Frank and leaves without taking a drink, so Frank is unable to get her fingerprints. Frank bumps into her again at a market, but this time she is more friendly. Helen manages a chic upscale shoe store. Frank does not reveal his true occupation.\n\nFrank takes her to his place, against his better judgment and a warning from Sherman not to do so. They start getting passionate, but Frank panics after finding a gun in her purse and treats her roughly. Helen explains she keeps the starting pistol because she\u2019s been scared. Frank apologizes, and they have sex.\n\nFrank and Helen begin a romance. He has a chance to obtain Helen's fingerprints on a glass but decides to wipe the glass clean. Their relationship becomes strained when she discovers that he is a cop. One night when he is drunk, he nearly gives away the fact that Helen was involved in a sting. He starts to confess his feelings for her, but then discovers that she responded to each of the victims' ads. When he confronts her, Helen refuses to admit to anything, so he throws her out.\n\nMoments later, the real killer bursts into the apartment: Helen's ex-husband Terry, who has been stalking Helen and murdering the men she dates. At gunpoint, he makes Frank lie on his bed and show how he made love to Helen, just as he had done to his other victims before murdering them. Frank manages to overpower Terry and tries to call the police, but Terry  lunges at him and, in the ensuing struggle, Frank throws Terry through the bedroom window to his death.\n\nSeveral weeks later, a newly sober Frank meets Sherman in a bar and later reunites with Helen. She forgives him, and they resume their relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Detective Frank Keller\n* [[Ellen Barkin]] as Helen Cruger\n* [[John Goodman]] as Detective Sherman Touhey\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as Terry Cruger\n* [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]] as Frank Keller Sr.\n* [[Richard Jenkins]] as Gruber\n* [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]] as Precinct Chief\n* [[Michael O'Neill (actor)|Michael O'Neill]] as Raymond Brown\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Lorraine Bracco]] filmed scenes as Keller's ex-wife Denice, which were cut from the theatrical release print, but were restored for television versions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2008/10/15/sea-of-love-1989/|title=Sea of Love (1989)|website=thisdistractedglobe.com|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref> [[Samuel L.

Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent<!-- Note: the essential point is /abruptness/, not \"strength\". --> enough to propel objects and people into the air, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The [[seismicity]], or '''seismic activity''', of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word ''tremor'' is also used for [[Episodic tremor and slip|non-earthquake seismic rumbling]].\n\nAt the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the [[epicenter]] of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a [[tsunami]]. Earthquakes can also trigger [[landslide]]s and occasionally, volcanic activity.\n\nIn its most general sense, the word ''earthquake'' is used to describe any seismic event\u2014whether natural or caused by humans\u2014that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological [[Fault (geology)|faults]] but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and [[Underground nuclear testing|nuclear tests]]. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its [[hypocenter]] or focus. The [[epicenter]] is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.\n\n==Naturally occurring earthquakes==\n[[File:Fault types.svg|thumb|Three types of faults:<br />\nA. Strike-slip<br />\nB. Normal<br />\nC.

The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and [[Aseismic creep|aseismically]] only if there are no irregularities or [[Asperity (faults)|asperities]] along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of [[Stick-slip phenomenon|stick-slip behavior]]. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the [[Potential energy|stored energy]].<ref name=\"Ohnaka\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bp0gAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA234 | title=The Physics of Rock Failure and Earthquakes | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Ohnaka, M. | year=2013 | page=148 | isbn=978-1-107-35533-0}}</ref> This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] [[seismic waves]],<ref>Vassiliou, Marius and Hiroo Kanamori (1982): \u201cThe Energy Release in Earthquakes,\u201d Bull.

Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]] growth or is converted into heat generated by friction.

Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of [[Strike and dip|dip]] and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being [[Extensional tectonics|extended]] such as a [[divergent boundary]]. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being [[Thrust tectonics|shortened]] such as at a convergent boundary. [[Strike-slip fault]]s are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.\n\nReverse faults, particularly those along [[Convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]], are associated with the most powerful earthquakes, [[megathrust earthquake]]s, including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental [[Transform fault|transforms]], can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirtyfold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 30 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 900 times (30 \u00d7 30) more energy than a 5.0 magnitude of earthquake. An 8.6 magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs like those used in [[World War II]].<ref>Geoscience Australia</ref>\n\nThis is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wyss | first1 = M. | year = 1979 | title = Estimating expectable maximum magnitude of earthquakes from fault dimensions | url = | journal = Geology | volume = 7 | issue = 7| pages = 336\u2013340 |bibcode = 1979Geo.....7..336W |doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1979)7<336:EMEMOE>2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures.

The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the [[San Andreas Fault]] ([[1857 Fort Tejon earthquake|1857]], [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906]]), the [[North Anatolian Fault]] in Turkey ([[1939 Erzincan earthquake|1939]]), and the [[Denali Fault]] in Alaska ([[2002 Denali earthquake|2002]]), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.\n\n[[File:Kluft-photo-Carrizo-Plain-Nov-2007-Img 0327.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photo of the San Andreas Fault in the [[Carrizo Plain]], northwest of Los Angeles]]\n\nThe most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20.

In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (''greatest'' principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass \"escapes\" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass up, and thus, the overburden equals the ''least'' principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions.\n\n===Earthquakes away from plate boundaries===\n{{main|Intraplate earthquake}}\n[[File:Tremor(English).gif|thumb|Comparison of the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|1985]] and [[2017 Puebla earthquake|2017]] earthquakes on Mexico City, Puebla and Michoac\u00e1n/Guerrero]]\nWhere plate boundaries occur within the [[Continental crust|continental lithosphere]], deformation is spread out over a much larger area than the plate boundary itself. In the case of the [[San Andreas fault]] continental transform, many earthquakes occur away from the plate boundary and are related to strains developed within the broader zone of deformation caused by major irregularities in the fault trace (e.g., the \"Big bend\" region). The [[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge earthquake]] was associated with movement on a blind thrust within such a zone. Another example is the strongly oblique convergent plate boundary between the [[Arabian plate|Arabian]] and [[Eurasian plate]]s where it runs through the northwestern part of the [[Zagros Mountains]]. The deformation associated with this plate boundary is partitioned into nearly pure thrust sense movements perpendicular to the boundary over a wide zone to the southwest and nearly pure strike-slip motion along the Main Recent Fault close to the actual plate boundary itself.

The scale of the nucleation zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than {{cvt|100|m||}} while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the nucleation involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion make it very difficult to record information close to a nucleation zone.<ref name=\"NRS\"/>\n\nRupture propagation is generally modeled using a [[fracture mechanics]] approach, likening the rupture to a propagating mixed mode shear crack. The rupture velocity is a function of the fracture energy in the volume around the crack tip, increasing with decreasing fracture energy. The velocity of rupture propagation is orders of magnitude faster than the displacement velocity across the fault. Earthquake ruptures typically propagate at velocities that are in the range 70\u201390% of the S-wave velocity, which is independent of earthquake size. A small subset of earthquake ruptures appear to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These [[supershear earthquake]]s have all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of coseismic damage caused by the [[2001 Kunlun earthquake]] has been attributed to the effects of the [[sonic boom]] developed in such earthquakes. Some earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities and are referred to as [[slow earthquake]]s. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the [[tsunami earthquake]], observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the [[1896 Sanriku earthquake]].<ref name=\"NRS\">{{cite book|last=National Research Council (U.S.).

An aftershock is in the same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. If an aftershock is larger than the main shock, the aftershock is redesignated as the main shock and the original main shock is redesignated as a [[foreshock]]. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced [[Fault (geology)|fault plane]] adjusts to the effects of the main shock.<ref name=WAAFEC/>\n\n====Earthquake swarms====\n{{Main|Earthquake swarm}}\nEarthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of [[aftershock]]s by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, so none has a notable higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at [[Yellowstone National Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/2004/Apr04Swarm.html|title=Earthquake Swarms at Yellowstone|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook [[Southern California]]'s [[Imperial Valley]], showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=Quake 'swarm' shakes Southern California|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/26/us/california-quake-swarm/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nSometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an ''earthquake storm'', where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or [[coulomb stress transfer|stress redistribution]] of the previous earthquakes. Similar to [[aftershock]]s but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the [[North Anatolian Fault]] in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Poseidon's Horses: Plate Tectonics and Earthquake Storms in the Late Bronze Age Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | year = 2000 | author = Amos Nur | issn = 0305-4403 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 43\u201363 | url = http://water.stanford.edu/nur/EndBronzeage.pdf | doi = 10.1006/jasc.1999.0431 | last2 = Cline | first2 = Eric H. | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090325050459/http://water.stanford.edu/nur/EndBronzeage.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-25 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2003/earthquakestorms.shtml | title = Earthquake Storms | work = [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] | date = 1 April 2003 | accessdate = 2007-05-02 }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Magnitude}}Intensity of earth quaking and magnitude of earthquakes==\nQuaking or shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon undoubtedly known to humans from earliest times. Prior to the development of [[accelerograph|strong-motion accelerometers]] that can measure peak ground speed and acceleration directly, the intensity of the earth-shaking was estimated on the basis of the observed effects, as categorized on various [[seismic intensity scales]]. Only in the last century has the source of such shaking been identified as ruptures in the Earth's crust, with the intensity of shaking at any locality dependent not only on the local ground conditions but also on the strength or ''magnitude'' of the rupture, and on its distance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Seismic magnitude scales#Richter|first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes]] was developed by [[Charles F. Richter]] in 1935. Subsequent scales (see [[seismic magnitude scales]]) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chung|Bernreuter|1980|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as \"Richter magnitude\" or \"Richter scale\", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the [[seismic scale#Mw|moment magnitude]] scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake.<ref>The USGS policy for reporting magnitudes to the press was posted at [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/aboutus/docs/020204mag_policy.php USGS policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504144754/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/aboutus/docs/020204mag_policy.php |date=2016-05-04 }}, but has been removed.

It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. [[Seismic waves]] travel through the [[Earth's interior]] and can be recorded by [[seismometer]]s at great distances. The [[surface wave magnitude]] was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The [[moment magnitude scale]] not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the [[seismic moment]] (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale]], the [[Medvedev\u2013Sponheuer\u2013Karnik scale]], and the [[Mercalli intensity scale]] are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.\n\nEvery tremor produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities:\n* Longitudinal [[P-waves]] (shock- or pressure waves)\n* Transverse [[S-waves]] (both body waves)\n* [[Surface wave]]s \u2013 ([[Rayleigh wave|Rayleigh]] and [[Love wave|Love]] waves)\n[[Propagation velocity]] of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. {{Convert|3|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}} up to {{Convert|13|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}}, depending on the [[density]] and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the [[epicentre|epicenter]] to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of quakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the [[hypocenter]] can be computed roughly.\n\nIn the upper crust, P-waves travel in the range {{Convert|2-3|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second (or lower) in soils and unconsolidated sediments, increasing to {{Convert|3-6|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second in solid rock. In the lower crust, they travel at about {{Convert|6-7|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second; the velocity increases within the deep mantle to about {{Convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second. The velocity of S-waves ranges from {{Convert|2-3|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second in light sediments and {{Convert|4-5|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second in the Earth's crust up to {{Convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second in the deep mantle. As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle.\n\nOn average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S-wave '''times 8'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/PamelaSpiegel.shtml |title=Speed of Sound through the Earth |publisher=Hypertextbook.com |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analyses of seismograms the Earth's core was located in 1913 by [[Beno Gutenberg]].\n\nS-waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P-waves. P-waves squeeze and expand material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S-waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsela.com/articles/govt-science-earthquakes/id/26756/|title=Newsela {{!}} The science of earthquakes|website=newsela.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>\n\nEarthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur.

Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as [[dams]], bridges, and [[nuclear power stations]] and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_49/Documents/note_49.pdf|title=Guidelines for evaluating the hazard of surface fault rupture, California Geological Survey|publisher=California Department of Conservation|year=2002|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009065422/http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_49/Documents/note_49.pdf|archivedate=2009-10-09|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Soil liquefaction===\n{{Main|Soil liquefaction}}\nSoil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated [[granular]] material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a [[solid]] to a [[liquid]].

Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent<!-- Note: the essential point is /abruptness/, not \"strength\". --> enough to propel objects and people into the air, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The [[seismicity]], or '''seismic activity''', of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The word ''tremor'' is also used for [[Episodic tremor and slip|non-earthquake seismic rumbling]].\n\nAt the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground. When the [[epicenter]] of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a [[tsunami]]. Earthquakes can also trigger [[landslide]]s and occasionally, volcanic activity.\n\nIn its most general sense, the word ''earthquake'' is used to describe any seismic event\u2014whether natural or caused by humans\u2014that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological [[Fault (geology)|faults]] but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and [[Underground nuclear testing|nuclear tests]]. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its [[hypocenter]] or focus. The [[epicenter]] is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.\n\n==Naturally occurring earthquakes==\n[[File:Fault types.svg|thumb|Three types of faults:<br />\nA. Strike-slip<br />\nB. Normal<br />\nC. Reverse\n]]\n\nTectonic earthquakes occur anywhere in the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a [[Fault (geology)|fault plane]]. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and [[Aseismic creep|aseismically]] only if there are no irregularities or [[Asperity (faults)|asperities]] along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of [[Stick-slip phenomenon|stick-slip behavior]]. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the [[Potential energy|stored energy]].<ref name=\"Ohnaka\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bp0gAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA234 | title=The Physics of Rock Failure and Earthquakes | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Ohnaka, M. | year=2013 | page=148 | isbn=978-1-107-35533-0}}</ref> This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] [[seismic waves]],<ref>Vassiliou, Marius and Hiroo Kanamori (1982): \u201cThe Energy Release in Earthquakes,\u201d Bull.

This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the [[elastic-rebound theory]].

Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]] growth or is converted into heat generated by friction.

Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of [[Strike and dip|dip]] and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being [[Extensional tectonics|extended]] such as a [[divergent boundary]]. Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being [[Thrust tectonics|shortened]] such as at a convergent boundary. [[Strike-slip fault]]s are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip.\n\nReverse faults, particularly those along [[Convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]], are associated with the most powerful earthquakes, [[megathrust earthquake]]s, including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental [[Transform fault|transforms]], can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirtyfold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 30 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 900 times (30 \u00d7 30) more energy than a 5.0 magnitude of earthquake. An 8.6 magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs like those used in [[World War II]].<ref>Geoscience Australia</ref>\n\nThis is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wyss | first1 = M. | year = 1979 | title = Estimating expectable maximum magnitude of earthquakes from fault dimensions | url = | journal = Geology | volume = 7 | issue = 7| pages = 336\u2013340 |bibcode = 1979Geo.....7..336W |doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1979)7<336:EMEMOE>2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures.

The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the [[San Andreas Fault]] ([[1857 Fort Tejon earthquake|1857]], [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906]]), the [[North Anatolian Fault]] in Turkey ([[1939 Erzincan earthquake|1939]]), and the [[Denali Fault]] in Alaska ([[2002 Denali earthquake|2002]]), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.\n\n[[File:Kluft-photo-Carrizo-Plain-Nov-2007-Img 0327.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photo of the San Andreas Fault in the [[Carrizo Plain]], northwest of Los Angeles]]\n\nThe most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20.

In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (''greatest'' principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass \"escapes\" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass up, and thus, the overburden equals the ''least'' principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions.\n\n===Earthquakes away from plate boundaries===\n{{main|Intraplate earthquake}}\n[[File:Tremor(English).gif|thumb|Comparison of the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|1985]] and [[2017 Puebla earthquake|2017]] earthquakes on Mexico City, Puebla and Michoac\u00e1n/Guerrero]]\nWhere plate boundaries occur within the [[Continental crust|continental lithosphere]], deformation is spread out over a much larger area than the plate boundary itself. In the case of the [[San Andreas fault]] continental transform, many earthquakes occur away from the plate boundary and are related to strains developed within the broader zone of deformation caused by major irregularities in the fault trace (e.g., the \"Big bend\" region). The [[1994 Northridge earthquake|Northridge earthquake]] was associated with movement on a blind thrust within such a zone. Another example is the strongly oblique convergent plate boundary between the [[Arabian plate|Arabian]] and [[Eurasian plate]]s where it runs through the northwestern part of the [[Zagros Mountains]]. The deformation associated with this plate boundary is partitioned into nearly pure thrust sense movements perpendicular to the boundary over a wide zone to the southwest and nearly pure strike-slip motion along the Main Recent Fault close to the actual plate boundary itself.

The scale of the nucleation zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than {{cvt|100|m||}} while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the nucleation involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion make it very difficult to record information close to a nucleation zone.<ref name=\"NRS\"/>\n\nRupture propagation is generally modeled using a [[fracture mechanics]] approach, likening the rupture to a propagating mixed mode shear crack. The rupture velocity is a function of the fracture energy in the volume around the crack tip, increasing with decreasing fracture energy. The velocity of rupture propagation is orders of magnitude faster than the displacement velocity across the fault. Earthquake ruptures typically propagate at velocities that are in the range 70\u201390% of the S-wave velocity, which is independent of earthquake size. A small subset of earthquake ruptures appear to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These [[supershear earthquake]]s have all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of coseismic damage caused by the [[2001 Kunlun earthquake]] has been attributed to the effects of the [[sonic boom]] developed in such earthquakes. Some earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities and are referred to as [[slow earthquake]]s. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the [[tsunami earthquake]], observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the [[1896 Sanriku earthquake]].<ref name=\"NRS\">{{cite book|last=National Research Council (U.S.).

An aftershock is in the same region of the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude. If an aftershock is larger than the main shock, the aftershock is redesignated as the main shock and the original main shock is redesignated as a [[foreshock]]. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced [[Fault (geology)|fault plane]] adjusts to the effects of the main shock.<ref name=WAAFEC/>\n\n====Earthquake swarms====\n{{Main|Earthquake swarm}}\nEarthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period of time. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of [[aftershock]]s by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock, so none has a notable higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at [[Yellowstone National Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/2004/Apr04Swarm.html|title=Earthquake Swarms at Yellowstone|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook [[Southern California]]'s [[Imperial Valley]], showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=Quake 'swarm' shakes Southern California|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/26/us/california-quake-swarm/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nSometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an ''earthquake storm'', where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or [[coulomb stress transfer|stress redistribution]] of the previous earthquakes. Similar to [[aftershock]]s but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, and with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the [[North Anatolian Fault]] in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Poseidon's Horses: Plate Tectonics and Earthquake Storms in the Late Bronze Age Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean | journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | year = 2000 | author = Amos Nur | issn = 0305-4403 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 43\u201363 | url = http://water.stanford.edu/nur/EndBronzeage.pdf | doi = 10.1006/jasc.1999.0431 | last2 = Cline | first2 = Eric H. | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090325050459/http://water.stanford.edu/nur/EndBronzeage.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-25 | df =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2003/earthquakestorms.shtml | title = Earthquake Storms | work = [[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] | date = 1 April 2003 | accessdate = 2007-05-02 }}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Magnitude}}Intensity of earth quaking and magnitude of earthquakes==\nQuaking or shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon undoubtedly known to humans from earliest times.

Only in the last century has the source of such shaking been identified as ruptures in the Earth's crust, with the intensity of shaking at any locality dependent not only on the local ground conditions but also on the strength or ''magnitude'' of the rupture, and on its distance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolt|1993}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Seismic magnitude scales#Richter|first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes]] was developed by [[Charles F.

It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. [[Seismic waves]] travel through the [[Earth's interior]] and can be recorded by [[seismometer]]s at great distances. The [[surface wave magnitude]] was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The [[moment magnitude scale]] not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the [[seismic moment]] (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale]], the [[Medvedev\u2013Sponheuer\u2013Karnik scale]], and the [[Mercalli intensity scale]] are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking.\n\nEvery tremor produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities:\n* Longitudinal [[P-waves]] (shock- or pressure waves)\n* Transverse [[S-waves]] (both body waves)\n* [[Surface wave]]s \u2013 ([[Rayleigh wave|Rayleigh]] and [[Love wave|Love]] waves)\n[[Propagation velocity]] of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. {{Convert|3|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}} up to {{Convert|13|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}}, depending on the [[density]] and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P-waves travel much faster than the S-waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the [[epicentre|epicenter]] to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of quakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the [[hypocenter]] can be computed roughly.\n\nIn the upper crust, P-waves travel in the range {{Convert|2-3|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second (or lower) in soils and unconsolidated sediments, increasing to {{Convert|3-6|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second in solid rock. In the lower crust, they travel at about {{Convert|6-7|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second; the velocity increases within the deep mantle to about {{Convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second. The velocity of S-waves ranges from {{Convert|2-3|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second in light sediments and {{Convert|4-5|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second in the Earth's crust up to {{Convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} per second in the deep mantle. As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle.\n\nOn average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S-wave '''times 8'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/PamelaSpiegel.shtml |title=Speed of Sound through the Earth |publisher=Hypertextbook.com |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analyses of seismograms the Earth's core was located in 1913 by [[Beno Gutenberg]].\n\nS-waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P-waves. P-waves squeeze and expand material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S-waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsela.com/articles/govt-science-earthquakes/id/26756/|title=Newsela {{!}} The science of earthquakes|website=newsela.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref>\n\nEarthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur.

This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the [[seismic]] motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and to effects of seismic energy focalization owing to typical geometrical setting of the deposits.\n\nGround rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as [[dams]], bridges, and [[nuclear power stations]] and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_49/Documents/note_49.pdf|title=Guidelines for evaluating the hazard of surface fault rupture, California Geological Survey|publisher=California Department of Conservation|year=2002|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009065422/http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_49/Documents/note_49.pdf|archivedate=2009-10-09|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Soil liquefaction===\n{{Main|Soil liquefaction}}\nSoil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated [[granular]] material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a [[solid]] to a [[liquid]].

After breaking Tommy's neck in a fight, Varla kidnaps and drugs Linda.\n\nIn a small desert town, they stop at a gas station where they see a wheelchair-bound old man and his muscular, dim-witted son. The gas station attendant tells the women that the old man was crippled in a railway accident, \u201cgoing nuts\" as a result, and that he received a large settlement of money that is hidden somewhere around his decrepit house in the desert. Intrigued, Varla hatches a scheme to rob the old man, and the three women follow him back to the ranch, with their captive in tow.\n\nAt the ranch they encounter the old man, his younger son (who they learn is called \"The Vegetable\" due to his [[feebleminded]]ness) and his elder son, Kirk. The group all have lunch together, and Billie taunts Rosie when Varla leaves with Kirk, hoping to seduce him into revealing the location of the money. Linda subsequently escapes the drunken Billie and runs away into the desert. The old man and the younger son pursue in their truck. The younger son catches Linda and seems about to assault her, but he collapses in tears as Varla and Kirk arrive. Kirk finally acknowledges his father's lecherous nature and the old man's hold over his younger brother, and he vows to have his younger brother institutionalized. He tries to take the hysterical Linda into town in the truck, but the old man says that he has thrown away the keys, and Kirk and Linda set out across the desert on foot.\n\nVarla drives back to the house and tells Billie and Rosie that they should kill the men and the girl to cover up Linda's kidnapping and the murder of her boyfriend. Billie refuses, but as she walks away, Varla throws a knife into her back just as the old man and his younger son arrive. Rosie and Varla hit the old man with their car, killing him and knocking over his wheelchair to reveal the money hidden inside. Rosie is stabbed and killed by the younger son while trying to retrieve the knife from Billie's body. Varla tries to ram him into a wall with her car, injuring him. She drives off in the truck and overtakes Kirk and Linda, chasing them into a [[gully]]. Varla and Kirk fight [[Hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand]]. She gets the better of him until Linda hits her with the truck, and she dies.

After breaking Tommy's neck in a fight, Varla kidnaps and drugs Linda.\n\nIn a small desert town, they stop at a gas station where they see a wheelchair-bound old man and his muscular, dim-witted son. The gas station attendant tells the women that the old man was crippled in a railway accident, \u201cgoing nuts\" as a result, and that he received a large settlement of money that is hidden somewhere around his decrepit house in the desert. Intrigued, Varla hatches a scheme to rob the old man, and the three women follow him back to the ranch, with their captive in tow.\n\nAt the ranch they encounter the old man, his younger son (who they learn is called \"The Vegetable\" due to his [[feebleminded]]ness) and his elder son, Kirk. The group all have lunch together, and Billie taunts Rosie when Varla leaves with Kirk, hoping to seduce him into revealing the location of the money. Linda subsequently escapes the drunken Billie and runs away into the desert. The old man and the younger son pursue in their truck. The younger son catches Linda and seems about to assault her, but he collapses in tears as Varla and Kirk arrive. Kirk finally acknowledges his father\u2019s lecherous nature and the old man\u2019s hold over his younger brother, and he vows to have his younger brother institutionalized. He tries to take the hysterical Linda into town in the truck, but the old man says that he has thrown away the keys, and Kirk and Linda set out across the desert on foot.\n\nVarla drives back to the house and tells Billie and Rosie that they should kill the men and the girl to cover up Linda\u2019s kidnapping and the murder of her boyfriend. Billie refuses, but as she walks away, Varla throws a knife into her back just as the old man and his younger son arrive. Rosie and Varla hit the old man with their car, killing him and knocking over his wheelchair to reveal the money hidden inside. Rosie is stabbed and killed by the younger son while trying to retrieve the knife from Billie's body. Varla tries to ram him into a wall with her car, injuring him. She drives off in the truck and overtakes Kirk and Linda, chasing them into a [[gully]]. Varla and Kirk fight [[Hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand]]. She gets the better of him until Linda hits her with the truck, and she dies.

CWA  has several affiliated subsidiary labor unions bringing total membership to over 700,000. CWA is headquartered in [[Washington, DC]], and affiliated with the [[AFL-CIO]], the [[Change to Win Federation]]<ref>Change to Win Website, July 2017 http://www.changetowin.org/about-us/</ref>, the [[Canadian Labour Congress]], and [[UNI Global Union]]. The current president is Chris Shelton.\n\n==History==\nIn 1918 telephone operators organized under the '''Telephone Operators Department''' of the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]]. While initially successful at organizing, the union was damaged by a 1923 strike and subsequent [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] lockout. After AT&T installed company-controlled Employees' Committees, the Telephone Operators Department eventually disbanded.<ref>Norwood, S: ''Labor's Flaming Youth'', page 302. University of Illinois Press, 1990.</ref>  The CWA's roots lie in the 1938 reorganization of telephone workers into the '''National Federation of Telephone Workers''' after the [[Wagner Act]] outlawed such employees' committees or \"[[company union]]s\". NFTW was a federation of sovereign local independent unions that lacked authority over the affiliated local unions leaving it at a serious organizational disadvantage. After losing [[1947 Telephone strike|a strike with AT&T in 1947]], the federation led by Joseph A. Beirne,<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Labor - Labor Hall of Honor - Joseph A.

CWA has continued to expand into areas beyond traditional telephone service. In 1994 the [[National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians]] merged with the CWA and became The Broadcasting and [[Cable Television]] Workers Sector of the CWA, NABET-CWA. Since 1997, it includes The [[Newspaper Guild]] (now renamed The NewsGuild-CWA).  In 2004, the [[Association of Flight Attendants]] merged with CWA, and became formally known as the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, or AFA-CWA.\n\n===Contracts and strikes===\nFollowing is a partial list of contracts and strikes that the Communications Workers of America were involved in:<ref>[http://www.cwa-union.org/about/timeline Communications Workers of America - Timeline] Accessed March 24, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.cwa3805.org/HistoryOfTheCWA.pdf CWA Local 3805 Timeline] Accessed March 24, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1990/01/art2full.pdf U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Monthly Labor Review - January, 1990] Accessed March 24, 2010.</ref>\n[[File:CWA union rat protest Verizon.jpg|thumb|right|An [[inflatable rat]] used by the CWA during a 2009 rally against [[Verizon]]]]\n[[File:Day 36 Occupy Wall Street October 21 2011 Shankbone 48.JPG|thumb|Verizon members protesting at [[Occupy Wall Street]] in October 2011]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=2%|Year !!width=20%|Company !!width=5%| Number of Members Affected !!width=1%| Duration of Strike !!width=40%| Notes\n|-\n|1955||[[Southern Bell|Southern Bell Telephone Co.]]||50,000||72 days||Strike was in answer to management's effort to prohibit workers from striking.\n|-\n|1968||[[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]||200,000||18 days||Wage increases to compensate for cost of living, and medical benefits won\n|-\n|1971||[[Bell System]]||400,000||9 months||Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) won for workers\n|-\n|1983||Bell System||600,000||22 days||Last contract with the Bell System before its breakup.

CWA  has several affiliated subsidiary labor unions bringing total membership to over 700,000. CWA is headquartered in [[Washington, DC]], and affiliated with the [[AFL-CIO]], the [[Change to Win Federation]]<ref>Change to Win Website, July 2017 http://www.changetowin.org/about-us/</ref>, the [[Canadian Labour Congress]], and [[UNI Global Union]]. The current president is Chris Shelton.\n\n==History==\nIn 1918 telephone operators organized under the '''Telephone Operators Department''' of the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers]]. While initially successful at organizing, the union was damaged by a 1923 strike and subsequent [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] lockout. After AT&T installed company-controlled Employees' Committees, the Telephone Operators Department eventually disbanded.<ref>Norwood, S: ''Labor's Flaming Youth'', page 302. University of Illinois Press, 1990.</ref>  The CWA's roots lie in the 1938 reorganization of telephone workers into the '''National Federation of Telephone Workers''' after the [[Wagner Act]] outlawed such employees' committees or \"company unions\". NFTW was a federation of sovereign local independent unions that lacked authority over the affiliated local unions leaving it at a serious organizational disadvantage. After losing [[1947 Telephone strike|a strike with AT&T in 1947]], the federation led by Joseph A. Beirne,<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Labor - Labor Hall of Honor - Joseph A.

CWA has continued to expand into areas beyond traditional telephone service. In 1994 the [[National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians]] merged with the CWA and became The Broadcasting and [[Cable Television]] Workers Sector of the CWA, NABET-CWA. Since 1997, it includes The [[Newspaper Guild]] (now renamed The NewsGuild-CWA).  In 2004, the [[Association of Flight Attendants]] merged with CWA, and became formally known as the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, or AFA-CWA.\n\n===Contracts and strikes===\nFollowing is a partial list of contracts and strikes that the Communications Workers of America were involved in:<ref>[http://www.cwa-union.org/about/timeline Communications Workers of America - Timeline] Accessed March 24, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.cwa3805.org/HistoryOfTheCWA.pdf CWA Local 3805 Timeline] Accessed March 24, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1990/01/art2full.pdf U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Monthly Labor Review - January, 1990] Accessed March 24, 2010.</ref>\n[[File:CWA union rat protest Verizon.jpg|thumb|right|An [[inflatable rat]] used by the CWA during a 2009 rally against [[Verizon]]]]\n[[File:Day 36 Occupy Wall Street October 21 2011 Shankbone 48.JPG|thumb|Verizon members protesting at [[Occupy Wall Street]] in October 2011]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!width=2%|Year !!width=20%|Company !!width=5%| Number of Members Affected !!width=1%| Duration of Strike !!width=40%| Notes\n|-\n|1955||[[Southern Bell|Southern Bell Telephone Co.]]||50,000||72 days||Strike was in answer to management's effort to prohibit workers from striking.\n|-\n|1968||[[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]]||200,000||18 days||Wage increases to compensate for cost of living, and medical benefits won\n|-\n|1971||[[Bell System]]||400,000||9 months||Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) won for workers\n|-\n|1983||Bell System||600,000||22 days||Last contract with the Bell System before its breakup.

{"title_page": "Partimento", "text_new": "'''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is an instructional bass line with either [[figured bass]] or [[unfigured bass]]. Partimenti were used mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries as pedagogical aids for the teaching of [[accompaniment||accompaniment]], [[counterpoint|counterpoint]], [[Musical composition|composition]], diminution practice, and [[musical improvisation|improvisation]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. Notable partimento collections were written by [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Francesco Durante]], [[Leonardo Leo]], [[Fedele Fenaroli]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Nicola Sala]], [[Giacomo Tritto]], [[Stanislao Mattei]], and [[Luigi Palmerini]]. Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]]. The rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== Consonance and Dissonance ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\n\n=== Compound Cadence ===\n\n=== Double Cadence ===\n\n== Rule of the Octave ==\n\n=== Major ===\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b d g>1 <c d fis> <b d g> <a e' g> <a d fis> <c c g'> <c d a'> <b d g>\t\t \n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g, a b c d e fis g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <6+ 4 3> <6 3 8> <5 3 6> <3 5 8> <6 3> <3 6 5/> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Ascending in G major.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <b d g>1 <a d a'> <a cis g'> <a d fis> <a d fis> <b d g> <c d fis> <b d g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4\n                g fis e d c b a g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <3 6 3> <3 6+ 4> <3 8 5> <4+ 2 6> <6 3 8> <6+ 4 3> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Descending in G major.\n\n=== Minor ===\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <bes d g>1 <c d fis> <bes d g> <a es' g> <a d fis> <c c g'> <c d a'> <bes d g>\t\t \n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4\n                g, a bes c d e fis g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <6+ 4 3> <6 3 8> <5 3 6> <3+ 8 5> <3 6> <3 6 5/> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Ascending in G minor.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c'' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4 \\tempo 1 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <bes d g>1 <a d a'> <a cis g'> <a d fis> <a d fis> <bes d g> <c d fis> <bes d g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key g \\minor \\time 4/4\n                g f es d c bes a g\n                }\n                \\new FiguredBass {\n                    \\figuremode {\n                       <8 5 3>1 <3 6 3> <3 6+ 4> <3+ 8 5> <4+ 2 6> <6 3 8> <6+ 4 3> <8 5 3>\n    }\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>Rule of the Octave Descending in G minor.\n\n== Function ==\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso).

The story focuses on Eun-yi, played by [[Jeon Do-yeon]], who becomes involved in a destructive love triangle while working as a housemaid for an upper-class family. Other cast members include [[Lee Jung-jae]], [[Seo Woo]] and [[Youn Yuh-jung]]. The film is a [[remake]] of [[Kim Ki-young]]'s 1960 film [[The Housemaid (1960 film)|of the same name]]. It competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''Housemaid'' Director Delights in Cannes Invitation|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=130000&biid=2010051958378|work=[[The Dong-a Ilbo]]|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=19 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a bustling city street, where a young woman commits suicide by jumping from a building ledge to her death. Eun-yi, who works as a worker in a restaurant, persuades her coworker and roommate to drive her to the scene of the suicide, and she stands distraught over the chalk outline where the woman's body had lain. The next morning, an older woman by the name of Byeong-sik visits her small apartment and later expresses interest in giving her a job.\n\nEun-yi is hired as an [[au pair]] for Hae-ra (pregnant with twins) and her rich husband Hoon. Eun-yi's primary task is watching the couple's young daughter, Nami.  Eun-yi is eager to connect to Nami, who gradually warms to her. Hoon begins to secretly flirt with Eun-yi, enticing her with glasses of wine and his piano playing, and they eventually begin a sexual relationship. Despite the affair, Eun-yi is still warm and friendly to Hoon's oblivious wife, Hae-ra; she even expresses enthusiasm and delight at the progress of Hae-ra's pregnancy.\n\nByeong-sik, aka \"Miss Cho\" (the other live-in maid, originally Hae-ra's childhood maid) witnesses Eun-yi and Hoon having sex. She tries to subtly pry details from Eun-yi, but Eun-yi brushes her off casually. Later, Miss Cho reveals her suspicion to Hae-ra's mother that Eun-yi is pregnant. Hae-ra's mother then visits the family and stages an \"accident,\" resulting in Eun-yi falling from a ladder positioned at the top of a set of stairs. Dangling from a chandelier, Eun-yi begs Hae-ra's mother to pull her over the railing. Hae-ra's mother does not oblige, and Eun-yi falls. Suffering only a [[concussion]], Eun-yi spends the night in the hospital.  During her stay, she learns that she is pregnant and contemplates [[abortion]]. Meanwhile, the affair is revealed to Hae-ra.\n\nHae-ra's mother, Mi-hee, instructs Hae-ra to ignore the affair; she insists that all wealthy husbands will eventually cheat and that if Hae-ra ignores it she can \"live like a queen.\" Later that night, Hae-ra stands over Eun-yi's bed with a golf club but is unable to strike the sleeping woman. The next day, Hae-ra and her mother confront Eun-yi, offering her $100,000 to have an abortion and leave. Hae-ra knows that Eun-yi would not abort her child \"for all the money in the world,\" so she takes matters into her own hands by poisoning the herbal medicine packets Eun-yi drinks every day.  Hae-ra goes to the hospital and delivers her twin sons. Hoon visits the hospital, where Hae-ra makes her ill will toward him known.  Furious, he returns home alone and finds Eun-yi in his bathtub. She reveals that she is pregnant and plans on keeping the baby.\n\nEun-yi succumbs to the effects of the poison, and Mi-hee arranges an abortion without Eun-yi's consent. After the abortion, Miss Cho reveals that she told Mi-hee about Eun-yi's pregnancy. Eun-yi is angry, but forgives Miss Cho and vows to get revenge on the family. After recovering from her abortion, Eun-yi sneaks into the house with Miss Cho's assistance. Hoon finds her [[breastfeeding]] one of the newborn babies. Hae-ra insists that Miss Cho chase Eun-yi out of the house, but Miss Cho refuses and quits her job on the spot. Eun-yi then confronts the entire family (Hae-ra, Mi-hee, Hoon, and Nami), hanging herself from the same chandelier she once clung to, then lighting her body on fire as the family watches in horror.\n\nThe final scene depicts the family outdoors in the snow celebrating Nami's birthday, all speaking English. While Hae-ra sings \"Happy Birthday\", Hoon hands a glass of champagne to Nami. Both appear insane as Nami looks on.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeon Do-yeon]] as Eun-yi\n* [[Lee Jung-jae]] as Hoon\n* [[Seo Woo]] as Hae-ra\n* [[Youn Yuh-jung]] as Byeong-sik\n* [[Ahn Seo-hyun]] as Nami\n* [[Park Ji-young (actress)|Park Ji-young]] as Mi-hee\n* [[Moon So-ri]] as Obstetrician\n\n==Production==\nAn early draft of the screenplay was written by [[Kim Soo-hyun (writer)|Kim Soo-hyun]], but after director Im Sang-soo had edited the script so heavily that Kim considered it to be entirely Im's own work, she decided to leave the project and publicly expressed her dissatisfaction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee |first=Hyo-won |date=2 November 2009 |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2009/11/178_54726.html |title=Jeon Do-yeon Cast in ''The Housemaid'' |work=[[The Korea Times]] |accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Although the film includes some key elements of the original, [[Kim Ki-young]]'s ''[[The Housemaid (1960 film)|The Housemaid]]'' from 1960, Im has said that he tried to never think of it during the production in order to come up with a modern and original work. One major difference between the versions is that the original film took place in the middle class, while the remake is set in an extreme upper-class environment. Im explains this with South Korea's social structure around 1960, which was a time when the country's middle class started to form and many poor people moved from the countryside to work in the cities: \"women became housemaids who served not only for the rich but also the middle class and that issue had served as the basis to Kim Ki-young's work.

It also plays a role in the dramatic and tragic end of the movie's heroine. That chandelier in all its detail is actually a copy of the 2008 work \"Song of Dionysus\" created by artist Bae Young-whan. The decision to include the chandelier in ''The Housemaid'' was quite a deliberate one. At first glance, the light fixture looks like an elegant [[Art Nouveau]] craft, but a closer look reveals that its green glass pieces are actually sharp shards from broken wine and [[soju]] bottles. In the same sense, the high-class family members in the movie look elegant at a glance but are actually selfish and cruel enough to break their housemaid's heart.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moon|first=So-young|title=Bae Young-whan spotlights Korean social woes|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2951688|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered in South Korea on 13 May 2010.

It also plays a role in the dramatic and tragic end of the movie\u2019s heroine. That chandelier in all its detail is actually a copy of the 2008 work \"Song of Dionysus\" created by artist Bae Young-whan. The decision to include the chandelier in ''The Housemaid'' was quite a deliberate one. At first glance, the light fixture looks like an elegant [[Art Nouveau]] craft, but a closer look reveals that its green glass pieces are actually sharp shards from broken wine and [[soju]] bottles. In the same sense, the high-class family members in the movie look elegant at a glance but are actually selfish and cruel enough to break their housemaid's heart.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moon|first=So-young|title=Bae Young-whan spotlights Korean social woes|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2951688|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered in South Korea on 13 May 2010.
