The mayor is responsible for the administration and management of various city departments, submits proposals and recommendations to the [[Chicago City Council]], is active in the enforcement of the city's ordinances, submits the city's annual budget and appoints city officers, department commissioners or directors, and members of city boards and commissions. \n\nDuring sessions of the city council, the mayor serves as the presiding officer. The mayor is not allowed to vote on issues except in certain instances, most notably where the vote taken on a matter before the body results in a tie.\n\nThe office of mayor was created when Chicago became a city in 1837.\n\n==Appointment powers==\nThe mayor appoints the commissioner of the [[Chicago Fire Department]] and superintendent of the [[Chicago Police Department]]. He or she also appoints the heads of other departments,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/chicago-mayor-lori-lightfoot-announces-key-hires-for-her-new-administration-some-rahm-emanuel-appointees-will-stay/ar-AABHV2Y |title=Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announces key hires for her new administration, some Rahm Emanuel appointees will stay |last=Pratt |first=Gregory |date=May 22, 2018 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2019-05-22 |via=MSN}}</ref> the largest of which are the Water Management Department (formed by the consolidation of the former Water Department and Sewer Department under [[Richard M. Daley]]), and the Streets & Sanitation Department. He or she also appoints members to the boards of several [[Special_district_(United_States)|special-purpose governmental bodies]] including the [[Chicago Park District]], [[Chicago Public Library]], [[Chicago Housing Authority]], [[Chicago Transit Authority]], and the [[Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority]]. Under [[Richard M. Daley]], the [[Illinois General Assembly|Illinois legislature]] granted the mayor power to appoint the governing board and chief executive officer of the [[Chicago Public Schools]] and subordinated the district to the mayor; the district had long been an independent unit of government.\n\nThe [[Chicago City Clerk]] and [[City Treasurer of Chicago]] are elected separately, as are the 50 aldermen who form the city council. The mayor is empowered, however, to fill vacancies in any of these 52 elected offices by appointment. In turn, the city council elects one of its own to fill a mayoral vacancy.\n\n==Election and succession==\n{{see main|Mayoral elections in Chicago}}\n\nThe mayor of Chicago is elected by popular vote every four years, on the last Tuesday in February. A run-off election, in the event that no candidate garners more than fifty percent of the vote, is held on the first Tuesday in April. The election is held on a [[nonpartisan|non-partisan]] basis.

Carter Harrison, Jr. was the first mayor to have been born in the city. As an interim mayor, [[David Duvall Orr]] had the shortest mayoral term. Richard M. Daley was elected six times becoming Chicago's longest-serving mayor, surpassing his father's record.<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilKvZ_-QeQYYesyxYOrMxElWJQcA?docId=a29f3a05d0b5405e8e446c86c6e89c3f \"Daley now Chicago mayor 1 day longer than father\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101064019/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilKvZ_-QeQYYesyxYOrMxElWJQcA?docId=a29f3a05d0b5405e8e446c86c6e89c3f |date=2011-01-01 }} [[Associated Press]] December 26, 2010</ref>  The first Irish Catholic mayor was [[John Patrick Hopkins]] (1893&ndash;1895), and [[Rahm Emanuel]] (2011&ndash;2019) is the only Jewish American to have served as mayor.  [[Harold Washington]] (1983&ndash;1987) was the first African American mayor. Current Mayor Lightfoot (sworn in May 2019) is the city's first African American woman and first openly LGBTQ mayor.\n\nBy charter, Chicago has a \"[[mayor-council government#Weak-mayor form|weak-mayor]]\" system, in which most of the power is vested in the city council. In practice, however, the mayor of Chicago has long been one of the most powerful municipal chief executives in the nation.  Unlike mayors in most other weak-mayor systems, he or she has the power to draw up the budget.  For most of the 20th century, before [[Shakman Decrees|the decline of patronage]] and the mayor's office becoming officially nonpartisan in 1999, the mayor was the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the city's Democratic Party, and had great influence over the ward organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/532.html|title=Government, City of Chicago|author=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|accessdate=19 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815015258/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/532.html|archive-date=15 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==List of mayors==\nThe mayoral term in Chicago was one year from 1837 through 1863, when it was changed to two years. In 1907, it was changed again, this time to four years. Until 1861, municipal elections were held in March. In that year, legislation moved them to April. In 1869, however, election day was changed to November, and terms expiring in April of that year were changed. In 1875, election day was moved back to April by the city's vote to operate under the [[Cities and Villages Act of 1872]].\n[[File:William B Ogden by GPA Healy, 1855.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[William B.

Chicago|government]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the [[List of United States cities by population|third-largest city]] in the [[United States]]. The mayor is responsible for the administration and management of various city departments, submits proposals and recommendations to the [[Chicago City Council]], is active in the enforcement of the city's ordinances, submits the city's annual budget and appoints city officers, department commissioners or directors, and members of city boards and commissions. \n\nDuring sessions of the city council, the mayor serves as the presiding officer. The mayor is not allowed to vote on issues except in certain instances, most notably where the vote taken on a matter before the body results in a tie.\n\nThe office of mayor was created when Chicago became a city in 1837.\n\n==Appointment powers==\nThe mayor appoints the commissioner of the [[Chicago Fire Department]] and superintendent of the [[Chicago Police Department]]. He or she also appoints the heads of other departments,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/chicago-mayor-lori-lightfoot-announces-key-hires-for-her-new-administration-some-rahm-emanuel-appointees-will-stay/ar-AABHV2Y |title=Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announces key hires for her new administration, some Rahm Emanuel appointees will stay |last=Pratt |first=Gregory |date=May 22, 2018 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=2019-05-22 |via=MSN}}</ref> the largest of which are the Water Management Department (formed by the consolidation of the former Water Department and Sewer Department under [[Richard M.

He or she also appoints members to the boards of several [[Special_district_(United_States)|special-purpose governmental bodies]] including the [[Chicago Park District]], [[Chicago Public Library]], [[Chicago Housing Authority]], [[Chicago Transit Authority]], and the [[Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority]]. Under [[Richard M. Daley]], the [[Illinois General Assembly|Illinois legislature]] granted the mayor power to appoint the governing board and chief executive officer of the [[Chicago Public Schools]] and subordinated the district to the mayor; the district had long been an independent unit of government.\n\nThe [[Chicago City Clerk]] and [[City Treasurer of Chicago]] are elected separately, as are the 50 aldermen who form the city council. The mayor is empowered, however, to fill vacancies in any of these 52 elected offices by appointment. In turn, the city council elects one of its own to fill a mayoral vacancy.\n\n==Election and succession==\n{{see main|Mayoral elections in Chicago}}\n\nThe mayor of Chicago is elected by popular vote every four years, on the last Tuesday in February. A run-off election, in the event that no candidate garners more than fifty percent of the vote, is held on the first Tuesday in April. The election is held on a [[nonpartisan|non-partisan]] basis.

Daley was elected six times becoming Chicago's longest-serving mayor, surpassing his father's record.<ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilKvZ_-QeQYYesyxYOrMxElWJQcA?docId=a29f3a05d0b5405e8e446c86c6e89c3f \"Daley now Chicago mayor 1 day longer than father\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101064019/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilKvZ_-QeQYYesyxYOrMxElWJQcA?docId=a29f3a05d0b5405e8e446c86c6e89c3f |date=2011-01-01 }} [[Associated Press]] December 26, 2010</ref>  The first Irish Catholic mayor was [[John Patrick Hopkins]] (1893&ndash;1895), and [[Rahm Emanuel]] (2011&ndash;2019) is the only Jewish American to have served as mayor.  [[Harold Washington]] (1983&ndash;1987) was the first African American mayor. Current Mayor Lightfoot (sworn in May 2019) is the city's first African American woman and first openly LGBTQ mayor.\n\nBy charter, Chicago has a \"[[mayor-council government#Weak-mayor form|weak-mayor]]\" system, in which most of the power is vested in the city council. In practice, however, the mayor of Chicago has long been one of the most powerful municipal chief executives in the nation.  Unlike mayors in most other weak-mayor systems, he or she has the power to draw up the budget.  For most of the 20th century, before [[Shakman Decrees|the decline of patronage]] and the mayor's office becoming officially nonpartisan in 1999, the mayor was the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the city's Democratic Party, and had great influence over the ward organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/532.html|title=Government, City of Chicago|author=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|accessdate=19 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815015258/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/532.html|archive-date=15 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==List of mayors==\nThe mayoral term in Chicago was one year from 1837 through 1863, when it was changed to two years. In 1907, it was changed again, this time to four years. Until 1861, municipal elections were held in March. In that year, legislation moved them to April. In 1869, however, election day was changed to November, and terms expiring in April of that year were changed. In 1875, election day was moved back to April by the city's vote to operate under the [[Cities and Villages Act of 1872]].\n[[File:William B Ogden by GPA Healy, 1855.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[William B.

After his film debut ''[[Going Overboard]]'' in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian [[Dennis Miller]], who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]]. Sandler was hired as a writer for ''SNL'' in 1990 and became a featured player the following year, making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including \"[[The Thanksgiving Song]]\" and \"[[The Chanukah Song]]\".<ref name=biography.com/> Sandler told [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' that [[NBC]] fired him and [[Chris Farley]] from the show in 1995, and played this up in his return to the show as a host in 2019.<ref name=\"Sandler fired\">{{cite news| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2010/01/21/2010-01-21_youre_not_alone_conan_obrien_adam_sandler_says_nbc_fired_him_and_chris_farley_fr.html | title= You're not alone, Conan O'Brien: Adam Sandler says NBC fired him and Chris Farley from 'SNL'| first= Joe |last=Dziemianowicz| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location=New York City |date= January 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Adam Sandler's \"I Was Fired\" Monologue - SNL |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eghK5yMpNuc |publisher=SNL}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' with Chris Farley, [[David Spade]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Jane Curtin]].

He starred in ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995) playing a grown man repeating grades 1\u201312 to earn back his father's respect and the right to inherit his father's multimillion-dollar hotel empire. The film was successful at the box office despite negative reviews. He followed this film with ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' (1996), and the financially successful comedies ''Happy Gilmore'' (1996) and ''The Wedding Singer'' (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor party\u2013themed comedy/thriller ''[[Very Bad Things]]'' (1998) but had to back out due to his involvement in ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998), one of his first hits.\n\nAlthough his earliest films did not receive favorable critical attention, he started to receive more positive reviews, beginning with ''Punch-Drunk Love'' in 2002.

Amaya becomes Owlette (an [[owl]]), Greg becomes Gekko (a [[lizard]]), and Connor becomes Catboy (a [[cat]]).\n\n==Characters==\n===PJ Masks===\n'''PJ Masks''' (known as \"PJs\" for short) is the titular superhero team that fights crime at night to keep it from ruining people's days. Their catchphrase when planning to go fight their enemies is \"PJ Masks, we're on our way. Into the night, to save the day!\" Their base is hidden in a totem-like structure in the park, called their \"HQ\", which also houses a crystal that grants them their abilities. When the villains are defeated, their victory catchphrase is \"PJ Masks, all shout hooray, 'cause in the night, we saved the day!\" Among its members and allies are:\n\n====Members====\n* Connor / Catboy (voiced by [[Jacob Ewaniuk]] in Season 1, Jacob Ursomarzo in Season 2-\"Best Friends Forever\", and Roman Lutterotti in \"Meet An Yu\"-present) \u2013 Connor is a blue-eyed boy with brown hair. When he transforms, he wears a blue [[cat]] costume with cat ears and a thin feline tail.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Catboy and the Shrinker|series=PJ Masks|quote=I'm not that little, and I can still be your leader.}}</ref> He has super-hearing using Cat Ears, can leap high and far using Super Cat Jump (or \"Super Cat Leap\"), and sprints fast using Super Cat Speed,<ref name=ep2>{{cite episode|series=PJ Masks|number=2}}</ref> or just Super Speed.<ref name=SuperMS>{{cite episode|title=Owlette and the Moonball|series=PJ Masks|minutes=21|quote=We need to play as a team. Gekko, use your Super Muscles, Catboy, use your Super Speed, and I'll use my Owl Wing Wind!}}</ref> Starting in season 2, he also has Super Cat Stripes. When on a mission, he sometimes likes to narrate his actions. His main flaws are his [[impulsiveness]] and his need to control, flaws that can be exploited by the team's opponents. He is the only member of the team that [[Aquaphobia|hates water]]. His vehicle is the Cat Car, which is located in the middle segment of the PJ Masks' tower. It can launch blue hairballs at any obstacle. His bedroom is on the second floor of a blue-roofed blue-doored house next to Amaya's house. Unlike Amaya and Greg, Connor is the only one without a pet.\n** Kitten Boy (voiced by Jacob Ursomarzo in \"Terrible Two-Some\", Roman Lutterotti in \"Big Sister Motsuki\") \u2013 The baby-fied version of Catboy who appeared in \"Terrible Two-Some\". Unlike Chicklette, he acts like a [[kitten]]. Whenever he uses his super cat speed, he exclaims \u201cSuper Cat Speed, and whoosh!\u201d He and Chicklette returned in \"Big Sister Motsuki\".\n* Amaya / Owlette (voiced by [[Addison Holley]]) \u2013 Amaya is a brown-eyed girl who wears red glasses, as well as PJ Masks' only female member besides An Yu. She has dark brown hair with a pink, wing-shaped hair clip. When she transforms, she wears a red [[owl]] costume with a dark red [[facial disc]] and a cape made of artificial feathers (dubbed her \"Super Owl Wings\"), which helps her fly. She also loses her glasses and presumably wears contact lenses. Her eyes also become an intense, blood-red color that matches her suit. She has Owl Eyes that let her see things that are far away up close, and she also has Super Owl Wing Wind, or just Owl Wing Wind (She also occasionally has super strength). Starting in season 2, she also has Super Owl Feathers, which sometimes form a Super Feather Shield. Despite being a member of PJ Masks, as well as being as adorable and likable as her teammates, she is also rude and unlikable at times (most notably in \"Glowy Moths\", where she even teamed up with Luna to get revenge on Romeo). While she doesn't mind water as Amaya, as seen in \"Catboy's Cloudy Crisis\", she is rarely soaked as Owlette. But when she is, the feathers on her suit get really soggy.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Catboy's Two Wheeled Wonder|series=PJ Masks|quote=I'm okay. But he got all my feathers wet.}}</ref> During PJ Masks Takeover Weekend on Disney Junior, she is revealed to also be the smartest member of the team. Her vehicle is the Owl-Glider, which can also do a \"Super Owl Wing Wind\". It is located in the top segment of the PJ Masks' tower. Her bedroom is on the third floor of a red-roofed red-doored home with a walled-in yard between Connor and Greg's houses. Amaya owns a bird named Birdie. Despite the fact that she is Connor's best friend, she flirts with him for convincing him to give the extra ticket to her (much to Greg/Gekko's chagrin) in \"Catboy's Tricky Ticket\". Owlette is male in the books.\n** Chicklette (also voiced by Addison Holley) \u2013 The baby-fied version of Owlette who appeared in \"Terrible Two-Some\". Whenever she uses her super owl wing wind, she exclaims \u201cSuper Owly Wingy-Wind!\u201d She and Kitten Boy returned in \"Big Sister Motsuki\".\n* Greg / Gekko (voiced by [[Kyle Harrison Breitkopf]] in Season 1-Season 3 and the short films and [[Claire Corlett]] in \"HQ Tour\" and Season 4-present) \u2013 Greg is a green-eyed, blonde-haired boy. When he transforms, he wears a green [[lizard]] costume with a thick reptilian tail and fins on top of his head. His powers are: Super Gekko Camouflage to go invisible or blend into the environment around him, Super Gekko Muscles (aka Super Muscles<ref name=SuperMS/>) to lift heavy things, like the HQ, Super Lizard Grip to climb walls or anchor himself to stop vehicles, and Super Lizard Water Run to walk on water.<ref name=ep2/> He has exhibited enough strength to lift a mobile laboratory (namely Romeo's) off the ground. Starting in season 2, he also has Super Lizard Shields, which can create shields. He is the only semi-aquatic member of the PJ Masks. His vehicle is the Gekko-Mobile, which is also a submersible vehicle that can travel underwater and can also ride up & over buildings via land on tank treads; it is slower than the Cat-Car. His vehicle is located in the bottom segment of the PJ Masks' tower. The vehicle has abilities similar to him, with a \"Gekko-Mobile Camouflage\" letting it blend in with surroundings. His bedroom is on the second floor of a green-roofed green-doored house next to Amaya's. Greg has a gecko named Lionel. In seasons 1\u20132, an ongoing joke about how he \"can't think of a rhyme\" was finished in \"Pirates Ahoy!\" when he sang with Owlette/Amaya, where they were singing about each other and he thought of a rhyme for the relationship of them both in that segment. It is hinted that he has a slim crush on Amaya/Owlette, but some fans believe that he has a crush on Luna Girl. He is also Connor's best friend and is treated like a little brother.\n** Baby Gekko (voiced by Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) \u2013 The baby-fied version of Gekko who appeared in \"Big Sister Motsuki\". Unlike the other baby PJs, he is the only one who never speaks by himself and usually only speaks in unison with the other babies. However, at one point, he did say \"Muscle Wuscles!\" when he used his Super Gekko Muscles.\n* PJ Robot (voiced by Juan Luis Bonilla) \u2013 A robot that Romeo created to infiltrate the PJ Masks HQ. However, PJ Robot decided to be a PJ Mask rather than a villain's sidekick. He joined the PJ Masks Team in Season 2. He spends most of his time inside HQ as mission control for the PJ Masks. He doesn't speak much, but when he does, it usually comes out as robotic gibberish that only the PJ Masks and Romeo can understand. He is the creator of the PJ Seeker.\n\n====Allies====\n* Teeny Weeny Ninjalino (actor unknown) \u2013 A tiny and cute ninja from \"Catboy and the Teeny Weeny Ninjalino\", who was supposed to spy on the PJ Masks but won Owlette and Gekko's affection. Catboy (who was too quick to judge him, but later became his friend after being unstuck from the Owl Glider by him) kept wanting to get rid of him, and convinced his teammates to do so as well. He returned in \"Race Up Mystery Mountain\", where he mostly interacted with Gekko. In \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\", Teeny turned on his master. But in \"The Disappearing Ninjas\" he returned to his master's side.\n** The Splat Monster (actor unknown) \u2013 The alternate form Teeny took in the episode of the same name, where he turned into a Splat Monster when he touched the transforming splat in the Mystery Mountain cave. The Teeny Weeny Ninjalino was restored to normal by An Yu. This form returned in \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\" and again in \"The Disappearing Ninjas.\"\n* Armadylan (voiced by Max Calinescu in Season 2-\"Armadylan Zen\", Christian Perri in \"Arma-Leader\"-present) \u2013 An [[armadillo]]-like boy who wants to be a hero, but his being inexperienced causes him to mess up. He first meets the PJ Masks in \"Meet Armadylan\" and became an official member of the PJ Masks team in the episode \"PJ Dylan\". Armadylan's powers are his Thunder Thump to shake the ground, super strength to lift any heavy objects, like Gekko, the Rolling Thunder to roll himself up into a ball to attack his opponents and he can also dig to go underneath the ground. He is mostly mistaken by Romeo and Night Ninja for an anteater and/or an aardvark instead of an armadillo. He has a crush on either Rip or Octobella.\n* Captain Smartypants (voiced by Carter Thorne) \u2013 A young scientist who is the good version of Romeo. He helps Gekko change his teammates back to normal before Robot changes him back to his usual, evil self in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\".\n* An Yu (voiced by Kari Wong) \u2013 A samurai girl who uses her bo staff as a weapon or to fly; it also turns into a magic flute. She also turned out to be the human form of the Dragon from the Dragon Gong, as hinted by the gold dragon head on her headdress. She first appears in her human form in the season 3 episode \"Meet An Yu\". An Yu was a loner{{snd}}she attempted to face Night Ninja (from the episode \"Meet An Yu\") alone without the PJ Masks{{snd}}but they helped her out anyway, and she has occasionally helped them out in return. An Yu's powers mostly work on Mystery Mountain, and she can't use her magic flute in the town either, as seen in \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\".\n*Lionel (actor unknown) \u2013 a small gekko who is the pet of Gekko, he normally appeared when the PJ Masks are transforming. He then had a major role in \"Lionel-saurs.\" when Romeo made him huge.\n*[[Santa Claus|Santa ]](voiced by [[Ron Pardo]]) - Santa is the jolly man who appeared in \"The PJ Masks Save Christmas.\" where he teamed up with the PJ Masks to stop Romeo from running [[Christmas]]. He appears with a long beard and was not as fat as the other adaptations of him.\n* Newton (actor unknown at the moment) \u2013 An upcoming character who is set to appear in season 4, and was first seen in a storyboard video for the season's 14th episode. He has star powers. He is likely to be the first hero to appear in both daytime and nighttime.\n\n===Villains===\n* Romeo (voiced by Alex Thorne in Season 1, Carter Thorne in the short films and Season 2-\"Owlette Slips Up\", Simon Pirso in \"Motsuki the Best\"-present) \u2013 The main villain in the series. He is a childish scientist who comes up with a variety of inventions and dislikes the PJ Masks, who always foil his plans. He also dislikes the other villains such as Luna Girl and Night Ninja, who he trapped in \"Romeo's Disguise\", although they did team up in \"PJ Masks vs. Bad Guys United.\" He also dislikes it when his servants disobey him. His favorite inventions (as said in \"Owlette's New Move\") are Robot, his Laboggan (which is his mobile lab, with skis in place of [[Continuous track|Caterpillar]] tracks), Super Train, and Radical Romeo Remote. From \"Blame it on the Train, Owlette\" to \"The Prank Wheelz\", he originally controlled a mobile Lab on land, but now controls his flying Sky Factory starting in \"Villain of the Sky\". He always tries to take over the world and defeat the PJs but regularly fails. Once, though, he took over the city, turning it into Romeo-aplolis in \"Gekko and the Mayhem at the Museum\". He did once help the PJ Masks in \"The PJ Masks Save Christmas.\" when he realised how much Robot cares for him despite the rotten things he has done. Even though he may be evil, Robot mentions that there is good in Romeo deep down.\n** Robots - Romeo's mechanical henchmen.\n*** Robot (voiced by Ron Pardo) \u2013 A large [[robot]], Romeo's personal servant and his buddy as Romeo mentions it in \" Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage.\". He has acted on his own,  when Romeo invented Robette and when he captured Armadylan, Despite Romeo replacing him, Robot shows that he still cares for his master and is always willing to help him. Robot's main weakness is water, as it causes him to short-circuit and be paralyzed. Whenever this happens he often says \"Robots hate water.\"\n*** Robette (actor unknown) \u2013 One of Romeo's inventions. She began to try to take over the world herself in \"Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage\". This was due to a loose screw caused by Owlette and was later resolved. During the episode, Romeo's original Robot became jealous of Robette, and ran away. This was also later resolved, and Romeo became friends with Robot again. Robette returned in the Season 2 episode \"PJ Robot\". In \"Armadylan and Robette Rule\", she ends up as Armadylan's sidekick but then went back to Romeo.\n*** Toolbox \u2013 A walking toolbox who works with Romeo, and in case of making inventions Toolbox carries Romeo's tools.\n*** Spy-Bot \u2013 A cubical bot that works for Romeo, who often used Spy-Bot to spy on the PJ Masks.\n*** Fly Bots \u2013 Small, flying robots which resemble PJ Robot before he reformed and regularly guard Romeo's Sky Factory.\n*** Naughty Bots - Naughty Bots are robots disguised as [[Gift| presents]], but they destroy everything related to [[Christmas|Christmas]] \u2013 like presents and Christmas decorations\n*** Robo-PJ Masks - As the robotic versions of the PJ Masks, they all have the same powers but with the addition of Laser Eyes which stops the enemies from moving.\n* Luna Girl (a.k.a. Luna) (voiced by Brianna Daguanno) \u2013 The second villain in the series who is also the first villainess. She is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] girl who lives on the [[Moon]] in her Lunar Fortress with her little sister Motsuki and their moths, but in \"Best Friends Forever\", it is revealed that her Luna Magnet powers give her the power to breathe in space. Her main weapons are her Luna Magnet and Luna Board that she uses as a mode of transportation. However, she also had a lot of other weapons; this once included a giant Moon-Ball, which could steal objects and swallow her enemies and the small Moon Ball, which turns the person who touches it to servants. She teamed with PJ Masks while defeating Romeo in some episodes when it came to him threatening the Moon or using her stolen lunar crystal. Starting in Season 3, she is persistently nicknamed Luna, rather than being called by her full name. In \"Gekko Saves Christmas\", she is shown to develop a crush on Gekko and at the end, they team up to put Christmas right. In \u201cBest Friends Forever\u201d at the end of the episode (like Gekko Saves Christmas), and she also joins the PJ Masks victory! She also helps the PJ Masks in \u201cPJ Party Crasher\u201d when Motsuki try to ruin Owlette\u2019s pajama party and was even invited to her slumber party. Also, she and Romeo team up in \u201cPJ Masks VS Bad Guy United\u201d when Romeo allied with Night Ninja and Luna Girl to defeat the PJs forever and in \u201cPJ Comet\u201d when Romeo and Luna Girl work together to Trap the PJ Masks in a fake comet and try to build a Villain HQ! But although being a villain towards the PJ Masks, Luna Girl is shown to have a good side sometimes that some fans believe that she will turn good and ally with them more often.\n** Moths \u2013 A swarm of [[Moth|moths]] who work for Luna.  They also have the ability to fly on the moon.\n*** Motsuki (voiced by Hattie Kragten) \u2013 The first moth to go to the moon with Luna Girl and receive her own powers from her mistress in \"Moon Madness\". Previously nicknamed \"Moth\" and \"Hench-Moth\" by Catboy, Luna was originally going to call her either \"Mothena\" or \"Motherella\", but eventually stuck with \"Motsuki\". Motsuki has the power to sense someone in the Lunar Fortress and can also shoot moon beams from her antennas to trap her victims in a purple bubble. Thanks to the PJ Masks' bad vibes, she later turns into a more anthropomorphic and more powerful, moth-like insectoid girl after hatching from a strange crystal on the moon in \"Moth on the Moon\", as intended by Luna. Following her transformation, she is given the power of speech and has a smaller crystal on her chest that has the same purpose as Luna's Luna Magnet. Despite this, she also becomes much less loyal to Luna, who now sees her as a younger sister, and enjoys annoying her, but she still loves her either way. She also has the tendency to occasionally make high-pitched squeaking noises really often. In \"Minding Motsuki\", she appears to be more loyal towards Gekko than towards Luna, as she treats her like a baby while he treats her like she's a guest.\n* Night Ninja (voiced by Trek Buccino in Season 1, Devan Cohen in the short films and Season 2-\"Do the Gekko\" and Jacob Soley in \"Armadylan, Action Hero\"-present) \u2013 Night Ninja, as his name suggests, is a [[ninja]] who rarely gets into battle as he makes his Ninjalinos do all his work and is the third villain of the series. He and Romeo have occasionally teamed up: in \"Catboy and the Shrinker\", when Romeo needed someone to help operate his shrink ray; and in \"Wacky Floats\" where they stole the parade floats and plotted to transform them into Robot Floats. In both episodes, they always argued and disagreed with each other. He did help the PJs twice in \"Wolfy Mountain\" and in \u201cWerejalinos\u201d to stop the Wolfies, from taking control of the Mystery Mountain and in \"The  Disappearing Ninjas\" when Romeo stole his Ninjalinos and invade Mystery Mountain. His main weapon is Sticky Splat which he normally uses to trap his opponents, he also uses [[Smoke bomb|smoke bombs]] to teleport to place to another.\n* Ninjalinos (actors unknown) \u2013 The minions of Night Ninja. They are small purple ninjas that talk in their own, unintelligible language (though Night Ninja does seem to understand them). Their numbers increased from episode to episode, from as few as three to well over a dozen. They sometimes get along well with the PJ Masks, much to their boss' chagrin.\n** Marvin (actor unknown) \u2013 A Ninjalino who was named. He appeared in \"Wolfy Mountain\" and \"Werejalinos\"\n** Daisy (actor unknown) \u2013 A female Ninjalino who was named. She appeared in \"The Disappearing Ninjas\".\n* The Wolfy Kids (usually referred to as \"the Wolfies\") \u2013 A trio of [[werewolf]] siblings who like to cause mischief. They ride in their car they call the \"Wolf Wheelz\". They may have been inspired by Les Mascrapules (lit. the Masked Scoundrels), a trio of villain kids from the books who also like to mess around and do as they please! They and The PJ Masks team up to defeat Luna Girl in two episode. They are show in \"Arma-Leader\" to be good after all since they help the PJs to rescue Armadylan and also another teaming with the PJs in \u201cWolfy Powers\u201d when Romeo stole the PJ Masks's powers and the Wolfies help them to retrieve their PJ powers.\n** Rip (voiced by Shechinah Mpumlwana) \u2013 The female member and leader of the Wolfy Kids who is the second villainess in the series. She has dark magenta hair with light tips and bone-shaped hair clips.\n** Howler (voiced by Kaden Stephen) \u2013 A male member of the Wolfy Kids, with white streak in his black hair.\n** Kevin (voiced by Ethan Pugiotto) \u2013 A male and younger member of the Wolfy Kids, always nicer than his brother and sister. He is a friend of Gekko.\n***Wolf Wheelz \u2013 The car of the Wolfy Kids. Originally three scooters used by the humanoid wolves, it transformed into a car in \"The Moon Prix\" as a result of being exposed to moon energy. In \"Where's the Wolf Wheelz?\", it is revealed that the car has a mind of its own.\n* Night [[Panthera|Panther]] (voiced by Jacob Ursomarzo) \u2013 The evil version of Catboy who appeared in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\". He also has the same powers like Catboy, like his Super Cat Stripes, only he calls it Night Panther Stripes.\n* Dark [[Owl]] (voiced by Addison Holley) \u2013 The evil version of Owlette who appeared in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\". Like Night Panther, she has the same powers as her couterpart, like Dark Owl Feathers which are like Owlette's Owl Feathers.\n* Octobella (voiced by Simon Pirso) \u2013 Another upcoming character for season 4 who, as her name suggests, will be an [[octopus]]-themed villain, as well as the series' third villainess (yet despite being set to debut in season 4, one of her tentacles can be seen in the end of \"Gekko Everywhere\"). She was leaked in a now-removed storyboard video for an upcoming episode for season 4, titled \"Octobella's Garden\". Since the storyboard video for said episode is no longer available for viewing online, it was unknown on what Octobella will look like until \"Gekko Everywhere\", when one of her tentacles was seen grabbing the Teleporting Crystal; it was light green with a hint of orange at the base. Besides that, her other half is currently unseen, so your best bet is to wait until \"Octobella's Garden\" (or whatever episode she'll first fully appear in) comes out. One other thing about her that we do know, however, is that she has a beautiful singing voice which is enough to attract Armadylan and make him fall in love with her.\n** Percival \u2013 Octobella's [[hermit crab]] sidekick.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Cameron (voiced by Tristan Samuel in Season 1, Jonah Wineberg in Season 2, Tyler Nathan in Season 3-present) \u2013 A boy in the same class as PJ Masks when they attend school during the day as civilians. He once scared Amaya with a T-Rex cutout the same way Connor did earlier in \"Owlette's Terrible Pterodactyl Trouble\", but Connor learned his lesson and tells Cameron not to do it. In \"Catboy's Cuddly\", he was revealed to have a sister (named Marie as of \"PJ Party Crasher\"), who attends the same school.\n* Teacher (voiced by [[Robert Tinkler|Rob Tinkler]]) \u2013 An unnamed adult male who teaches Connor, Greg, and Amaya's class. When things disappear, he thinks it's strange.\n* Jayden Houston \u2013 A popular singer, known for his golden microphone. It was stolen by Luna Girl in \"Catboy's Tricky Ticket\", but was later recovered by the PJ Masks.\n* Master Fang (actor unknown) \u2013 The protagonist of his own comic book and TV series. Greg and Connor generally looked up to him, but Amaya doesn't seem to care about him much. He is known for his signature sword that was stolen by Night Ninja in \"Catboy and Master Fang's Sword\".\n** Kick McGee \u2013 Master Fang's unseen sidekick. His persona is often used during missions.\n* Flossy Flash \u2013 A female comic book superhero, looked up to by Owlette and Armadylan. Owlette prefers her over Master Fang and Kick McGee, who are favored by Catboy and Gekko.\n* The Announcer (voiced by Ron Pardo) \u2013 A male voice that is heard in every episode as the day becomes night. He is never seen, but is known for saying his signature introduction sequence \"Night in the city, and a brave band of heroes is ready to face fiendish villains to stop them messing with your day.\" As the kids turn into their superhero forms, the announcer states who turns into who.\n*Marie (voice actor unknown) - Marie is Cameron's sister.  Like Cameron, Marie has green eyes and brown hair. She is one of Amaya's friends. Her name was revealed in, \u201cPJ Party Crasher\u201d.\n*Jenny (voice actor unknown) - Jenny is one of Amaya's friends.\n*Unknown Monkey - An upcoming character in Season 4.  First seen at the New York Toy Fair 2020 as an action figure. They don't have a name or gender yet, but it might be the confirmed third new character for the season.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of PJ Masks episodes}}\n{{:List of PJ Masks episodes}}\n\n==Production==\n''PJ Masks'' is a British/French coproduction by [[Entertainment One]], Frog Box, and [[TeamTO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/annecy-teamto-re-ups-pj-masks-skylanders-1201798571/|title=Annecy: TeamTO Re-Ups on 'PJ Masks,' 'Skylanders' (EXCLUSIVE)|work=Variety|author1=John Hopewell|author2=Emilio Mayorga|date=June 18, 2016|access-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref> The series was renewed for a second season consisting of 52 11-minute segments in June 2016;<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web |author=Georg Szalai |date=June 15, 2016 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-juniors-pj-masks-get-903016 |title=Disney Junior's 'PJ Masks' to Get Second Season |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref> it premiered on 15 January 2018.

When he transforms, he wears a blue [[cat]] costume with cat ears and a thin feline tail.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Catboy and the Shrinker|series=PJ Masks|quote=I'm not that little, and I can still be your leader.}}</ref> He has super-hearing using Cat Ears, can leap high and far using Super Cat Jump (or \"Super Cat Leap\"), and sprints fast using Super Cat Speed,<ref name=ep2>{{cite episode|series=PJ Masks|number=2}}</ref> or just Super Speed.<ref name=SuperMS>{{cite episode|title=Owlette and the Moonball|series=PJ Masks|minutes=21|quote=We need to play as a team. Gekko, use your Super Muscles, Catboy, use your Super Speed, and I'll use my Owl Wing Wind!}}</ref> Starting in season 2, he also has Super Cat Stripes. When on a mission, he sometimes likes to narrate his actions. His main flaws are his [[impulsiveness]] and his need to control, flaws that can be exploited by the team's opponents. He is the only member of the team that [[Aquaphobia|hates water]]. His vehicle is the Cat Car, which is located in the middle segment of the PJ Masks' tower. It can launch blue hairballs at any obstacle. His bedroom is on the second floor of a blue-roofed blue-doored house next to Amaya's house. Unlike Amaya and Greg, Connor is the only one without a pet.\n** Kitten Boy (voiced by Jacob Ursomarzo in \"Terrible Two-Some\", Roman Lutterotti in \"Big Sister Motsuki\") \u2013 The baby-fied version of Catboy who appeared in \"Terrible Two-Some\". Unlike Chicklette, he acts like a [[kitten]]. Whenever he uses his super cat speed, he exclaims \u201cSuper Cat Speed, and whoosh!\u201d He and Chicklette returned in \"Big Sister Motsuki\".\n* Amaya / Owlette (voiced by [[Addison Holley]]) \u2013 Amaya is a brown-eyed girl who wears red glasses, as well as PJ Masks' only female member besides An Yu. She has dark brown hair with a pink, wing-shaped hair clip. When she transforms, she wears a red [[owl]] costume with a dark red [[facial disc]] and a cape made of artificial feathers (dubbed her \"Super Owl Wings\"), which helps her fly. She also loses her glasses and presumably wears contact lenses. Her eyes also become an intense, blood-red color that matches her suit. She has Owl Eyes that let her see things that are far away up close, and she also has Super Owl Wing Wind, or just Owl Wing Wind (She also occasionally has super strength). Starting in season 2, she also has Super Owl Feathers, which sometimes form a Super Feather Shield. Despite being a member of PJ Masks, as well as being as adorable and likable as her teammates, she is also rude and unlikable at times (most notably in \"Glowy Moths\", where she even teamed up with Luna to get revenge on Romeo). While she doesn't mind water as Amaya, as seen in \"Catboy's Cloudy Crisis\", she is rarely soaked as Owlette. But when she is, the feathers on her suit get really soggy.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Catboy's Two Wheeled Wonder|series=PJ Masks|quote=I'm okay. But he got all my feathers wet.}}</ref> During PJ Masks Takeover Weekend on Disney Junior, she is revealed to also be the smartest member of the team. Her vehicle is the Owl-Glider, which can also do a \"Super Owl Wing Wind\". It is located in the top segment of the PJ Masks' tower. Her bedroom is on the third floor of a red-roofed red-doored home with a walled-in yard between Connor and Greg's houses. Amaya owns a bird named Birdie. Despite the fact that she is Connor's best friend, she flirts with him for convincing him to give the extra ticket to her (much to Greg/Gekko's chagrin) in \"Catboy's Tricky Ticket\". Owlette is male in the books.\n** Chicklette (also voiced by Addison Holley) \u2013 The baby-fied version of Owlette who appeared in \"Terrible Two-Some\". Whenever she uses her super owl wing wind, she exclaims \u201cSuper Owly Wingy-Wind!\u201d She and Kitten Boy returned in \"Big Sister Motsuki\".\n* Greg / Gekko (voiced by [[Kyle Harrison Breitkopf]] in Season 1-Season 3 and the short films and [[Claire Corlett]] in \"HQ Tour\" and Season 4-present) \u2013 Greg is a green-eyed, blonde-haired boy. When he transforms, he wears a green [[lizard]] costume with a thick reptilian tail and fins on top of his head. His powers are: Super Gekko Camouflage to go invisible or blend into the environment around him, Super Gekko Muscles (aka Super Muscles<ref name=SuperMS/>) to lift heavy things, like the HQ, Super Lizard Grip to climb walls or anchor himself to stop vehicles, and Super Lizard Water Run to walk on water.<ref name=ep2/> He has exhibited enough strength to lift a mobile laboratory (namely Romeo's) off the ground. Starting in season 2, he also has Super Lizard Shields, which can create shields. He is the only semi-aquatic member of the PJ Masks. His vehicle is the Gekko-Mobile, which is also a submersible vehicle that can travel underwater and can also ride up & over buildings via land on tank treads; it is slower than the Cat-Car. His vehicle is located in the bottom segment of the PJ Masks' tower. The vehicle has abilities similar to him, with a \"Gekko-Mobile Camouflage\" letting it blend in with surroundings. His bedroom is on the second floor of a green-roofed green-doored house next to Amaya's. Greg has a gecko named Lionel. In seasons 1\u20132, an ongoing joke about how he \"can't think of a rhyme\" was finished in \"Pirates Ahoy!\" when he sang with Owlette/Amaya, where they were singing about each other and he thought of a rhyme for the relationship of them both in that segment. It is hinted that he has a slim crush on Amaya/Owlette, but some fans believe that he has a crush on Luna Girl. He is also Connor's best friend and is treated like a little brother.\n** Baby Gekko (voiced by Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) \u2013 The baby-fied version of Gekko who appeared in \"Big Sister Motsuki\". Unlike the other baby PJs, he is the only one who never speaks by himself and usually only speaks in unison with the other babies. However, at one point, he did say \"Muscle Wuscles!\" when he used his Super Gekko Muscles.\n* PJ Robot (voiced by Juan Luis Bonilla) \u2013 A robot that Romeo created to infiltrate the PJ Masks HQ. However, PJ Robot decided to be a PJ Mask rather than a villain's sidekick. He joined the PJ Masks Team in Season 2. He spends most of his time inside HQ as mission control for the PJ Masks. He doesn't speak much, but when he does, it usually comes out as robotic gibberish that only the PJ Masks and Romeo can understand. He is the creator of the PJ Seeker.\n\n====Allies====\n* Teeny Weeny Ninjalino (actor unknown) \u2013 A tiny and cute ninja from \"Catboy and the Teeny Weeny Ninjalino\", who was supposed to spy on the PJ Masks but won Owlette and Gekko's affection. Catboy (who was too quick to judge him, but later became his friend after being unstuck from the Owl Glider by him) kept wanting to get rid of him, and convinced his teammates to do so as well. He returned in \"Race Up Mystery Mountain\", where he mostly interacted with Gekko. In \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\", Teeny turned on his master. But in \"The Disappearing Ninjas\" he returned to his master's side.\n** The Splat Monster (actor unknown) \u2013 The alternate form Teeny took in the episode of the same name, where he turned into a Splat Monster when he touched the transforming splat in the Mystery Mountain cave. The Teeny Weeny Ninjalino was restored to normal by An Yu. This form returned in \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\" and again in \"The Disappearing Ninjas.\"\n* Armadylan (voiced by Max Calinescu in Season 2-\"Armadylan Zen\", Christian Perri in \"Arma-Leader\"-present) \u2013 An [[armadillo]]-like boy who wants to be a hero, but his being inexperienced causes him to mess up. He first meets the PJ Masks in \"Meet Armadylan\" and became an official member of the PJ Masks team in the episode \"PJ Dylan\". Armadylan's powers are his Thunder Thump to shake the ground, super strength to lift any heavy objects, like Gekko, the Rolling Thunder to roll himself up into a ball to attack his opponents and he can also dig to go underneath the ground. He is mostly mistaken by Romeo and Night Ninja for an anteater and/or an aardvark instead of an armadillo. He has a crush on either Rip or Octobella.\n* Captain Smartypants (voiced by Carter Thorne) \u2013 A young scientist who is the good version of Romeo. He helps Gekko change his teammates back to normal before Robot changes him back to his usual, evil self in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\".\n* An Yu (voiced by Kari Wong) \u2013 A samurai girl who uses her bo staff as a weapon or to fly; it also turns into a magic flute. She also turned out to be the human form of the Dragon from the Dragon Gong, as hinted by the gold dragon head on her headdress. She first appears in her human form in the season 3 episode \"Meet An Yu\". An Yu was a loner{{snd}}she attempted to face Night Ninja (from the episode \"Meet An Yu\") alone without the PJ Masks{{snd}}but they helped her out anyway, and she has occasionally helped them out in return. An Yu's powers mostly work on Mystery Mountain, and she can't use her magic flute in the town either, as seen in \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\".\n*Lionel (actor unknown) \u2013 a small gekko who is the pet of Gekko, he normally appeared when the PJ Masks are transforming. He then had a major role in \"Lionel-saurs.\" when Romeo made him huge.\n*[[Santa Claus|Santa ]](voiced by [[Ron Pardo]]) - Santa is the jolly man who appeared in \"The PJ Masks Save Christmas.\" where he teamed up with the PJ Masks to stop Romeo from running [[Christmas]]. He appears with a long beard and was not as fat as the other adaptations of him.\n* Newton (actor unknown at the moment) \u2013 An upcoming character who is set to appear in season 4, and was first seen in a storyboard video for the season's 14th episode. He has star powers. He is likely to be the first hero to appear in both daytime and nighttime.\n\n===Villains===\n* Romeo (voiced by Alex Thorne in Season 1, Carter Thorne in the short films and Season 2-\"Owlette Slips Up\", Simon Pirso in \"Motsuki the Best\"-present) \u2013 The main villain in the series. He is a childish scientist who comes up with a variety of inventions and dislikes the PJ Masks, who always foil his plans. He also dislikes the other villains such as Luna Girl and Night Ninja, who he trapped in \"Romeo's Disguise\", although they did team up in \"PJ Masks vs. Bad Guys United.\" He also dislikes it when his servants disobey him. His favorite inventions (as said in \"Owlette's New Move\") are Robot, his Laboggan (which is his mobile lab, with skis in place of [[Continuous track|Caterpillar]] tracks), Super Train, and Radical Romeo Remote. From \"Blame it on the Train, Owlette\" to \"The Prank Wheelz\", he originally controlled a mobile Lab on land, but now controls his flying Sky Factory starting in \"Villain of the Sky\". He always tries to take over the world and defeat the PJs but regularly fails. Once, though, he took over the city, turning it into Romeo-aplolis in \"Gekko and the Mayhem at the Museum\". He did once help the PJ Masks in \"The PJ Masks Save Christmas.\" when he realised how much Robot cares for him despite the rotten things he has done. Even though he may be evil, Robot mentions that there is good in Romeo deep down.\n** Robots - Romeo's mechanical henchmen.\n*** Robot (voiced by Ron Pardo) \u2013 A large [[robot]], Romeo's personal servant and his buddy as Romeo mentions it in \" Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage.\". He has acted on his own,  when Romeo invented Robette and when he captured Armadylan, Despite Romeo replacing him, Robot shows that he still cares for his master and is always willing to help him. Robot's main weakness is water, as it causes him to short-circuit and be paralyzed. Whenever this happens he often says \"Robots hate water.\"\n*** Robette (actor unknown) \u2013 One of Romeo's inventions. She began to try to take over the world herself in \"Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage\". This was due to a loose screw caused by Owlette and was later resolved. During the episode, Romeo's original Robot became jealous of Robette, and ran away. This was also later resolved, and Romeo became friends with Robot again. Robette returned in the Season 2 episode \"PJ Robot\". In \"Armadylan and Robette Rule\", she ends up as Armadylan's sidekick but then went back to Romeo.\n*** Toolbox \u2013 A walking toolbox who works with Romeo, and in case of making inventions Toolbox carries Romeo's tools.\n*** Spy-Bot \u2013 A cubical bot that works for Romeo, who often used Spy-Bot to spy on the PJ Masks.\n*** Fly Bots \u2013 Small, flying robots which resemble PJ Robot before he reformed and regularly guard Romeo's Sky Factory.\n*** Naughty Bots - Naughty Bots are robots disguised as [[Gift| presents]], but they destroy everything related to [[Christmas|Christmas]] \u2013 like presents and Christmas decorations\n*** Robo-PJ Masks - As the robotic versions of the PJ Masks, they all have the same powers but with the addition of Laser Eyes which stops the enemies from moving.\n* Luna Girl (a.k.a. Luna) (voiced by Brianna Daguanno) \u2013 The second villain in the series who is also the first villainess. She is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] girl who lives on the [[Moon]] in her Lunar Fortress with her little sister Motsuki and their moths, but in \"Best Friends Forever\", it is revealed that her Luna Magnet powers give her the power to breathe in space. Her main weapons are her Luna Magnet and Luna Board that she uses as a mode of transportation. However, she also had a lot of other weapons; this once included a giant Moon-Ball, which could steal objects and swallow her enemies and the small Moon Ball, which turns the person who touches it to servants. She teamed with PJ Masks while defeating Romeo in some episodes when it came to him threatening the Moon or using her stolen lunar crystal. Starting in Season 3, she is persistently nicknamed Luna, rather than being called by her full name. In \"Gekko Saves Christmas\", she is shown to develop a crush on Gekko and at the end, they team up to put Christmas right. In \u201cBest Friends Forever\u201d at the end of the episode (like Gekko Saves Christmas), and she also joins the PJ Masks victory! She also helps the PJ Masks in \u201cPJ Party Crasher\u201d when Motsuki try to ruin Owlette\u2019s pajama party and was even invited to her slumber party. Also, she and Romeo team up in \u201cPJ Masks VS Bad Guy United\u201d when Romeo allied with Night Ninja and Luna Girl to defeat the PJs forever and in \u201cPJ Comet\u201d when Romeo and Luna Girl work together to Trap the PJ Masks in a fake comet and try to build a Villain HQ! But although being a villain towards the PJ Masks, Luna Girl is shown to have a good side sometimes that some fans believe that she will turn good and ally with them more often.\n** Moths \u2013 A swarm of [[Moth|moths]] who work for Luna.  They also have the ability to fly on the moon.\n*** Motsuki (voiced by Hattie Kragten) \u2013 The first moth to go to the moon with Luna Girl and receive her own powers from her mistress in \"Moon Madness\". Previously nicknamed \"Moth\" and \"Hench-Moth\" by Catboy, Luna was originally going to call her either \"Mothena\" or \"Motherella\", but eventually stuck with \"Motsuki\". Motsuki has the power to sense someone in the Lunar Fortress and can also shoot moon beams from her antennas to trap her victims in a purple bubble. Thanks to the PJ Masks' bad vibes, she later turns into a more anthropomorphic and more powerful, moth-like insectoid girl after hatching from a strange crystal on the moon in \"Moth on the Moon\", as intended by Luna. Following her transformation, she is given the power of speech and has a smaller crystal on her chest that has the same purpose as Luna's Luna Magnet. Despite this, she also becomes much less loyal to Luna, who now sees her as a younger sister, and enjoys annoying her, but she still loves her either way. She also has the tendency to occasionally make high-pitched squeaking noises really often. In \"Minding Motsuki\", she appears to be more loyal towards Gekko than towards Luna, as she treats her like a baby while he treats her like she's a guest.\n* Night Ninja (voiced by Trek Buccino in Season 1, Devan Cohen in the short films and Season 2-\"Do the Gekko\" and Jacob Soley in \"Armadylan, Action Hero\"-present) \u2013 Night Ninja, as his name suggests, is a [[ninja]] who rarely gets into battle as he makes his Ninjalinos do all his work and is the third villain of the series. He and Romeo have occasionally teamed up: in \"Catboy and the Shrinker\", when Romeo needed someone to help operate his shrink ray; and in \"Wacky Floats\" where they stole the parade floats and plotted to transform them into Robot Floats. In both episodes, they always argued and disagreed with each other. He did help the PJs twice in \"Wolfy Mountain\" and in \u201cWerejalinos\u201d to stop the Wolfies, from taking control of the Mystery Mountain and in \"The  Disappearing Ninjas\" when Romeo stole his Ninjalinos and invade Mystery Mountain. His main weapon is Sticky Splat which he normally uses to trap his opponents, he also uses [[Smoke bomb|smoke bombs]] to teleport to place to another.\n* Ninjalinos (actors unknown) \u2013 The minions of Night Ninja. They are small purple ninjas that talk in their own, unintelligible language (though Night Ninja does seem to understand them). Their numbers increased from episode to episode, from as few as three to well over a dozen. They sometimes get along well with the PJ Masks, much to their boss' chagrin.\n** Marvin (actor unknown) \u2013 A Ninjalino who was named. He appeared in \"Wolfy Mountain\" and \"Werejalinos\"\n** Daisy (actor unknown) \u2013 A female Ninjalino who was named. She appeared in \"The Disappearing Ninjas\".\n* The Wolfy Kids (usually referred to as \"the Wolfies\") \u2013 A trio of [[werewolf]] siblings who like to cause mischief. They ride in their car they call the \"Wolf Wheelz\". They may have been inspired by Les Mascrapules (lit. the Masked Scoundrels), a trio of villain kids from the books who also like to mess around and do as they please! They and The PJ Masks team up to defeat Luna Girl in two episode. They are show in \"Arma-Leader\" to be good after all since they help the PJs to rescue Armadylan and also another teaming with the PJs in \u201cWolfy Powers\u201d when Romeo stole the PJ Masks's powers and the Wolfies help them to retrieve their PJ powers.\n** Rip (voiced by Shechinah Mpumlwana) \u2013 The female member and leader of the Wolfy Kids who is the second villainess in the series. She has dark magenta hair with light tips and bone-shaped hair clips.\n** Howler (voiced by Kaden Stephen) \u2013 A male member of the Wolfy Kids, with white streak in his black hair.\n** Kevin (voiced by Ethan Pugiotto) \u2013 A male and younger member of the Wolfy Kids, always nicer than his brother and sister. He is a friend of Gekko.\n***Wolf Wheelz \u2013 The car of the Wolfy Kids. Originally three scooters used by the humanoid wolves, it transformed into a car in \"The Moon Prix\" as a result of being exposed to moon energy. In \"Where's the Wolf Wheelz?\", it is revealed that the car has a mind of its own.\n* Night [[Panthera|Panther]] (voiced by Jacob Ursomarzo) \u2013 The evil version of Catboy who appeared in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\". He also has the same powers like Catboy, like his Super Cat Stripes, only he calls it Night Panther Stripes.\n* Dark [[Owl]] (voiced by Addison Holley) \u2013 The evil version of Owlette who appeared in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\". Like Night Panther, she has the same powers as her couterpart, like Dark Owl Feathers which are like Owlette's Owl Feathers.\n* Octobella (voiced by Simon Pirso) \u2013 Another upcoming character for season 4 who, as her name suggests, will be an [[octopus]]-themed villain, as well as the series' third villainess (yet despite being set to debut in season 4, one of her tentacles can be seen in the end of \"Gekko Everywhere\"). She was leaked in a now-removed storyboard video for an upcoming episode for season 4, titled \"Octobella's Garden\". Since the storyboard video for said episode is no longer available for viewing online, it was unknown on what Octobella will look like until \"Gekko Everywhere\", when one of her tentacles was seen grabbing the Teleporting Crystal; it was light green with a hint of orange at the base. Besides that, her other half is currently unseen, so your best bet is to wait until \"Octobella's Garden\" (or whatever episode she'll first fully appear in) comes out. One other thing about her that we do know, however, is that she has a beautiful singing voice which is enough to attract Armadylan and make him fall in love with her.\n** Percival \u2013 Octobella's [[hermit crab]] sidekick.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Cameron (voiced by Tristan Samuel in Season 1, Jonah Wineberg in Season 2, Tyler Nathan in Season 3-present) \u2013 A boy in the same class as PJ Masks when they attend school during the day as civilians. He once scared Amaya with a T-Rex cutout the same way Connor did earlier in \"Owlette's Terrible Pterodactyl Trouble\", but Connor learned his lesson and tells Cameron not to do it. In \"Catboy's Cuddly\", he was revealed to have a sister (named Marie as of \"PJ Party Crasher\"), who attends the same school.\n* Teacher (voiced by [[Robert Tinkler|Rob Tinkler]]) \u2013 An unnamed adult male who teaches Connor, Greg, and Amaya's class. When things disappear, he thinks it's strange.\n* Jayden Houston \u2013 A popular singer, known for his golden microphone. It was stolen by Luna Girl in \"Catboy's Tricky Ticket\", but was later recovered by the PJ Masks.\n* Master Fang (actor unknown) \u2013 The protagonist of his own comic book and TV series. Greg and Connor generally looked up to him, but Amaya doesn't seem to care about him much. He is known for his signature sword that was stolen by Night Ninja in \"Catboy and Master Fang's Sword\".\n** Kick McGee \u2013 Master Fang's unseen sidekick. His persona is often used during missions.\n* Flossy Flash \u2013 A female comic book superhero, looked up to by Owlette and Armadylan. Owlette prefers her over Master Fang and Kick McGee, who are favored by Catboy and Gekko.\n* The Announcer (voiced by Ron Pardo) \u2013 A male voice that is heard in every episode as the day becomes night. He is never seen, but is known for saying his signature introduction sequence \"Night in the city, and a brave band of heroes is ready to face fiendish villains to stop them messing with your day.\" As the kids turn into their superhero forms, the announcer states who turns into who.\n*Marie (voice actor unknown) - Marie is Cameron's sister.  Like Cameron, Marie has green eyes and brown hair. She is one of Amaya's friends. Her name was revealed in, \u201cPJ Party Crasher\u201d.\n*Jenny (voice actor unknown) - Jenny is one of Amaya's friends.\n*Unknown Monkey - An upcoming character in Season 4.  First seen at the New York Toy Fair 2020 as an action figure. They don't have a name or gender yet, but it might be the confirmed third new character for the season.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of PJ Masks episodes}}\n{{:List of PJ Masks episodes}}\n\n==Production==\n''PJ Masks'' is a British/French coproduction by [[Entertainment One]], Frog Box, and [[TeamTO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/annecy-teamto-re-ups-pj-masks-skylanders-1201798571/|title=Annecy: TeamTO Re-Ups on 'PJ Masks,' 'Skylanders' (EXCLUSIVE)|work=Variety|author1=John Hopewell|author2=Emilio Mayorga|date=June 18, 2016|access-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref> The series was renewed for a second season consisting of 52 11-minute segments in June 2016;<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web |author=Georg Szalai |date=June 15, 2016 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-juniors-pj-masks-get-903016 |title=Disney Junior's 'PJ Masks' to Get Second Season |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref> it premiered on 15 January 2018.

It is a [[science fiction]] [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] with a [[Time travel in fiction|time traveling plot]] loosely adapting the 1995 [[12 Monkeys|film of the same name]], which was written by [[David Peoples|David]] and [[Janet Peoples]] and directed by [[Terry Gilliam]], itself being inspired by [[Chris Marker]]'s 1962 [[featurette]] ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]''; the series credits Marker and both Peoples for their original works.\n\nIn the series, [[Aaron Stanford]] and [[Amanda Schull]] star as James Cole and Dr. Cassandra \"Cassie\" Railly, two strangers destiny brought together on a mission to use [[time travel]] to stop the destructive plans of the enigmatic organization \"Army of the 12 Monkeys\". [[Kirk Acevedo]] and [[Noah Bean]] also star in the first season. In the second season, Bean makes a guest appearance, and [[Todd Stashwick]], [[Emily Hampshire]], and [[Barbara Sukowa]] are promoted from recurring guests to regulars. In the fourth season, Acevedo moves from starring to recurring guest star. Stanford, Schull, and Hampshire play reimagined versions of characters respectively portrayed by [[Bruce Willis]], [[Madeleine Stowe]], and [[Brad Pitt]] in the 1995 film. Stowe made a guest appearance in the second season in a small but pivotal role.\n\n[[Natalie Chaidez]] was the [[showrunner]] of ''12 Monkeys'' during its first season, working closely with creators Matalas and Fickett. For the second season, she stepped down to the role of consultant and Matalas and Fickett became showrunners. In the third and fourth seasons Fickett became a consultant, and Matalas was the sole showrunner. The series was produced by [[Atlas Entertainment]], which also made the 1995 film, and [[Universal Content Productions|Universal Cable Productions]]. [[Charles Roven]], producer of the original film, was one of the series [[executive producers]].\n\n''12 Monkeys'' premiered on January 16, 2015, with a 13-episode first season which received mixed to positive critical reception, and ended with the completion of its 11-episode fourth season on July 6, 2018, for a total of 47 episodes produced. From its second season and onward, it enjoyed more consistently favorable critical reception. The series won two awards for its [[cinematography]], one by each of the [[American Society of Cinematographers|American]] and [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers|Canadian Societies of Cinematographers]], and was nominated for a further four.\n\n==Plot==\n{{further|List of 12 Monkeys episodes}}\nIn the year 2043, [[Waste picker|scavenger]] James Cole ([[Aaron Stanford]]) has been recruited by a team of \"Project Splinter\" scientists led by physicist Katarina Jones ([[Barbara Sukowa]]), to [[Time travel|travel back in time]] to the year 2015, and stop the release of a deadly virus by the enigmatic organization known as the \"Army of the 12 Monkeys\". In Cole's original timeline, the virus caused a [[Pandemic|plague]] (Kalavirus) that resulted in the death of seven billion humans in the year 2017, and its on-going mutations will mean the eventual end of the human race. In the 2015 timeline, Cole will meet and enlist the help of brilliant [[virologist]] Dr. Cassandra \"Cassie\" Railly ([[Amanda Schull]]); the two are brought together because a recording mentioning Cole, that Cassie made after the viral outbreak, is uncovered by Katarina Jones in the future timeline, prompting her to select Cole for the mission. Cole will also encounter a seemingly unstable math genius named Jennifer Goines ([[Emily Hampshire]]), whose father Cole has been tasked to kill, Cassie's ex-boyfriend Aaron Marker ([[Noah Bean]]), and the dangerous high-ranking members of the Army of the 12 Monkeys, \"Pallid Man\" ([[Tom Noonan]]) and Olivia ([[Alisen Down]]). In the future timeline, Cole will also have to deal with his best friend Jos\u00e9 Ramse ([[Kirk Acevedo]]), and a man named Theodore Deacon ([[Todd Stashwick]]), who leads a brutal pack of scavengers from which Cole and Ramse fled. Meanwhile, Cole and Cassie will try to unveil the identity and whereabouts of the mysterious leader of the Army of the 12 Monkeys, who is only known as \"The Witness\" and who is always one step ahead of them.\n{{:List of 12 Monkeys episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Aaron Stanford]] as James Cole, a scavenger who travels back in time to stop the plague and redeem himself from his troubled past<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/12-monkeys-everything-need-know-season-two/ |title=12 Monkeys: everything you need to know for Season 2 |first=Ed |last=Gross |work=empireonline.com |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Amanda Schull]] as Cassandra \"Cassie\" Railly, a virologist who leaves a message about the origins of the plague that scientists recover in the future<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n* [[Kirk Acevedo]] as Jos\u00e9 Ramse (seasons 1\u20133;

Stanford, Schull, and Hampshire play reimagined versions of characters respectively portrayed by [[Bruce Willis]], [[Madeleine Stowe]], and [[Brad Pitt]] in the 1995 film. Stowe made a guest appearance in the second season in a small but pivotal role.\n\n[[Natalie Chaidez]] was the [[showrunner]] of ''12 Monkeys'' during its first season, working closely with creators Matalas and Fickett. For the second season, she stepped down to the role of consultant and Matalas and Fickett became showrunners. In the third and fourth seasons Fickett became a consultant, and Matalas was the sole showrunner. The series was produced by [[Atlas Entertainment]], which also made the 1995 film, and [[Universal Content Productions|Universal Cable Productions]]. [[Charles Roven]], producer of the original film, was one of the series [[executive producers]].\n\n''12 Monkeys'' premiered on January 16, 2015, with a 13-episode first season which received mixed to positive critical reception, and ended with the completion of its 11-episode fourth season on July 6, 2018, for a total of 47 episodes produced. From its second season and onward, it enjoyed more consistently favorable critical reception. The series won two awards for its [[cinematography]], one by each of the [[American Society of Cinematographers|American]] and [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers|Canadian Societies of Cinematographers]], and was nominated for a further four.\n\n==Plot==\n{{further|List of 12 Monkeys episodes}}\nIn the year 2043, [[Waste picker|scavenger]] James Cole ([[Aaron Stanford]]) has been recruited by a team of \"Project Splinter\" scientists led by physicist Katarina Jones ([[Barbara Sukowa]]), to [[Time travel|travel back in time]] to the year 2015, and stop the release of a deadly virus by the enigmatic organization known as the \"Army of the 12 Monkeys\". In Cole's original timeline, the virus caused a [[Pandemic|plague]] (Kalavirus) that resulted in the death of seven billion humans in the year 2017, and its on-going mutations will mean the eventual end of the human race. In the 2015 timeline, Cole will meet and enlist the help of brilliant [[virologist]] Dr. Cassandra \"Cassie\" Railly ([[Amanda Schull]]); the two are brought together because a recording mentioning Cole, that Cassie made after the viral outbreak, is uncovered by Katarina Jones in the future timeline, prompting her to select Cole for the mission. Cole will also encounter a seemingly unstable math genius named Jennifer Goines ([[Emily Hampshire]]), whose father Cole has been tasked to kill, Cassie's ex-boyfriend Aaron Marker ([[Noah Bean]]), and the dangerous high-ranking members of the Army of the 12 Monkeys, \"Pallid Man\" ([[Tom Noonan]]) and Olivia ([[Alisen Down]]). In the future timeline, Cole will also have to deal with his best friend Jos\u00e9 Ramse ([[Kirk Acevedo]]), and a man named Theodore Deacon ([[Todd Stashwick]]), who leads a brutal pack of scavengers from which Cole and Ramse fled. Meanwhile, Cole and Cassie will try to unveil the identity and whereabouts of the mysterious leader of the Army of the 12 Monkeys, who is only known as \"The Witness\" and who is always one step ahead of them.\n{{:List of 12 Monkeys episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Aaron Stanford]] as James Cole, a scavenger who travels back in time to stop the plague and redeem himself from his troubled past<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/12-monkeys-everything-need-know-season-two/ |title=12 Monkeys: everything you need to know for Season 2 |first=Ed |last=Gross |work=empireonline.com |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Amanda Schull]] as Cassandra \"Cassie\" Railly, a virologist who leaves a message about the origins of the plague that scientists recover in the future<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n* [[Kirk Acevedo]] as Jos\u00e9 Ramse (seasons 1\u20133;

Bharmaur is situated {{convert|75|km|mi}} to the east of the present day Chamba town. For three hundred years, kings of Rajput Dynasty ruled from their capital in Bharmour.<ref name=\"B1623\"/>\n\nHowever, in 920, Raja Sahil Varman (or Raja Sahila Verma), King of Bharmour, shifted his capital from Bharmour to a more centrally located plateau in the lower Ravi valley, and named the city Champavati, after his daughter.<ref name=\"B1623\"/> There is some variation in the story to how exactly this transition came about in the historical records of Chamba. One version tells how Varman, who, after being childless for a significant period, was blessed with ten sons and a daughter, named \"Champavati\". It was Champavati who urged her father to build a new capital town in the valley.<ref name=\"B1623\"/> However, obstacles stood in the way to relocating his capital, given that the king had previously granted the land in the modern Chamba vicinity to the Kanwan [[Brahmins]]. A solution was found in the form of offering a gift of eight copper coins called ''chaklis'' on the occasion of every marriage that took place in the Brahmin family, if they would agree to surrender their land to pave the way for the new capital.<ref name=\"B1623\"/> With the land thus obtained, the new capital was built and named as Champa after Chamapavati, the King's daughter, which, over the years, was simply shortened to \"Chamba'.<ref name=\"B1623\"/>\n\nA variation of this origin of Chamba is that it originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent.<ref>Bharati (2001), pp.23-24</ref> The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he was said to have heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals.<ref name=\"B24\">Bharati (2001), p.24</ref> The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter's honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King's daughter is venerated as a goddess.

It is named after Champavati, the daughter of King Sahil Varman, the founder of the temple. The temple holds great historical and religious relevance for many Hindus. Champavati Temple enshrines an idol of Goddess Mahisasuramardini, the avatar of Goddess Durga. According to the legend, the daughter of King Sahil Varman Champavati was a religious person and used to visit temples and sadhu's ashrams regularly.\n\nThe king, after getting suspicious of her actions, once followed her to a sadhu's place, with a dagger in his cloak. Once he reached the ashram, he found that there was no one inside. To his surprise, both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati had vanished. When he was about to return, he heard a voice saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, on the name of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities.\n\nThe king ordered the construction of the Champavati Temple. Now, the temple is under the Archaeological Survey of India, for its historical and archaeological importance. The major attraction of the temple is its Shikhara style architecture. Stone carved walls, full with sculptures, make the temple an attractive tourist spot. The temple has a large wheel on the rooftop, which adores it and makes it a distinguished temple in North India.

It is held annually in March\u2013April for four days to commemorate the sacrifice made by the queen of Chamba with her life, to bring water to the town. The legend associated with this festival and the Sui Mata temple, built in memory of the queen (wife of Raja Sahil Varman), relates to the sacrifice she made to fulfill a prophecy in a dream, which said that water from the Sarota stream could only be accessed through an aqueduct if the queen or her son was sacrificed. Rather than kill her own son she sacrificed her own life for the town. To commemorate this event, women and children take a lead role in the festival.

It was often tied or girdled with a band or ''patka'', as evidenced by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion.<ref name=\"S36\">Sharma (1997), p.36</ref> The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a ''[[chola]]'', tied around the waist with a black wool rope.<ref name=\"B212\"/> A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton ''maikhal'' sheet to wear over the head during the ''Nuwala'' ceremony to honour [[Lord Siva]]. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.<ref name=\"S36\"/>\n\n{{quotation|\"The Jakatas, the Milinda Panha and the Vinaya of the Mulasarvastivadins mention the beautifully embroidered Kotumbara clothes of the Audumbara country (Pathankot and Chamba) and the fine textiles captured in the lot of Kangra Fort in 1009 around the astonishment of the soldiers of Mahmud of Ghazni.

The most traditional dress worn by [[Hindu]] women, on special occasions, is the ''[[pashwaj]]''. ''Pashwaj'' is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a ''pairahan'', with a ''chadar'' or ''[[dupatta]]'' (stole) worn over the head.

However, the one difference is that the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called an ''angi'', worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common.<ref name=Dress/> Hindu men wear an ''angrakha'', long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small ''pagri'' (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.<ref name=Dress/>\n\n==Music of Chamba==\n\nDevotional songs known as 'Ainchali' are sung throughout the night. The 'Chella' is summoned who goes into a [[Trance]]as soon as the sacrifices are referred to [[Lord Shiva]]. He is said to be possessed of the Lord himself. He answers the questions put to him by members of the family and their friends.\n\nChambyal (people of Chamba) enjoy the traditional folk music of their area. This consists of folk songs, dances and folklores and these are accompanied by various musical instruments. Their love for folk music is evident from their keen interest in folk music which is different from that of other regions. Folk songs of Gaddis can be categorised as marriage songs, festivity songs, love songs.\n\n'''Marriage Songs'''\nThe theme of the marriage songs is mostly related to the selection of groom and the girl's wishes regarding it. The songs which are sung at the time of wedding ceremony are known as 'Charlai' and these songs depict that the relatives of the bride and groom seek the blessings from the God.\n\n'''Festivity Songs'''\nChambyals celebrate many fairs and festivals with great pump and show. They sing many songs which are usually accompanied by folk dances. Major folk songs are - 'Sukart and Ghanihar', 'Kunjadi Malhar' during Minjar Mela, 'Ainchali' on Nuala, songs related to [[Baisakhi]] at the time of 'Basoa' and 'Kunjadi' songs of the rainy season are sung during Patroru festival.\n\n'''Love Songs''' \nThese songs are of Shrinagar rasa.

Bharmaur is situated {{convert|75|km|mi}} to the east of the present day Chamba town. For three hundred years, kings of Rajput Dynasty ruled from their capital in Bharmour.<ref name=\"B1623\"/>\n\nHowever, in 920, Raja Sahil Varman (or Raja Sahila Verma), King of Bharmour, shifted his capital from Bharmour to a more centrally located plateau in the lower Ravi valley, and named the city Champavati, after his daughter.<ref name=\"B1623\"/> There is some variation in the story to how exactly this transition came about in the historical records of Chamba. One version tells how Varman, who, after being childless for a significant period, was blessed with ten sons and a daughter, named \"Champavati\". It was Champavati who urged her father to build a new capital town in the valley.<ref name=\"B1623\"/> However, obstacles stood in the way to relocating his capital, given that the king had previously granted the land in the modern Chamba vicinity to the Kanwan [[Brahmins]]. A solution was found in the form of offering a gift of eight copper coins called ''chaklis'' on the occasion of every marriage that took place in the Brahmin family, if they would agree to surrender their land to pave the way for the new capital.<ref name=\"B1623\"/> With the land thus obtained, the new capital was built and named as Champa after Chamapavati, the King's daughter, which, over the years, was simply shortened to \"Chamba'.<ref name=\"B1623\"/>\n\nA variation of this origin of Chamba is that it originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent.<ref>Bharati (2001), pp.23-24</ref> The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he was said to have heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals.<ref name=\"B24\">Bharati (2001), p.24</ref> The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter's honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King's daughter is venerated as a goddess.

It is named after Champavati, the daughter of King Sahil Varman, the founder of the temple. The temple holds great historical and religious relevance for many Hindus. Champavati Temple enshrines an idol of Goddess Mahisasuramardini, the avatar of Goddess Durga. According to the legend, the daughter of King Sahil Varman Champavati was a religious person and used to visit temples and sadhu's ashrams regularly.\n\nThe king, after getting suspicious of her actions, once followed her to a sadhu's place, with a dagger in his cloak. Once he reached the ashram, he found that there was no one inside. To his surprise, both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati had vanished. When he was about to return, he heard a voice saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, on the name of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further familial calamities.\n\nThe king ordered the construction of the Champavati Temple. Now, the temple is under the Archaeological Survey of India, for its historical and archaeological importance. The major attraction of the temple is its Shikhara style architecture. Stone carved walls, full with sculptures, make the temple an attractive tourist spot. The temple has a large wheel on the rooftop, which adores it and makes it a distinguished temple in North India. The Champavati Temple is often compared with Laxmi Narayan Temple, in its grandeur.\n\n===== Banni Mata Temple =====\n\nSee [[Banni Mata Temple]]\n\n====Lakshmi Narayan temples====\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| image1 = Laxminarayan temple of Chamba.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Chamba5.jpg\n| width2 = 175\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Laxmi Narayan temple in Chamba\n}}\nThe Lakshmi Narayan temples complex, devoted to the [[Vaishnavite]] sect, includes the main Lakshmi Narayan temple, built in the 10th century by Raja Sahil Verman.

Of particular note in this trade are the large plaques with reliefs, commonly used for wall decoration. The temple cupolas in Chamba district are often furnished with copper and brass items made in Chamba and often the golden [[kalasha]] or vessel crowning them is produced here.<ref name=\"ch\"/>\n\nChamba has its own unique traditional system of men's and women's footwear. Traditional footwear was originally made from locally produced leather but is today transported to Chamba from the south of India.<ref name=\"ch\"/> Women's footwear is embroidered as is \"vegetarian\" footwear which is purposefully made without leather for use in places where leather is prohibited for religious reasons. [[Handkerchief]]s and [[shawl]]s are also made in abundance in Chamba. Traditionally hand-spun, they are designed in such a way as to make both sides of the cloth look identical, and are beautifully embroidered.<ref name=\"ch\"/> Chamba shawls are woven on hand looms in wool and typically have a bright border in a traditional design.<ref name=\"ch\"/> A similar woven design is used for making caps.\n\nTraditional jewellery is made in gold and silver in Chamba as its pottery, typically kitchenware, utensils and earthen pots.<ref name=\"ch\"/> Given Chamba's history of new immigration from other parts of the country and [[Tibet]], a variety of influences can be seen in the pieces of jewellery that are produced in Chamba.<ref name=\"ch\"/> Chamba is also noted for its wood carvings, which, like the metalware is often used for iconography in temples, such as Chamunda Devi.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margabandhu, Chedarambattu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3AZuAAAAMAAJ&q=Chamba,+Himachal+Pradesh&dq=Chamba,+Himachal+Pradesh&cd=8|title=Indian Archaeological Heritage: Shri K.V.

A notable event of such fairs is when the \u2018chela\u2019. a subordinate of the deity who is being worshipped goes into a trance and answers the queries and prayers of the devotees.<ref name=fairs>{{Cite web |url=http://hpchamba.nic.in/Fairs&festivals.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020827235344/http://hpchamba.nic.in/Fairs%26festivals.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 August 2002 |title=Fairs in Chamba |publisher=National Informatics Centre:Government of Chamba district |accessdate=6 April 2010 }}</ref>\n\nAn important festival held in Chamba is known as the \"Suhi Mata Mela\". It is held annually in March\u2013April for four days to commemorate the sacrifice made by the queen of Chamba with her life, to bring water to the town. The legend associated with this festival and the Sui Mata temple, built in memory of the queen (wife of Raja Sahil Varman), relates to the sacrifice she made to fulfill a prophecy in a dream, which said that water from the Sarota stream could only be accessed through an aqueduct if the queen or her son was sacrificed. Rather than kill her own son she sacrificed her own life for the town. To commemorate this event, women and children take a lead role in the festival. An image of Champavati, with banners of the Rajput solar emblem, are taken by them in a procession, dancing and singing, through the Chaugan to the Suhi Mata temple.<ref name=places/><ref name=\"station\"/><ref name=fairs/>\n\nAnother popular festival held in Chamba is the \"Minjar Mela\", held on the second Sunday of the [[Shravana]] month, corresponding to the month of August in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. It marks the triumph of the Raja of Chamba over the ruler of [[Trigarta]] (now called as [[Kangra district|Kangra]]), in 935 AD and also celebrates the paddy and maize crops grown at this time of the year.<ref name=\"ilct\"/> The festival commences with offerings of 'minjar', consisting of a bunch of paddy plant and golden silk wrapped in red fabric.<ref name=\"ilct\"/> The offerings also include a [[rupee]], a seasonal fruit, and a [[coconut]].<ref name=\"ilct\"/> This occasion is also celebrated with a flag hoisting ceremony at the Chaugan that initiates a week of cultural and social programmes.<ref name=\"ilct\"/> The image of the deity, Lord Raghuvira, and more than 200 other deities, are taken in a procession, in a chariot pulled by ropes. Folk dances and music performances known as 'Kunjari Malhar' are part of the festivities. On the last day of the festival, a parade is held from the Akhand Chandi Palace to Ravi River, where offerings are made to the river.<ref name=\"ilct\"/> This commemorates an event in which Raja Sahil Verman changed the course of the river, to make the Hari Rai temple accessible to all devotees.<ref name=fairs/><ref name=Minjar>{{Cite web|url=http://www.himachalpradeshtourismindia.com/chamba/minjarmelachamba.php|title=MinjarMelaChamba|accessdate=6 April 2010|publisher=Himachal Tourism}}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nChamba and the surrounding district have many local customs in dancing, illustrating the differences in geographical, anthropological and social cultures and religious beliefs in the area.<ref name=\"Sharma 04 p50\">Sharma (2004), p.50</ref>  A solo dance or a dance of two people such as the ''Pharati'' or ''Khad-dumbi'' is commonly performed during the ''Nuwala'' ceremony and other important occasions, such as marriages etc. and the ''Dangri'' and ''Sikri'' are said to be of note.<ref name=\"Sharma 04 p50\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Pramanik, Prabal|url=http://www.chambaheritage.net/festival.html|title=Festivals of Chamba|publisher=Chamba Heritage|accessdate=6 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029162726/http://www.chambaheritage.net/festival.html|archive-date=29 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Notable male dances include the Gaddi and Gujjar dances, ''Dandaras'', ''Nat'', ''Ghorda'', ''Nachan'', ''Dharumsde'', the ''Khad-dumbi'' and the ''Chhinjhati''.<ref>Sharma (2004), p.08</ref> Notable female dances include  the ''Ghurei'', ''Dangi'' and ''Kikli'', whilst  dances such as the ''Shain'', ''Dhamal'', ''Sohal'', ''Sal Kukdi Nachan'', ''Ratege'' and ''Til-Chauti'' are performed by both sexes.<ref name=\"Sharma 04 p07\">Sharma (2004), p.07</ref> Several forms of masked dance are also performed in Chamba, such as the ''Chhatradhi Jatar''.<ref name=\"Sharma 04 p07\"/>\n\n===Costumes===\nAncient people of Chamba were known to have worn a fine woolen blanket or ''chadar'' around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or ''patka'', as evidenced by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion.<ref name=\"S36\">Sharma (1997), p.36</ref> The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a ''[[chola]]'', tied around the waist with a black wool rope.<ref name=\"B212\"/> A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton ''maikhal'' sheet to wear over the head during the ''Nuwala'' ceremony to honour [[Lord Siva]]. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.<ref name=\"S36\"/>\n\n{{quotation|\"The Jakatas, the Milinda Panha and the Vinaya of the Mulasarvastivadins mention the beautifully embroidered Kotumbara clothes of the Audumbara country (Pathankot and Chamba) and the fine textiles captured in the lot of Kangra Fort in 1009 around the astonishment of the soldiers of Mahmud of Ghazni. A heavier, though not less luxurious type of embriodered dresses can be traced on the fountain stones, which had been erected by the local aristocracy of Churah, in western Chamba in the 11th to 12th centuries.\" - [[Hermann Goetz]]<ref name=\"S36\"/>}}\n\nGiven the history of migrants arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba has a variety of traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by [[Hindu]] women, on special occasions, is the ''[[pashwaj]]''. ''Pashwaj'' is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a ''pairahan'', with a ''chadar'' or ''[[dupatta]]'' (stole) worn over the head. The lower half of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a ''[[suthan]]''.<ref name=Dress>{{Cite web |url=http://hpchamba.nic.in/dress&ornament.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020828004531/http://hpchamba.nic.in/dress%26ornament.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 August 2002 |title=Dress and Ornaments |accessdate=6 April 2010 |publisher=National Informatics Centre }}</ref>\n\n[[Muslim]] women also generally wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one difference is that the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called an ''angi'', worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common.<ref name=Dress/> Hindu men wear an ''angrakha'', long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small ''pagri'' (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.<ref name=Dress/>\n\n==Music of Chamba==\n\nDevotional songs known as 'Ainchali' are sung throughout the night. The 'Chella' is summoned who goes into a [[Trance]]as soon as the sacrifices are referred to [[Lord Shiva]]. He is said to be possessed of the Lord himself. He answers the questions put to him by members of the family and their friends.\n\nChambyal (people of Chamba) enjoy the traditional folk music of their area. This consists of folk songs, dances and folklores and these are accompanied by various musical instruments. Their love for folk music is evident from their keen interest in folk music which is different from that of other regions. Folk songs of Gaddis can be categorised as marriage songs, festivity songs, love songs.\n\n'''Marriage Songs'''\nThe theme of the marriage songs is mostly related to the selection of groom and the girl's wishes regarding it. The songs which are sung at the time of wedding ceremony are known as 'Charlai' and these songs depict that the relatives of the bride and groom seek the blessings from the God.\n\n'''Festivity Songs'''\nChambyals celebrate many fairs and festivals with great pump and show. They sing many songs which are usually accompanied by folk dances. Major folk songs are - 'Sukart and Ghanihar', 'Kunjadi Malhar' during Minjar Mela, 'Ainchali' on Nuala, songs related to [[Baisakhi]] at the time of 'Basoa' and 'Kunjadi' songs of the rainy season are sung during Patroru festival.\n\n'''Love Songs''' \nThese songs are of Shrinagar rasa. Mostly the feelings of separation, hard life of Gaddis, their social bindings and the tales of sacrifice, unsuccessful love etc. are depicted through these songs. Famous Love songs are, 'Kunju and Chanchlo', 'Phulmu and Ranjhu', 'Raja Gaddan' and 'Bhunku Gaddi' that are very popular among the city and the state.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CDxa5G2S0AwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Tribal Melodies of Himachal Pradesh: Gaddi folk music|last=Sharma|first=Manorama|year=1998|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=9788170249122}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|author=Archer, W.

WZID is located on Commercial Street in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]].  Its signal can be heard as far south as the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], as far east as southern [[Maine]] and as far west as [[Vermont]]. WZID also broadcasts in HD Radio.\n\n==History==\nThe station was born October 2, 1947 as '''WKBR-FM'''. Throughout the 1960s, and very early 1970s, WKBR-FM simulcasted the [[top 40]] format of WKBR 1250 (now [[WGAM]]), providing that station with significant extended coverage. In July 1971, WKBR-FM became '''WZID''', and the format was flipped to [[beautiful music]].  In the 1980s, instrumental [[easy listening]] music was scaled back, with soft vocal hits added, to the point where the station evolved into an adult contemporary station.  In October 1990, Sunshine Broadcasting of New Hampshire Inc. announced the sale of WZID and 1370 [[WFEA (AM)]] to Saga Communications Inc. of [[Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan]]. The sale was finalized April 16, 1991. Saga Communications of New England LLC operates the station today. WZID's President and General Manager is Bob Cox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manfrommars.com/wfea.html|title=WFEA History|accessdate=2008-05-04}}</ref>\n\n==Translators==\n[[File:WZID-HD2 94.1-103.1 logo.png|thumb|left|160px|Former logo for WZID-HD2, used from January 2009 until the split of FM translator W276BJ 103.1 FM Concord on February 1, 2017 to simulcast WZID-HD3 \"103.1 The Outlaw\".]]\nWZID used to be heard on translator station, W270AH 101.9 in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]]. However in 2008, Saga Communications filed a series of minor translator applications which moved the translator into the [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]] radio market as W276CB, a translator of Saga radio station [[WKNE]]'s HD3 channel as \"Kool 103.1\" (now [[WINQ-FM]]'s HD2 channel as \"WINK Classic Country 103.1FM\").\n\nUp until mid-January 2009, WZID had two more translators, W231BR 94.1 in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] at 250 watts and W276BJ 103.1 in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], also at 250 watts, but in January 2009 those two translators were turned into the new \"Hot Hits 94.1 and 103.1\", a simulcast of WZID's HD-2 channel, which is a [[top 40]] station broadcasting [[Dial Global]]'s [[Hits Now!]] format; branding themselves as the new hit music station in New Hampshire. Saga Communications obviously had been planning this out for some time because both the translator's power was recently increased from low power to 250 watts.

WZID is located on Commercial Street in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]].  Its signal can be heard as far south as the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], as far east as southern [[Maine]] and as far west as [[Vermont]]. WZID also broadcasts in HD Radio.\n\n==History==\nThe station was born October 2, 1947 as '''WKBR-FM'''. Throughout the 1960s, and very early 1970s, WKBR-FM simulcasted the [[top 40]] format of WKBR 1250 (now [[WGAM]]), providing that station with significant extended coverage. In July 1971, WKBR-FM became '''WZID''', and the format was flipped to [[beautiful music]].  In the 1980s, instrumental [[easy listening]] music was scaled back, with soft vocal hits added, to the point where the station evolved into an adult contemporary station.  In October 1990, Sunshine Broadcasting of New Hampshire Inc. announced the sale of WZID and 1370 [[WFEA (AM)]] to Saga Communications Inc. of [[Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan]]. The sale was finalized April 16, 1991. Saga Communications of New England LLC operates the station today. WZID's President and General Manager is Bob Cox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manfrommars.com/wfea.html|title=WFEA History|accessdate=2008-05-04}}</ref>\n\n==Translators==\n[[File:WZID-HD2 94.1-103.1 logo.png|thumb|left|160px|Former logo for WZID-HD2, used from January 2009 until the split of FM translator W276BJ 103.1 FM Concord on February 1, 2017 to simulcast WZID-HD3 \"103.1 The Outlaw\".]]\nWZID used to be heard on translator station, W270AH 101.9 in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]].

Therapeutic abortion to save a mother's life was permitted between 1837 and 1936. <ref name=\"c355-06\">{{cite court|court=Constitutional Court|vol=Sentencia C-355/06|date=10 May 2006|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/relatoria/2006/c-355-06.htm}}</ref> As of 2006, only in the following circumstances, which remain in effect to this day. These three exceptions are: The continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the life or health of the mother; The existence of life-threatening fetal malformations; The pregnancy is the result of rape, non-consensual artificial insemination or incest.\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1837 and 1936 penal legislation authorized [[therapeutic abortion]] while banning all other forms of abortion, regardless of whether the abortion consented or not. The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \"generally condemned\" by the [[Catholic Church]], the official religion at the time.<ref name=c355-06 /> In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful).<ref name=abortocolombiabook>{{cite book|last1=Molina Betancur|first1=Carlos Mario|title=El derecho al aborto en Colombia.

The law also provided for reduced sentences, of 3\u20136 months (5\u201310 months if the abortion was successful), in the case of \"honest women of good reputation\" who received an abortion to \"conceal their frailty\" (''aborto honoris causa'').<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nA very conservative 1922 law to reform the penal code would have eliminated therapeutic abortion and punished women who sought an abortion but maintained the ''aborto honoris causa'', but the law never entered into force. The ''aborto honoris causa'', a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour.<ref name=abortocolombiabook /> The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl.<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=abortocolombiabook />\n\nThe 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the ''aborto honoris causa'' and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000.\n\n\n\n'''<big>Decree 100 of 1980.

The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts. Furthermore, it opined that \"the life of the unborn embodies a fundamental value, for the hope of its existence as a person, and its apparent helplessness requires special attention from the State.\"<ref name=c133-94>{{cite court|vol=Sentencia C-133/94|court=Constitutional Court|date=17 March 1994|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm}}</ref> Thus, Colombia's abortion legislation was constitutional under the State's obligation to protect the life of \"all persons\", which, at the time, the Court claimed \"obviously\" protected life during its formation and development given that these stages were condition for the viability of birth, the origin of the [[Legal personality|legal existence of a person]].<ref name=c133-94 /> In addition, the Court said, if the Constitution gives couples the right to decide their number of children, this right could only be exercised prior to conception since conception creates a being which is existentially distinct from the mother.<ref name=c133-94 />\n\n===Legal situation prior to 2006===\n\nAbortion was legally regulated by articles 122 through 124 of the Colombian Penal Code (law 599 of 2000). Article 122 of the Penal Code punished women who self-induced or consented to someone else inducing her abortion to imprisonment for a period of one to three years, increased to a term of 16 to 54 months by law 890 of 2004.<ref name=\"penalcode\" /> Article 123 punished those who practised an abortion without the woman's consent ''or'' on a girl under fourteen years of age to a period of imprisonment of 4 to 10 years, increased to 64 to 180 months by the 2004 law. Article 124, finally, allowed for attenuating circumstances: the prescribed penalty for abortion would be reduced by three quarters when the pregnancy was the result of rape or non-consensual artificial insemination.<ref name=penalcode>{{cite act|title=Ley por la cual se expide el C\u00f3digo Penal|type=Law|number=599|language=Spanish|date=2000|article=122-124|url=http://www.secretariasenado.gov.co/senado/basedoc/ley_0599_2000_pr004.html#122}}</ref>\n\n==Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez's case==\n\nIn 2006, the case of [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]] woman [[Martha Gonzalez|Martha Sulay Gonz\u00e1lez]] brought national attention to the issue of abortion in the country. Martha Sulay, already a mother of three, was diagnosed with [[cervical cancer]] while pregnant with her fourth child in 2004 (despite prior [[tubal ligation]]).<ref name=\":0\" /> Her requests for [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiotherapy]] were denied, as they would entail the termination of her pregnancy, which was illegal.

Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.<ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception.\n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration.\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request).<ref>{{cite book|title=Determinantes del aborto inseguro y barreras de acceso para la atenci\u00f3n de la interrupci\u00f3n voluntaria del embarazo en mujeres colombianas|date=2014|publisher=Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social and Fondo de Poblaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA)|location=Bogot\u00e1|isbn=978-958-873-575-7|url=http://profamilia.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Determinantes%20del%20aborto%20inseguro%20y%20barreras%20de%20acceso%20para%20la%20atencio%CC%81n%20de%20la%20IVE%20en%20mujeres%20colombianas.pdf|ref=profamilia publication}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections. The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Center Praises Momentous Decision in Abortion Case in Colombia|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-praises-momentous-decision-in-abortion-case-in-colombia|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\nIn October 2013, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures.<ref name=abortionstats>{{cite web|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Colombia|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Colombia.html|website=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the [[Colombian Ministry of Health|Ministry of Health]], which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012.

TO BE RESOLVED in the judgment C-591 of 1995 by means of which it was decided \"Articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code be declared EXEQUIBLE\", regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution. Second. Declare INHIBITED to issue a substantive pronouncement, due to the substantive ineptitude of the lawsuit, regarding the charges made against articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code (for violation of articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95 of the Political Charter, as well as of the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the United Nations Convention against Torture). Summary of the ruling Citizen Natalia Bernal Cano demanded the constitutionality of articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code. In his opinion, limiting the rights of those who are about to be born, does not know that they are \"innocent living beings capable of feeling pain and that they are attacked with abortive methods when they are in the womb because their human person status is not recognized, holder of rights and obligations \u201d3. Consequently, he maintained that the defendant provisions violate the provisions of the Constitution in its articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50, 94 and 95; the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Court concluded that regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution, the phenomenon of constitutional res judicata operated for what was resolved in judgment C-591 of 1995, reiterated in judgment C-327 of 2016. In effect, it found that on that occasion the Court ruled regarding the constitutionality of the same legal provisions, for the same reasons stated in this application. Additionally, it clarified that the reasons stated by the plaintiff are not sufficient to weaken the existence of res judicata. Therefore, it was resolved in that judgment. On the other hand, the Court determined that the charges for ignorance of the Constitution in its articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95, of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the Convention of the United Nations against Torture did not comply with the minimum requirements demanded by constitutional jurisprudence.

The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \"generally condemned\" by the [[Catholic Church]], the official religion at the time.<ref name=c355-06 /> In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful).<ref name=abortocolombiabook>{{cite book|last1=Molina Betancur|first1=Carlos Mario|title=El derecho al aborto en Colombia.

The law also provided for reduced sentences, of 3\u20136 months (5\u201310 months if the abortion was successful), in the case of \"honest women of good reputation\" who received an abortion to \"conceal their frailty\" (''aborto honoris causa'').<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nA very conservative 1922 law to reform the penal code would have eliminated therapeutic abortion and punished women who sought an abortion but maintained the ''aborto honoris causa'', but the law never entered into force. The ''aborto honoris causa'', a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour.<ref name=abortocolombiabook /> The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl.<ref name=c355-06 /><ref name=abortocolombiabook />\n\nThe 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the ''aborto honoris causa'' and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000.\n\n\n\n'''<big>Decree 100 of 1980.

The majority opinion of the court contended the [[Constitution of Colombia|1991 Constitution]], which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \"primacy and inviolability of life\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts. Furthermore, it opined that \"the life of the unborn embodies a fundamental value, for the hope of its existence as a person, and its apparent helplessness requires special attention from the State.\"<ref name=c133-94>{{cite court|vol=Sentencia C-133/94|court=Constitutional Court|date=17 March 1994|url=http://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm}}</ref> Thus, Colombia's abortion legislation was constitutional under the State's obligation to protect the life of \"all persons\", which, at the time, the Court claimed \"obviously\" protected life during its formation and development given that these stages were condition for the viability of birth, the origin of the [[Legal personality|legal existence of a person]].<ref name=c133-94 /> In addition, the Court said, if the Constitution gives couples the right to decide their number of children, this right could only be exercised prior to conception since conception creates a being which is existentially distinct from the mother.<ref name=c133-94 />\n\n===Legal situation prior to 2006===\n\nAbortion was legally regulated by articles 122 through 124 of the Colombian Penal Code (law 599 of 2000).

Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M\u00f3nica Roa of the [[Women's Link Worldwide]] NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case.<ref name=elpais /> M\u00f3nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'') and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was [[Proportionality (law)|disproportional]], violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life).<ref name=c355-06 /> Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally-recognized autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 /> Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nSupporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law).<ref name=c355-06 /> Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nReligious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Opus Dei]], as well their allies in [[Congress of Colombia|Congress]].<ref name=elpais /> During the [[Colombian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential campaign]], incumbent President [[\u00c1lvaro Uribe]] said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second-place finisher [[Carlos Gaviria D\u00edaz|Carlos Gaviria]], a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code.<ref name=elpais />\n\nThe Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases.<ref name=c355-06 /> In its intervention before the Court, the [[Ombudsman's Office of Colombia|Ombudsman]] (''Defensor del Pueblo''), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \"merely biological\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality.<ref name=c355-06 /> The [[Ministry of Social Protection (Colombia)|Ministry of Social Protection]] primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe [[Episcopal Conference of Colombia]] opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The [[Magisterium]] assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> The Episcopal Conference argued that the \"original and inalienable right to life\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], which states in article 4.1 that \"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including [[Pedro Rubiano Sa\u00e9nz]], [[Archbishop of Bogot\u00e1]], urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe [[Inspector General of Colombia]], [[Edgardo Jos\u00e9 Maya Villaz\u00f3n|Edgardo Maya Villaz\u00f3n]], asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity.<ref name=c355-06 /> The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights.\n\n==Sentence C-355 of 2006==\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances.\n\nThe majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including:<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n*'''Life and the right to live:''' The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn.<ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n*'''Life in [[International human rights law]]:''' The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person. The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \"in general\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \"in general\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception. \n*'''Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law:''' Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes.\n*'''Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters:''' While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (''libre desarrollo de la personalidad'', individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law.\n\nConcretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother.<ref name=\"c355-06\" /> The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\"<ref name=c355-06 /> Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court also struck down the phrase \"or in women younger than fourteen\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\nThe Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances.<ref name=c355-06 />\n\n==Current legal situation==\n\nTo date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. <ref name=\"c355-06\" />\n\n===Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent===\n\nAbortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration.\n\n===Maternal life or health===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Fetal malformations===\n\nAbortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals.\n\n===Conscientious objection===\n\nIn sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that [[juridical persons]] do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to [[natural persons]]. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions.\n\n==='''Other circumstances'''===\n\nIn the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion.\n\n==Barriers and obstacles to abortion==\n\nDespite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request).<ref>{{cite book|title=Determinantes del aborto inseguro y barreras de acceso para la atenci\u00f3n de la interrupci\u00f3n voluntaria del embarazo en mujeres colombianas|date=2014|publisher=Ministerio de Salud y Protecci\u00f3n Social and Fondo de Poblaci\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas (UNFPA)|location=Bogot\u00e1|isbn=978-958-873-575-7|url=http://profamilia.org.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Determinantes%20del%20aborto%20inseguro%20y%20barreras%20de%20acceso%20para%20la%20atencio%CC%81n%20de%20la%20IVE%20en%20mujeres%20colombianas.pdf|ref=profamilia publication}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections. The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy \u2026 it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Center Praises Momentous Decision in Abortion Case in Colombia|url=http://www.reproductiverights.org/press-room/center-praises-momentous-decision-in-abortion-case-in-colombia|website=Center for Reproductive Rights|accessdate=14 January 2016|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\nIn October 2013, the [[Guttmacher Institute]] reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures.<ref name=abortionstats>{{cite web|title=Unintended Pregnancy and Induced Abortion in Colombia|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-pregnancy-abortion-Colombia.html|website=Guttmacher Institute|accessdate=14 January 2016}}</ref> These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the [[Colombian Ministry of Health|Ministry of Health]], which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012.

TO BE RESOLVED in the judgment C-591 of 1995 by means of which it was decided \"Articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code be declared EXEQUIBLE\", regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution. Second. Declare INHIBITED to issue a substantive pronouncement, due to the substantive ineptitude of the lawsuit, regarding the charges made against articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code (for violation of articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95 of the Political Charter, as well as of the provisions of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the United Nations Convention against Torture). Summary of the ruling Citizen Natalia Bernal Cano demanded the constitutionality of articles 90, 91 and 93 of the Civil Code. In his opinion, limiting the rights of those who are about to be born, does not know that they are \"innocent living beings capable of feeling pain and that they are attacked with abortive methods when they are in the womb because their human person status is not recognized, holder of rights and obligations \u201d3. Consequently, he maintained that the defendant provisions violate the provisions of the Constitution in its articles 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50, 94 and 95; the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Court concluded that regarding the charges for ignorance of articles 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 94 of the Constitution, the phenomenon of constitutional res judicata operated for what was resolved in judgment C-591 of 1995, reiterated in judgment C-327 of 2016. In effect, it found that on that occasion the Court ruled regarding the constitutionality of the same legal provisions, for the same reasons stated in this application. Additionally, it clarified that the reasons stated by the plaintiff are not sufficient to weaken the existence of res judicata. Therefore, it was resolved in that judgment. On the other hand, the Court determined that the charges for ignorance of the Constitution in its articles 4, 42, 44, 47, 49, 50 and 95, of the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of the Convention of the United Nations against Torture did not comply with the minimum requirements demanded by constitutional jurisprudence. '''Specifically, it maintained that they do not meet the requirements of certainty, clarity, specificity and sufficiency, which is why it declared itself inhibited from issuing a substantive pronouncement.'''\n\n\n\n\n==References==\n<ref>{{cite web |title=COMUNICADO NO. 11 |url=https://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/comunicados/Comunicado%20No.%2011%20del%2002%20de%20marzo%20de%202020.pdf |website=CORTE CONSTITUCIONAL DE COLOMBIA |publisher=CORTE CONSTITUCIONAL DE COLOMBIA}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |title=DERECHO A LA VIDA-Naturaleza/NASCITURUS-Protecci\u00f3n/ABORTO-Penalizaci\u00f3n |url=https://www.corteconstitucional.gov.co/RELATORIA/1994/C-133-94.htm |website=Sentencia No. C-133/94 |publisher=Alejandro Martinez Caballero}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |title=En Colombia hay 502 menores criminalizadas por abortar |url=https://elpais.com/sociedad/2019/09/30/actualidad/1569863503_607122.html |website=El Pa\u00eds |publisher=Catalina Oquendo}}</ref>\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abortion]]\n*[[:Category:Abortion by country|Abortion by country]]\n*[[Abortion law]]\n\n{{Abortion in South America}}\n{{Abortion}}\n\n[[Category:Abortion in Colombia| ]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellac99", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Colombia"}
