Licensed to [[Belmont, North Carolina]], United States, it serves the [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]/[[Gastonia, North Carolina|Gastonia]] area. The station is currently owned by WHVN Inc.  \n\n==History==\nWCGC was started by Mr. Robert Richard Hilker. The 5,000-watt radio station was put on the air with a transmitter he built from a Heathkit model. He started and applied to the FCC for licensing of the radio station. Mr Hilker owned WCGC and with that built Suburban Radio Group which owned and operated 11 AM and FM radio stations and also put on two television stations; WJZY in Charlotte and another in Morehead City. At the time of Mr. Hilker's death the radio station was still using the transmitter he built as a backup for the now computerized WCGC. Born in Winston-Salem, he served in the U.S. Navy and established Cablevision Companies in Gaston County and the Lake Norman area as well at Charlotte television station WJZY-TV. He was past Chairman of the National Association of Broadcasters Radio Board, served on the boards of numerous national broadcasting associations and civic organizations and was inducted into the N.C. Broadcasters Hall of Fame\n\nEbb Gantt, who played football for Belmont High School and [[Belmont Abbey College]], later became the radio voice for both teams (the high school later consolidated with [[Cramerton, North Carolina|Cramerton]] High to form [[South Point High School (North Carolina)|South Point High School]], whose games Gantt and WCGC carried) as well as [[Davidson College]], during his years as  a WCGC sportscaster, beginning in the late 1950s.

Mintzer said WCGC broadcast [[disclaimer]]s telling listeners that callers' opinions were not those of the station.
