This also includes the hotel and bar staff, construction workers, and drivers who are required to work in/for the restaurants and other services accommodating these visitors.

Today, the citizens of Ku\u015fadas\u0131 often shorten the town's name to ''Ada''.\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Ku\u015fadas\u0131 plaj.JPG|thumb|left|A beach in Ku\u015fadas\u0131, with [[G\u00fcvercinada]] island seen in the background, at right.]]\nThe area has been a centre of art and culture since some of the earliest recorded history, and has been settled by many civilizations since being founded by the [[Leleges]] people in 3000 BC. Later settlers include the [[Aeolians]] in the 11th century BC and [[Ionians]] in the 9th. Originally, seamen and traders built a number of settlements along the coastline, including Neopolis.\n\nAn outpost of [[Ephesus]] in ancient [[Ionia]], known as [[Pygela]] (\u03a0\u03cd\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1) was located in the area between the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes]] (Maeander) and [[Gediz River|Gediz]] (Hermos) rivers. The original Neopolis, is thought to have been founded on the nearby point of Y\u0131lanc\u0131 Burnu. Later settlements were probably built on the hillside of Pilavtepe, in the district called And\u0131zkulesi today. Ku\u015fadas\u0131 was a minor port frequented by vessels trading along the Aegean coast. In antiquity it was overshadowed by [[Ephesus]], until Ephesus' harbor silted up. From the 7th century BC onwards the coast was ruled by [[Lydians]] from their capital at [[Sardis]], then from 546 BC the [[Persia]]ns, and from 334 BC, along with all of Anatolia, the coast was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. From that point on the coastal cities in [[Anatolia]] became a centre of [[Hellenistic]] culture.\n\n===Rome and Christianity===\nThe [[Roman Empire]] took possession of the coast in the 2nd century BC and made it their provincial capital<ref>[http://www.aboutkusadasi.com/ephesus/st-john.html St. John - History]</ref> in the early years of [[Christianity]].  [[Saint John the Evangelist]] and (according to Roman Catholic<!--and probably Islam, but NOT Orthodox Christians--> [[sacred tradition]]) the [[Virgin Mary]] both came to live in the area, which in the Christian era became known as \"Ania\".\n\nAs [[Byzantine]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] shippers began to trade along the coast, the port was re-founded (by the name of ''Scala Nova'' or ''Scala Nuova'', meaning \"New Port\"), a garrison was placed on the island, and the town centre shifted from the hillside to the coast.\n\n===The Turkish era===\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk Monument, Ku\u015fadas\u0131 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Atat\u00fcrk]] Memorial in Ku\u015fadas\u0131]]\n[[File:Ku\u015fadas\u0131 genel.JPG|thumb|right|A view of the town center, with the Clock Tower seen at right.]]\nLong afterwards, in 1834, the castle and garrison on the island were rebuilt and expanded, becoming the focus of the town. This was to such an extent that people began to refer to the whole town as Ku\u015fadas\u0131 (bird island).  However, in the 19th century, trade began to decline in favor of other nearby cities with the opening of the [[\u0130zmir]]-[[Sel\u00e7uk]]-[[Ayd\u0131n]] railway, which forwent Ku\u015fadas\u0131.<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref><!---this has the advantage of being in English, but strictly speaking not an allowable reference.

Today, the citizens of Ku\u015fadas\u0131 often shorten the town's name to ''Ada''.\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[File:Ku\u015fadas\u0131 plaj.JPG|thumb|left|A beach in Ku\u015fadas\u0131, with [[G\u00fcvercinada]] island seen in the background, at right.]]\nThe area has been a centre of art and culture since some of the earliest recorded history, and has been settled by many civilizations since being founded by the [[Leleges]] people in 3000 BC. Later settlers include the [[Aeolians]] in the 11th century BC and [[Ionians]] in the 9th. Originally, seamen and traders built a number of settlements along the coastline, including Neopolis.\n\nAn outpost of [[Ephesus]] in ancient [[Ionia]], known as [[Pygela]] (\u03a0\u03cd\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1) was located in the area between the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes]] (Maeander) and [[Gediz River|Gediz]] (Hermos) rivers. The original Neopolis, is thought to have been founded on the nearby point of Y\u0131lanc\u0131 Burnu. Later settlements were probably built on the hillside of Pilavtepe, in the district called And\u0131zkulesi today. Ku\u015fadas\u0131 was a minor port frequented by vessels trading along the Aegean coast. In antiquity it was overshadowed by [[Ephesus]], until Ephesus' harbor silted up. From the 7th century BC onwards the coast was ruled by [[Lydians]] from their capital at [[Sardis]], then from 546 BC the [[Persia]]ns, and from 334 BC, along with all of Anatolia, the coast was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. From that point on the coastal cities in [[Anatolia]] became a centre of [[Hellenistic]] culture.\n\n===Rome and Christianity===\nThe [[Roman Empire]] took possession of the coast in the 2nd century BC and made it their provincial capital<ref>[http://www.aboutkusadasi.com/ephesus/st-john.html St. John - History]</ref> in the early years of [[Christianity]].  [[Saint John the Evangelist]] and (according to Roman Catholic<!--and probably Islam, but NOT Orthodox Christians--> [[sacred tradition]]) the [[Virgin Mary]] both came to live in the area, which in the Christian era became known as \"Ania\".\n\nAs [[Byzantine]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] shippers began to trade along the coast, the port was re-founded (by the name of ''Scala Nova'' or ''Scala Nuova'', meaning \"New Port\"), a garrison was placed on the island, and the town centre shifted from the hillside to the coast.\n\n===The Turkish era===\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk Monument, Ku\u015fadas\u0131 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Atat\u00fcrk]] Memorial in Ku\u015fadas\u0131]]\n[[File:Ku\u015fadas\u0131 genel.JPG|thumb|right|A view of the town center, with the Clock Tower seen at right.]]\nLong afterwards, in 1834, the castle and garrison on the island were rebuilt and expanded, becoming the focus of the town. This was to such an extent that people began to refer to the whole town as Ku\u015fadas\u0131 (bird island).  However, in the 19th century, trade began to decline in favor of other nearby cities with the opening of the [[\u0130zmir]]-[[Sel\u00e7uk]]-[[Ayd\u0131n]] railway, which forwent Ku\u015fadas\u0131.<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref><!---this has the advantage of being in English, but strictly speaking not an allowable reference.

They first appeared in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] video game ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as the first enemy players encounter. They have appeared outside video games, including in film, television, and other media. They are usually brown and are most commonly seen walking around aimlessly, often as an obstacle, in video games. They were included late in the development of ''Super Mario Bros.'' as a simple, easy to defeat enemy.\n\nThe species is considered one of the most iconic elements of the ''Mario'' series, appearing in nearly every game in the series, and is often ranked amongst the most famous enemies in video games. In 2009, [[Crave Online]] described it as the series' \"everyman.\" It has been compared to other generic enemies in video games, such as the \"[[List of Mega Man characters#Met|Met]]\" enemy from the [[Mega Man (series)|''Mega Man'' series]]. The video game incarnation has been made into several [[plush toys]].\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Shiitakegrowing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[shiitake]], on which the Goomba is based.

As a result, the designers decided to introduce the Goomba as a basic enemy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGRJRUWafY|title=Miyamoto on World 1-1: How Nintendo made Mario's most iconic level|last=Eurogamer|date=7 September 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> However, they had very little space left in the game. They used a single image twice to convey the notion that the Goombas are walking, rotating it back and forth, causing it to look lopsided as it walks and giving the appearance of a trot. The Goomba's resemblance to the Super Mushroom forced designers to change the mechanics and appearance of the Super Mushroom. They used the Goomba's ability to be jumped on and defeated to teach players how to deal with enemies and to not fear the Super Mushroom.\n\nGoombas resemble [[shiitake]],<ref name=\"shiitake\">{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros.

In the 2D games, they walk aimlessly in a straight line, turning only at walls. They can be defeated by jumping on them, which flattens them. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', and all their 3D Mario appearances since, they will pursue Mario when he is near (instead of just walking aimlessly). In ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', Goombas are not present, but an enemy called the Strollin' Stu is described in ''The Perfect Guide of Super Mario Sunshine'' as the \"Isle Delfino versions of Goombas\". In ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', Goombas wear hats that depend on what kingdom they are in.\n\nSeveral variations of the Goomba have appeared. There are larger versions called Big Goombas or Grand Goombas, and smaller versions called Mini Goombas or Microgoombas. In one level of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Goombas can be seen wearing a shoe called \"Kuribo's Shoe\".<ref name=\"toastyfrog\"/> ''[[Super Mario World]]'' replaces the normal Goomba with a more round version, later named Galoombas. ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' features a type of Goomba called the Goombo (also called Chibibo). Other variations include Jack O'Goombas (first seen in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''), Bone Goombas (first seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''), Tail Goombas (first seen in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]''), Goombrats (first seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]''), and Cat Goombas (first seen in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''). Some games also feature stacks of Goombas called Goomba Towers. A giant goomba called Mega Goomba appears as a boss in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]''. In ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', Goombas wear hats that depend on what kingdom they are in. They can be captured, which allows them to form Goomba Towers. \n\nGoombas appear in each of the [[Mario role-playing games|''Mario'' role-playing games]]. ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' introduces the first non-hostile Goombas, while the follow-up game ''[[Paper Mario]]'' introduces a Goomba village, and a playable Paper Goomba character called Goombario. The series has also seen their fair share of Goomba variations, such as Spiked Goombas,  Dark Goombas, and Hyper Goombas. A second playable Paper Goomba is introduced in ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door|The Thousand-Year Door]]'' called Goombella. Goombas also appear in the five ''Mario & Luigi'' titles: ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga|Superstar Saga]]'', [[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time|Partners in Time]], ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story|Bowser's Inside Story]]'', and ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team|Dream Team]]''. The Goombas meets their paper counterparts, Paper Goombas, in a ''Paper Mario'' and ''Mario & Luigi'' crossover game, ''[[Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam]]''. ''Bowser's Inside Story'' features Goomba-form cells who think Mario and company are viruses, and outside Bowser's body, they are used in one of Bowser's special attacks. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions]]'', a Goomba takes the role of a captain to lead his troops and battle to save [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] from [[Fawful]]. Goombas have appeared in several other spin-off titles in and out of the ''Mario'' series, including the second, third, fourth, and fifth titles of the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''. They have a playable appearance in ''Mario'' [[baseball]] video games such as ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', as well as in the most recent game in the [[Mario Party|''Mario Party'' series]], ''[[Super Mario Party]]''. Goombas are also obstacles in various ''[[Mario Kart]]'' courses.\n\n===In other media===\nIn the [[1989 in television|1989 television cartoon]] ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', Goombas are loyal soldiers in [[Bowser (character)|King Koopa]]'s army. The general appearance of the Goomba resembles the ones found in the Mario video games. In many of the episodes, the Goombas appear as [[zombie]]s, [[pirate]]s, or other themed variations in accordance with the plot. When the show spun off into ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', they continued their job as soldiers in the Koopa army in some episodes. However, the ''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' cartoon only featured them twice.  Goombas were included in an Ice Capades show featuring characters from the ''Mario'' series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Retro Clip: Mario and King Koopa on Ice |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/01/retro-clip-mari |first=Susan |last=Arendt |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2008-01-15}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' live-action film, Goombas were originally inhabitants of Dinohattan who opposed the tyrannical King Koopa's rule, and were devolved as punishment for this disloyalty. In the film, upon being de-evolved, these people became Goombas, who were large, reptilian monsters (as opposed to the usual mushroom appearance seen in the games) with hulking bodies and disproportionately small, circular heads, who wore trenchcoats.\n\nGoombas appear as enemies in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'' in the underground side-scrolling passages throughout the game, and also in the seventh dungeon, Eagle's Tower. They can be defeated either by striking them with a sword or by jumping on top of them with Roc's Feather.\n\nA Goomba can also be spotted as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] on \"Basic Run\" on ''[[Wii Fit Plus]]''.\n\nMultiple variations appear in all the games of the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, appearing either as background elements or regular enemies.\n\n==Reception and promotion==\nThe Goomba has become an icon of the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' series]], both in its appearance and the concept of \"stomping on them\", often referenced as one of the key elements of the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo continues to dominate Japan |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2007/05/japan-loves-nintendo-possibly-more-than-gackt.ars |first=Frank |last=Caron |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2007-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Game Boy raises bar for hand-helds |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/jul/14/20040714-110114-7942r |first=Joseph |last=Szadkowski |publisher=[[The Washington Times]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2004-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=UK VC Friday Round-Up: It's-a-me Mario |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/791/791883p1.html |first=Rob |last=Burman |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2007-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=E3 2005: DDR Mario Mix |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/616/616980p1.html |first=Juan |last=Castro |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2005-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Mario tough to resist on Wii |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2007-04-09-super-paper-mario_N.htm |publisher=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 | first=Brett | last=Molina | date=2007-04-09}}</ref> The Goomba has appeared in multiple pieces of merchandise, including a [[Happy Meal]] toy as part of a ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' promotion by [[Nintendo]] and [[McDonald's]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lameazoid.com/?p=73 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415134019/http://lameazoid.com/?p=73 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-04-15 |title=Review \u2013 McDonalds Mario 3 Happy Meal Toys |publisher=Lameazoid |date=2006-11-17 |accessdate=2012-01-04 }}</ref> A plush Goomba that plays the Goomba \"defeat\" noise as well as the Game Over tune at certain points was also released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plush Mario Sound Bops get updated  |url=http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080319/plush-mario-sound-bops-get-updated |publisher=Coolest Gadgets |accessdate=2009-12-24}}</ref> [[IGN]] editor Craig Harris described the Goomba as a \"household name\" along with Koopa Paratroopas and [[Bowser (character)|King Koopa]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Super Mario Bros.

They first appeared in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] video game ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' as the first enemy players encounter. They have appeared outside video games, including in film, television, and other media. They are usually brown and are most commonly seen walking around aimlessly, often as an obstacle, in video games. They were included late in the development of ''Super Mario Bros.'' as a simple, easy to defeat enemy.\n\nThe species is considered one of the most iconic elements of the ''Mario'' series, appearing in nearly every game in the series, and is often ranked amongst the most famous enemies in video games. In 2009, [[Crave Online]] described it as the series' \"everyman.\" It has been compared to other generic enemies in video games, such as the \"[[List of Mega Man characters#Met|Met]]\" enemy from the [[Mega Man (series)|''Mega Man'' series]]. The video game incarnation has been made into several [[plush toys]].\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Shiitakegrowing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[shiitake]], on which the Goomba is based.

As a result, the designers decided to introduce the Goomba as a basic enemy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRGRJRUWafY|title=Miyamoto on World 1-1: How Nintendo made Mario's most iconic level|last=Eurogamer|date=7 September 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> However, they had very little space left in the game. They used a single image twice to convey the notion that the Goombas are walking, rotating it back and forth, causing it to look lopsided as it walks and giving the appearance of a trot. The Goomba's resemblance to the Super Mushroom forced designers to change the mechanics and appearance of the Super Mushroom. They used the Goomba's ability to be jumped on and defeated to teach players how to deal with enemies and to not fear the Super Mushroom.\n\nGoombas resemble [[shiitake]],<ref name=\"shiitake\">{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros.

In the 2D games, they walk aimlessly in a straight line, turning only at walls. They can be defeated by jumping on them, which flattens them. In ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', and all their 3D Mario appearances since, they will pursue Mario when he is near (instead of just walking aimlessly). In ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', Goombas are not present, but an enemy called the Strollin' Stu is described in ''The Perfect Guide of Super Mario Sunshine'' as the \"Isle Delfino versions of Goombas\". In ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', Goombas wear hats that depend on what kingdom they are in.\n\nSeveral variations of the Goomba have appeared. There are larger versions called Big Goombas or Grand Goombas, and smaller versions called Mini Goombas or Microgoombas. In one level of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Goombas can be seen wearing a shoe called \"Kuribo's Shoe\".<ref name=\"toastyfrog\"/> ''[[Super Mario World]]'' replaces the normal Goomba with a more round version, later named Galoombas. ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' features a type of Goomba called the Goombo (also called Chibibo). Other variations include Jack O'Goombas (first seen in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''), Bone Goombas (first seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]''), Tail Goombas (first seen in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]''), Goombrats (first seen in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]''), and Cat Goombas (first seen in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''). Some games also feature stacks of Goombas called Goomba Towers. A giant goomba called Mega Goomba appears as a boss in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]''. In ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', Goombas wear hats that depend on what kingdom they are in. They can be captured, which allows them to form Goomba Towers. \n\nGoombas appear in each of the [[Mario role-playing games|''Mario'' role-playing games]]. ''[[Super Mario RPG]]'' introduces the first non-hostile Goombas, while the follow-up game ''[[Paper Mario]]'' introduces a Goomba village, and a playable Paper Goomba character called Goombario. The series has also seen their fair share of Goomba variations, such as Spiked Goombas,  Dark Goombas, and Hyper Goombas A second playable Paper Goomba is introduced in ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door|The Thousand-Year Door]]'' called Goombella. Goombas also appear in the five ''Mario & Luigi'' titles: ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga|Superstar Saga]]'', [[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time|Partners in Time]], ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story|Bowser's Inside Story]]'', and ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team|Dream Team]]''. The Goombas meets their paper counterparts, Paper Goombas, in a ''Paper Mario'' and ''Mario & Luigi'' crossover game, ''[[Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam]]''. ''Bowser's Inside Story'' features Goomba-form cells who think Mario and company are viruses, and outside Bowser's body, they are used in one of Bowser's special attacks. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions]]'', a Goomba takes the role of a captain to lead his troops and battle to save [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] from [[Fawful]]. Goombas have appeared in several other spin-off titles in and out of the ''Mario'' series, including the second, third, fourth, and fifth titles of the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''. They have a playable appearance in ''Mario'' [[baseball]] video games such as ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]'', as well as in the most recent game in the [[Mario Party|''Mario Party'' series]], ''[[Super Mario Party]]''. Goombas are also obstacles in various ''[[Mario Kart]]'' courses.\n\n===In other media===\nIn the [[1989 in television|1989 television cartoon]] ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'', Goombas are loyal soldiers in [[Bowser (character)|King Koopa]]'s army. The general appearance of the Goomba resembles the ones found in the Mario video games. In many of the episodes, the Goombas appear as [[zombie]]s, [[pirate]]s, or other themed variations in accordance with the plot. When the show spun off into ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', they continued their job as soldiers in the Koopa army in some episodes. However, the ''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' cartoon only featured them twice.  Goombas were included in an Ice Capades show featuring characters from the ''Mario'' series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Retro Clip: Mario and King Koopa on Ice |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/01/retro-clip-mari |first=Susan |last=Arendt |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2008-01-15}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' live-action film, Goombas were originally inhabitants of Dinohattan who opposed the tyrannical King Koopa's rule, and were devolved as punishment for this disloyalty. In the film, upon being de-evolved, these people became Goombas, who were large, reptilian monsters (as opposed to the usual mushroom appearance seen in the games) with hulking bodies and disproportionately small, circular heads, who wore trenchcoats.\n\nGoombas appear as enemies in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'' in the underground side-scrolling passages throughout the game, and also in the seventh dungeon, Eagle's Tower. They can be defeated either by striking them with a sword or by jumping on top of them with Roc's Feather.\n\nA Goomba can also be spotted as an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] on \"Basic Run\" on ''[[Wii Fit Plus]]''.\n\nMultiple variations appear in all the games of the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, appearing either as background elements or regular enemies.\n\n==Reception and promotion==\nThe Goomba has become an icon of the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' series]], both in its appearance and the concept of \"stomping on them\", often referenced as one of the key elements of the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo continues to dominate Japan |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2007/05/japan-loves-nintendo-possibly-more-than-gackt.ars |first=Frank |last=Caron |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2007-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Game Boy raises bar for hand-helds |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/jul/14/20040714-110114-7942r |first=Joseph |last=Szadkowski |publisher=[[The Washington Times]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2004-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=UK VC Friday Round-Up: It's-a-me Mario |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/791/791883p1.html |first=Rob |last=Burman |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2007-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=E3 2005: DDR Mario Mix |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/616/616980p1.html |first=Juan |last=Castro |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 |date=2005-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Mario tough to resist on Wii |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2007-04-09-super-paper-mario_N.htm |publisher=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2009-12-24 | first=Brett | last=Molina | date=2007-04-09}}</ref> The Goomba has appeared in multiple pieces of merchandise, including a [[Happy Meal]] toy as part of a ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' promotion by [[Nintendo]] and [[McDonald's]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lameazoid.com/?p=73 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415134019/http://lameazoid.com/?p=73 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-04-15 |title=Review \u2013 McDonalds Mario 3 Happy Meal Toys |publisher=Lameazoid |date=2006-11-17 |accessdate=2012-01-04 }}</ref> A plush Goomba that plays the Goomba \"defeat\" noise as well as the Game Over tune at certain points was also released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plush Mario Sound Bops get updated  |url=http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20080319/plush-mario-sound-bops-get-updated |publisher=Coolest Gadgets |accessdate=2009-12-24}}</ref> [[IGN]] editor Craig Harris described the Goomba as a \"household name\" along with Koopa Paratroopas and [[Bowser (character)|King Koopa]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Super Mario Bros.
