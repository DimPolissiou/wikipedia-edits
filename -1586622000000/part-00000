''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.  \n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  ''Relief'' was abandoned in 1931. \n\nThe 1906 steamer should not be confused with an earlier vessel, also named [[Relief (sternwheeler)|'''''Relief''''']], which operated on the Willamette river from 1858 to 1865.\n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = \u201cSnake River, Washington\u201d\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref>, the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.  \n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids..<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.

''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.  \n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  The vessel was abandoned in 1931. \n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = \u201cSnake River, Washington\u201d\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref>, the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.  \n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids..<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.  There once had been steamboats operating on the upper Columbia river, but by 1883, railroad competition had been so successful that all river boats had been driven off the route.<ref name = WheatFleet>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 =  \n| title = Sternwheelers up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country\n| isbn = 0-8032-5874-7 \n| chapter = Ch. 8: The Wheat Fleet\n| lccn = 77007161 \n| location =  Lincoln NE \n| publisher = University of Nebraska \n| publication-date = 1947 \n| at = 105-106\n}}</ref>  Wheat farming became widespread in the region in the 1880s and 1890s, and the railroads could not handle the larger and larger wheat crops being produced.<ref name = WheatFleet/>  The Open River Navigation company was formed to meet the demands for transport by wheat farmers and shippers, and it built a number of steamers, including ''Relief''.<ref name = WheatFleet/>\n\n== Construction ==\n''Relief'' was rebuilt from the much smaller stern-wheel steamer ''Columbia'' (US registry 127689), which had been {{convert|77|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet long, {{convert|20.4|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} on the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], with a depth of hold of {{convert|3.6|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet.<ref name = 1903mvrList>{{cite book\n| last1 = [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Dept]], Statistics Bureau \n| title = Annual List of Merchant Vessels\n| volume = 35\n| type = [[Fiscal year|FY]] end Jun 30, 1903\n| url = http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nnc1.cu05600138\n| location = [[Washington, DC|Wash.

He also pointed out that there are several other programs with the same name, including the ones from [[BBC News]] and [[CNN]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=011&aid=0002574457|title='\ub274\uc2a4\ub8f8' \uc190\uc11d\ud76c, \"\uc81c\ubaa9\uc740 \ubbf8\ub4dc\uc640 \uc0c1\uad00\uc5c6\uc5b4, \uc800\ub110\ub9ac\uc998 \uad50\uacfc\uc11c\ub300\ub85c \ud560 \ubfd0\"|access-date=2017-11-29|language=ko}}</ref>\n\n===As JTBC News 10===\nIt was launched on December 1, 2011 as JTBC News 10, together with the launch of the network itself. It was JTBC's first flagship newscast, which was then hosted by Jun Yong-woo and Cha Ye-rin. Unlike newscasts from the mainstream networks, JTBC News 10 is more focused on providing in-depth stories throughout the program. It was one of the pioneer programs of JTBC that time, usually getting 1% rating according to AGB Nielsen Korea.<ref>[http://star.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/OhmyStar/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001665063 \uc885\ud3b8 \uc2dc\uccad\ub960 1\uc704 < JTBC\ub274\uc2a410 >, 1%\ub300 \uc2dc\uccad\ub960 \ud131\uac78\uc774]</ref>\n\n===From News 10 to News 9===\nOn November 5, 2012, major programming revamp happened within the JTBC network. This includes a major shift between drama and news programs. Its drama series were moved from 20:45/23:00 to 21:45, and their main newscast JTBC News 10 became JTBC News 9. Also, JTBC News 10 anchors Jeon Young-U and Cha Ye-Rin were eventually replaced by Jun Young Gi and Hwang Nam-Hee weeks before the 2012 South Korean Presidential Elections. Although it was entitled JTBC News 9, it actually starts at 20:50 KST. JTBC News 9 focused on news summaries similar to the mainstream networks, with some exclusive news features. It did not became that popular with viewers, as the newscast would place third among General Cable news programs, behind Channel A Main News and TV Chosun News Show ''Pan''.<ref>[http://news.ichannela.com/society/3/03/20121125/51086110/1 Channel A News - News A reached 3.4%, Sets new record for General Cable news]</ref><ref>[http://starin.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?newsid=01128326599729328 '\ub274\uc2a4A' \uc548\ucca0\uc218 \uc0ac\ud1f4 \ud2b9\uc9d1, \uc885\ud3b8\ub274\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uace0 \uae30\ub85d `3.4%`]</ref>\n\n===Sohn Suk Hee takes over News 9===\n\nOn May 9, 2013, [[Sohn Suk-hee|Sohn Suk Hee]] was named as the president of JTBC News department.<ref>[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/people/2013/09/178_142172.html Sohn Suk-hee to return to anchor desk Sept. 16]</ref> He was considered as the most prominent and the most influential news anchor in South Korea, having been with MBC Television and Radio for over three decades.

The newscast is aired from 20:00~21:40 KST. JTBC Newsroom replaced two of its predecessors, namely, JTBC News 10 and JTBC News 9.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Name===\n[[Sohn Suk-hee]] has clarified that the name of the program has nothing to do with the US TV drama [[The Newsroom (U.S. TV series)]], of which he only watched for about ten minutes. He also pointed out that there are several other programs with the same name, including the ones from [[BBC News]] and [[CNN]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=011&aid=0002574457|title='\ub274\uc2a4\ub8f8' \uc190\uc11d\ud76c, \"\uc81c\ubaa9\uc740 \ubbf8\ub4dc\uc640 \uc0c1\uad00\uc5c6\uc5b4, \uc800\ub110\ub9ac\uc998 \uad50\uacfc\uc11c\ub300\ub85c \ud560 \ubfd0\"|access-date=2017-11-29|language=ko}}</ref>\n\n===As JTBC News 10===\nIt was launched on December 1, 2011 as JTBC News 10, together with the launch of the network itself. It was JTBC's first flagship newscast, which was then hosted by Jun Yong-woo and Cha Ye-rin. Unlike newscasts from the mainstream networks, JTBC News 10 is more focused on providing in-depth stories throughout the program. It was one of the pioneer programs of JTBC that time, usually getting 1% rating according to AGB Nielsen Korea.<ref>[http://star.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/OhmyStar/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001665063 \uc885\ud3b8 \uc2dc\uccad\ub960 1\uc704 < JTBC\ub274\uc2a410 >, 1%\ub300 \uc2dc\uccad\ub960 \ud131\uac78\uc774]</ref>\n\n===From News 10 to News 9===\nOn November 5, 2012, major programming revamp happened within the JTBC network. This includes a major shift between drama and news programs. Its drama series were moved from 20:45/23:00 to 21:45, and their main newscast JTBC News 10 became JTBC News 9. Also, JTBC News 10 anchors Jeon Young-U and Cha Ye-Rin were eventually replaced by Jun Young Gi and Hwang Nam-Hee weeks before the 2012 South Korean Presidential Elections. Although it was entitled JTBC News 9, it actually starts at 20:50 KST. JTBC News 9 focused on news summaries similar to the mainstream networks, with some exclusive news features. It did not became that popular with viewers, as the newscast would place third among General Cable news programs, behind Channel A Main News and TV Chosun News Show ''Pan''.<ref>[http://news.ichannela.com/society/3/03/20121125/51086110/1 Channel A News - News A reached 3.4%, Sets new record for General Cable news]</ref><ref>[http://starin.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?newsid=01128326599729328 '\ub274\uc2a4A' \uc548\ucca0\uc218 \uc0ac\ud1f4 \ud2b9\uc9d1, \uc885\ud3b8\ub274\uc2a4 \ucd5c\uace0 \uae30\ub85d `3.4%`]</ref>\n\n===Sohn Suk Hee takes over News 9===\n\nOn May 9, 2013, [[Sohn Suk-hee|Sohn Suk Hee]] was named as the president of JTBC News department.<ref>[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/people/2013/09/178_142172.html Sohn Suk-hee to return to anchor desk Sept. 16]</ref> He was considered as the most prominent and the most influential news anchor in South Korea, having been with MBC Television and Radio for over three decades.

His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression. \n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with the composer as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824.

The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} Johann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] (gnerally known as Karl) was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], (generally known as Johann) the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

Here he also met [[ Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline.

[[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}}. These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by the composer [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]].

Working under Haydn's direction,{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 3}} he sought to master [[counterpoint]]. He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=161}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf |Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}} \n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

They were published in 1801. He also completed his [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] (Op. 20) in 1799, which was one of his most popular works during his lifetime. With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}} \n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], and the [[oratorio]] ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]''. Reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201327}}\n\nHis business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations.

It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]].

The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120.

An [[autopsy]] revealed significant [[liver]] damage, which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}} It also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2011}}{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2012}}\n\nThere is dispute about the cause of his death: [[alcoholic cirrhosis]], [[syphilis]], [[infectious hepatitis]], [[lead poisoning]], [[sarcoidosis]] and [[Whipple's disease]] have all been proposed.{{sfn|Mai|2006}} Friends and visitors before and after his death clipped locks of his hair, some of which have been preserved and subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1862 [[exhumation]].{{sfn|Meredith|2005 |pp=2\u20133}} Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that he was accidentally [[poison]]ed to death by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.{{sfn|Eisinger|2008}}{{sfn|Lorenz|2007}}\n\nBeethoven's funeral procession on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 20,000 people. [[Franz Schubert]], who died the following year and was buried next to him, was one of the torchbearers. He was buried in a dedicated grave in the [[W\u00e4hring]] cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche). His remains were [[exhume]]d for study in 1862, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Beethoven's musical style|Beethoven and C minor|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n=== Overview ===\nBeethoven is acknowledged to be one of the giants of [[classical music]]. Together with [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Johannes Brahms]], he is referred to as one of the \"[[three Bs|three ''B''s]]\" who epitomize that tradition. He was a pivotal figure in the transition from the 18th century musical [[Classical music era|classicism]] to 19th century [[Romantic music|romanticism]], and his influence on subsequent generations of composers was profound. His music features twice on the [[Voyager Golden Record]], a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images, common sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into outer space with the two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes.<ref name=\"Golden Record Music List\">{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/music.html |title=Golden Record Music List|accessdate= 26 July 2012|publisher=[[NASA]]}}</ref>\n\nBeethoven composed in several musical genres and for a variety of instrument combinations. His works for [[symphony orchestra]] include nine [[Symphony|symphonies]] (of which the Ninth Symphony includes a chorus), and about a dozen pieces of \"occasional\" music. He wrote seven [[concerto|concerti]] for one or more soloists and orchestra, as well as four shorter works that include soloists accompanied by orchestra. His only [[opera]] is ''[[Fidelio]]''; other vocal works with orchestral accompaniment include two [[mass (music)|masses]] and a number of shorter works.\n\nHis large body of compositions for [[piano]] includes 32 [[piano sonata]]s and numerous shorter pieces, including arrangements of some of his other works. Works with piano accompaniment include 10 violin sonatas, 5 cello sonatas, and a sonata for [[French horn]], as well as numerous [[lieder]].\n\nHe also wrote a significant quantity of [[chamber music]]. In addition to 16 [[string quartet]]s, he wrote five works for [[string quintet]], seven for [[piano trio]], five for [[string trio]], and more than a dozen works for various combinations of [[wind instrument]]s.\n\n=== The three periods ===\nBeethoven's career as a composer is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the \"middle\" period from 1802 to 1812, and the \"late\" period thereafter. This distinction was first introduced in 1828, just one year after his death, and while often challenged and refined it remains a starting point to understand the development of Beethoven's work.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 11}}\n\nBeethoven's early years in Bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary, period. His earliest known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are known today (though mainly from much later sources). Today his best-known works from before 1790 are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a draft violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.{{refn|{{harvnb|GroveOnline|loc=section 12}}, quote: \"... a few rather colourless sonata movements... Less impressive, in these years, is the instrumental music in the sonata style. ... Where Beethoven departed from formula in these works he seems to have straggled helplessly, as in the violin concerto fragment. ... Beethoven at Bonn was a less interesting composer of works in the sonata style than of music in other genres ...\"|group=n}}\n\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===Middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship. The term is more frequently used as an alternative name for the middle period.<ref name=\"Steinberg2006\">{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael P.|authorlink=Michael P.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\nHe was attracted to the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In 1804, when Napoleon's imperial ambitions became clear, Beethoven took hold of the title page of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] and scratched the name Bonaparte out so violently that he made a hole in the paper. He later changed the work's title to \"Sinfonia Eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d'un grand'uom\" (\"Heroic Symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man\"), and he rededicated it to his patron, Prince [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz]], at whose palace it was first performed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beethoven.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=&template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&_dokid=bi:i3113&_seite=1|title=Friedrich Oelenhainz (1745\u20131804), Franz Joseph Maximilian F\u00fcrst von Lobkowitz (1772\u20131816)]|website=[[Beethoven-Haus]] Bonn|accessdate=6 October 2018|date=April 2002}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth. It was the first statue of a composer created in Germany, and the music festival that accompanied the unveiling was the impetus for the very hasty construction of the original [[Beethovenhalle]] in Bonn (it was designed and built within less than a month, on the urging of [[Franz Liszt]]). A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria, in 1842. Vienna did not honour Beethoven with a statue until 1880.{{sfn|Comini|2008|p=316}} His is the only name inscribed on one of the plaques that trim [[Symphony Hall, Boston]]; the others were left empty because it was felt that only Beethoven's popularity would endure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bso.org/brands/symphony-hall/about-us/historyarchives/the-history-of-symphony-hall.aspx|title=The History of Symphony Hall|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThere is a museum, the [[Beethoven House]], the place of his birth, in central Bonn. The same city has hosted a musical festival, the [[Beethovenfest]], since 1845. The festival was initially irregular but has been organised annually since 2007.\n\nThe [[Ira F. Brilliant Center for Beethoven Studies]] serves as a museum, research center, and host of lectures and performances devoted solely to this life and works.\n\nThe [[Beethoven (crater)|third largest crater]] on Mercury is named in his honour, as is the main-belt asteroid [[1815 Beethoven]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biography|Classical music}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n* [[Beethoven and his contemporaries]]\n* [[Beethoven in film]]\n* [[Catalogues of Beethoven compositions]]\n*[[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=15em}}\n\n===Sources ===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{Cite encyclopedia |title=Anton Schindler as destroyer and forger of Beethoven's conversation books: A case for decriminalization |first=Theodore |last=Albrecht|authorlink=Theodore Albrecht|url=https://rilm.org/historiography/talbrecht.pdf|encyclopedia=Music's intellectual history|editor-first=Zdravko|editor-last=Bla\u017eekovi\u0107|year=2009 |publisher=RILM|location=New York|pages=169-181 |isbn= 978-1-932765-05-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|editor-last=Brandenburg |editor-first=Sieghard |title=Ludwig van Beethoven: Briefwechsel.

His works span the transition between the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] eras in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period in which he forged his craft, is typically seen to last until 1802. His \"middle\" period, (sometimes characterised as \"heroic\") shows an individual development from the \"classical\" styles of [[Franz Joseph Haydn|Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], covers the years 1802 to 1812, during which he increasingly suffered from [[deafness]]. In the \"late\" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression. \n\nBeethoven was born in [[Bonn]]. His musical talent was obvious at an early age, and he was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father [[Johann van Beethoven]]. He was later taught by the composer and conductor [[Christian Gottlob Neefe]], under whose tuition he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of [[Helene von Breuning]], whose children he loved, befriended and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to [[Vienna]] which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon courted by [[Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky]] for compositions, which resulted in his three [[Piano Trios, Op. 1 (Beethoven)|Opus 1]] [[piano trio]]s (the earliest works to which he accorded an [[opus number]]) in 1795.\n\nHis first major orchestral work, the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First Symphony]], appeared in 1800, and his [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|first set of string quartets]] was published in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth]] [[symphony|Symphonies]] in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] appeared in 1806. His [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|last piano concerto]] (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to his great patron [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria]], was premiered in 1810, but not with the composer as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. His problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life are exemplified by his \"[[Heiligenstadt Testament]]\" (1802) and his unsent letter to his \"[[Immortal Beloved]]\" (1812).\n\nIn the years from 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature [[chamber music]] and [[piano sonata]]s. His only opera ''[[Fidelio]]'', which had been first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed his ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' in the years 1819\u20131823, and his final, [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth]], Symphony, one of the first examples of a [[choral symphony]], in 1822\u20131824. Written in his last years, his [[Late string quartets (Beethoven)|late string quartets]] of 1825\u201326 are amongst his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness he [[Death of Ludwig van Beethoven|died in 1827]]. Beethoven's works in all genres remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.\n\n== Life and career ==\n=== Family and early life ===\n[[File:Beethoven house of birth Bonn 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Beethoven's birthplace at Bonngasse&nbsp;20, Bonn, now the [[Beethoven House]] museum]]\nBeethoven was the grandson of [[Ludwig van Beethoven (1712\u20131773)|Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1712\u20131773), a musician from the town of [[Mechelen]] in the Austrian [[Duchy of Brabant]] (in what is now the [[Flemish region]] of Belgium) who had moved to [[Bonn]] at the age of 21.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=407}} Ludwig was employed as a [[bass (voice type)|bass]] singer at the court of [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]], eventually rising to become, in 1761, [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical heritage.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=12\u201317}} Ludwig had one son, [[Johann van Beethoven|Johann]] (1740\u20131792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and [[violin]] lessons to supplement his income.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} Johann married [[Maria Magdalena Keverich]] in 1767; she was the daughter of Heinrich Keverich (1701\u20131751), who had been the head chef at the court of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}} Beethoven was born of this marriage in Bonn. There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; however, the registry of his [[baptism]], in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus, (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=53}}\n\nOf the seven children born to Johann van Beethoven, only Ludwig, the second-born, and two younger brothers survived infancy. [[Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven|Kaspar Anton Karl]] was born on 8 April 1774, and [[Nikolaus Johann van Beethoven|Nikolaus Johann]], the youngest, was born on 2 October 1776.{{sfn|Stanley|2000|p=7}}\n\nBeethoven's first music teacher was his father. He later had other local teachers: the court [[organist]] Gilles van den Eeden (d. 1782), Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (a family friend, who provided keyboard tuition), and Franz Rovantini (a relative, who instructed him in playing the violin and [[viola]]).{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 1}} From the outset his tuition regime, which began in his fifth year, was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears; with the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer there were irregular late-night sessions with the young Beethoven being dragged from his bed to the keyboard.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=22, 32}} His musical talent was obvious at a young age. Johann, aware of [[Leopold Mozart]]'s successes in this area (with his son [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Wolfgang]] and daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]]), attempted to promote his son as a [[child prodigy]], claiming that Beethoven was six (he was seven) on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=57\u20138}}\n\n===1780\u20131792: Bonn ===\n[[File:Christian Gottlob Neefe.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Christian Gottlob Neefe.

In addition, some minor works not listed with opus numbers or in the WoO list have [[Catalogues_of_Beethoven_compositions#Hess_catalogue|Hess catalogue]] numbers.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=210}}|group=n}} Beethoven soon began working with Neefe as assistant organist, at first unpaid (1782), and then as a paid employee (1784) of the court chapel.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=65\u201370}} His [[Three Piano Sonatas, WoO 47 (Beethoven)|first three piano sonatas]], WoO 47, sometimes known as \"{{lang|de|[[Kurf\u00fcrst]]}}\" (\"Elector\") for their dedication to the Elector [[Maximilian Friedrich von K\u00f6nigsegg-Rothenfels|Maximilian Friedrich]] (1708\u20131784), were published in 1783.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=69}} In the same year the first printed reference to Beethoven appeared in the ''Magazin der Musik'' \u2013 \"Louis van Beethoven [sic] ... a boy of 11 years and most promising talent.

He gave some support to Beethoven, appointing him Court Organist and paying towards his visit to Vienna of 1792. {{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=50}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=50}}\n\nHe was introduced in these years to several people who became important in his life. He often visited the cultivated von Breuning family, where he taught piano to some of the children, and where the widowed Frau von Breuning offered him a motherly friendship. Here he also met [[ Franz Gerhard Wegeler|Franz Wegeler]], a young medical student, who became a lifelong friend (and was to marry one of the von Breuning daughters). The von Breuning family environment offered an alternative to his home life, which was increasingly dominated by his father's decline. Another frequenter of the von Breunings was [[Count Ferdinand Ernst Gabriel von Waldstein|Count Ferdinand von Waldstein]], who became a friend and financial supporter during Beethoven's Bonn period.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= section 2}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=55}}{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp= 51\u201352}} Waldstein was to commission in 1791 Beethoven's first work for the stage, the ballet ''Musik zu einem Ritterballett'' (WoO 1).{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p= 121\u2013122}} \n\n[[File:Count von Waldstein.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|Count Waldstein: portrait by  [[Anton\u00edn Machek]], c. 1800]]In the period 1785\u201390 there is virtually no record of Beethoven's activity as a composer. This may be attributed to the lukewarm response his initial publications had attracted, and also to ongoing problems in the Beethoven family.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|pp=36\u201337}} His mother died in 1787, shortly after Beethoven\u2019s first visit to Vienna, where he stayed for about two weeks and almost certainly met with Mozart.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 2}} In 1789 Beethoven's father was forcibly retired from the service of the Court (as a consequence of his alcoholism) and it was ordered that half of his father's pension be paid directly to him for support of the family.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=95}} He contributed further to the family's income by teaching (to which Wegeler said he had \"an extraordinary aversion\"{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=51}}) and by playing [[viola]] in the court orchestra. This familiarized him with a variety of operas, including works by Mozart, [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] and [[Giovanni Paisiello|Paisiello]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=95\u201398}} Here he also befriended [[Anton Reicha]], a composer, [[flute|flautist]] and violinist of about his own age who was a nephew of the court orchestra's conductor, [[Josef Reicha]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|p=96}} \n\nFrom 1790 to 1792, Beethoven composed a number of works (none were published at the time) showing a growing range and maturity. [[Musicologist]]s have identified a theme similar to those of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] in a set of variations written in 1791.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 35\u201341}} It was perhaps on Neefe's recommendation that Beethoven received his first commissions; the Literary Society in Bonn commissioned a cantata to mark the occasion of the death in 1790 of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (WoO 87),  and a further cantata, to celebrate the subsequent accession of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (WoO 88), may have been commissioned by the Elector.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=93\u201394}}. These two ''Emperor Cantatas'' were never performed at the time and they remained lost until the 1880s, when they were described by the composer [[Johannes Brahms]] as \"Beethoven through and through\" and as such prophetic of the style which would mark his music as distinct from the classical tradition.{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=107\u2013111}}\n\nBeethoven was probably first introduced to [[Joseph Haydn]] in late 1790, when the latter was travelling to London and stopped in Bonn around Christmas time.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 35}} A year and a half later, they met in Bonn on Haydn's return trip from London to Vienna in July 1792, when Beethoven played in the orchestra at the [[Redoute, Bad Godesberg|Redoute in Godesberg]]. It is likely that arrangements were made at that time for Beethoven to study with the older master.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 41}} Waldstein wrote to him before his departure: \u201cYou are going to Vienna in fulfilment of your long-frustrated wishes [\u2026] With the help of assiduous labour you shall receive Mozart\u2019s spirit from Haydn\u2019s hands.\u201d{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 2}}\n\n===1792\u20131802: Vienna - the early years ===\n[[File:Beethoven Riedel 1801.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Beethoven as a young man, c. 1800, by Carl Traugott Riedel (1769\u20131832)]]Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna in November 1792, amid rumours of [[First Coalition|war spilling out of France]]; he learned shortly after his arrival that his father had died.{{sfn|Thayer|1967a|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 42}}  Over the next few years, Beethoven responded to the widespread feeling that he was a successor to the recently deceased Mozart by studying that master's work and writing works with a distinctly Mozartean flavour.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 43}}\n\nHe did not immediately set out to establish himself as a composer, but rather devoted himself to study and performance. Working under Haydn's direction,{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 3}} he sought to master [[counterpoint]]. He also studied violin under [[Ignaz Schuppanzigh]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 47, 54}} Early in this period, he also began receiving occasional instruction from [[Antonio Salieri]], primarily in Italian vocal composition style; this relationship persisted until at least 1802, and possibly as late as 1809.{{sfn|Thayer|1921|p=161}}\n\nWith Haydn's departure for England in 1794, Beethoven was expected by the Elector to return home to Bonn. He chose instead to remain in Vienna, continuing his instruction in counterpoint with [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger|Johann Albrechtsberger]] and other teachers. In any case, by this time it must have seemed clear to his employer that Bonn would fall to the French, as it did in October 1794, effectively leaving Beethoven without a stipend or the necessity to return.{{sfn|Ronge|2013}} However, a number of Viennese noblemen had already recognised his ability and offered him financial support, among them [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Joseph Franz Lobkowitz]], [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, F\u00fcrst Lichnowsky|Prince Karl Lichnowsky]], and Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}}\n\nAssisted by his connections with Haydn and Waldstein, Beethoven began to develop a reputation as a performer and improviser in the salons of the Viennese nobility.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=59}} His friend [[Nikolaus Simrock]] began publishing his compositions, starting with a set of keyboard variations on a theme of [[Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf |Dittersdorf]] (WoO 66).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 46}} By 1793, he had established a reputation in Vienna as a piano virtuoso, but he apparently withheld works from publication so that their eventual appearance would have greater impact.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 53}} \n\n[[File:\u00d6lenhainz - Franz Joseph Maximilian von Lobkowitz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Prince Lobkowitz: portrait by [[August Friedrich Oelenhainz]]]]His first public performance in Vienna was in March 1795, where he first performed one of his [[piano concerto]]s.{{refn|It is uncertain whether this was the [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]].

With premieres of his [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|First]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|Second]] Symphonies in 1800 and 1803, he became regarded as one of the most important of a generation of young composers following Haydn and Mozart. But his melodies, musical development, use of modulation and texture, and characterisation of emotion all set him apart from his influences, and heightened the impact some of his early works made when they were first published.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 58}}  For the premiere of his First Symphony, he hired the [[Burgtheater]] on 2 April 1800, and staged an extensive programme, including works by Haydn and Mozart, as well as his Septet, the Symphony, and one of his piano concertos (the latter three works all then unpublished). The concert, which the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]'' described as \"the most interesting concert in a long time,\" was not without difficulties; among the criticisms was that \"the players did not bother to pay any attention to the soloist.\"{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 90}} By the end of 1800, Beethoven and his music were already much in demand from patrons and publishers.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 97}} \n\n[[File:Josephine Brunsvik.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Josephine Brunsvik, pencil miniature (unknown artist), before 1804.]]In May 1799, he taught piano to the daughters of Hungarian Countess Anna Brunsvik.

Amongst his other students, from 1801 to 1805, he tutored [[Ferdinand Ries]], who went on to become a composer and later wrote about their encounters. The young [[Carl Czerny]], who later became a renowned music teacher himself, studied with Beethoven from 1801 to 1803. In late 1801, he met a young countess, [[Giulietta Guicciardi|Julie (\"Giulietta\") Guicciardi]], through the Brunsvik family; he mentions his love for Julie in a November 1801 letter to a friend, but class difference prevented any consideration of pursuing this. He later dedicated his [[Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)|Sonata No. 14]], now commonly known as the ''Moonlight Sonata'', to her.{{sfn|Steblin|2009}}\n\nIn the spring of 1801 he completed ''[[The Creatures of Prometheus]]'', a [[ballet]].

The symphony received its premiere instead at a subscription concert in April 1803 at the [[Theater an der Wien]], where he had been appointed composer in residence. In addition to the Second Symphony, the concert also featured the First Symphony, the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Piano Concerto]], and the [[oratorio]] ''[[Christ on the Mount of Olives (Beethoven)|Christ on the Mount of Olives]]''. Reviews were mixed, but the concert was a financial success; he was able to charge three times the cost of a typical concert ticket.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201327}}\n\nHis business dealings with publishers also began to improve in 1802 when his brother Kaspar, who had previously assisted him casually, began to assume a larger role in the management of his affairs. In addition to negotiating higher prices for recently composed works, Kaspar also began selling some of his earlier unpublished compositions, and encouraged him (against Beethoven's preference) to also make arrangements and transcriptions of his more popular works for other instrument combinations. Beethoven acceded to these requests, as he could not prevent publishers from hiring others to do similar arrangements of his works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 112\u201315}}\n\n===1802\u20131812: The 'heroic' period ===\n====Deafness====\n[[File:Beethoven Hornemann.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beethoven in 1803, painted by [[Christian Horneman]]]]Beethoven told the English pianist [[Charles Neate]] (in 1815) that he dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a quarrel with a singer.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=160}} During its gradual decline, his hearing was further impeded by a severe form of [[tinnitus]].{{sfn|Swafford|2014|pp=223\u201324}} As early as 1801, he wrote to Wegeler and another friend Karl Amenda, describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 108}} The cause was probably [[otosclerosis]], perhaps accompanied by degeneration of the [[auditory nerve]].{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 5}}{{refn|The cause of Beethoven\u2019s deafness has also variously been attributed to , amongst other possibilities, [[lead poisoning]] from Beethoven\u2019s preferred wines{{sfn|Stevens|2013|pp=2854-2858}}, and [[Paget's disease of bone]] {{sfn|Oiseth|2015|pp=139\u201347}}|group=n}} \n\nOn the advice of his doctor, he moved to the small Austrian town of [[Heiligenstadt, Vienna|Heiligenstadt]], just outside Vienna, from April to October 1802 in an attempt to come to terms with his condition.

The idea of creating a symphony based on the career of [[Napoleon]] may have been suggested to Beethoven by [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Count Bernadotte]] in 1798.{{sfn|GroveOnline|locatio=section 4}} Beethoven, sympathetic to the ideal of the heroic revolutionary leader, originally gave the symphony the title \"Bonaparte\", but disillusioned by Napoleon [[1804 French constitutional referendum|declaring himself Emperor in 1804]], he scratched Napoleon's name from the manuscript's title page, and the symphony was published in 1806 with its present title and the subtitle \"to celebrate the memory of a great man.\"{{sfn|GroveOnline|location=section 6}} The ''Eroica'' was longer and larger in scope than any previous symphony.

Some of his early patrons, including Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Lichnowsky, gave him annual stipends in addition to commissioning works and purchasing published works.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 78\u201379}} Perhaps his most important aristocratic patron was [[Archduke Rudolf of Austria ]], the youngest son of [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold II]], who in 1803 or 1804 began to study piano and composition with him.  They became friends, and their meetings continued until 1824.{{sfn|Lockwood|2005|pp=300\u201301}} Beethoven was to dedicate 14 compositions to Rudolph, including smw of his major works such as the [[Piano Trio No. 7 (Beethoven)|''Archduke'' Trio]] Op. 97 (1811) and ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' Op. 123 (1823).\n\nHis position at the Theater an der Wien was terminated when the theatre changed management in early 1804, and he was forced to move temporarily to the suburbs of Vienna with his friend Stephan von Breuning. This slowed work on ''Leonore'', (his original title for his opera), his largest work to date, for a time. It was delayed again by the Austrian [[censorship|censor]], and finally premiered, under its present tile of ''Fidelio'' in November 1805 to houses that were nearly empty because of the [[War of the Third Coalition|French occupation of the city]]. In addition to being a financial failure, this version of ''Fidelio'' was also a critical failure, and Beethoven began revising it.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 150}}\n\nDespite this failure, Beethoven continued to attract recognition. In 1807 the musician and publisher [[Muzio Clementi]] secured the rights for publishing his works in England, and Haydn's former patron [[Nikolaus II, Prince Esterh\u00e1zy|Prince Esterh\u00e1zy]] commissioned a mass (the [[Mass_in_C_major_(Beethoven)|Mass in C]], Op. 86) for his wife's name-day. But he could not count on such recognition alone. A colossal benefit concert which he organized in December 1808, and was widely advertised, included the premieres of the Fifth and [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Sixth (''Pastoral'')]] symphonies, the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]], extracts from the Mass in C, the [[aria|scena and aria]] ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' Op. 65 and the [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy op. 80]]. There was a large audience, (including Czerny and the young [[Ignaz Moscheles]]).

[[Egmont (Beethoven)| The result]] (an overture, and nine additional [[entracte]]s and vocal pieces, Op. 84), which appeared in 1810 fitted well with Beethoven's \"heroic\" style and he became interested in Goethe, setting three of his poems as songs (Op. 83) and learning about the poet from a mutual acquaintance, [[Bettina Brentano]] (who also wrote to Goethe at this time about Beethoven). Other works of this period in a similar vein were the F minor [[String Quartet No. 11 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 95]], to which the composer gave the subtitle ''Quartetto serioso'', and the Op. 97 [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|Piano Trio in B flat major]] known, from its dedication to his patron Rudolph as the ''Archduke Trio''.{{sfn|GroveOnline|location=section 7}}\n\nIn the spring of 1811 Beethoven became seriously ill, suffering headaches and high fever.

Advised again to visit Teplitz in 1812 he met there with Goethe,  who wrote of the composer \"His talent amazed me; unfortunately he is an utterly untamed personality, who is not altogether wrong in holding the world to be detestable, but surely does not make it any more enjoyable [...] by his attitude.\" Beethoven wote to his publishers [[Breitkopf and H\u00e4rtel]] that \"Goethe delights far too much in the court atmosphere, far more than is becoming in a poet.\"{{sfn|GroveOnline|location=section 7}} But following their meeting he began a setting for choir and orchestra of [[Meeresstille und gl\u00fcckliche Fahrt (Beethoven)| Goethe's ''Meeresstille und gl\u00fcckliche Fahrt'']] ''(Calm Sea and Properous Voyage)'' (Op. 112), completed in 1815.

Unsympathetic to the sorts of trends in German romanticism that featured the supernatural (as in operas by [[Louis Spohr]], [[Heinrich Marschner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber]], he also \"resisted the impending Romantic fragmentation of the [...] cyclic forms of the Classical era into small forms and lyric mood pieces\" and turned towards study of Bach, [[George Frederic Handel|Handel]] and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=295}} An old connection was renewed in 1817 when Maelzel sought, and obtained, Beethoven's endorsement for his newly developed [[metronome]].{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=684-686}} During these years the few major works completed include Beethoven's only [[song cycle]], ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'' Op. 98, (1816), and the gigantic [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' Sonata]] (Sonata no 29 in B flat major, Op. 106) (1818).{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp= 659, 717}} It was also in 1818 that he began musical sketches that eventually form part of his final Ninth Symphony.{{sfn|Solomon|1998|p=322}}\n\nBy early 1818 Beethoven's health had improved, and his nephew Karl, now aged 11, moved in with him in January, (although within a year Karl's mother had won him back in the courts).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=41}} By now the composer's hearing had again significantly deteriorated, necessitating Beethoven and his interlocutors writing in notebooks to carry out conversations. These 'conversation books' are a rich written resource for this period. They contain discussions about music, business and personal life; they are also a valuable source for his contacts and for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and of his opinions of the art of music.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=164-167}} {{refn|It was suggested by Beethoven's  biographer [[Alexander Wheelock Thayer]] that, of 400 conversation books, 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after his death by his secretary  Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive.{{sfn|Clive|2001|p=239}} The music historian [[Theodore Albrecht]] has however demonstrated that Thayer's allegations were over the top. \"[It is now] abundantly clear that Schindler never possessed as many as c. 400 conversation books, and that he never destroyed roughly five-eighths of that number.\"{{sfn|Albrecht|2009|p=181}} Schindler did however insert a number of fraudulent entries that bolstered his own profile and his prejudices.{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=52}}{{sfn|Nettl|1994|p=103}} Presently 136 books covering the period 1819-1827 are preserved at the [[Staatsbibliothek Berlin]], with another two at the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn.{{sfn|Hammelmann|1965|p=187}}|group=n}} His household management had also improved somewhat; Nanette Streicher, who had assisted in his care during his illness, continued to provide some support, and he finally found a skilled cook.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p= 260}} A testimonial to the esteem in which Beethoven was held in England was the presentation to him in this year by Thomas Broadwood, the proprietor of the company, of a [[John Broadwood & Sons|Broadwood piano]], for which Beethoven expressed grateful thanks.

The first was the announcement of Archduke Rudolf's promotion to [[Cardinal-Archbishop]] and Archbishop of [[Olomouc]] (now in Czechia), which triggered the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' Op. 123, intended to be ready for his installation in Olomouc in March 1820. The other was  the invitation by the publisher [[Antonio Diabelli]] to fifty Viennese composers , including Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert]], Czerny and the 8-year old [[Franz Liszt]], to compose a variation each on a theme which he provided. Beethoven was spurred to outdo the competition and by mid-1819 had already completed 20 variations of what were to become the 33 ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'' op. 120. Neither of these works were to be completed however for a few years.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc= section 8}}{{sfn|Cooper|1996|p=45}} A significant tribute of 1819, however, was Archduke Rudolf's set of forty piano variations on a theme written for him by Beethoven (WoO 200), and dedicated to the master.{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|pp=741, 745}} Beethoven's portrait by Ferdinand Schimon of this year, which was one of the most familiar images of him for the enxt century, was described by Schindler as, despite its artistic weaknesses, \"in the rendering of that particular look, the majestic forehead [...] the firmly shut mouth and the chin shaped like a shell, [...] truer to nature than any other picture.\"{{sfn|Thayer|1967b|p=742}}\n\nBeethoven's status was confirmed by the series of ''Concerts sprituels'' given in Vienna by the choirmaster Franz Xaver Gebauer in the 1819/1820 and 1820/1821 seasons, during which all eight of his symphonies to date, plus the oratorio ''Christus'' and the Mass in C, were performed. Beethoven was typically underwhelmed:  when in an April 1820 conversation book a friend mentioned Gebauer,  Beethoven wrote in reply \"Geh!

One consequence of this was that Schlesinger was to secure Beethoven's three last piano sonatas and his final quartets;  part of the attaction to Beethoven was that Schlesinger had publishing facilities in Germany, France and England which could overcome problems of copyright piracy.{{sfn|Conway|2012|pp=185-187}} The first of the three sonatas, for which Beethoven contracted with Schlesinger in 1820 at 30 [[Ducat#Spread of the ducat|ducat]]s per sonata, (further delaying completion of the Mass), was sent to the publisher at the end of that year (the [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|Sonata in E major, Op. 109]], dedicated to Maximiliane, Antonie Brentano's daughter).{{sfn|Cooper|1996|pp=27-28}}.\n\nHe was ill again for an extended time in 1821, and completed the ''Missa'' in 1823, three years after its original due date.

The [[Philharmonic Society]] of London offered a commission for a symphony, and Prince [[Nikolay Borisovich Galitzin|Nikolas Golitsin]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] offered to pay Beethoven's price for three string quartets. The first of these commissions spurred him to finish the Ninth Symphony, which was first performed, along with the ''Missa Solemnis'', on 7 May 1824, to great acclaim at the [[K\u00e4rntnertortheater]]. Beethoven stood by the conductor [[Michael Umlauf]] during the premiere beating time (although Umlauf had warned the singers and orchestra to ignore him), and because of his deafness was not even aware of the applause which followed until he was turned to witness it.{{sfn|Solomon|1988|p=351}} The ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' gushed, \"inexhaustible genius had shown us a new world\", and Carl Czerny wrote that his symphony \"breathes such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit&nbsp;... so much power, innovation, and beauty as ever [came] from the head of this original man, although he certainly sometimes led the old wigs to shake their heads.\" Unlike his more lucrative earlier concerts, this did not make him much money, as the expenses of mounting it were significantly higher.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=317}} A second concert on 24 May, in which the producer guaranteed him a minimum fee, was poorly attended; nephew Karl noted that \"many people [had] already gone into the country\".

The illness\u2014or more precisely, his recovery from it\u2014is remembered in the slow movement of the [[String Quartet No. 15 (Beethoven)|Fifteenth Quartet]], which he called \"Holy song of thanks ('Heiliger Dankgesang') to the divinity, from one made well.\" He went on to complete the quartets now numbered [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|Thirteenth]], [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|Fourteenth]], and [[String Quartet No. 16 (Beethoven)|Sixteenth]]. Of these  \"[[Late String Quartets (Beethoven)|Late Quartets]]\", Beethoven's favourite was the Fourteenth, in C{{music|#}} minor, which he rated as his most perfect single work.{{sfn|Morris|2010|p=213}} The last work completed by Beethoven was the substitute final movement of the Thirteenth Quartet, which replaced the difficult ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]''. \n\nBeethoven's nephew Karl had attempted suicide on 31 July 1826 by shooting himself in the head. He survived and was brought to his mother's house, where he recuperated. He and Beethoven were reconciled, but shortly thereafter, in December 1826, illness struck Beethoven again, with episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea that nearly ended his life. Karl insisted on joining the army and last saw Beethoven in January 1827.\n\n=== Illness and death ===\n{{Main|Death of Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n[[File:Zentralfriedhof Vienna - Beethoven.JPG|thumb|upright|Beethoven's grave at Vienna [[Zentralfriedhof]]]]\nBeethoven was bedridden for most of his remaining months, and many friends came to visit.

An [[autopsy]] revealed significant [[liver]] damage, which may have been due to heavy alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}} It also revealed considerable dilation of the auditory and other related nerves.{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2011}}{{sfn|SaccentiSmildeSaris|2012}}\n\nThere is dispute about the cause of his death: [[alcoholic cirrhosis]], [[syphilis]], [[infectious hepatitis]], [[lead poisoning]], [[sarcoidosis]] and [[Whipple's disease]] have all been proposed.{{sfn|Mai|2006}} Friends and visitors before and after his death clipped locks of his hair, some of which have been preserved and subjected to additional analysis, as have skull fragments removed during the 1862 [[exhumation]].{{sfn|Meredith|2005 |pp=2\u20133}} Some of these analyses have led to controversial assertions that he was accidentally [[poison]]ed to death by excessive doses of lead-based treatments administered under instruction from his doctor.{{sfn|Eisinger|2008}}{{sfn|Lorenz|2007}}\n\nBeethoven's funeral procession on 29 March 1827 was attended by an estimated 20,000 people. [[Franz Schubert]], who died the following year and was buried next to him, was one of the torchbearers. He was buried in a dedicated grave in the [[W\u00e4hring]] cemetery, north-west of Vienna, after a requiem mass at the church of the Holy Trinity (Dreifaltigkeitskirche). His remains were [[exhume]]d for study in 1862, and moved in 1888 to Vienna's [[Zentralfriedhof]].{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp= 318, 349}}\n\n== Music ==\n{{further|Beethoven's musical style|Beethoven and C minor|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven}}\n=== Overview ===\nBeethoven is acknowledged to be one of the giants of [[classical music]]. Together with [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Johannes Brahms]], he is referred to as one of the \"[[three Bs|three ''B''s]]\" who epitomize that tradition. He was a pivotal figure in the transition from the 18th century musical [[Classical music era|classicism]] to 19th century [[Romantic music|romanticism]], and his influence on subsequent generations of composers was profound. His music features twice on the [[Voyager Golden Record]], a phonograph record containing a broad sample of the images, common sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into outer space with the two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes.<ref name=\"Golden Record Music List\">{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/music.html |title=Golden Record Music List|accessdate= 26 July 2012|publisher=[[NASA]]}}</ref>\n\nBeethoven composed in several musical genres and for a variety of instrument combinations. His works for [[symphony orchestra]] include nine [[Symphony|symphonies]] (of which the Ninth Symphony includes a chorus), and about a dozen pieces of \"occasional\" music. He wrote seven [[concerto|concerti]] for one or more soloists and orchestra, as well as four shorter works that include soloists accompanied by orchestra. His only [[opera]] is ''[[Fidelio]]''; other vocal works with orchestral accompaniment include two [[mass (music)|masses]] and a number of shorter works.\n\nHis large body of compositions for [[piano]] includes 32 [[piano sonata]]s and numerous shorter pieces, including arrangements of some of his other works. Works with piano accompaniment include 10 violin sonatas, 5 cello sonatas, and a sonata for [[French horn]], as well as numerous [[lieder]].\n\nHe also wrote a significant quantity of [[chamber music]]. In addition to 16 [[string quartet]]s, he wrote five works for [[string quintet]], seven for [[piano trio]], five for [[string trio]], and more than a dozen works for various combinations of [[wind instrument]]s.\n\n=== The three periods ===\nBeethoven's career as a composer is conventionally divided into early, middle, and late periods. The \"early\" period is typically seen to last until 1802, the \"middle\" period from 1802 to 1812, and the \"late\" period thereafter. This distinction was first introduced in 1828, just one year after his death, and while often challenged and refined it remains a starting point to understand the development of Beethoven's work.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 11}}\n\nBeethoven's early years in Bonn arguably represent a further, preliminary, period. His earliest known composition was from 1782, and a total of 40 pieces by him dating from 1792 or earlier are known today (though mainly from much later sources). Today his best-known works from before 1790 are three piano quartets and three piano sonatas, the quartets being closely modelled on Mozart's sonatas for piano and violin. From 1790 to 1802, his best music can be found in a cantata and a number of concert arias, and in some variations for solo piano, while his instrumental music (including movements of symphonies and a draft violin concerto, as well as various fragmentary chamber works) is conservative and uninspired.{{refn|{{harvnb|GroveOnline|loc=section 12}}, quote: \"... a few rather colourless sonata movements... Less impressive, in these years, is the instrumental music in the sonata style. ... Where Beethoven departed from formula in these works he seems to have straggled helplessly, as in the violin concerto fragment. ... Beethoven at Bonn was a less interesting composer of works in the sonata style than of music in other genres ...\"|group=n}}\n\nThe conventional \"first period\" begins after Beethoven's arrival in Vienna in 1792. In the first few years he seems to have composed less than he did at Bonn, and his Piano Trios, op.1 were not published until 1795. From this point onward, he had mastered the 'Viennese style' (best known today from [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]) and was making the style his own. His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a [[scherzo]] rather than a [[minuet and trio]]; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony. It was this that led Haydn to believe the third trio of Op.1 was too difficult for an audience to appreciate.{{sfn|GroveOnline|loc=section 13}}\n\nHe also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the early period are the [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|first]] and [[Symphony No. 2 (Beethoven)|second]] symphonies, the set of six string quartets [[String Quartets Nos. 1\u20136, Op. 18 (Beethoven)|Opus 18]], the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so [[Beethoven's piano sonatas|piano sonatas]], including the famous ''[[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)|Path\u00e9tique]]'' sonata, Op. 13.\n\n===Middle period===\nHis middle (heroic) period began shortly after the personal crisis brought on by his recognition of encroaching deafness. It includes large-scale works that express heroism and struggle. Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3\u20138), the last two piano concertos, the [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto]] and [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|violin concerto]], five string quartets (Nos. 7\u201311), several piano sonatas (including the ''[[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|Waldstein]]'' and ''[[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|Appassionata]]'' sonatas), the ''[[Violin Sonata No. 9 (Beethoven)|Kreutzer]]'' violin sonata and his only [[opera]], ''[[Fidelio]]''.\n\nThe \"middle period\" is sometimes associated with a \"heroic\" manner of composing,<ref name=\"Solomon1990\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Maynard|authorlink=Maynard Solomon|title=Beethoven essays|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=2ZH3v2_-4F4C|page=124}}|accessdate=4 August 2011|year=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-06379-2|page=124}}</ref> but the use of the term \"heroic\" has become increasingly controversial in Beethoven scholarship.

He began a renewed study of older music, including works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]], that were then being published in the first attempts at complete editions. The overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' (1822) was an early work to attempt to incorporate these influences. A new style emerged, now called his \"late period\". He returned to the keyboard to compose his first piano sonatas in almost a decade: the works of the late period include the last five piano sonatas and the ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the last two sonatas for cello and piano, the late string quartets (see below), and two works for very large forces: the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Works from this period are characterised by their intellectual depth, their formal innovations, and their intense, highly personal expression. The [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 131]] has seven linked movements, and the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement.{{sfn|GroveOnline}} Other compositions from this period include the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'', the last five string quartets (including the massive ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'') and the last five piano sonatas.\n\nHe was attracted to the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In 1804, when Napoleon's imperial ambitions became clear, Beethoven took hold of the title page of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony]] and scratched the name Bonaparte out so violently that he made a hole in the paper. He later changed the work's title to \"Sinfonia Eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d'un grand'uom\" (\"Heroic Symphony, composed to celebrate the memory of a great man\"), and he rededicated it to his patron, Prince [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz]], at whose palace it was first performed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beethoven.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=&template=dokseite_digitales_archiv_en&_dokid=bi:i3113&_seite=1|title=Friedrich Oelenhainz (1745\u20131804), Franz Joseph Maximilian F\u00fcrst von Lobkowitz (1772\u20131816)]|website=[[Beethoven-Haus]] Bonn|accessdate=6 October 2018|date=April 2002}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn was unveiled in August 1845, in honour of the 75th anniversary of his birth.

A statue to Mozart had been unveiled in [[Salzburg]], Austria, in 1842.

Presolar [[cosmic dust#Stardust|stardust]] grains formed within outflowing and cooling gases from earlier presolar stars. \n\nThe [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] that took place within each presolar star gives to each granule an [[isotopes|isotopic]] composition unique to that parent star, which differs from the isotopic composition of our solar system's matter as well as from the galactic average. These isotopic signatures often fingerprint very specific astrophysical nuclear processes<ref>Ernst Zinner (1998) Stellar nucleosynthesis and the isotopic composition of presolar grains from primitive meteorites, ''Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences'' '''26''':147-188.</ref> that took place within the parent star and prove their presolar origin.<ref>T.

Stardust had a close encounter with the comet [[81P/Wild|Wild 2]] in January 2004 and also collected interstellar dust containing pre-solar interstellar grains.]]\n\n==Terminology==\n{{confusing section|date=January 2020}}\nMeteoriticists often use the term to represent ''stardust'', grains that originated within a single star and which they extract from meteorites for study. Because most interstellar grains are not stardust from a single star, however, being instead interstellar cloud matter accreted by smaller presolar grains, most presolar grains are also not stardust. Logically, all stardust are presolar grains; but not all presolar grains are stardust. This confusing terminology is heavily entrenched among 21st century meteoriticists who prefer to use the terms interchangeably, however, so both usages should employed or utilize the expression ''presolar stardust grains'' for ''stardust''.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, the noble gases [[neon]]<ref>D. C. Black and R. O. Pepin (1969) Trapped neon in meteorites. II., ''Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.'' '''36''', 377-394</ref> and [[xenon]]<ref>J. H. Reynolds and G. Turner (1964) Rare gases in the chondrite Renazzo, ''J. Geo. Phys. Res.'' '''69''', 3263-3281</ref> were discovered to have unusual [[isotopic signature|isotopic ratio]]s in primitive meteorites; their origin and the type of matter that contained them was a mystery. These discoveries were made by vaporizing a bulk sample of a meteorite within a [[mass spectrometer]], in order to count the relative abundance of the [[isotope]]s of the very small amount of [[noble gas]]es trapped as inclusions. During the 1970s similar experiments discovered more components of trapped xenon isotopes.<ref> Xenon has nine stable isotopes that differ in mass because they have different numbers of neutrons in their atomic nuclei. The mass spectrometer records the number of detected xenon atoms at atomic weights A=124, 126, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 134 and 136. By measuring these at several temperature steps in the heating of the sample it was demonstrated that trapped xenon had differing components within its total. It was speculated that one such component was xenon created when an unknown superheavy nucleus that was assumed to exist in the early Solar System underwent fission.</ref> Competing speculations about the origins of the xenon isotopic components were advanced, all within the existing paradigm that the variations were created by processes within an initially homogeneous solar gas cloud.\n\nA new theoretical framework for interpretation was advanced during the 1970s when [[Donald D. Clayton]] rejected the popular belief among meteoriticists that the solar system began as a uniform hot gas.<ref name=\"D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter 1975\">D. D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, Astrophys. H. 199, 765 (1975). ''Moon and Planets'' '''19''', 109-137 (1978)</ref> Instead he predicted that unusual but predictable isotopic  compositions would be found within thermally condensed interstellar grains that had condensed during mass loss from stars of differing types. He argued that such grains exist throughout the interstellar medium.<ref name=\"D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter 1975\"/><ref name=\"R.A. Ward 1978\">D.D. Clayton and R.A. Ward, s-process studies: xenon and krypton isotopic abundances, ''Astrophys. J.'' '''224''', 1000-1006 (1978). This paper was submitted in 1975 to Geochim. et Cosmochim Acta but was judged at that time to not be relevant to geochemistry. It was resubmitted to Astrophys J in 1978 after Edward Anders stated that he had discovered the pure s-process xenon gas in a bulk carbonaceous residue off a meteorite</ref> Clayton's first papers using that idea in 1975 pictured an interstellar medium populated with supernova grains that are rich in the radiogenic isotopes of Ne and Xe that had defined the extinct radioactivities.<ref>DD Clayton, Extinct radioactivities: trapped residuals of presolar grains, Astrophys. J. 199, 765 (1975); DD Clayton, 22Na, Ne-E, extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar, Nature 257, 36 (1975)</ref>  Clayton defined several different types of stardust presolar grains likely to be discovered: ''stardust'' from red giant stars, ''sunocons'' (acronym from ''SU''per''NO''va ''CON''densates) from [[supernova]]e, ''nebcons'' from nebular condensation by [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of cold cloud gaseous atoms and molecules, and ''novacons'' from [[nova]] condensation.<ref name=\"D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter 1975\"/> Despite vigorous and  continuous active development of this picture, Clayton's suggestions lay unsupported by others for a decade until such grains were discovered within meteorites.\n\nThe first unambiguous consequence of the existence of stardust within meteorites came from the laboratory of [[Edward Anders]] in Chicago,<ref>B. Srinivasan and E. Anders, ''Science'' '''201''', 51-56 (1978)</ref> who found using traditional mass spectrometry that the xenon isotopic abundances contained within an acid-insoluble carbonaceous residue that remained after the meteorite bulk had been dissolved in acids matched almost exactly the predictions for isotopic xenon in [[red giant]] stardust.<ref name=\"R.A. Ward 1978\"/> It then seemed certain that stardust grains were contained within Anders' acid-insoluble residue. Finding the actual stardust grains and documenting them was a much harder challenge that required locating the grains and showing that their isotopes matched those within the red-giant star.  There followed a decade of intense experimental searching in the attempt to isolate individual grains of those xenon carriers. But what was really needed to discover stardust was a new type of mass spectrometer that could measure the smaller number of atoms in a single grain. Sputtering ion probes were pursued by several laboratories in the attempt to demonstrate such an instrument. But the contemporary ion probes needed to be technologically much better.\n\nIn 1987 diamond grains<ref>Lewis R.S., Tang M., Wacker J.F., Anders E. and Steel E. (1987) ''Interstellar diamonds in meteorites'', Nature '''326''', 160-162</ref> and silicon carbide grains<ref name=\"Bernatowicz, T. 1987\">Bernatowicz, T., Fraundorf, G., Ming, T., Anders, E., Wopenka, B., Zinner, E., and Fraundorf, P. (1987) ''Evidence for interstellar SiC in the Murray carbonaceous meteorite'', Nature '''330''', 728.</ref>  were found to exist abundantly in those same acid-insoluble residues and also to contain large concentrations of noble gases. Significant isotopic anomalies were in turn measured by improvements in [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] within the structural chemical elements of these grains.<ref>[[Ernst Zinner]] (1996) Stardust in the laboratory, ''Science'' '''271''':5245, 41-42</ref> Improved SIMS experiments showed that the silicon isotopes within each SiC grain did not have solar isotopic ratios but rather those expected in certain red-giant stars. The finding of stardust is therefore dated 1987.<ref name=\"Bernatowicz, T. 1987\"/> To measure the isotopic abundance ratios of the structural elements (e.g. silicon in an SiC grain) in microscopic stardust grains had required two difficult technological and scientific steps: 1) locating micron-sized stardust grains within the meteorite's overwhelming mass; 2) development of SIMS technology to a sufficiently high level to measure isotopic abundance ratios within micron-sized grains. [[Ernst K. Zinner|Ernst Zinner]] became the undisputed leader of SIMS applications to microscopic grains,<ref>A special issue of ''Meteoritics and Planetary Science'' 42, No. 7/8 (2007) documents Zinner's role in honor of his 70th birthday. Read especially its introductory article by Kevin McKeegan.</ref> earning him historic acclaim.<ref>Zinner died in 2015 at age 78. His obituary is in February 2016 ''Physics Today'' by Donald Clayton tells more of Zinner's relationship to SIMS discoveries.</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, analysis of the [[Murchison meteorite]] found in [[Australia]] in 1969 revealed stardust formed 5 to 7 billion years ago, older than Earth's 4.6 billion year-old sun, making the meteor and its stardust the oldest solid material ever discovered on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/the-oldest-material-on-earth-has-been-found-in-a-meteorite/ar-BBYUQy4|title=The oldest material on Earth has been found in a meteorite|website=MSN|date=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"LS-20200113\">{{cite news |last=Weisberger |first=Mindy |title=7 Billion-Year-Old Stardust Is Oldest Material Found on Earth - Some of these ancient grains are billions of years older than our sun. |url=https://www.livescience.com/oldest-material-on-earth.html |date=13 January 2020 |work=[[Live Science]] |accessdate=13 January 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"PNAS-20200113\">{{cite journal |author=Heck, Philipp R. |display-authors=et al. |title=Lifetimes of interstellar dust from cosmic ray exposure ages of presolar silicon carbide |date=13 January 2020 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=1884\u20131889 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1904573117 |pmid=31932423 |pmc=6995017 }}</ref>\n\n==In meteorites==\nPresolar grains are the solid matter that was contained in the interstellar gas before the Sun formed.

However, Ti-44 has a half-life of only 59 years, and thus it is soon converted entirely to calcium-44. Excesses of the decay products of the longer lived, but extinct, [[nuclide]]s Ca-41 (half-life 350,000 years) and Al-26 (730,000 years) have also been detected in such grains.

Their atmospheres are cool enough for condensation processes to take place, resulting in the precipitation of solid particles (i.e., multiple atom agglomerations of elements such as carbon) in their atmosphere. This is unlike the atmosphere of the [[Sun]], which is too hot to allow atoms to build up into more complex molecules. These solid fragments of matter are then injected into the interstellar medium by [[radiation pressure]]. Hence, particles bearing the signature of stellar nucleosynthesis provide information on (i) condensation processes in red giant atmospheres, (ii) radiation and heating processes in the [[interstellar medium]], and (iii) the types of particles that carried the elements of which we are made, across the galaxy to our Solar System. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/a-meteorite-discovered-in-australia-contains-oldest-known-material-on-earth/amp|title=The Oldest Known Material on Earth Is Officially Older Than The Solar System|website=www.sciencealert.com|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Circumstellar dust]]\n* [[Cosmic dust]]\n* [[Cosmochemistry]]\n* [[Extraterrestrial diamonds]]\n* [[Extraterrestrial materials]]\n* [[Glossary of meteoritics]]\n* [[Interplanetary dust cloud]]\n* [[List of meteorite minerals]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180511174511/http://presolar.wustl.edu/Laboratory_for_Space_Sciences/Presolar_Grain_Research.html Presolar grain research]\n*[http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/users/nittler/psg_main.html Presolar grains in meteorites]\n*[http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/July97/Stardust.html Moving Stars and Shifting Sands of Presolar History]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030904030905/http://www.stecf.org/~ralbrech/amico/intabs/ottu.html Presolar Grains in Meteorites: An Overview and Some Implications]\n\n{{Meteorites}}\n{{Molecules detected in outer space}}\n{{portal bar|Chemistry|Physics|Space}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Presolar grains}}\n[[Category:Meteorite mineralogy and petrology]]\n[[Category:Meteorite minerals]]\n[[Category:Interstellar media]]\n[[Category:Nucleosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Cosmic dust]]\n", "text_old": "'''Presolar grains''' are interstellar solid matter in the form of tiny solid grains that originated at a time before the [[Sun]] was formed.

Because most interstellar grains are not stardust from a single star, however, being instead interstellar cloud matter accreted by smaller presolar grains, most presolar grains are also not stardust. Logically, all stardust are presolar grains; but not all presolar grains are stardust. This confusing terminology is heavily entrenched among 21st century meteoriticists who prefer to use the terms interchangeably, however, so both usages should employed or utilize the expression ''presolar stardust grains'' for ''stardust''.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, the noble gases [[neon]]<ref>D. C. Black and R. O. Pepin (1969) Trapped neon in meteorites. II., ''Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.'' '''36''', 377-394</ref> and [[xenon]]<ref>J. H. Reynolds and G. Turner (1964) Rare gases in the chondrite Renazzo, ''J. Geo. Phys. Res.'' '''69''', 3263-3281</ref> were discovered to have unusual [[isotopic signature|isotopic ratio]]s in primitive meteorites; their origin and the type of matter that contained them was a mystery. These discoveries were made by vaporizing a bulk sample of a meteorite within a [[mass spectrometer]], in order to count the relative abundance of the [[isotope]]s of the very small amount of [[noble gas]]es trapped as inclusions. During the 1970s similar experiments discovered more components of trapped xenon isotopes.<ref> Xenon has nine stable isotopes that differ in mass because they have different numbers of neutrons in their atomic nuclei. The mass spectrometer records the number of detected xenon atoms at atomic weights A=124, 126, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 134 and 136. By measuring these at several temperature steps in the heating of the sample it was demonstrated that trapped xenon had differing components within its total. It was speculated that one such component was xenon created when an unknown superheavy nucleus that was assumed to exist in the early Solar System underwent fission.</ref> Competing speculations about the origins of the xenon isotopic components were advanced, all within the existing paradigm that the variations were created by processes within an initially homogeneous solar gas cloud.\n\nA new theoretical framework for interpretation was advanced during the 1970s when [[Donald D. Clayton]] rejected the popular belief among meteoriticists that the solar system began as a uniform hot gas.<ref name=\"D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter 1975\">D. D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, Astrophys. H. 199, 765 (1975). ''Moon and Planets'' '''19''', 109-137 (1978)</ref> Instead he predicted that unusual but predictable isotopic  compositions would be found within thermally condensed interstellar grains that had condensed during mass loss from stars of differing types. He argued that such grains exist throughout the interstellar medium.<ref name=\"D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter 1975\"/><ref name=\"R.A. Ward 1978\">D.D. Clayton and R.A. Ward, s-process studies: xenon and krypton isotopic abundances, ''Astrophys. J.'' '''224''', 1000-1006 (1978). This paper was submitted in 1975 to Geochim. et Cosmochim Acta but was judged at that time to not be relevant to geochemistry. It was resubmitted to Astrophys J in 1978 after Edward Anders stated that he had discovered the pure s-process xenon gas in a bulk carbonaceous residue off a meteorite</ref> Clayton's first papers using that idea in 1975 pictured an interstellar medium populated with supernova grains that are rich in the radiogenic isotopes of Ne and Xe that had defined the extinct radioactivities.<ref>DD Clayton, Extinct radioactivities: trapped residuals of presolar grains, Astrophys. J. 199, 765 (1975); DD Clayton, 22Na, Ne-E, extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar, Nature 257, 36 (1975)</ref>  Clayton defined several different types of stardust presolar grains likely to be discovered: ''stardust'' from red giant stars, ''sunocons'' (acronym from ''SU''per''NO''va ''CON''densates) from [[supernova]]e, ''nebcons'' from nebular condensation by [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of cold cloud gaseous atoms and molecules, and ''novacons'' from [[nova]] condensation.<ref name=\"D. Clayton, Precondensed Matter 1975\"/> Despite vigorous and  continuous active development of this picture, Clayton's suggestions lay unsupported by others for a decade until such grains were discovered within meteorites.\n\nThe first unambiguous consequence of the existence of stardust within meteorites came from the laboratory of [[Edward Anders]] in Chicago,<ref>B. Srinivasan and E. Anders, ''Science'' '''201''', 51-56 (1978)</ref> who found using traditional mass spectrometry that the xenon isotopic abundances contained within an acid-insoluble carbonaceous residue that remained after the meteorite bulk had been dissolved in acids matched almost exactly the predictions for isotopic xenon in [[red giant]] stardust.<ref name=\"R.A. Ward 1978\"/> It then seemed certain that stardust grains were contained within Anders' acid-insoluble residue. Finding the actual stardust grains and documenting them was a much harder challenge that required locating the grains and showing that their isotopes matched those within the red-giant star.  There followed a decade of intense experimental searching in the attempt to isolate individual grains of those xenon carriers. But what was really needed to discover stardust was a new type of mass spectrometer that could measure the smaller number of atoms in a single grain. Sputtering ion probes were pursued by several laboratories in the attempt to demonstrate such an instrument. But the contemporary ion probes needed to be technologically much better.\n\nIn 1987 diamond grains<ref>Lewis R.S., Tang M., Wacker J.F., Anders E. and Steel E. (1987) ''Interstellar diamonds in meteorites'', Nature '''326''', 160-162</ref> and silicon carbide grains<ref name=\"Bernatowicz, T. 1987\">Bernatowicz, T., Fraundorf, G., Ming, T., Anders, E., Wopenka, B., Zinner, E., and Fraundorf, P. (1987) ''Evidence for interstellar SiC in the Murray carbonaceous meteorite'', Nature '''330''', 728.</ref>  were found to exist abundantly in those same acid-insoluble residues and also to contain large concentrations of noble gases. Significant isotopic anomalies were in turn measured by improvements in [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] within the structural chemical elements of these grains.<ref>[[Ernst Zinner]] (1996) Stardust in the laboratory, ''Science'' '''271''':5245, 41-42</ref> Improved SIMS experiments showed that the silicon isotopes within each SiC grain did not have solar isotopic ratios but rather those expected in certain red-giant stars. The finding of stardust is therefore dated 1987.<ref name=\"Bernatowicz, T. 1987\"/> To measure the isotopic abundance ratios of the structural elements (e.g. silicon in an SiC grain) in microscopic stardust grains had required two difficult technological and scientific steps: 1) locating micron-sized stardust grains within the meteorite's overwhelming mass; 2) development of SIMS technology to a sufficiently high level to measure isotopic abundance ratios within micron-sized grains. [[Ernst K. Zinner|Ernst Zinner]] became the undisputed leader of SIMS applications to microscopic grains,<ref>A special issue of ''Meteoritics and Planetary Science'' 42, No. 7/8 (2007) documents Zinner's role in honor of his 70th birthday.

The calcium in some presolar grains is composed primarily of Ca-44, which is presumably the remains of the [[extinct radionuclide]] Ti-44, a titanium isotope which is formed in abundance in [[Type II supernova]]e such as [[SN 1987A]] after rapid capture of four alpha particles by Si-28, after the process of [[silicon burning]] normally begins, and prior to the supernova explosion. However, Ti-44 has a half-life of only 59 years, and thus it is soon converted entirely to calcium-44. Excesses of the decay products of the longer lived, but extinct, [[nuclide]]s Ca-41 (half-life 350,000 years) and Al-26 (730,000 years) have also been detected in such grains. The rapid-process isotopic anomalies of these grains include relative excesses of N-15 and O-18 relative to Solar System abundances, as well as excesses of the neutron-rich [[stable nuclide]]s Ca-42, and Ti-49.<ref name=McSween>{{cite book| last=McSween| first=Harry|author2=Gary R.

Because the elements in these particles were made at different times (and places) in the early Milky Way, the set of collected particles further provides insight into [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galactic evolution]] prior to the formation of the Solar System. <ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/meteorite-grains-are-oldest-known-solid-material-on-earth-180973953/|title=Meteorite Grains Are the Oldest Known Solid Material on Earth|first=Jay|last=Bennett|website=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to providing information on nucleosynthesis of the grain's elements, solid grains provide information on the physico-chemical conditions under which they condensed, and on events subsequent to their formation. <ref name=\"auto\"/>  For example, consider [[red giant]]s \u2014 which produce much of the carbon in our galaxy. Their atmospheres are cool enough for condensation processes to take place, resulting in the precipitation of solid particles (i.e., multiple atom agglomerations of elements such as carbon) in their atmosphere. This is unlike the atmosphere of the [[Sun]], which is too hot to allow atoms to build up into more complex molecules. These solid fragments of matter are then injected into the interstellar medium by [[radiation pressure]]. Hence, particles bearing the signature of stellar nucleosynthesis provide information on (i) condensation processes in red giant atmospheres, (ii) radiation and heating processes in the [[interstellar medium]], and (iii) the types of particles that carried the elements of which we are made, across the galaxy to our Solar System. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/a-meteorite-discovered-in-australia-contains-oldest-known-material-on-earth/amp|title=The Oldest Known Material on Earth Is Officially Older Than The Solar System|website=www.sciencealert.com|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Circumstellar dust]]\n* [[Cosmic dust]]\n* [[Cosmochemistry]]\n* [[Extraterrestrial diamonds]]\n* [[Extraterrestrial materials]]\n* [[Glossary of meteoritics]]\n* [[Interplanetary dust cloud]]\n* [[List of meteorite minerals]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20180511174511/http://presolar.wustl.edu/Laboratory_for_Space_Sciences/Presolar_Grain_Research.html Presolar grain research]\n*[http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/users/nittler/psg_main.html Presolar grains in meteorites]\n*[http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/July97/Stardust.html Moving Stars and Shifting Sands of Presolar History]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030904030905/http://www.stecf.org/~ralbrech/amico/intabs/ottu.html Presolar Grains in Meteorites: An Overview and Some Implications]\n\n{{Meteorites}}\n{{Molecules detected in outer space}}\n{{portal bar|Chemistry|Physics|Space}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Presolar grains}}\n[[Category:Meteorite mineralogy and petrology]]\n[[Category:Meteorite minerals]]\n[[Category:Interstellar media]]\n[[Category:Nucleosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Cosmic dust]]\n", "name_user": "RTG", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCharacterization:piped Diamond->Extraterrestrial diamonds", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presolar_grains"}

Other publishers followed suit, with significant expansion across the industry in the 1980s. This supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry. The sourcing of play-by-mail games in this list largely comes from these magazines, whether from reviews or advertisements, as well as additional magazines such as ''[[Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]'', ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]'', and other publications that serviced the gaming community broadly, resuming with the contemporary online magazine ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'', which supports the small but active play-by-mail gaming community today.\n\nIn some cases, more than one publisher can be found for the same game on the list. This is because the rights to play-by-mail games were occasionally sold among publishers.{{efn|For example, in 1993, play-by-mail gaming company [[Schubel & Sons]] sold all games and licenses to Northwest Simulations.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 27|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} In other cases, games were licensed from the publishing company, which might be then moderated by a different company\u2014potentially even translated and played in a different country.{{efn|For example, in the March/April 1993 issue of ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' magazine, Prime Time Simulations announced that its play-by-mail game [[World Conquest (play-by-mail game)|''World Conquest'']] was licensed to multiple companies in Europe and was available in English, French, German, Dutch, and Italian.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 25|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} Many more play-by-mail games existed in nascent, playtest form than there are on this list.

Other publishers followed suit, with significant expansion across the industry in the 1980s. This supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry. The sourcing of play-by-mail games in this list largely comes from these magazines, whether from reviews or advertisements, as well as additional magazines such as ''[[Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]'', ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]'', and other publications that serviced the gaming community broadly, resuming with the contemporary online magazine ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'', which supports the small but active play-by-mail gaming community today.\n\nIn some cases, more than one publisher can be found for the same game on the list. This is because the rights to play-by-mail games were occasionally sold among publishers.{{efn|For example, in 1993, play-by-mail gaming company [[Schubel & Sons]] sold all games and licenses to Northwest Simulations.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 27|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} In other cases, games were licensed from the publishing company, which might be then moderated by a different company\u2014potentially even translated and played in a different country.{{efn|For example, in the March/April 1993 issue of ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' magazine, Prime Time Simulations announced that its play-by-mail game [[World Conquest (play-by-mail game)|''World Conquest'']] was licensed to multiple companies in Europe and was available in English, French, German, Dutch, and Italian.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 25|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} Many more play-by-mail games existed in nascent, playtest form than there are on this list. Only games which completed playtesting and were released for play are included here as a \"published\" game. This list includes games played only by [[postal mail]], those played by mail with a play-by-email option, and games played only in a turn-based play-by-email (PBEM) format.
