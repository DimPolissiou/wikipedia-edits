People of Limbuwan and [[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] citizens in the present context of federalism and autonomy in Nepal do not understand that of all the territories annexed by the kings of [[Gurkha|Gorkha]], Limbuwan was the only territory that was actually incorporated to the Kingdom of Nepal by the means of collective Gorkha-Limbuwan [[Treaty]] with the kings of ten kingdoms of Limbuwan and their ministers. Under the terms of the treaty, Limbuwan and her kings would accept the King of Nepal as their overlord and stay under the same Nepalese flag, but Limbuwan and her people were supposed to be completely autonomous with non-interference from the Kingdom of Nepal. However, over the period of the Shah dynasty, Limbuwan was gradually stripped of its original treaty rights. Therefore, the people of Limbuwan today are the most vocal proponents of [[federalism]] with [[autonomy]] in Nepal.\n\n==Pre-history==\n[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] and [[historian]]s claim that the [[Fossil|fossil records]] show that people lived in Nepal around 30-40 thousand years ago. The first people of Eastern Nepal were the Kirats in the hills and Koches in the Terai. {{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}. The first people to live permanently and call Limbuwan their home were the [[Kirant]] people.But, The term Limbuwan is not a valid term. many historians and scholars argue that there was no Limbuwan in Nepal. Limbuwan is a new term to mobilise a group of people who can fight against Kirat. These [[Mongoloid]] people are believed to have moved into Nepal from the Tibet or yunnan and beyond around 6-8 thousand years ago. They practiced shifting cultivation and moved with their domesticated pigs and other animals along the lower, warmer hills. The same people moved on to western [[Nepal]] and eventually conquered the Kathmandu valley to establish the first Kirant civilization of Nepalese history. They spoke the language of their sino-Tibetan and practiced [[Animism|animistic]] religion.\n\n==Bhauiputahang dynasty==\n'''King Bhauiputahang of Limbuwan''' - first independent king of Limbuwan (c. 580 BC)\n\nKing Jitedasti became the seventh Kiranti king in central Nepal around 580 BC. Kirant chiefs under King Jitedasti in the present-day Limbuwan area revolted against him and ceased to see him as their overlord. During that period all the Kirant chiefs used to pay monetary [[tribute]] and rendered military service to the Kirant kings of the Kathmandu valley. The system was similar to the [[feudal]] system in medieval Europe. After the revolts, the Kirant chiefs of eastern Nepal elected Bhauiputahang as their new king. King Bhauiputahang built his capital in Phedap and ruled eastern Nepal which comprised present-day Limbuwan.{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\nWhile central Nepal was ruled by kings of the Kirant dynasty, Limbuwan in east Nepal was also ruled by kings of Kirant dynasty. King Bhauiputahang was renowned in the Limbuwan and eastern parts of Nepal, while King Jitedasti sat on the throne in the Kathmandu valley.\n\n'''King Parbatak/ Eastern Nepal (c. 317 BC)'''\n\nA descendant of King Bhauiputahang, King Parbatak was a son of King Jeitehang and ruled Limbuwan around 317 BC. During that period, King Parbatak was the most powerful king of the Himalayan region and present-day Nepal. King Parbatak was allied with Chandra Gupta Maurya of [[Magadha]], and also assisted him in his military campaigns in the [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda]] kingdom. During his father King Jiete's rule, [[Alexander the great]] had invaded [[India]] and established his [[satraps]] in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]. King Parbatak assisted King [[Chandra Gupta Maurya]] in driving the [[Greeks|Greek]] Satraps Seleucus (military governor) away from Punjab and Sindh. For King Parbatak's assistance to Chandra Gupta, he gave lands in northern [[Bihar]] to King Parbatak and many Kiranti people migrated to northern Bihar during that period. They became known as Madhesia Kirant people, or Limbus of Kashi Gotra. King Parbatak Hang is also mentioned by Magadha historians as an ally of Maurya Emperor.\n\n'''King Samyuk of Limbuwan / Eastern Nepal (c. 125 BC)'''\n\nAfter seven generations of King Parbatak, King Samyuk sat on the throne of Limbuwan / Eastern Nepal. He was unpopular among the descendants of Madhesia Kirant people (descendants of those who lived in Bihar in King Parbatak's time). Under the leadership of Bazdeohang, people revolted against King Samyuk and overthrew him. The Kirant chiefs elected Bazdeo as the new king of Limbuwan.\n\n==Bazdeo dynasty==\n'''King Bazdeohang of Limbuwan (c. 125 BC on)'''\n\nAfter the revolution of the Kirant people of Limbuwan area, the Kirant chiefs of the region elected the rebel leader Bazdeohang as their king. He made his capital at [[Libang]] and started his own dynasty. He was followed by twelve other kings of his dynasty:\n\n* '''King Sangkhadeo I'''\n* '''King Sangkhadeo II'''\n* '''King Dewapour'''\n* '''King Bhichuuk'''\n* '''King Ghangtuk'''\n* '''King Sotumhang'''\n* '''King Limdung'''\n* '''King Lijehang'''\n* '''King Mapunhang'''\n* '''King Dendehang'''\n* '''King Kundungjapa'''\n* '''King Kundungjapa of Limbuwan'''\n\nThe last king of the Bazdeo dynasty had four sons: Mundhungge, Sandhungge, Kane Hang and Kochu Hang. It is said that Kochu Hang migrated to [[North Bengal]] and established his own kingdom, Kochpiguru, from where the term Koch is derived. After the death of King Kundungjapa, Limbuwan fell into chaos and anarchy, each chief ruling their own areas independently.\n\n==The era of eight kings==\nFrom the time of the last king of the Bazdeo dynasty, [[Limbuwan]] was ruled by eight chiefs and their descendants; none of them rose to become powerful enough to subdue all and none came to prominence. During this period, people migrated in and out of the Limbuwan region and around the 6th century AD, a group of people from the Shan-Makwan areas in [[China]] and [[Burma]] moved to Assam in India and eventually to the Limbuwan area in Nepal. The assimilation of the original Kirants of Limbuwan, the migrants from Tibet, the [[Mongol]]s and the tribes from the [[Bihar]] area and finally the migrant people of Shan-Makwan gave birth to the new nation of '''Limbuwan''', the nationality of Limbu and Limbu culture.\n\nThe Kirat states was ruled by eight feudal Chiefs.\n* Honden Hang\n* Yaketet Hang\n* Chesbi Hang\n* Laraso Pangbo Hang\n* Khesiwa Hang\n* Ekangso Hang\n* Khadi Hang\n* Eme Hang\n\n'''The revolution of the Taisiyan people in Limbuwan'''\n\nDuring the latter years of the rule of the eight Kiranti chiefs, the population of Limbuwan multiplied and families increased in number. Feeling that this was a threat, the eight rulers started to suppress the people. When the descendants of the Shan Mokwan people (the latest immigrants to Limbuwan) could not stand this any longer they devised a plan to overthrow the eight chiefs. They met at Ambe Pojoma and decided to revolt against the eight chiefs. The rebel leaders erected three stone pillars and planted three [[mango]] trees around them. After sprinkling holy waters, the rebel leaders and the rebel army took an oath that everyone would fight against the tyrant chiefs and would not return home until they had beaten the rulers.  The meeting place of Ambe Pojoma still exists to this day, and the battle of eight chiefs is incorporated in [[Limbu people|Limbu]] Mundhum ever since.\n\nAfter knowing that the rebellion was breaking out in their country; the eight rulers raised their own army and aimed at massacring and displacing people of Shan-Mokwan dulers were defeated in every village by the rebels. All the eight rulers were either killed or chased away from Limbuwan territory.\n\n==The era of ten Limbu kings (550\u20131609)==\nThus, with unity and strength, the people of Shan Mokwan origin defeated their rulers. After their victory, the rebel leaders assembled once again at their holy place Ambe Pojoma. The leaders fixed the northern boundary to be in Tibet, the southern boundary in JalalGarh in Bihar, the eastern boundary at the river [[Teesta River|Teesta]] and the western boundary at the [[Koshi River|Dudhkoshi]] River. Later the boundaries of Limbuwan came to rest at the Arun river in the west and [[Kanchenjunga]] mountain and the [[Mechi]] river in the east.\n\nThe meeting of rebel leaders decided to name the recently acquired country Limbuwan as it was won by the strength of a bow and arrow (Li = \"bow\", ambu = \"acquire\" in the Limbu language). They also decided to divide Limbuwan into ten districts or kingdoms and place ten kings to rule each kingdom. They also agreed to defend Limbuwan from any external threat by rendering military assistance from all the ten kingdoms. They changed the name of their nationality to Yakthumba. Originally at the beginning only the kings of Limbuwan were called Limbus and the people of Limbuwan were called Yakhthungba, but over time the people of Limbuwan started calling themselves [[Limbu people|Limbu]]. Thus, the term Limbu and Yakthungba became synonymous.\n\nThis period in '''Limbuwan history''' corresponds to the [[Lichhavi]] and [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] dynasty periods in the Nepal Valley.\n\nThe ten rulers, their kingdoms and their forts.\n\n*  '''Samlupi Samba Hang''' -- king of Tambar (his capital Tambar Yiok)\n*  '''Sisigen Sireng Hang''' -- king of Mewa and Maiwa kingdoms (his capital Meringden Yiok)\n*  '''Thoktokso Angbo Hang''' -- king of Athraya (his capital Pomajong)\n*  '''Thindolung Khoya Hang''' -- king of Yangwarok (his capital Hastapojong Yiok)\n*  '''Ye nga so Papo Hang''' -- king of Panthar (his capital at Yashok and Phedim)\n*  '''Shengsengum Phedap Hang''' -- king of Phedap (his capital at Poklabung)\n*  '''Mung Tai Chi Emay Hang''' -- king of Ilam (his capital at [[Phakphok]])\n*  '''Saiyok Ladho Hang''' -- king of Miklung (Choubise) (his capital at Shanguri Yiok)\n*  '''Tappeso Perung Hang''' -- king of Thala (his capital at Thala Yiok)\n*  '''Taklung Khewa Hang''' -- king of Chethar (his capital at  Yiok)\n\n==Ten kings of Limbuwan==\n\n'''King Mung Mawrong Hang'''\n\nAt the beginning of the 7th century, King Mung Mawrong Hang came to prominence in the terai lands of Limbuwan (present-day [[Sunsari]], [[Morang]] and [[Jhapa]] area). He cleared much of the forest area in present-day Rangeli, east of Biratnagar, and built a town there. Since the ten kings of Limbuwan had sovereignty over the terai lands through the Kingdom of Ilam and the Kingdom of Bodhey (Choubise), they assembled a collective Limbuwan force and chased King Mawrong from Rongli area.\n\nMawrong went to Tibet and took refuge in Khampa Jong, but he still had an ambition to rule all of Limbuwan. When Limbuwan was ruled by ten kings and when King Mawrong came to prominence, Tibet was ruled by King Tsrong Tsen Gempo. Mawrong went on to ally with Tibetan King Tsrong Tsen Gempo, managed to get Bhutia tribes of Khampa jong to assist him and planned on attacking Limbuwan from the north. King Mawrong attacked Limbuwan, the ten kings of Limbuwan brought their forces and fought decisive battle through Hatia, Walungchung and Tapkey passes in the Himalayas. Ten kings of Limbuwan lost and King Mawrong rose as the overlord of Limbuwan. The ten kings of Limbuwan still continued to rule their original places as subordinate to King Mung Mawrong.\n\nKing Mawrong also started a festival among the Kirant people called \u201cNamban\u201d, where people celebrate the gathering of harvest every year, in the last week of December.\n\nKing Mawrong had no male heir, so when he died one of his ministers took over, becoming King Mokwan San. After a brief period King Uba Hang came to prominence in Limbuwan area.\n\n==The era of the Lasahang dynasty==\n\n'''King Uba Hang''' (ruled 849\u2013865)\n\nFollowing the death of King Mawrong, Uba Hang became powerful and renowned in Limbuwan area. He subdued the Limbuwan area which was under King Mokwan San and became King. He is known for introducing new faith among Limbu people and bringing changes to the Kirant mundhum religion. He taught his subjects to worship the great spirit of Tagera Ningwafumang with flowers and fruit, but not with blood sacrifice.\n\nHe built Chempojong fort and palace in Ilam. He introduced the festival of Tong Sum Tong Nam, held every three years in honour of Limbu Ancestor goddess Yumasammang and supreme god Tagera Ningwafumang. This Tong Sum Tong Nam festival is still held in Panchthar district of Nepal and is called Trisala Puja in [[Nepali language]].\n \n'''King Mabo Hang''' (ruled 865\u2013880)\n\nKing Mabo Hang succeeded his father King Uba Hang in Limbuwan. He ruled Limbuwan for 15 years with the title of Thakthakkum Mabo Hang. He was well respected and known in Limbuwan and many also believed him to be the reincarnation of  god. He moved his capital from Chempo Jong in Ilam to Yasok Jong in [[Panchthar]].\n\n'''King Muda Hang'''\n\nAfter the death of Mabo hang his son Muda hang succeeded to the throne, but he was a weak king and unlike his father and grandfather he was not able to subdue all the rulers of ten Limbuwan. The ten rulers of Limbuwan declared independence in their own districts and began ruling independently. There was anarchy and chaos in [[Limbuwan]] as the rulers and clan chiefs tried to establish their own hagemony over Limbuwan. Thus Limbuwan disintegrated, and Lasa dynasty kings were reduced to being only kings of [[Panchthar]] area and the southern Limbuwan.\n\n'''King Wedo Hang'''\n\nIn the chaos and integration of [[Limbuwan]], King Muda hang was succeeded by his son Wedo Hang. He ruled from Hellang palace in Panthar. In Panchthar district King Muda Hang was fighting Nembang hang Chief, the same chief fought with king wedo hang as well. When chief Nembang hang failed to defeat he plotted King Wedo Hang's assassination, he married his sister Dalima to King Wedo Hang to be close to Hellang Palace. King Wedo Hang was murdered by his enemies while he was sleeping. Queen Dalima, sister of Nembang chief was pregnant with King Wedo's child at the time of the murder. Chief Pathong Hang sat on the throne of Hellang palace ruling present-day Panchthar area. Queen Dalima left Hellang palace and went on to live in Chempojong palace in Ilam. Chempojong palace was the ancestral home of the Lasahang dynasty kings built by King Uba Hang.\n\n'''King Chemjong Hang'''\n\nThe fifth king of Lasa dynasty was King Chemjong Hang. He was born in Chempojong palace in Ilam, where his mother was living. When he was born his mother disguised him by dressing him as a girl, fearing that Chief Pathong Hang's people would come and murder him. She told him that his father's enemy would destroy him if they were to find out his true identity. He grew up to be a wise and strong individual under the disguise as a girl. His mother having told him of his late father's followers in the northern part of Limbuwan, he made his way there and forged alliances with the chiefs. He made a surprise attack while everyone at Hellang palace was celebrating the marriage of one of the district chiefs. After capturing Hellang palace, he revealed his identity to all those present and they accepted him as the true ruler and heir of the late King Wedo Hang. Since he had no real name and that he was born in the old palace of Chempojong, the assembled chiefs decided to name him Chemjong Hang, which became his name. He once again tried to unite all of [[Limbuwan]] and succeeded in extending from present-day [[Panchthar]], [[Illam]], [[Dhankuta]], [[Sunsari]], [[Morang]] and [[Jhapa]]. Back in those days Morang composed of the lower terai lands of Sunsari, Morang and Jhapa, while northern Limbuwan was still in fragments.\n\n==The era of King Sirijunga (880\u2013915)==\n\nKing Galijunga who ruled the Yangwarok kingdom of Limbuwan during the time of King Uba Hang; Ubahang was Galijunga's overlord at the period. As King Muda hang became weak and started losing control of Limbuwan, the grandson of King Galijung, Sirijunga rose to power in the northern Limbuwan area. King Sirijunga\u2019a ancestors had ruled [[Kathmandu valley]] during the Kirant era in Nepal.\n\n'''Unification of northern Limbuwan'''\n\nDuring the anarchic period of King Muda Hang, King Sirijunga became powerful enough to subdue all the Limbu chiefs under his control.\n\n'''Famous Sirijunga forts'''\n\nKing Sirijung constructed two big forts at present-day Sirjung in [[Terhathum]] district and Chainpur in Sankhuwasabha district. The forts were named Sirjunga fort, and the remains of the structures still stand today.\n\n'''King Sirijunga script'''\n\nKing Sirijunga is also known for developing and introducing Sirijunga script to the Limbus, which is still in use today. The Mundhum, Kirant Limbu religious text of Mundhum states that King Sirijunga was asked by Nisammang (Limbu god of learning) to accompany her to the base of mount Phoktanglungma. The goddess took him to the deepest cave in the mountain and gave him the stone slab consisting of writings. There he was also blessed with the power of knowledge; the goddess taught him how to read and write that language and told him to spread the scriptures to his people. The king returned to his palace and began teaching the script and knowledge to Limbu people.\n\n'''The Kipat land system of King Sirijunga'''\n\nKing Sirijunga is also known for his famous land reform law. He introduced a Kipat land system, whereby he divided lands to the chiefs of each clan or village and vested them with the full power over his land. The chief's powers did not extend beyond his borders and chiefs were expected to extend full military support from his village during the time of war to all the Kings of Limbuwan for the protection of Limbuwan. One of the important characteristics of the Kipat system was that neither the chief nor his people were allowed to sell their land to any outsiders or any non-clan members. Non-clan members were only allowed to rent the land for the period of time and were not supposed to take permanent land ownership. The land was to be divided equally among all sons and unmarried daughters. He also decreed that all the chiefs of villages must have a council, called Chumlung, of four members to assist him in ruling the villages. The chief presided over all the clan/village meetings and festivals. He also had enough powers so that his decisions were considered final. Ever since the time of King Sirijunga, Limbu people of Limbuwan have been enjoying special Kipat rights over their lands. No one could take away the Kipat lands and the lands belonged communally to specific clan. The Kipat land system devised by King Sirijunga of Limbuwan gained popularity in other Kirant areas in Nepal as well. The Kipat land system was used by people of Kirant Rai, Kirant Sunuwar and even [[Tamang]] people. Following King Sirijunga all the rulers of Limbuwan area up to King Mahendra had promised to uphold the special laws and custom of the Kipat system of Limbuwan during or right after their coronation.\n\n==The period of the ten kings after King Sirijunga==\n\nAfter the death of King Sirijunga, [[Limbuwan]] was once again ruled by the ten kings of the kingdoms of Limbuwan; this period lasted from 915 to 1584. The ten kingdoms formed after the great revolution of Limbuwan in the 6th century all remained the same. The current state of Limbu nation, culture, language and ethnicity is believed to have taken shape during this period.\n\nDuring this period, the lowlands of Limbuwan (present-day terai lands of Sunsari, Morang and Jhapa) collectively known as Morang since the time of King Mung Mawrong Hang, developed as a kingdom in its own right. At the beginning of 1400, Morang Kingdom patriates from the Kingdom of Ilam and the Kingdom of Mikluk Bodhey (Choubise) and began ruling on its own. Morang Kingdom's borders were set at Kankai river in the east, Koshi river in the west, Shanguri fort in the north and Jalal garh in India in the south. King Sangla Ing became the first king of the lowland Limbuwan kingdom of Morang after 900 years since it last had its own king. He built alliances with the other kings of Limbuwan and remained on good terms. He built his kingdom at Varatappa and ruled from there. King Sangla Ing was succeeded by his son Pungla Ing, who later converted to Hinduism and changed his name to Amar Raya Ing.\n\n==The Sanglaing dynasty kings==\n\n'''King Sangla Ing''' (first king of Ing dynasty)\n\n'''King Pungla Ing''' (became Amar Raya Ing)\n\n'''King Kirti Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\n'''King Ap Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\n'''King Jarai Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\n'''King Indhing Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\n'''King Bijay Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\nThe last king of the Ing dynasty of [[Morang]] Kingdom Bijay Narayan built a good friendship with the king of Phedap, Murray Hang Khebang. He then advised King Bijay Narayan to build a new town after his name, and thus Bijaypur town was settled. Bijaypur town, near present-day [[Dharan, Nepal|Dharan City]] remained the capital of Morang Kingdom and of all of Limbuwan until 1774. King Bijay Narayan then persuaded King Murray Hang Khebang of Phedap to stay in Bijaypur and assist him in ruling Morang Kingdom as his prime minister. King Murray Hang Khebang agreed to the proposal and his title of prime minister became a hereditary position for his descendants. In this way King Bijay Narayan Raya Sanglaing effectively made King Murray Hang his prime minister and Murray Hang's son Bajahang Raya Khebang ruled the kingdom of Phedap under his father. King Bijay Narayan also gave the title of Raya, \u201cKing\u201d, to Murray Hang. Since then, King Murray Hang Khebang became the first prime minister of Limbuwan and second king of Limbuwan to hold the Hindu title of \u201cRaya\u201d.\n\nOver time, the relationship between King Bijay Narayan Raya Sanlgaing and his prime minister Murray Hang Khebang soured. The king accused Murray Hang of raping his daughter and sentenced him to death. Hearing the news of Murray Hang's betrayal by the king of Morang, his son King Bajahang Khebang decided to punish the King of Morang. He went to Makwanpur and asked for the help of King Lo Hang Sen of Makwanpur. King Lohang Sen of Makwanpur with the help of the Kirant force conquered Bijaypur in 1608. King of Phedap Bajahang Khebang, who had come to take revenge of his father's death, died on the battlefield; at the same time, King Bijay Narayan also died of natural causes. King Lohang Sen of Makwanpur then appointed King Bajahang Khebang's son and Murray Hang's grandson, Bidya Chandra Raya Khebang, as prime minister of the Morang Kingdom and gave him autonomy to rule Morang. Lohang Sen returned to Makwanpur and King Bidya Chandra Raya Khebang went to [[Lhasa]] to get recognition as the real King of Limbuwan. King Bidya Chandra successfully gets the Royal document with the seal of Dalai Lama recognition of him as the ruler of all of Phedap and Morang. In the meantime, the rest of the kingdoms of Limbuwan were ruled by their own kings.\n\n==The era of divided Limbuwan (1609\u20131741)==\n\nThe death of King Bijay Narayan Sanglaing of Morang and the subsequent war of revenge by the King of Phedap led to the conquest of the Morang Kingdom of Limbuwan by Lo Hang Sen of Mokwanpur. This event led to the era of divided Limbuwan because the association of Limbuwan states no longer existed. Only a few of the ten kingdoms of Limbuwan actually formed alliances with the Sen king and saw him as their overlord. In the meantime, in 1641, when King Phuncho Namgyal became the king of [[Sikkim]], independent Limbu kings of Tambar Kingdom, Yangwarok Kingdom, Panthar Kingdom and Ilam Kingdom allied with the Sikkimese king, effectively dividing Limbuwan in half. From the enthronement of King Puncho Namgyal of Sikkim in 1641 to 1741, the eastern and northern [[Limbuwan]] kings allied with the kings of Sikkim.\n\n==The era of the Namgyal dynasty in eastern and northern Limbuwan (1641\u20131741)==\n\nFrom 1641 to 1741 for approximately a hundred years, the Limbu kings of Tambar, Yangwarok, Panthar and Ilam kingdoms allied with the King of Sikkim and saw him as their overlord. During this time the other kingdoms of Limbuwan were allied with the Sen king of Makwanpur. King Puncho Namgyal died in 1670 and was succeeded by his son King Tensong Namgyal, who married three queens. The youngest queen was from Limbuwan, and her name was Queen Thungwa Mukma, daughter of the King of Yangwarok, Yong Ya Hang. King Tensong Namgyal of Sikkim built a new palace and asked his youngest queen to name it. She names it \u201cSong Khim\u201d meaning new home. Over time this name changed from \"Songkhim\" to \"Sukkhim\", and eventually the name \"[[Sikkim]]\" came into being. The original name of Sikkim was Mayel in the Lepcha language, Chungjung in the Limbu language and Denjong in the Bhutia language. King Tensong was succeeded by his son and third king Chhyagdor Namgyal. During his time, Bhutan attacked Sikkim and occupied it for eight years. With the help of Tibetans he regained his throne. He died in 1716 and was succeeded by his son, King Gyurmi Namgyal. In 1733 King Gyurmi Namgyal of Sikkim died childless, then his minister declared himself the King of Sikkim under the title of \u201cTamding Gyalpo\u201d and started ruling from the throne of Rabdentse palace. He ruled from 1738 to 1741. This threw the Limbu alliance with Sikkim into disarray as other ministers had placed the infant king on the throne. Meanwhile, in 1741, a Limbu scholar named Srijunga Sing Thebe of Yangwarok Kingdom of Limbuwan came to western Sikkim to teach Limbu script and literature to the Kirant people there. The Tibetan Tachhang Lamas of Pemayangtse monastery feared the Limbu Sirijunga Xin Thebe's actions. They killed him by tying him to a tree and shooting him with arrows. This caused anger in Limbuwan and the kings of all the kingdoms of Limbuwan that had allied with the King of Sikkim in 1641 broke off the ties and stopped regarding the kings of Sikkim as their overlords and allies. Thus the [[Chogyal|Namgyal dynasty]] ended in Limbuwan in 1741, and after breaking off ties with Sikkim, the four Limbu kings and their kingdoms remained neutral and independent.\n\n==The era of the Sen dynasty in western and southern Limbuwan (1609\u20131769)==\n\nFrom 1609 to 1769, for about 160 years, the Sen kings of Makwanpur were nominal kings of Morang and allied to the other five kings of Limbuwan. The era of the Sen dynasty in Limbuwan began with the conquest of the Morang kingdom by King Lo Hang Sen to avenge the death of the prime minister of Morang.  They were Hindus of present-day Bihar and Terai region.\n\n===King Lo Hang Sen (1609\u201361)===\n\nFollowing the enthronement of King Lo Hang Sen to the throne of Morang Kingdom at Bijaypur, Limbuwan also entered the phase of [[Hindu]] influence.  King Lo Hang Sen ruled from 1609 to 1641 and managed to get all the kings of Limbuwan who were not allied with [[Sikkim]] on his side. He promised the Limbu people and their chiefs that the Kipat land system, the Limbu language, culture and way of life that had been practised for thousands of years would be protected. He also promised to Kings of Limbu kingdoms that they would get full autonomy and power to rule their own kingdoms. This way King Lo Hang Sen managed to become the King of Kings in Limbuwan and take the title of Maharajadhiraj. He appointed three Limbu ministers to his court in Makwanpur. In the meantime, the kingdom of Morang with its capital Bijaypur was ruled by the descendants of King Murray Hang Khebang, the Prime Ministers during the Sanglaing dynasty.\n\n===King Harihar Sen (1661\u201384)===\n\nKing Harihar Sen, the grandson of Lo Hang Sen, succeeded his grandfather to the throne of Morang. He extended Morang up to Gondwara in Bihar, gave himself the title of \u201cHindupati Maharaj\u201d, and built a new palace in Chanjitpur in lower Morang. He placed his grandson Bidhata Indra Sen on the throne of Morang. This was not liked by Hahrihar Sen's sons so civil war broke out. In this chaotic struggle, Subha Sen, younger son of King Harihar Sen, was victorious and started ruling Morang.\n\nKing Subha Sen ruled Morang for 22 years, while King Bidhata Indra Sen was also ruling Morang. Both King Subha Sen and Bidhata Indra Sen were tricked into coming to the palace of the Nawab of Purnea, who then betrayed them and sent them to the Mughal Emperor in [[Delhi]]. Both the uncle and nephew kings died at the hands of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor. After finding out about this betrayal, Queen Padmidhata Induraj Rajeswari, the wife of King Bidhata Indra Sen, called upon the allies of Morang Kingdom, all the nine kings of Limbuwan, to assist her in punishing the Nawab of Purnea.\n\n===Queen Padmidhata Induraj Rajeswari Sabitra Sen (1706\u201325)===\n\nThe kings ruling nine Kingdoms of Limbuwan at that time were, Chemjong King, Pasenama King, Lingdom King, Khewa King, Sukmi King, Makkhim King, Vaji King, Gabha King, and Shah Hang King. They were titled Roy by the Sen Kings of Morang, Roy was equivalent of King.\n\nAnother war of revenge broke out with the united forces of Limbuwan under the command of Chemjong King and the Nawab of Purnea at Jalal Garh. The Limbuwan forces were victorious; their leaders established the boundary at Jalal Gurh in the south.\n\nThe kings of Limbuwan decided to bring the capital city of Morang back to Bijaypur from Chanjitpur. They placed Queen Padmidhata Indurajrajeswari on the throne of Bijaypur. The same Khebang dynasty kings of Phedap served as prime minister of Morang and other Limbus served as ministers and chautariayas.\n\nIn 1721, about fifteen years after the War of Revenge with the Nawabs of Purnia, Limbuwan established friendly and trading relations with the kingdom of Purnea in the south. King Pasenama, who was also a minister of Morang, went to Purnea and established the bilateral relationship.\n\n===King Mahipati Sen (1725\u201361)===\n\nAfter almost twenty years of reign, Queen Padmidhata died. The kings of Limbuwan and their ministers assembled and elected Mahipati Sen of Makwanpur, son of the late King Subha Sen, as the king of Morang and placed him on the throne in Bijaypur. He effectively became King of Kings of Limbuwan or Maharajadhiraja of Limbuwan. Mahipati Sen was a weak king; he had no legitimate issue, but had eighteen illegitimate sons. Kamadatta Sen, the eldest of the illegitimate sons, would succeed King Mahipati Sen of Morang and Maharajadhiraj of Limbuwan.\n\n===King Kamadatta Sen (1761\u201369)===\n\nDuring the reign of King Mahipati Sen, the prime minister of Morang was King Bichitra Chandra Raya Khebang of Phedap Kingdom. When Mahipati Sen died, he did not allow Kamadatta Sen to be the full ruler of Morang Kingdom because he thought Kamadatta was illegitimate. During this time, the Sen kings had given much of the terai lands of Morang to the Limbu kings and chiefs for their personal jagir, believing that they would not revolt against them.\n\nThe feud between King Kamdatta Sen and his prime minister grew as the tensions of the power struggle increased; Prime Minister Bichitra Chandra Raya Khebang was succeeded by his son, [[Budhhi Karna Raya Khewang|Buddhi Karna Raya Khebang]]. Buddhi Karna pursued his father's policy of disengaging Kamadatta Sen from state affairs. Then finally Kamadatta Sen had had enough; he came to Bijaypur and occupied the throne and expelled Buddhi Karna from Morang. Buddhi Karna went to Rabdentse palace in Sikkim to get help.\n\nKamadatta Sen turned out to be a worthy ruler and established good relations with everyone. He declared that all the Limbu kings of Limbuwan, their ministers and chiefs were to be of his own lineage and that they were to be treated as his own family. He also married Princess Thangsama Angbohang, sister of King of Hastapur yak who were defeated by the king of Yangwrook in Limbuwan. He appointed King Shamo Raya Chemjong of Miklung Bodhey Kingdom (Choubise) as his Prime Minister and requested him to come to his palace in Bijaypur and manage his country. He again guaranteed autonomy and Kipat to all the people and chiefs of Limbuwan. He established friendly relations with the king of Bhutan, king of Sikkim and Tibet. King Dev Zudur of [[Bhutan]] even sent his representatives to King Kama Datta Sen's coronation. Morang and Limbuwan already had good relations with the Kingdom of Purnea in the south and he also developed good relations with King Ranjit Malla of Bhaktapur.\n\nThus with his appeasement policies to the people of Limbuwan and good relations with the neighbouring states of Limbuwan, he gained much confidence and popularity in Limbuwan.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1769, the exiled and unhappy prime minister of Morang, Buddhi Karna, planned a conspiracy to assassinate King Kama Datta Sen, who was ambushed and killed in Morang on his way to a meeting.\n\n===The era of divided Limbuwan===\n\n'''King [[Budhhi Karna Raya Khewang]] of Morang (1769\u201373)'''\n\nAfter the assassination of Kama Datta Sen, Buddhi Karna came to Bijaypur and became the last king of Morang and Limbuwan. But on hearing of the death of King Kama Datta Sen, all the states that made up Limbuwan and their allies split up. The kings of Limbuwan no longer had allegiance to Buddhi Karna. He seriously needed able ministers and chiefs to assist him in ruling Morang and all of Limbuwan. He sent people to look for King Shamo Raya Chemjong of Miklung Bodhey Kingdom to help him.\n\nDuring this time,\n\n'''King Shridev Roy Phago''' -- king of Maiwa Kingdom\n\n'''King Raina Sing Raya Sireng''' -- king of Mewa Kingdom\n\n'''King Ata Hang''' -- king of Phedap Kingdom\n\n'''King Subhawanta Libang''' -- king of Tambar Kingdom\n\n'''King Yehang''' -- king of Yangwarok Kingdom\n\n'''King Thegim Hang''' -- king of Panthar Kingdom\n\n'''King Lingdom Hang''' -- king of Ilam Kingdom\n\n'''King Shamo Roya Chemjong Hang''' -- king of Miklung Bodhey (Choubise, including southern Panther)\n\n'''King Khewa Hang''' -- king of Chethar (including Dasmajhiya, Jalhara and Belhara areas)\n\n'''King [[Budhhi Karna Raya Khewang]]''' -- king of Morang (including present-day Sunsari, Morang and Jhapa areas)\n\nKing Shamo Raya Chemjong was responsible for leading the Kings of Limbuwan and chiefs of Limbuwan in signing a treaty with the King of Gorkha. King Shamo Chemjong was also the prime minister of Morang Kingdom and effectively ruled Morang when King Buddhi Karna was away from Bijaypur to seek help from the British. The king of [[Ilam District|Ilam]], King Lingdom's son, was the last king of Limbuwan to sign a treaty with the King of Gorkha.\n\nThe [[Limbuwan Gorkha War]] ended in 1774, following a treaty between the King of Gorkha and  the Kings of Limbuwan and their ministers in Bijaypur, Morang.\n\n==The era of the Shah dynasty in Limbuwan==\n{{Further|Limbuwan Gorkha War}}\n\n'''[[King Prithivi Narayan Shah]] (1768\u201375)'''\n\nThe major role that King Prithivi Narayan played in Limbuwan history was the incorporation of [[Limbuwan]] lands into his [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] Kingdom. Following this, the [[Gorkha | Gorkha Empire]] became Nepal. The former ten kingdoms of Limbuwan were divided into seventeen districts; the former kings became subbas under the new king and were granted autonomy, which was eroded over time. Kipat rights included ownership of rice fields, pasture fields, forests, water sources, rivers and mineral resources. While the rest of Nepal had the \u201cRaikar\u201d system of land ownership, only farwest Nepal and  Limbuwan had the state sanctioned \u201cKipat\u201d system. The policy of autonomy to Limbuwan by the [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] king was to ensure that Limbus always stayed loyal to him. Thus it would be easier for the Gorkhas to both conquer Sikkim and subdue Limbu brotherns [[Kirant]] Khambu (Rais) of Majh Kirant at the same time. This was an example of the divide and rule policy of the Shah rulers.\n\nThe '''Gorkha-Limbuwan Treaty''' of 1774 CE ended the [[Limbuwan Gorkha War history|Limbuwan Gorkha wars]].\n\nThe [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] Bhardars, [[Abhiman Singh Basnet]], [[Parath Bhandari]], Kirti Singh Khawas and Bali Bania on behalf of Gorkha raja Prithivi Narayan Shah, agreed to take an oath and swear on \u201cNoon pani\u201d (salt-water) promising that [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] raja would never confiscate Limbus\u2019 Kipat land (autonomous land) nor destroy them. If he confiscated their Kipat land and destroyed them, then the god, upon whom Gorkha Raja had sworn and put faith in, would destroy him, his descendants and his kingdom. At this swearing ceremony, a big copper cauldron was brought in front of Gorkha and Limbu representatives and one pathi (eight pounds) of salt was put into it. [[Limbu people|Limbu]] ministers then poured water into it and stirred properly to mix the salt with water. Then the ministers asked the Gorkha bhardars to extract salt out of the water. They answered that salt had mixed and had become impossible to extract from the water.\n\nThe [[Limbu people|Limbu]] ministers then said: \u201dAlthough the salt has melted and it is impossible to extract it from the water, yet the water has become tasteful. You, the Gorkhas, are like water and we the Kirant Limbu people, are like salt. You Gorkhas people want us to melt in you, but you will not remain as before. When we mix or amalgamate with you, then you Gorkhas will be more exalted than before. But, if you betray us by taking our right of Kipat land, then what oath will you take for not violating this agreement?\u201d The Gorkha bhardars, on behalf of Gorkha raja, took a handful of salt water in their hands and swore that the Gorkha raja would never betray them by forfeiting the Kipat land (self-governing autonomous land). If the [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] King did so, his descendants would melt like salt and disappear from the world. The Gorkha Bhardars, then questioned the Kirant [[Limbu people|Limbu]] ministers, saying if they will betray the Gorkha raja by violating \u201cNoon pani\" agreement what oath would they take for never violating such an agreement. The [[Kirant]] [[Limbu people|Limbu]] ministers took a handful of salt water and swore that they would never go against the Gorkhali king. If they did so then their descendants would also melt like salt and disappear from the world.\n\nAfter making such agreement on salt-water (sacred and important elements), the Gorkha bhardars on behalf of Gorkha raja gave the following treaty paper, or Lal Mohor, to the Limbu ministers of Bijaypur.\n\nTranslation of the agreement between the Limbu ministers of [[Morang]] kingdom and King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] of [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] Kingdom in 1774:{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\n\u201cLet this be our agreement that I want to have you as the members of my own family. My religious mind is good. You are under my protection from now. By my power, your country is now mine but you are still ours. I will take the responsibility of progress and protection of your families. I will retain your rights to anything you possess. You keep in contact with my officers, help them and enjoy your land with full right as long as it exists. You are different from Nau lakh Rai, because their kings will be displaced. You who call yourselves Kings are not destroyable. I know your policy and good intentions.\u201d\n\u201cThe Kingdom of [[Sikkim]] had not come to terms with us. My officers have come to your land with full instructions. You will come to now everything through them. You agree with them and enjoy your land individually in a manner as mentioned above. I, hereby, agree to abide by the above-mentioned terms of agreement of never taking your land by force and destroying you. I swear on the copper plate and say that if I violate the above-mentioned promises, then let the God upon whom I and my family depend and worship, destroy my descendants and my kingdom. I have written the above-mentioned agreement and hereby hand it over to the above-mentioned [[Limbu people|Limbu]] brothers on this day of twenty second shrawan of Sambat eighteen hundred and thirty one at our capital city of [[Kantipur]] may it be blessed and fortunate.\u201d\n\nWhen the allies of [[Morang]] Kingdom heard the news of the agreement between the Gorkha and Morong kingdoms, the [[Limbu people|Limbu]] rulers of Mewa Kingdom, Phedap Kingdom, Maiwa Kingdom and Tambar Kingdom also came to Bijaypur (present-day [[Dharan, Nepal|Dharan]]) to join the alliance with the Gorkha King under the same terms and conditions of the treaty. The rulers of the regions Papo Hang, Thegim Hang and Nembang Hang under the leadership of Chemjong Hang (ShriShun rai) decided to join the Gorkha king on the same conditions.\n\nThus the [[Limbuwan-Gorkha War]] came to an end in 1774, with all the principalities of [[Limbuwan]] joining Gorkha Kingdom except the King of Yangwarok (Kingdom of Yangwarok consists of present-day parts of [[Taplejung]], [[Panchthar]]) and King of [[Ilam District|Ilam]] Hangsu Phuba of Lingdom Family.\n\n'''King Rana Bahadur Shah (1777\u201399)'''\n\nThe grandson of King Prithvi Narayan Shah, King [[Rana Bahadur Shah]]\u2019s role in Limbuwan was limited to arming the former kings of Limbuwan, now the Subbas and chiefs, to fight against Sikkim. He called them to Kathmandu and under the charge of four former kings of Limbuwan, the king of Gorkha handed about 107 guns, 935 swords and 825 bows to raise a Limbu army and fight against Sikkim.\n\n'''King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah (1799\u20131816)'''\n\nFollowing the occupation of Sikkim, west of Teesta River, Nepal was again plunged into a war with Tibet and eventually with [[China]]. During the war with Tibet, Sumur Lama of [[Tibet]] had taken refuge in Kathmandu. When Nepal refused to hand him back to China, the war broke out with Nepal and Tibet. At that time, the Chinese had incited the people of Limbuwan to revolt against their Gorkha king. General Tung Thang sent guns, gunpowder, cannons and other weapons to Limbus in Limbuwan. It was said that about 1000 pathis of gunpowder and 500 pathis of lead were sent to Limbus.\n\n'''Rebellions in Limbuwan'''\n\nIn 1867, Dashain was boycotted in Dhankuta in protest at eroding the Limbuwan peoples\u2019 cultural rights. The state government forced the people of Limbuwan to celebrate [[Dashain]] or else bear the consequences. This was unacceptable to the people of Limbuwan, so a revolt started in Dhankuta and spread. Gorkha rulers soon suppressed the protest and there were two deaths.{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1870, the [[Limbu language]] suppression policy of the Ranas led to another uprising in Limbuwan. Limbu script or education in the Limbu language was thought of as anti-nationalistic, so the state adopted the policy of suppressing all ethnic and aboriginal languages and cultures of Nepal. Many Limbus were either executed or chased away from their motherland.\n\n'''King Tribhuwan (1913\u201355)'''\n\nKing Tribhuwan's rule saw several changes in the system of Kipat in Limbuwan. Although Ranas had taken away the rights of forest and other mineral rights of the Kipat system, worse was to come. In 1913, the government brought in legislation that stated that any new lands that were brought under cultivation in Limbuwan would be turned into a Raikar land. This was specifically designed to target the new farm lands that had been carved out from the forest and pasture areas. But once again, that was against the spirit of the Gorkha Limbuwan Treaty of 1774, whereby the State was to let Limbus use their lands in their own way according to the Kipat system. According to the treaty of 1774 and the Kipat system, if forest land was to be turned into farm land, with the consent and approval of the Subha and Chumlung of the area, then it was not supposed to be an issue to the state. Besides, forests and pasture lands along with river and water bodies with mineral rights were enshrined in the Kipat system. In 1917, the Rana government's unilateral legislation stated that Kipat lands of Limbuwan could be turned into \u201cRaikar\u201d lands if the Limbu owners could not pay off loans within six months. This was totally against the treaty of 1774, which specifically stated that the lands of Limbuwan east of Arun River could never be transferred to the Raikar system. Up to 1920 the Subha and their Chumlung also had power to hold courts according to tradition in their jurisdiction.{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\n'''Limbus of Ilam rose up in resistance'''{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\nSimilarly in 1926, the Rana government introduced the Panchayat system of government in Limbuwan, accordingly these Panchayat systems replaced the Subha and Chumlung system of government in Limbuwan which was also held up by the Gorkha-Limbuwan Treaty of 1774. Limbus of Ilam rose in resistance against the government policies of gradually nibbling away the rights given them by the 1774 treaty. Thus in this way State tried to eat away the autonomy and the rights of Limbu people of Limbuwan. The most interesting and unfair part of this whole saga was that, never were any Limbu Subha or Chumlung members asked nor were their opinion taken into any consideration. Treaties and agreements are signed or dissolved with the agreement of two sides, but the Gorkha-Limbuwan Treaty of 1774 was never consulted and the state unilaterally displaced the people of Limbuwan. In the meantime, the government of Nepal continued its encouragement of mass immigration of non Limbu and non Kirant people into Limbuwan to exploit Kipat lands.\n\nIn 1950\u201351, when there was political movement going on in rest of Nepal, there was also a Limbu/Kiranti insurgency going on in Limbuwan demanding more political rights.\n\n'''King Mahendra (1955\u201372)'''{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\nThere was a tradition from the time of Ten Limbu Kings that whenever a new king was crowned, or a new government was formed, a delegation of Subha and Chumlung members would go to the capital city and voice their concerns. In 1960, a delegation of Limbu Subhas from Chumlungs across Limbuwan region went to Kathmandu to remind the King about the Gorkha-Limbuwan Treaty of 1774 and also to get guarantees about the rights of Limbuwan. Following his meeting with the Limbuwan delegation, the king issued royal decrees stating that the \u201cTraditional rights and privileges of Limbu people in Limbuwan will be protected\u201d, in reference to the treaty.\n\nIn 1964 King Mahendra and his government introduced the Land Reform Act, whereby the government was to confiscate any land holdings that exceeded 1.8 hectares. This was applied to all of Nepal, but [[Limbuwan]] was a different case because lands of Limbuwan once again were under Kipat system and not the Raikar system. The land could not have been sold or owned personally other than Kipat holders anyway, it was communal belonging to a clan or group of people. But once again, going against the spirit of the 1774 Treaty, eroding democratic values and neglecting the people of Limbuwan, the government did not consult with the original people of Limbuwan or the Treaty of 1774 and went ahead with their land surveying in Limbuwan. King Prithvi Narayan Shah had agreed that he would not survey, designate or take away lands of Limbuwan from the original people.\n\n'''Limbuwan Rebellion against the Land Reform Act 1964'''\n\nSoon after the introduction of the Land Reform Act, Subhas of Limbuwan and many other Limbu individuals raised the issue and implications of the Land Reform Act on Limbuwan and the existing Treaty. Limbus clearly knew that this was another act to erode the \u201ctreaty protected traditional\u201d rights of the Limbu people over their lands. The situation was tense as the very next day, the immigrant non-Limbu tenants of Kipat lands who had been paying rent over a period of time, could be declared to own the land. The very existence of the Limbu people, its culture, tradition and autonomy was in danger. King Prithvi Narayan Shah had promised to Limbus that he would not survey the Lands of Limbuwan, because he did not own them but only the people of Limbuwan did. Similarly, after the 1964 Land reforms act, King Mahendra had promised a delegation of Limbuwans that he would not take away their lands, but he died without accomplishing this and failed to save the Limbu peoples\u2019 autonomy.\n\n'''The reasons why Kipat system in Limbuwan became a problem for the State and Hindu settlers'''\n\n1)\tThe state had no authority over Kipat Lands in Limbuwan.\n\n2)\tThe state could not generate revenue or make use of Lands in Limbuwan because Limbus owned the rights to rivers, waters, forests, mines and minerals.\n\n3)\tThe Limbu Kipat owners can anytime ask their tenants to move away from their Kipat lands.\n\n4)\tDue to its strategic location and being far away from the capital, the state had to exert its control over the people of Limbuwan by mass immigrating [[Hindu]] settlers to keep rebellious Limbus in check.\n\nBefore the Land Reform Act, of Nepal's total cultivable land, almost 95% or about 2.1 million hectares of land was under the Raikar system, and 2% or about 40000 hectares of land was under Guthi organisation. Only 3% or 77000 hectares of land was under the Kipat system. The main difference once again was that, all the lands of Nepal was owned by the state and given by the state to people for ownership under the Raikar system. Raikar lands had ownership documents given by the state and most importantly Raikar lands could be sold to anyone. Whereas in the Kipat system, communal/clan authorities owned the lands, Kipat lands were not granted because of the royal or state authority, the owner owned it because he or she belonged to a clan that owned the land for ever. Lands in Limbuwan were never conquered by the state and because the treaty existed that upheld the Kipat rights, it was illegal for the same state and authority that promised to uphold the privilege on one hand to take it away, piece by piece, by the other hand. Regmi states that the King and State had no authority over Kipat lands, communal authority was supreme.\n\nIn the treaty of 1774, Prithvi Narayan Shah swore that \u201cin case we confiscate your lands, may our ancestral gods destroy our kingdom and descendants\u201d Regmi further claims that this oath was restated by every other monarch after King Prithvi Narayan. Every new King promised and pledged to maintain Kipat rights but they on the other hand sponsored those policies that slowly eroded the Kipat rights.\n\n'''King Birendra (1972\u20132001)'''\n\nThe Panchayat regime adopted the old policy of \u201cOne country one king, one language one culture\u201d. It was sponsored by the state and Nepali language and Hindu religion was imposed on everyone. The existence of other religions, customs, languages and traditions were looked down upon and not encouraged. Since the implementation of the Land Reforms Acts, there had been protests and dissatisfacion towards the state for mismanaging, mistreating and most importantly betraying the Limbus. In 1968, a Limbu delegation that had gone to express their dissatisfaction over the single-handed treaty violation were jailed and tortured. Similarly the pioneers of the Limbuwan Liberation Front Party were jailed and tortured for three years for distributing pamphlets and trying to educate Limbus about their own rights. In 1972, some other Limbuwan Liberation members took a delegation to the new King Birendra and tried to revive the Limbuwan Autonomy issue but were soon suppressed.\n\nThe restoration of democracy came in 1990 following election. The Limbuwan Liberation Front, being the first party to raise the Limbuwan issue and Limbuwan autonomy and the rights of the Limbu people based on the Limbuwan Gorkha Treaty of 1774, was denied permission by the Nepal Election Commission to run in the election while several religious Hindu fundamentalist parties were allowed to run.\n\n==The republican era and now in Limbuwan==\n\nFollowing the relinquishment of power by then King Gyanendra, the people of [[Limbuwan]] and Limbuwan concerned parties became the first group to voice their pain. They organised a first peaceful strike to let the people of Nepal know how unfairly they had been treated and how far they were willing to go for justice. August 7\u20139, 2007, was the first of many peaceful strikes and protest programs of the Federal Limbuwan State Council and other parties. The demand remains as before, the true autonomy based on 1774 and recognition of indigenous rights.\n\nUnderstanding the sentiments of the people of Limbuwan, various political parties such as Maoists and others included Federalism in their manifestoes.\n\nThe United Nations Draft Declaration on the rights of Indigenous People has also brought new hopes of legally achieving the rights that people of Limbuwan lost unfairly. Kirant Yakthung Chumlung, an organisation of Limbu people, has come up with a policy and views on going forward with the Kipat and land issues of Limbuwan.\n\n==Future of Limbuwan==\n\nAs the shah dynasty has ended up, the treaty or the red seal of assent(Lalmohor) that has formed between the Gorkha king and Yakhung Limbuwan King as Pallo kirant also ousted. That is why, the Yakthung Laje Limbuwan as specific and historic nation in the eastern part of Nepal demanding for the free of nation states. For the purpose, the organisation, Yakthung Laje Limbuwan National Council (YLLNC) has formed in the presidency(Hangdumyang) of Mr. Nir Kumar Sambahangphe Limbu in 2018 A.D. The council has demanded the Yakthung Laje Limbuwan on the basis of historic, territorial, cultural, language, scripture and other religious values. It has also stated the Yakthung Laje Limbuwan, not only fall in the Nepal but also in the recent territory of India. The president,  Mr. Nir Kumar Sambahangphe of Yakthung Laje Limbuwan National Council (YLLNC) has announced to all the Yakhung Limbus to be united for the divided yakthung limbu nationals as an Indian and Nepali to make a distinct and unique nationality in the world. It was a land of Yakthung Limbus but divided through the treaty of Sugoulee in December 6, 1815. The territory of Yakthung Limbuwan fall on the east of Arun river and west of the Teesta river, which is proclaimed as independent nation by the council. \nNow the demand of federal limbuwan have been almost collapsed. However some of the voices urging to form constitutionally the federal limbuwan state. Notwithstanding, the people of Yakthung Limbuwan are coming out of the dark shadows of the repressive past, Limbus and people of Limbuwan aspire to bring new hope, new development and new future to a Land that has existed so long with such an old history.\n\n''==References==\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nSambahangphe, N.

Although Limbuwan is now part of Nepal, it was independent until 1774; even now, the history of Limbuwan remains unknown to many of its people. People of Limbuwan and [[People of Nepal|Nepalese]] citizens in the present context of federalism and autonomy in Nepal do not understand that of all the territories annexed by the kings of [[Gurkha|Gorkha]], Limbuwan was the only territory that was actually incorporated to the Kingdom of Nepal by the means of collective Gorkha-Limbuwan [[Treaty]] with the kings of ten kingdoms of Limbuwan and their ministers. Under the terms of the treaty, Limbuwan and her kings would accept the King of Nepal as their overlord and stay under the same Nepalese flag, but Limbuwan and her people were supposed to be completely autonomous with non-interference from the Kingdom of Nepal. However, over the period of the Shah dynasty, Limbuwan was gradually stripped of its original treaty rights. Therefore, the people of Limbuwan today are the most vocal proponents of [[federalism]] with [[autonomy]] in Nepal.\n\n==Pre-history==\n[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] and [[historian]]s claim that the [[Fossil|fossil records]] show that people lived in Nepal around 30-40 thousand years ago. The first people of Eastern Nepal were the Kirats in the hills and Koches in the Terai. {{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}. The first people to live permanently and call Limbuwan their home were the [[Kirant]] people.But, The term Limbuwan is not a valid term. many historians and scholars argue that there was no Limbuwan in Nepal. Limbuwan is a new term to mobilise a group of people who can fight against Kirat. These [[Mongoloid]] people are believed to have moved into Nepal from the Tibet or yunnan and beyond around 6-8 thousand years ago. They practiced shifting cultivation and moved with their domesticated pigs and other animals along the lower, warmer hills. The same people moved on to western [[Nepal]] and eventually conquered the Kathmandu valley to establish the first Kirant civilization of Nepalese history. They spoke the language of their sino-Tibetan and practiced [[Animism|animistic]] religion.\n\n==Bhauiputahang dynasty==\n'''King Bhauiputahang of Limbuwan''' - first independent king of Limbuwan (c. 580 BC)\n\nKing Jitedasti became the seventh Kiranti king in central Nepal around 580 BC. Kirant chiefs under King Jitedasti in the present-day Limbuwan area revolted against him and ceased to see him as their overlord. During that period all the Kirant chiefs used to pay monetary [[tribute]] and rendered military service to the Kirant kings of the Kathmandu valley. The system was similar to the [[feudal]] system in medieval Europe. After the revolts, the Kirant chiefs of eastern Nepal elected Bhauiputahang as their new king. King Bhauiputahang built his capital in Phedap and ruled eastern Nepal which comprised present-day Limbuwan.{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\nWhile central Nepal was ruled by kings of the Kirant dynasty, Limbuwan in east Nepal was also ruled by kings of Kirant dynasty. King Bhauiputahang was renowned in the Limbuwan and eastern parts of Nepal, while King Jitedasti sat on the throne in the Kathmandu valley.\n\n'''King Parbatak/ Eastern Nepal (c. 317 BC)'''\n\nA descendant of King Bhauiputahang, King Parbatak was a son of King Jeitehang and ruled Limbuwan around 317 BC. During that period, King Parbatak was the most powerful king of the Himalayan region and present-day Nepal. King Parbatak was allied with Chandra Gupta Maurya of [[Magadha]], and also assisted him in his military campaigns in the [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda]] kingdom. During his father King Jiete's rule, [[Alexander the great]] had invaded [[India]] and established his [[satraps]] in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]]. King Parbatak assisted King [[Chandra Gupta Maurya]] in driving the [[Greeks|Greek]] Satraps Seleucus (military governor) away from Punjab and Sindh. For King Parbatak's assistance to Chandra Gupta, he gave lands in northern [[Bihar]] to King Parbatak and many Kiranti people migrated to northern Bihar during that period. They became known as Madhesia Kirant people, or Limbus of Kashi Gotra. King Parbatak Hang is also mentioned by Magadha historians as an ally of Maurya Emperor.\n\n'''King Samyuk of Limbuwan / Eastern Nepal (c. 125 BC)'''\n\nAfter seven generations of King Parbatak, King Samyuk sat on the throne of Limbuwan / Eastern Nepal. He was unpopular among the descendants of Madhesia Kirant people (descendants of those who lived in Bihar in King Parbatak's time). Under the leadership of Bazdeohang, people revolted against King Samyuk and overthrew him. The Kirant chiefs elected Bazdeo as the new king of Limbuwan.\n\n==Bazdeo dynasty==\n'''King Bazdeohang of Limbuwan (c. 125 BC on)'''\n\nAfter the revolution of the Kirant people of Limbuwan area, the Kirant chiefs of the region elected the rebel leader Bazdeohang as their king. He made his capital at [[Libang]] and started his own dynasty. He was followed by twelve other kings of his dynasty:\n\n* '''King Sangkhadeo I'''\n* '''King Sangkhadeo II'''\n* '''King Dewapour'''\n* '''King Bhichuuk'''\n* '''King Ghangtuk'''\n* '''King Sotumhang'''\n* '''King Limdung'''\n* '''King Lijehang'''\n* '''King Mapunhang'''\n* '''King Dendehang'''\n* '''King Kundungjapa'''\n* '''King Kundungjapa of Limbuwan'''\n\nThe last king of the Bazdeo dynasty had four sons: Mundhungge, Sandhungge, Kane Hang and Kochu Hang. It is said that Kochu Hang migrated to [[North Bengal]] and established his own kingdom, Kochpiguru, from where the term Koch is derived. After the death of King Kundungjapa, Limbuwan fell into chaos and anarchy, each chief ruling their own areas independently.\n\n==The era of eight kings==\nFrom the time of the last king of the Bazdeo dynasty, [[Limbuwan]] was ruled by eight chiefs and their descendants; none of them rose to become powerful enough to subdue all and none came to prominence. During this period, people migrated in and out of the Limbuwan region and around the 6th century AD, a group of people from the Shan-Makwan areas in [[China]] and [[Burma]] moved to Assam in India and eventually to the Limbuwan area in Nepal. The assimilation of the original Kirants of Limbuwan, the migrants from Tibet, the [[Mongol]]s and the tribes from the [[Bihar]] area and finally the migrant people of Shan-Makwan gave birth to the new nation of '''Limbuwan''', the nationality of Limbu and Limbu culture.\n\nThe Kirat states was ruled by eight feudal Chiefs.\n* Honden Hang\n* Yaketet Hang\n* Chesbi Hang\n* Laraso Pangbo Hang\n* Khesiwa Hang\n* Ekangso Hang\n* Khadi Hang\n* Eme Hang\n\n'''The revolution of the Taisiyan people in Limbuwan'''\n\nDuring the latter years of the rule of the eight Kiranti chiefs, the population of Limbuwan multiplied and families increased in number. Feeling that this was a threat, the eight rulers started to suppress the people. When the descendants of the Shan Mokwan people (the latest immigrants to Limbuwan) could not stand this any longer they devised a plan to overthrow the eight chiefs. They met at Ambe Pojoma and decided to revolt against the eight chiefs. The rebel leaders erected three stone pillars and planted three [[mango]] trees around them. After sprinkling holy waters, the rebel leaders and the rebel army took an oath that everyone would fight against the tyrant chiefs and would not return home until they had beaten the rulers.  The meeting place of Ambe Pojoma still exists to this day, and the battle of eight chiefs is incorporated in [[Limbu people|Limbu]] Mundhum ever since.\n\nAfter knowing that the rebellion was breaking out in their country; the eight rulers raised their own army and aimed at massacring and displacing people of Shan-Mokwan dulers were defeated in every village by the rebels. All the eight rulers were either killed or chased away from Limbuwan territory.\n\n==The era of ten Limbu kings (550\u20131609)==\nThus, with unity and strength, the people of Shan Mokwan origin defeated their rulers. After their victory, the rebel leaders assembled once again at their holy place Ambe Pojoma. The leaders fixed the northern boundary to be in Tibet, the southern boundary in JalalGarh in Bihar, the eastern boundary at the river [[Teesta River|Teesta]] and the western boundary at the [[Koshi River|Dudhkoshi]] River. Later the boundaries of Limbuwan came to rest at the Arun river in the west and [[Kanchenjunga]] mountain and the [[Mechi]] river in the east.\n\nThe meeting of rebel leaders decided to name the recently acquired country Limbuwan as it was won by the strength of a bow and arrow (Li = \"bow\", ambu = \"acquire\" in the Limbu language). They also decided to divide Limbuwan into ten districts or kingdoms and place ten kings to rule each kingdom. They also agreed to defend Limbuwan from any external threat by rendering military assistance from all the ten kingdoms. They changed the name of their nationality to Yakthumba. Originally at the beginning only the kings of Limbuwan were called Limbus and the people of Limbuwan were called Yakhthungba, but over time the people of Limbuwan started calling themselves [[Limbu people|Limbu]]. Thus, the term Limbu and Yakthungba became synonymous.\n\nThis period in '''Limbuwan history''' corresponds to the [[Lichhavi]] and [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] dynasty periods in the Nepal Valley.\n\nThe ten rulers, their kingdoms and their forts.\n\n*  '''Samlupi Samba Hang''' -- king of Tambar (his capital Tambar Yiok)\n*  '''Sisigen Sireng Hang''' -- king of Mewa and Maiwa kingdoms (his capital Meringden Yiok)\n*  '''Thoktokso Angbo Hang''' -- king of Athraya (his capital Pomajong)\n*  '''Thindolung Khoya Hang''' -- king of Yangwarok (his capital Hastapojong Yiok)\n*  '''Ye nga so Papo Hang''' -- king of Panthar (his capital at Yashok and Phedim)\n*  '''Shengsengum Phedap Hang''' -- king of Phedap (his capital at Poklabung)\n*  '''Mung Tai Chi Emay Hang''' -- king of Ilam (his capital at [[Phakphok]])\n*  '''Saiyok Ladho Hang''' -- king of Miklung (Choubise) (his capital at Shanguri Yiok)\n*  '''Tappeso Perung Hang''' -- king of Thala (his capital at Thala Yiok)\n*  '''Taklung Khewa Hang''' -- king of Chethar (his capital at  Yiok)\n\n==Ten kings of Limbuwan==\n\n'''King Mung Mawrong Hang'''\n\nAt the beginning of the 7th century, King Mung Mawrong Hang came to prominence in the terai lands of Limbuwan (present-day [[Sunsari]], [[Morang]] and [[Jhapa]] area). He cleared much of the forest area in present-day Rangeli, east of Biratnagar, and built a town there. Since the ten kings of Limbuwan had sovereignty over the terai lands through the Kingdom of Ilam and the Kingdom of Bodhey (Choubise), they assembled a collective Limbuwan force and chased King Mawrong from Rongli area.\n\nMawrong went to Tibet and took refuge in Khampa Jong, but he still had an ambition to rule all of Limbuwan. When Limbuwan was ruled by ten kings and when King Mawrong came to prominence, Tibet was ruled by King Tsrong Tsen Gempo. Mawrong went on to ally with Tibetan King Tsrong Tsen Gempo, managed to get Bhutia tribes of Khampa jong to assist him and planned on attacking Limbuwan from the north. King Mawrong attacked Limbuwan, the ten kings of Limbuwan brought their forces and fought decisive battle through Hatia, Walungchung and Tapkey passes in the Himalayas. Ten kings of Limbuwan lost and King Mawrong rose as the overlord of Limbuwan. The ten kings of Limbuwan still continued to rule their original places as subordinate to King Mung Mawrong.\n\nKing Mawrong also started a festival among the Kirant people called \u201cNamban\u201d, where people celebrate the gathering of harvest every year, in the last week of December.\n\nKing Mawrong had no male heir, so when he died one of his ministers took over, becoming King Mokwan San. After a brief period King Uba Hang came to prominence in Limbuwan area.\n\n==The era of the Lasahang dynasty==\n\n'''King Uba Hang''' (ruled 849\u2013865)\n\nFollowing the death of King Mawrong, Uba Hang became powerful and renowned in Limbuwan area. He subdued the Limbuwan area which was under King Mokwan San and became King. He is known for introducing new faith among Limbu people and bringing changes to the Kirant mundhum religion. He taught his subjects to worship the great spirit of Tagera Ningwafumang with flowers and fruit, but not with blood sacrifice.\n\nHe built Chempojong fort and palace in Ilam. He introduced the festival of Tong Sum Tong Nam, held every three years in honour of Limbu Ancestor goddess Yumasammang and supreme god Tagera Ningwafumang. This Tong Sum Tong Nam festival is still held in Panchthar district of Nepal and is called Trisala Puja in [[Nepali language]].\n \n'''King Mabo Hang''' (ruled 865\u2013880)\n\nKing Mabo Hang succeeded his father King Uba Hang in Limbuwan. He ruled Limbuwan for 15 years with the title of Thakthakkum Mabo Hang. He was well respected and known in Limbuwan and many also believed him to be the reincarnation of  god. He moved his capital from Chempo Jong in Ilam to Yasok Jong in [[Panchthar]].\n\n'''King Muda Hang'''\n\nAfter the death of Mabo hang his son Muda hang succeeded to the throne, but he was a weak king and unlike his father and grandfather he was not able to subdue all the rulers of ten Limbuwan. The ten rulers of Limbuwan declared independence in their own districts and began ruling independently. There was anarchy and chaos in [[Limbuwan]] as the rulers and clan chiefs tried to establish their own hagemony over Limbuwan. Thus Limbuwan disintegrated, and Lasa dynasty kings were reduced to being only kings of [[Panchthar]] area and the southern Limbuwan.\n\n'''King Wedo Hang'''\n\nIn the chaos and integration of [[Limbuwan]], King Muda hang was succeeded by his son Wedo Hang. He ruled from Hellang palace in Panthar. In Panchthar district King Muda Hang was fighting Nembang hang Chief, the same chief fought with king wedo hang as well. When chief Nembang hang failed to defeat he plotted King Wedo Hang's assassination, he married his sister Dalima to King Wedo Hang to be close to Hellang Palace. King Wedo Hang was murdered by his enemies while he was sleeping. Queen Dalima, sister of Nembang chief was pregnant with King Wedo's child at the time of the murder. Chief Pathong Hang sat on the throne of Hellang palace ruling present-day Panchthar area. Queen Dalima left Hellang palace and went on to live in Chempojong palace in Ilam. Chempojong palace was the ancestral home of the Lasahang dynasty kings built by King Uba Hang.\n\n'''King Chemjong Hang'''\n\nThe fifth king of Lasa dynasty was King Chemjong Hang. He was born in Chempojong palace in Ilam, where his mother was living. When he was born his mother disguised him by dressing him as a girl, fearing that Chief Pathong Hang's people would come and murder him. She told him that his father's enemy would destroy him if they were to find out his true identity. He grew up to be a wise and strong individual under the disguise as a girl. His mother having told him of his late father's followers in the northern part of Limbuwan, he made his way there and forged alliances with the chiefs. He made a surprise attack while everyone at Hellang palace was celebrating the marriage of one of the district chiefs. After capturing Hellang palace, he revealed his identity to all those present and they accepted him as the true ruler and heir of the late King Wedo Hang. Since he had no real name and that he was born in the old palace of Chempojong, the assembled chiefs decided to name him Chemjong Hang, which became his name. He once again tried to unite all of [[Limbuwan]] and succeeded in extending from present-day [[Panchthar]], [[Illam]], [[Dhankuta]], [[Sunsari]], [[Morang]] and [[Jhapa]]. Back in those days Morang composed of the lower terai lands of Sunsari, Morang and Jhapa, while northern Limbuwan was still in fragments.\n\n==The era of King Sirijunga (880\u2013915)==\n\nKing Galijunga who ruled the Yangwarok kingdom of Limbuwan during the time of King Uba Hang; Ubahang was Galijunga's overlord at the period. As King Muda hang became weak and started losing control of Limbuwan, the grandson of King Galijung, Sirijunga rose to power in the northern Limbuwan area. King Sirijunga\u2019a ancestors had ruled [[Kathmandu valley]] during the Kirant era in Nepal.\n\n'''Unification of northern Limbuwan'''\n\nDuring the anarchic period of King Muda Hang, King Sirijunga became powerful enough to subdue all the Limbu chiefs under his control.\n\n'''Famous Sirijunga forts'''\n\nKing Sirijung constructed two big forts at present-day Sirjung in [[Terhathum]] district and Chainpur in Sankhuwasabha district. The forts were named Sirjunga fort, and the remains of the structures still stand today.\n\n'''King Sirijunga script'''\n\nKing Sirijunga is also known for developing and introducing Sirijunga script to the Limbus, which is still in use today. The Mundhum, Kirant Limbu religious text of Mundhum states that King Sirijunga was asked by Nisammang (Limbu god of learning) to accompany her to the base of mount Phoktanglungma. The goddess took him to the deepest cave in the mountain and gave him the stone slab consisting of writings. There he was also blessed with the power of knowledge; the goddess taught him how to read and write that language and told him to spread the scriptures to his people. The king returned to his palace and began teaching the script and knowledge to Limbu people.\n\n'''The Kipat land system of King Sirijunga'''\n\nKing Sirijunga is also known for his famous land reform law. He introduced a Kipat land system, whereby he divided lands to the chiefs of each clan or village and vested them with the full power over his land. The chief's powers did not extend beyond his borders and chiefs were expected to extend full military support from his village during the time of war to all the Kings of Limbuwan for the protection of Limbuwan. One of the important characteristics of the Kipat system was that neither the chief nor his people were allowed to sell their land to any outsiders or any non-clan members. Non-clan members were only allowed to rent the land for the period of time and were not supposed to take permanent land ownership. The land was to be divided equally among all sons and unmarried daughters. He also decreed that all the chiefs of villages must have a council, called Chumlung, of four members to assist him in ruling the villages. The chief presided over all the clan/village meetings and festivals. He also had enough powers so that his decisions were considered final. Ever since the time of King Sirijunga, Limbu people of Limbuwan have been enjoying special Kipat rights over their lands. No one could take away the Kipat lands and the lands belonged communally to specific clan. The Kipat land system devised by King Sirijunga of Limbuwan gained popularity in other Kirant areas in Nepal as well. The Kipat land system was used by people of Kirant Rai, Kirant Sunuwar and even [[Tamang]] people. Following King Sirijunga all the rulers of Limbuwan area up to King Mahendra had promised to uphold the special laws and custom of the Kipat system of Limbuwan during or right after their coronation.\n\n==The period of the ten kings after King Sirijunga==\n\nAfter the death of King Sirijunga, [[Limbuwan]] was once again ruled by the ten kings of the kingdoms of Limbuwan; this period lasted from 915 to 1584. The ten kingdoms formed after the great revolution of Limbuwan in the 6th century all remained the same. The current state of Limbu nation, culture, language and ethnicity is believed to have taken shape during this period.\n\nDuring this period, the lowlands of Limbuwan (present-day terai lands of Sunsari, Morang and Jhapa) collectively known as Morang since the time of King Mung Mawrong Hang, developed as a kingdom in its own right. At the beginning of 1400, Morang Kingdom patriates from the Kingdom of Ilam and the Kingdom of Mikluk Bodhey (Choubise) and began ruling on its own. Morang Kingdom's borders were set at Kankai river in the east, Koshi river in the west, Shanguri fort in the north and Jalal garh in India in the south. King Sangla Ing became the first king of the lowland Limbuwan kingdom of Morang after 900 years since it last had its own king. He built alliances with the other kings of Limbuwan and remained on good terms. He built his kingdom at Varatappa and ruled from there. King Sangla Ing was succeeded by his son Pungla Ing, who later converted to Hinduism and changed his name to Amar Raya Ing.\n\n==The Sanglaing dynasty kings==\n\n'''King Sangla Ing''' (first king of Ing dynasty)\n\n'''King Pungla Ing''' (became Amar Raya Ing)\n\n'''King Kirti Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\n'''King Ap Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\n'''King Jarai Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\n'''King Indhing Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\n'''King Bijay Narayan Raya Ing'''\n\nThe last king of the Ing dynasty of [[Morang]] Kingdom Bijay Narayan built a good friendship with the king of Phedap, Murray Hang Khebang. He then advised King Bijay Narayan to build a new town after his name, and thus Bijaypur town was settled. Bijaypur town, near present-day [[Dharan, Nepal|Dharan City]] remained the capital of Morang Kingdom and of all of Limbuwan until 1774. King Bijay Narayan then persuaded King Murray Hang Khebang of Phedap to stay in Bijaypur and assist him in ruling Morang Kingdom as his prime minister. King Murray Hang Khebang agreed to the proposal and his title of prime minister became a hereditary position for his descendants. In this way King Bijay Narayan Raya Sanglaing effectively made King Murray Hang his prime minister and Murray Hang's son Bajahang Raya Khebang ruled the kingdom of Phedap under his father. King Bijay Narayan also gave the title of Raya, \u201cKing\u201d, to Murray Hang. Since then, King Murray Hang Khebang became the first prime minister of Limbuwan and second king of Limbuwan to hold the Hindu title of \u201cRaya\u201d.\n\nOver time, the relationship between King Bijay Narayan Raya Sanlgaing and his prime minister Murray Hang Khebang soured. The king accused Murray Hang of raping his daughter and sentenced him to death. Hearing the news of Murray Hang's betrayal by the king of Morang, his son King Bajahang Khebang decided to punish the King of Morang. He went to Makwanpur and asked for the help of King Lo Hang Sen of Makwanpur. King Lohang Sen of Makwanpur with the help of the Kirant force conquered Bijaypur in 1608. King of Phedap Bajahang Khebang, who had come to take revenge of his father's death, died on the battlefield; at the same time, King Bijay Narayan also died of natural causes. King Lohang Sen of Makwanpur then appointed King Bajahang Khebang's son and Murray Hang's grandson, Bidya Chandra Raya Khebang, as prime minister of the Morang Kingdom and gave him autonomy to rule Morang. Lohang Sen returned to Makwanpur and King Bidya Chandra Raya Khebang went to [[Lhasa]] to get recognition as the real King of Limbuwan. King Bidya Chandra successfully gets the Royal document with the seal of Dalai Lama recognition of him as the ruler of all of Phedap and Morang. In the meantime, the rest of the kingdoms of Limbuwan were ruled by their own kings.\n\n==The era of divided Limbuwan (1609\u20131741)==\n\nThe death of King Bijay Narayan Sanglaing of Morang and the subsequent war of revenge by the King of Phedap led to the conquest of the Morang Kingdom of Limbuwan by Lo Hang Sen of Mokwanpur. This event led to the era of divided Limbuwan because the association of Limbuwan states no longer existed. Only a few of the ten kingdoms of Limbuwan actually formed alliances with the Sen king and saw him as their overlord. In the meantime, in 1641, when King Phuncho Namgyal became the king of [[Sikkim]], independent Limbu kings of Tambar Kingdom, Yangwarok Kingdom, Panthar Kingdom and Ilam Kingdom allied with the Sikkimese king, effectively dividing Limbuwan in half. From the enthronement of King Puncho Namgyal of Sikkim in 1641 to 1741, the eastern and northern [[Limbuwan]] kings allied with the kings of Sikkim.\n\n==The era of the Namgyal dynasty in eastern and northern Limbuwan (1641\u20131741)==\n\nFrom 1641 to 1741 for approximately a hundred years, the Limbu kings of Tambar, Yangwarok, Panthar and Ilam kingdoms allied with the King of Sikkim and saw him as their overlord. During this time the other kingdoms of Limbuwan were allied with the Sen king of Makwanpur. King Puncho Namgyal died in 1670 and was succeeded by his son King Tensong Namgyal, who married three queens. The youngest queen was from Limbuwan, and her name was Queen Thungwa Mukma, daughter of the King of Yangwarok, Yong Ya Hang. King Tensong Namgyal of Sikkim built a new palace and asked his youngest queen to name it. She names it \u201cSong Khim\u201d meaning new home. Over time this name changed from \"Songkhim\" to \"Sukkhim\", and eventually the name \"[[Sikkim]]\" came into being. The original name of Sikkim was Mayel in the Lepcha language, Chungjung in the Limbu language and Denjong in the Bhutia language. King Tensong was succeeded by his son and third king Chhyagdor Namgyal. During his time, Bhutan attacked Sikkim and occupied it for eight years. With the help of Tibetans he regained his throne. He died in 1716 and was succeeded by his son, King Gyurmi Namgyal. In 1733 King Gyurmi Namgyal of Sikkim died childless, then his minister declared himself the King of Sikkim under the title of \u201cTamding Gyalpo\u201d and started ruling from the throne of Rabdentse palace. He ruled from 1738 to 1741. This threw the Limbu alliance with Sikkim into disarray as other ministers had placed the infant king on the throne. Meanwhile, in 1741, a Limbu scholar named Srijunga Sing Thebe of Yangwarok Kingdom of Limbuwan came to western Sikkim to teach Limbu script and literature to the Kirant people there. The Tibetan Tachhang Lamas of Pemayangtse monastery feared the Limbu Sirijunga Xin Thebe's actions. They killed him by tying him to a tree and shooting him with arrows. This caused anger in Limbuwan and the kings of all the kingdoms of Limbuwan that had allied with the King of Sikkim in 1641 broke off the ties and stopped regarding the kings of Sikkim as their overlords and allies. Thus the [[Chogyal|Namgyal dynasty]] ended in Limbuwan in 1741, and after breaking off ties with Sikkim, the four Limbu kings and their kingdoms remained neutral and independent.\n\n==The era of the Sen dynasty in western and southern Limbuwan (1609\u20131769)==\n\nFrom 1609 to 1769, for about 160 years, the Sen kings of Makwanpur were nominal kings of Morang and allied to the other five kings of Limbuwan. The era of the Sen dynasty in Limbuwan began with the conquest of the Morang kingdom by King Lo Hang Sen to avenge the death of the prime minister of Morang.  They were Hindus of present-day Bihar and Terai region.\n\n===King Lo Hang Sen (1609\u201361)===\n\nFollowing the enthronement of King Lo Hang Sen to the throne of Morang Kingdom at Bijaypur, Limbuwan also entered the phase of [[Hindu]] influence.  King Lo Hang Sen ruled from 1609 to 1641 and managed to get all the kings of Limbuwan who were not allied with [[Sikkim]] on his side. He promised the Limbu people and their chiefs that the Kipat land system, the Limbu language, culture and way of life that had been practised for thousands of years would be protected. He also promised to Kings of Limbu kingdoms that they would get full autonomy and power to rule their own kingdoms. This way King Lo Hang Sen managed to become the King of Kings in Limbuwan and take the title of Maharajadhiraj. He appointed three Limbu ministers to his court in Makwanpur. In the meantime, the kingdom of Morang with its capital Bijaypur was ruled by the descendants of King Murray Hang Khebang, the Prime Ministers during the Sanglaing dynasty.\n\n===King Harihar Sen (1661\u201384)===\n\nKing Harihar Sen, the grandson of Lo Hang Sen, succeeded his grandfather to the throne of Morang. He extended Morang up to Gondwara in Bihar, gave himself the title of \u201cHindupati Maharaj\u201d, and built a new palace in Chanjitpur in lower Morang. He placed his grandson Bidhata Indra Sen on the throne of Morang. This was not liked by Hahrihar Sen's sons so civil war broke out. In this chaotic struggle, Subha Sen, younger son of King Harihar Sen, was victorious and started ruling Morang.\n\nKing Subha Sen ruled Morang for 22 years, while King Bidhata Indra Sen was also ruling Morang. Both King Subha Sen and Bidhata Indra Sen were tricked into coming to the palace of the Nawab of Purnea, who then betrayed them and sent them to the Mughal Emperor in [[Delhi]]. Both the uncle and nephew kings died at the hands of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor. After finding out about this betrayal, Queen Padmidhata Induraj Rajeswari, the wife of King Bidhata Indra Sen, called upon the allies of Morang Kingdom, all the nine kings of Limbuwan, to assist her in punishing the Nawab of Purnea.\n\n===Queen Padmidhata Induraj Rajeswari Sabitra Sen (1706\u201325)===\n\nThe kings ruling nine Kingdoms of Limbuwan at that time were, Chemjong King, Pasenama King, Lingdom King, Khewa King, Sukmi King, Makkhim King, Vaji King, Gabha King, and Shah Hang King. They were titled Roy by the Sen Kings of Morang, Roy was equivalent of King.\n\nAnother war of revenge broke out with the united forces of Limbuwan under the command of Chemjong King and the Nawab of Purnea at Jalal Garh. The Limbuwan forces were victorious; their leaders established the boundary at Jalal Gurh in the south.\n\nThe kings of Limbuwan decided to bring the capital city of Morang back to Bijaypur from Chanjitpur. They placed Queen Padmidhata Indurajrajeswari on the throne of Bijaypur. The same Khebang dynasty kings of Phedap served as prime minister of Morang and other Limbus served as ministers and chautariayas.\n\nIn 1721, about fifteen years after the War of Revenge with the Nawabs of Purnia, Limbuwan established friendly and trading relations with the kingdom of Purnea in the south. King Pasenama, who was also a minister of Morang, went to Purnea and established the bilateral relationship.\n\n===King Mahipati Sen (1725\u201361)===\n\nAfter almost twenty years of reign, Queen Padmidhata died. The kings of Limbuwan and their ministers assembled and elected Mahipati Sen of Makwanpur, son of the late King Subha Sen, as the king of Morang and placed him on the throne in Bijaypur. He effectively became King of Kings of Limbuwan or Maharajadhiraja of Limbuwan. Mahipati Sen was a weak king; he had no legitimate issue, but had eighteen illegitimate sons. Kamadatta Sen, the eldest of the illegitimate sons, would succeed King Mahipati Sen of Morang and Maharajadhiraj of Limbuwan.\n\n===King Kamadatta Sen (1761\u201369)===\n\nDuring the reign of King Mahipati Sen, the prime minister of Morang was King Bichitra Chandra Raya Khebang of Phedap Kingdom. When Mahipati Sen died, he did not allow Kamadatta Sen to be the full ruler of Morang Kingdom because he thought Kamadatta was illegitimate. During this time, the Sen kings had given much of the terai lands of Morang to the Limbu kings and chiefs for their personal jagir, believing that they would not revolt against them.\n\nThe feud between King Kamdatta Sen and his prime minister grew as the tensions of the power struggle increased; Prime Minister Bichitra Chandra Raya Khebang was succeeded by his son, [[Budhhi Karna Raya Khewang|Buddhi Karna Raya Khebang]]. Buddhi Karna pursued his father's policy of disengaging Kamadatta Sen from state affairs. Then finally Kamadatta Sen had had enough; he came to Bijaypur and occupied the throne and expelled Buddhi Karna from Morang. Buddhi Karna went to Rabdentse palace in Sikkim to get help.\n\nKamadatta Sen turned out to be a worthy ruler and established good relations with everyone. He declared that all the Limbu kings of Limbuwan, their ministers and chiefs were to be of his own lineage and that they were to be treated as his own family. He also married Princess Thangsama Angbohang, sister of King of Hastapur yak who were defeated by the king of Yangwrook in Limbuwan. He appointed King Shamo Raya Chemjong of Miklung Bodhey Kingdom (Choubise) as his Prime Minister and requested him to come to his palace in Bijaypur and manage his country. He again guaranteed autonomy and Kipat to all the people and chiefs of Limbuwan. He established friendly relations with the king of Bhutan, king of Sikkim and Tibet. King Dev Zudur of [[Bhutan]] even sent his representatives to King Kama Datta Sen's coronation. Morang and Limbuwan already had good relations with the Kingdom of Purnea in the south and he also developed good relations with King Ranjit Malla of Bhaktapur.\n\nThus with his appeasement policies to the people of Limbuwan and good relations with the neighbouring states of Limbuwan, he gained much confidence and popularity in Limbuwan.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1769, the exiled and unhappy prime minister of Morang, Buddhi Karna, planned a conspiracy to assassinate King Kama Datta Sen, who was ambushed and killed in Morang on his way to a meeting.\n\n===The era of divided Limbuwan===\n\n'''King [[Budhhi Karna Raya Khewang]] of Morang (1769\u201373)'''\n\nAfter the assassination of Kama Datta Sen, Buddhi Karna came to Bijaypur and became the last king of Morang and Limbuwan. But on hearing of the death of King Kama Datta Sen, all the states that made up Limbuwan and their allies split up. The kings of Limbuwan no longer had allegiance to Buddhi Karna. He seriously needed able ministers and chiefs to assist him in ruling Morang and all of Limbuwan. He sent people to look for King Shamo Raya Chemjong of Miklung Bodhey Kingdom to help him.\n\nDuring this time,\n\n'''King Shridev Roy Phago''' -- king of Maiwa Kingdom\n\n'''King Raina Sing Raya Sireng''' -- king of Mewa Kingdom\n\n'''King Ata Hang''' -- king of Phedap Kingdom\n\n'''King Subhawanta Libang''' -- king of Tambar Kingdom\n\n'''King Yehang''' -- king of Yangwarok Kingdom\n\n'''King Thegim Hang''' -- king of Panthar Kingdom\n\n'''King Lingdom Hang''' -- king of Ilam Kingdom\n\n'''King Shamo Roya Chemjong Hang''' -- king of Miklung Bodhey (Choubise, including southern Panther)\n\n'''King Khewa Hang''' -- king of Chethar (including Dasmajhiya, Jalhara and Belhara areas)\n\n'''King [[Budhhi Karna Raya Khewang]]''' -- king of Morang (including present-day Sunsari, Morang and Jhapa areas)\n\nKing Shamo Raya Chemjong was responsible for leading the Kings of Limbuwan and chiefs of Limbuwan in signing a treaty with the King of Gorkha. King Shamo Chemjong was also the prime minister of Morang Kingdom and effectively ruled Morang when King Buddhi Karna was away from Bijaypur to seek help from the British. The king of [[Ilam District|Ilam]], King Lingdom's son, was the last king of Limbuwan to sign a treaty with the King of Gorkha.\n\nThe [[Limbuwan Gorkha War]] ended in 1774, following a treaty between the King of Gorkha and  the Kings of Limbuwan and their ministers in Bijaypur, Morang.\n\n==The era of the Shah dynasty in Limbuwan==\n{{Further|Limbuwan Gorkha War}}\n\n'''[[King Prithivi Narayan Shah]] (1768\u201375)'''\n\nThe major role that King Prithivi Narayan played in Limbuwan history was the incorporation of [[Limbuwan]] lands into his [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] Kingdom. Following this, the [[Gorkha | Gorkha Empire]] became Nepal. The former ten kingdoms of Limbuwan were divided into seventeen districts; the former kings became subbas under the new king and were granted autonomy, which was eroded over time. Kipat rights included ownership of rice fields, pasture fields, forests, water sources, rivers and mineral resources. While the rest of Nepal had the \u201cRaikar\u201d system of land ownership, only farwest Nepal and  Limbuwan had the state sanctioned \u201cKipat\u201d system. The policy of autonomy to Limbuwan by the [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] king was to ensure that Limbus always stayed loyal to him. Thus it would be easier for the Gorkhas to both conquer Sikkim and subdue Limbu brotherns [[Kirant]] Khambu (Rais) of Majh Kirant at the same time. This was an example of the divide and rule policy of the Shah rulers.\n\nThe '''Gorkha-Limbuwan Treaty''' of 1774 CE ended the [[Limbuwan Gorkha War history|Limbuwan Gorkha wars]].\n\nThe [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] Bhardars, [[Abhiman Singh Basnet]], [[Parath Bhandari]], Kirti Singh Khawas and Bali Bania on behalf of Gorkha raja Prithivi Narayan Shah, agreed to take an oath and swear on \u201cNoon pani\u201d (salt-water) promising that [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] raja would never confiscate Limbus\u2019 Kipat land (autonomous land) nor destroy them. If he confiscated their Kipat land and destroyed them, then the god, upon whom Gorkha Raja had sworn and put faith in, would destroy him, his descendants and his kingdom. At this swearing ceremony, a big copper cauldron was brought in front of Gorkha and Limbu representatives and one pathi (eight pounds) of salt was put into it. [[Limbu people|Limbu]] ministers then poured water into it and stirred properly to mix the salt with water. Then the ministers asked the Gorkha bhardars to extract salt out of the water. They answered that salt had mixed and had become impossible to extract from the water.\n\nThe [[Limbu people|Limbu]] ministers then said: \u201dAlthough the salt has melted and it is impossible to extract it from the water, yet the water has become tasteful. You, the Gorkhas, are like water and we the Kirant Limbu people, are like salt. You Gorkhas people want us to melt in you, but you will not remain as before. When we mix or amalgamate with you, then you Gorkhas will be more exalted than before. But, if you betray us by taking our right of Kipat land, then what oath will you take for not violating this agreement?\u201d The Gorkha bhardars, on behalf of Gorkha raja, took a handful of salt water in their hands and swore that the Gorkha raja would never betray them by forfeiting the Kipat land (self-governing autonomous land). If the [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] King did so, his descendants would melt like salt and disappear from the world. The Gorkha Bhardars, then questioned the Kirant [[Limbu people|Limbu]] ministers, saying if they will betray the Gorkha raja by violating \u201cNoon pani\" agreement what oath would they take for never violating such an agreement. The [[Kirant]] [[Limbu people|Limbu]] ministers took a handful of salt water and swore that they would never go against the Gorkhali king. If they did so then their descendants would also melt like salt and disappear from the world.\n\nAfter making such agreement on salt-water (sacred and important elements), the Gorkha bhardars on behalf of Gorkha raja gave the following treaty paper, or Lal Mohor, to the Limbu ministers of Bijaypur.\n\nTranslation of the agreement between the Limbu ministers of [[Morang]] kingdom and King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] of [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] Kingdom in 1774:{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\n\u201cLet this be our agreement that I want to have you as the members of my own family. My religious mind is good. You are under my protection from now. By my power, your country is now mine but you are still ours. I will take the responsibility of progress and protection of your families. I will retain your rights to anything you possess. You keep in contact with my officers, help them and enjoy your land with full right as long as it exists. You are different from Nau lakh Rai, because their kings will be displaced. You who call yourselves Kings are not destroyable. I know your policy and good intentions.\u201d\n\u201cThe Kingdom of [[Sikkim]] had not come to terms with us. My officers have come to your land with full instructions. You will come to now everything through them. You agree with them and enjoy your land individually in a manner as mentioned above. I, hereby, agree to abide by the above-mentioned terms of agreement of never taking your land by force and destroying you. I swear on the copper plate and say that if I violate the above-mentioned promises, then let the God upon whom I and my family depend and worship, destroy my descendants and my kingdom. I have written the above-mentioned agreement and hereby hand it over to the above-mentioned [[Limbu people|Limbu]] brothers on this day of twenty second shrawan of Sambat eighteen hundred and thirty one at our capital city of [[Kantipur]] may it be blessed and fortunate.\u201d\n\nWhen the allies of [[Morang]] Kingdom heard the news of the agreement between the Gorkha and Morong kingdoms, the [[Limbu people|Limbu]] rulers of Mewa Kingdom, Phedap Kingdom, Maiwa Kingdom and Tambar Kingdom also came to Bijaypur (present-day [[Dharan, Nepal|Dharan]]) to join the alliance with the Gorkha King under the same terms and conditions of the treaty. The rulers of the regions Papo Hang, Thegim Hang and Nembang Hang under the leadership of Chemjong Hang (ShriShun rai) decided to join the Gorkha king on the same conditions.\n\nThus the [[Limbuwan-Gorkha War]] came to an end in 1774, with all the principalities of [[Limbuwan]] joining Gorkha Kingdom except the King of Yangwarok (Kingdom of Yangwarok consists of present-day parts of [[Taplejung]], [[Panchthar]]) and King of [[Ilam District|Ilam]] Hangsu Phuba of Lingdom Family.\n\n'''King Rana Bahadur Shah (1777\u201399)'''\n\nThe grandson of King Prithvi Narayan Shah, King [[Rana Bahadur Shah]]\u2019s role in Limbuwan was limited to arming the former kings of Limbuwan, now the Subbas and chiefs, to fight against Sikkim. He called them to Kathmandu and under the charge of four former kings of Limbuwan, the king of Gorkha handed about 107 guns, 935 swords and 825 bows to raise a Limbu army and fight against Sikkim.\n\n'''King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah (1799\u20131816)'''\n\nFollowing the occupation of Sikkim, west of Teesta River, Nepal was again plunged into a war with Tibet and eventually with [[China]]. During the war with Tibet, Sumur Lama of [[Tibet]] had taken refuge in Kathmandu. When Nepal refused to hand him back to China, the war broke out with Nepal and Tibet. At that time, the Chinese had incited the people of Limbuwan to revolt against their Gorkha king. General Tung Thang sent guns, gunpowder, cannons and other weapons to Limbus in Limbuwan. It was said that about 1000 pathis of gunpowder and 500 pathis of lead were sent to Limbus.\n\n'''Rebellions in Limbuwan'''\n\nIn 1867, Dashain was boycotted in Dhankuta in protest at eroding the Limbuwan peoples\u2019 cultural rights. The state government forced the people of Limbuwan to celebrate [[Dashain]] or else bear the consequences. This was unacceptable to the people of Limbuwan, so a revolt started in Dhankuta and spread. Gorkha rulers soon suppressed the protest and there were two deaths.{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn 1870, the [[Limbu language]] suppression policy of the Ranas led to another uprising in Limbuwan. Limbu script or education in the Limbu language was thought of as anti-nationalistic, so the state adopted the policy of suppressing all ethnic and aboriginal languages and cultures of Nepal. Many Limbus were either executed or chased away from their motherland.\n\n'''King Tribhuwan (1913\u201355)'''\n\nKing Tribhuwan's rule saw several changes in the system of Kipat in Limbuwan. Although Ranas had taken away the rights of forest and other mineral rights of the Kipat system, worse was to come. In 1913, the government brought in legislation that stated that any new lands that were brought under cultivation in Limbuwan would be turned into a Raikar land. This was specifically designed to target the new farm lands that had been carved out from the forest and pasture areas. But once again, that was against the spirit of the Gorkha Limbuwan Treaty of 1774, whereby the State was to let Limbus use their lands in their own way according to the Kipat system. According to the treaty of 1774 and the Kipat system, if forest land was to be turned into farm land, with the consent and approval of the Subha and Chumlung of the area, then it was not supposed to be an issue to the state. Besides, forests and pasture lands along with river and water bodies with mineral rights were enshrined in the Kipat system. In 1917, the Rana government's unilateral legislation stated that Kipat lands of Limbuwan could be turned into \u201cRaikar\u201d lands if the Limbu owners could not pay off loans within six months. This was totally against the treaty of 1774, which specifically stated that the lands of Limbuwan east of Arun River could never be transferred to the Raikar system. Up to 1920 the Subha and their Chumlung also had power to hold courts according to tradition in their jurisdiction.{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\n'''Limbus of Ilam rose up in resistance'''{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\nSimilarly in 1926, the Rana government introduced the Panchayat system of government in Limbuwan, accordingly these Panchayat systems replaced the Subha and Chumlung system of government in Limbuwan which was also held up by the Gorkha-Limbuwan Treaty of 1774. Limbus of Ilam rose in resistance against the government policies of gradually nibbling away the rights given them by the 1774 treaty. Thus in this way State tried to eat away the autonomy and the rights of Limbu people of Limbuwan. The most interesting and unfair part of this whole saga was that, never were any Limbu Subha or Chumlung members asked nor were their opinion taken into any consideration. Treaties and agreements are signed or dissolved with the agreement of two sides, but the Gorkha-Limbuwan Treaty of 1774 was never consulted and the state unilaterally displaced the people of Limbuwan. In the meantime, the government of Nepal continued its encouragement of mass immigration of non Limbu and non Kirant people into Limbuwan to exploit Kipat lands.\n\nIn 1950-51, when there was political movement going on in rest of Nepal, there was also a Limbu/Kiranti insurgency going on in Limbuwan demanding more political rights.\n\n'''King Mahendra (1955\u201372)'''{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}{{Citation needed|reason= research and for publication|date=November 2017}}\n\nThere was a tradition from the time of Ten Limbu Kings that whenever a new king was crowned, or a new government was formed, a delegation of Subha and Chumlung members would go to the capital city and voice their concerns. In 1960, a delegation of Limbu Subhas from Chumlungs across Limbuwan region went to Kathmandu to remind the King about the Gorkha-Limbuwan Treaty of 1774 and also to get guarantees about the rights of Limbuwan. Following his meeting with the Limbuwan delegation, the king issued royal decrees stating that the \u201cTraditional rights and privileges of Limbu people in Limbuwan will be protected\u201d, in reference to the treaty.\n\nIn 1964 King Mahendra and his government introduced the Land Reform Act, whereby the government was to confiscate any land holdings that exceeded 1.8 hectares. This was applied to all of Nepal, but [[Limbuwan]] was a different case because lands of Limbuwan once again were under Kipat system and not the Raikar system. The land could not have been sold or owned personally other than Kipat holders anyway, it was communal belonging to a clan or group of people. But once again, going against the spirit of the 1774 Treaty, eroding democratic values and neglecting the people of Limbuwan, the government did not consult with the original people of Limbuwan or the Treaty of 1774 and went ahead with their land surveying in Limbuwan. King Prithvi Narayan Shah had agreed that he would not survey, designate or take away lands of Limbuwan from the original people.\n\n'''Limbuwan Rebellion against the Land Reform Act 1964'''\n\nSoon after the introduction of the Land Reform Act, Subhas of Limbuwan and many other Limbu individuals raised the issue and implications of the Land Reform Act on Limbuwan and the existing Treaty. Limbus clearly knew that this was another act to erode the \u201ctreaty protected traditional\u201d rights of the Limbu people over their lands. The situation was tense as the very next day, the immigrant non-Limbu tenants of Kipat lands who had been paying rent over a period of time, could be declared to own the land. The very existence of the Limbu people, its culture, tradition and autonomy was in danger. King Prithvi Narayan Shah had promised to Limbus that he would not survey the Lands of Limbuwan, because he did not own them but only the people of Limbuwan did. Similarly, after the 1964 Land reforms act, King Mahendra had promised a delegation of Limbuwans that he would not take away their lands, but he died without accomplishing this and failed to save the Limbu peoples\u2019 autonomy.\n\n'''The reasons why Kipat system in Limbuwan became a problem for the State and Hindu settlers'''\n\n1)\tThe state had no authority over Kipat Lands in Limbuwan.\n\n2)\tThe state could not generate revenue or make use of Lands in Limbuwan because Limbus owned the rights to rivers, waters, forests, mines and minerals.\n\n3)\tThe Limbu Kipat owners can anytime ask their tenants to move away from their Kipat lands.\n\n4)\tDue to its strategic location and being far away from the capital, the state had to exert its control over the people of Limbuwan by mass immigrating [[Hindu]] settlers to keep rebellious Limbus in check.\n\nBefore the Land Reform Act, of Nepal's total cultivable land, almost 95% or about 2.1 million hectares of land was under the Raikar system, and 2% or about 40000 hectares of land was under Guthi organisation. Only 3% or 77000 hectares of land was under the Kipat system. The main difference once again was that, all the lands of Nepal was owned by the state and given by the state to people for ownership under the Raikar system. Raikar lands had ownership documents given by the state and most importantly Raikar lands could be sold to anyone. Whereas in the Kipat system, communal/clan authorities owned the lands, Kipat lands were not granted because of the royal or state authority, the owner owned it because he or she belonged to a clan that owned the land for ever. Lands in Limbuwan were never conquered by the state and because the treaty existed that upheld the Kipat rights, it was illegal for the same state and authority that promised to uphold the privilege on one hand to take it away, piece by piece, by the other hand. Regmi states that the King and State had no authority over Kipat lands, communal authority was supreme.\n\nIn the treaty of 1774, Prithvi Narayan Shah swore that \u201cin case we confiscate your lands, may our ancestral gods destroy our kingdom and descendants\u201d Regmi further claims that this oath was restated by every other monarch after King Prithvi Narayan. Every new King promised and pledged to maintain Kipat rights but they on the other hand sponsored those policies that slowly eroded the Kipat rights.\n\n'''King Birendra (1972\u20132001)'''\n\nThe Panchayat regime adopted the old policy of \u201cOne country one king, one language one culture\u201d. It was sponsored by the state and Nepali language and Hindu religion was imposed on everyone. The existence of other religions, customs, languages and traditions were looked down upon and not encouraged. Since the implementation of the Land Reforms Acts, there had been protests and dissatisfacion towards the state for mismanaging, mistreating and most importantly betraying the Limbus. In 1968, a Limbu delegation that had gone to express their dissatisfaction over the single-handed treaty violation were jailed and tortured. Similarly the pioneers of the Limbuwan Liberation Front Party were jailed and tortured for three years for distributing pamphlets and trying to educate Limbus about their own rights. In 1972, some other Limbuwan Liberation members took a delegation to the new King Birendra and tried to revive the Limbuwan Autonomy issue but were soon suppressed.\n\nThe restoration of democracy came in 1990 following election. The Limbuwan Liberation Front, being the first party to raise the Limbuwan issue and Limbuwan autonomy and the rights of the Limbu people based on the Limbuwan Gorkha Treaty of 1774, was denied permission by the Nepal Election Commission to run in the election while several religious Hindu fundamentalist parties were allowed to run.\n\n==The republican era and now in Limbuwan==\n\nFollowing the relinquishment of power by then King Gyanendra, the people of [[Limbuwan]] and Limbuwan concerned parties became the first group to voice their pain. They organised a first peaceful strike to let the people of Nepal know how unfairly they had been treated and how far they were willing to go for justice. August 7\u20139, 2007, was the first of many peaceful strikes and protest programs of the Federal Limbuwan State Council and other parties. The demand remains as before, the true autonomy based on 1774 and recognition of indigenous rights.\n\nUnderstanding the sentiments of the people of Limbuwan, various political parties such as Maoists and others included Federalism in their manifestoes.\n\nThe United Nations Draft Declaration on the rights of Indigenous People has also brought new hopes of legally achieving the rights that people of Limbuwan lost unfairly. Kirant Yakthung Chumlung, an organisation of Limbu people, has come up with a policy and views on going forward with the Kipat and land issues of Limbuwan.\n\n==Future of Limbuwan==\n\nAs the shah dynasty has ended up, the treaty or the red seal of assent(Lalmohor) that has formed between the Gorkha king and Yakhung Limbuwan King as Pallo kirant also ousted. That is why, the Yakthung Laje Limbuwan as specific and historic nation in the eastern part of Nepal demanding for the free of nation states. For the purpose, the organisation, Yakthung Laje Limbuwan National Council (YLLNC) has formed in the presidency(Hangdumyang) of Mr. Nir Kumar Sambahangphe Limbu in 2018 A.D. The council has demanded the Yakthung Laje Limbuwan on the basis of historic, territorial, cultural, language, scripture and other religious values. It has also stated the Yakthung Laje Limbuwan, not only fall in the Nepal but also in the recent territory of India. The president,  Mr. Nir Kumar Sambahangphe of Yakthung Laje Limbuwan National Council (YLLNC) has announced to all the Yakhung Limbus to be united for the divided yakthung limbu nationals as an Indian and Nepali to make a distinct and unique nationality in the world. It was a land of Yakthung Limbus but divided through the treaty of Sugoulee in December 6, 1815. The territory of Yakthung Limbuwan fall on the east of Arun river and west of the Teesta river, which is proclaimed as independent nation by the council. \nNow the demand of federal limbuwan have been almost collapsed. However some of the voices urging to form constitutionally the federal limbuwan state. Notwithstanding, the people of Yakthung Limbuwan are coming out of the dark shadows of the repressive past, Limbus and people of Limbuwan aspire to bring new hope, new development and new future to a Land that has existed so long with such an old history.\n\n''==References==\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nSambahangphe, N.

Japanese being a language with many [[homophone]]s, it is a coincidence that ''tora'' also means \"tiger\" ({{lang|ja|\u864e}}).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iknow.jp/courses/618828|title=Japanese Phonology: Homophones from Core Lists (complete) \u2013 iKnow!|last=http://corp.dmm.com/|first=\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793eDMM.com -|website=iknow.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn August 1939, the United States imposes a trade embargo on a belligerent Japan, severely limiting raw materials. Influential [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] figures and politicians push through an  [[Tripartite Pact| alliance with Germany and Italy]] in September 1940 and prepare for war. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the [[Japanese Combined Fleet|Combined Fleet]], [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]], reluctantly plans a pre-emptive strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet anchored at [[Pearl Harbor]], believing that Japan's best hope of controlling the [[Pacific Ocean]] is to quickly annihilate the American fleet. Air Staff Officer [[Minoru Genda]] is chosen to mastermind the operation while his old Naval Academy classmate [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] is selected to lead the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, U.S. military intelligence has broken the Japanese ''[[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple Code]]'', allowing them to intercept secret Japanese radio transmissions indicating increased Japanese naval activity. Monitoring the transmissions are U.S. Army Col. Bratton and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer. At Pearl Harbor itself, Admiral Kimmel and General Short do their best to increase defensive naval and air patrols around Hawaii which could provide early warning of enemy presence. Short recommends concentrating aircraft at the base on the runways to avoid sabotage by enemy agents in Hawaii.\n\nSeveral months pass while diplomatic tensions escalate. As the Japanese ambassador to Washington continues negotiations to stall for time, the large Japanese fleet sorties into the Pacific. On the day of the attack, Bratton and Kramer learn from intercepts that the Japanese plan a series of 14 radio messages from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy in Washington. They are also directed to destroy their code machines after receiving the final message. Deducing the Japanese intention to launch a surprise attack immediately after the messages are delivered, Bratton tries warning his superiors of his suspicions but encounters several obstacles: Chief of Naval Operations [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold R. Stark]] is indecisive over notifying Hawaii without first alerting the President while Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]]'s order that Pearl Harbor be alerted of an impending attack is stymied by poor atmospherics that prevent radio transmission and by bungling when a warning sent by telegram is not marked urgent. At dawn on December 7, the Japanese fleet launches its aircraft. Their approach to Hawaii is detected by two radar operators but their concerns are dismissed by the duty officer. The Japanese thus achieve surprise and a joyous commander Fuchida sends the code to begin the attack: \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\"\n\nThe damage to the naval base is catastrophic and casualties are severe. Seven battleships are either sunk or heavily damaged. General Short's anti-sabotage precautions prove a disastrous mistake that allows the Japanese aerial forces to destroy aircraft on the ground easily. Hours after the attack ends, General Short and Admiral Kimmel receive Marshall's telegram warning of impending danger. In Washington, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] is stunned to learn of the attack and urgently requests confirmation before receiving the Japanese ambassador. The message that was transmitted to the Japanese embassy in 14 parts \u2013 a declaration of war \u2013 was meant to be delivered to the Americans at 1:00 pm in Washington, 30 minutes before the attack. However, it was not decoded and transcribed in time, meaning the attack started while the two nations were technically still at peace. The distraught [[Kichisabur\u014d Nomura|Japanese ambassador]], helpless to explain the late ultimatum and unaware of the ongoing attack, is bluntly rebuffed by a despondent Hull.\n\nBack in the Pacific, the Japanese fleet commander, Vice-Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]], refuses to launch a scheduled third wave of aircraft for fear of exposing his force to U.S. submarines. Aboard his flagship, Admiral Yamamoto solemnly informs his staff that their primary target \u2013 the American aircraft carriers \u2013 were not at Pearl Harbor, having departed days previously to search for Japanese vessels. Lamenting that the declaration of war arrived after the attack began, Yamamoto notes that nothing would infuriate the U.S. more and ominously concludes: \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\"\n\n==Cast==\n=== Allies ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!Actor\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Martin Balsam]]\n|[[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Husband E.

Zanuck]], who had earlier produced ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), wanted to create an epic that depicted what \"really happened on December 7, 1941\", with a \"revisionist's approach\". He believed that the commanders in Hawaii, [[Walter Short|General Short]] and [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Kimmel]], though scapegoated for decades, provided adequate defensive measures for the apparent threats, including relocation of the fighter aircraft at Pearl Harbor to the middle of the base, in response to fears of sabotage from local Japanese.

I felt he was not only uncomfortable directing this kind of movie but also he wasn't used to having somebody tell him how he should make his film. He always had complete autonomy, and nobody would dare make a suggestion to Kurosawa about the budget, or shooting schedule, or anything like that. And then here he was, with Darryl Zanuck on his back and Richard Zanuck on him and Elmo Williams and the production managers, and it was all stuff that he never had run into before, because he was always untouchable. I think he was getting more and more nervous and more insecure about how he was going to work on this film. And of course, the press got a hold of a lot of this unrest on the set and they made a lot out of that in Japan, and it was more pressure on him, and he wasn't used to that kind of pressure.<ref>Galbraith, Stewart. \"[[Stuart Galbraith IV]] interview of Richard Fleischer.\" ''Tora!

These were used for much of the Japanese scenes on ship's decks. The one error introduced, however, was that the model ''Akagi''{{'}}s bridge was built on the starboard side instead of the port side. Only two Japanese carriers were built in this fashion, with bridges on the port side: ''Akagi'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}}.

The night before filming the \"Japanese\" take-off scenes she sailed to a spot a few miles west of San Diego and at dawn the film crew filmed the launches of all the aircraft. Since these \"Japanese\" aircraft were not actual carrier-based aircraft, they did not have [[arresting gear]] with which to land back on the carrier, and continued on to land at North Island Naval Air Station. ''Yorktown'' sailed back to North Island and re-loaded the aircraft. She then sailed to Hawaii and the aircraft were off-loaded and used to film the attack scenes in and around Pearl Harbor.

After viewing the \"single gear\" landing footage they decided to include it in the movie. In the sequence depicting the crash, only the final crash was actual footage. For the scenes leading up to the crash they manually retracted the starboard landing gear on a functioning B-17 and filmed the scenes of its final approach. After touching down on one wheel the pilot simply applied power and took off again. The B-17 that actually landed with one gear up sustained only minor damage to the starboard wing and propellers and was repaired and returned to service. A total of five Boeing B-17s were obtained for filming. Other U.S. aircraft used are the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] and, especially, the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] (two flyable examples were used).

Admiral Halsey was on {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, not the ''Essex''-class carrier {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}, which would not be commissioned until 1944. This is understandable, however, as both ''Enterprise'' and all six of the Japanese carriers from the attack had been scrapped and sunk, respectively. ''Enterprise'' was scrapped in 1959, and four of the six, including ''Akagi'', were sunk within six months of the attack at the [[Battle of Midway]].\n\nIn ''Tora! Tora! Tora!'', an error involves the model of {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Akagi}}. In the film, ''Akagi''{{'}}s bridge island is positioned on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side of the ship, which is typical on most aircraft carriers. However, the aircraft carrier ''Akagi'' was an exception; its bridge island was on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side of the ship. Despite this, the bridge section appeared accurately as a mirrored version of ''Akagi''{{'}}s real port-side bridge.<ref name=\"Orriss p. 196\">[[#refOrriss1984|Orriss 1984]], p. 196.</ref> Secondly, all the Japanese aircraft in the footage bear the markings of ''Akagi''{{'}}s aircraft (a single vertical red stripe following the red sun symbol of Japan), even though five other aircraft carriers participated, each having its own markings. In addition, the markings do not display the aircraft's identification numbers as was the case in the actual battle. The white surround on the [[roundel]] on the Japanese aircraft was only used from 1942 onwards. Prior to this the roundel was red only.<ref name=\"Robertson pp. 160\u2013161\">[[#refRobertson1961|Robertson 1961]], pp. 160\u2013161.</ref>\n\n{{USS|Ward|DD-139}} was an old \"4-piper\" [[destroyer]] commissioned in 1918; the ship used in the movie, {{USS|Finch|DE-328}}, which portrays ''Ward'' looked far different from the original destroyer.<ref>[http://www.usssavagededer386.org/ToraToraTora.html \"Tora, Tora, Tora, Chapter 9.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605000043/http://www.usssavagededer386.org/ToraToraTora.html |date=2013-06-05 }} ''.usssavagededer386.org.''

The [[lattice mast]] (or cage mast) section of the {{sclass-|Tennessee|battleship|0}}/''Maryland''-class battleship was built beside the set of the USS ''Nevada'' stern section, but not built upon a set of a deck, but on the ground as the footage in the movie only showed the cage [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] tower. The large scale model of the stern shows the two aft gun turrets with three gun barrels in each; in reality, ''Nevada'' had two heightened fore and aft turrets with two barrels each while the lower two turrets fore and aft had three barrels each. Another model of ''Nevada'', used in the film to portray the whole ship, displays the turrets accurately. The reason for this anomaly is because the aft section model was used in the film to portray both USS ''Nevada'' and USS ''Arizona''. The ships looked remarkably similar except that ''Arizona'' had four triple turrets and a slightly different stern section. Footage and photographs not used in the film show the cage mast as being built on the ground. The USS ''Nevada''/USS ''Arizona'' stern section was shown exploding to represent the explosion that destroyed ''Arizona'', although in reality the explosion took place in #2 [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazine|magazine]], forward, and ''Arizona''{{'}}s stern section remains essentially intact to this day.\n\nThe film has a Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighter being damaged over a naval base and then deliberately crashing into a naval base hangar. This is actually a composite of three incidents at [[Pearl Harbor attack]]: in the first wave, a Japanese Zero crashed into [[Fort Kamehameha]]'s ordnance building; in the second wave, a Japanese Zero did deliberately crash into a hillside after U.S. Navy CPO [[John William Finn]] at Naval Air Station at [[K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay]] had shot and damaged the aircraft; also during the second wave, a Japanese aircraft that was damaged crashed into the [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Curtiss|AV-4|6}}.<ref>[[#refCarnes1996|Carnes 1996]], pp. 228\u2013231.</ref>\n\nDuring a number of shots of the attack squadrons traversing across Oahu, a white cross can be seen standing on one of the mountainsides.

The film was produced by [[Elmo Williams]] and directed by [[Richard Fleischer]]<!--The Japanese segments form a significant portion of the film:-->, [[Toshio Masuda (director)|Toshio Masuda]] and [[Kinji Fukasaku]], and stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Martin Balsam]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[S\u014d Yamamura]], [[E.

Influential [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] figures and politicians push through an  [[Tripartite Pact| alliance with Germany and Italy]] in September 1940 and prepare for war. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the [[Japanese Combined Fleet|Combined Fleet]], [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]], reluctantly plans a pre-emptive strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet anchored at [[Pearl Harbor]], believing that Japan's best hope of controlling the [[Pacific Ocean]] is to quickly annihilate the American fleet. Air Staff Officer [[Minoru Genda]] is chosen to mastermind the operation while his old Naval Academy classmate [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] is selected to lead the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, U.S. military intelligence has broken the Japanese ''[[Purple (cipher machine)|Purple Code]]'', allowing them to intercept secret Japanese radio transmissions indicating increased Japanese naval activity. Monitoring the transmissions are U.S. Army Col. Bratton and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer. At Pearl Harbor itself, Admiral Kimmel and General Short do their best to increase defensive naval and air patrols around Hawaii which could provide early warning of enemy presence. Short recommends concentrating aircraft at the base on the runways to avoid sabotage by enemy agents in Hawaii.\n\nSeveral months pass while diplomatic tensions escalate. As the Japanese ambassador to Washington continues negotiations to stall for time, the large Japanese fleet sorties into the Pacific. On the day of the attack, Bratton and Kramer learn from intercepts that the Japanese plan a series of 14 radio messages from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy in Washington. They are also directed to destroy their code machines after receiving the final message. Deducing the Japanese intention to launch a surprise attack immediately after the messages are delivered, Bratton tries warning his superiors of his suspicions but encounters several obstacles: Chief of Naval Operations [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold R. Stark]] is indecisive over notifying Hawaii without first alerting the President while Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]]'s order that Pearl Harbor be alerted of an impending attack is stymied by poor atmospherics that prevent radio transmission and by bungling when a warning sent by telegram is not marked urgent. At dawn on December 7, the Japanese fleet launches its aircraft. Their approach to Hawaii is detected by two radar operators but their concerns are dismissed by the duty officer. The Japanese thus achieve surprise and a joyous commander Fuchida sends the code to begin the attack: \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\"\n\nThe damage to the naval base is catastrophic and casualties are severe. Seven battleships are either sunk or heavily damaged. General Short's anti-sabotage precautions prove a disastrous mistake that allows the Japanese aerial forces to destroy aircraft on the ground easily. Hours after the attack ends, General Short and Admiral Kimmel receive Marshall's telegram warning of impending danger. In Washington, [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] is stunned to learn of the attack and urgently requests confirmation before receiving the Japanese ambassador. The message that was transmitted to the Japanese embassy in 14 parts \u2013 a declaration of war \u2013 was meant to be delivered to the Americans at 1:00 pm in Washington, 30 minutes before the attack.

The distraught [[Kichisabur\u014d Nomura|Japanese ambassador]], helpless to explain the late ultimatum and unaware of the ongoing attack, is bluntly rebuffed by a despondent Hull.\n\nBack in the Pacific, the Japanese fleet commander, Vice-Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]], refuses to launch a scheduled third wave of aircraft for fear of exposing his force to U.S. submarines. Aboard his flagship, Admiral Yamamoto solemnly informs his staff that their primary target \u2013 the American aircraft carriers \u2013 were not at Pearl Harbor, having departed days previously to search for Japanese vessels. Lamenting that the declaration of war arrived after the attack began, Yamamoto notes that nothing would infuriate the U.S. more and ominously concludes: \"I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\"\n\n==Cast==\n=== Allies ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!Actor\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Martin Balsam]]\n|[[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Husband E.

Zanuck]], who had earlier produced ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), wanted to create an epic that depicted what \"really happened on December 7, 1941\", with a \"revisionist's approach\". He believed that the commanders in Hawaii, [[Walter Short|General Short]] and [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Kimmel]], though scapegoated for decades, provided adequate defensive measures for the apparent threats, including relocation of the fighter aircraft at Pearl Harbor to the middle of the base, in response to fears of sabotage from local Japanese. Despite a breakthrough in intelligence, they had received limited warning of the increasing risk of aerial attack.<ref name=\"Parish p. 411\" /> Recognizing that a balanced and objective recounting was necessary, Zanuck developed an American-Japanese co-production, allowing for \"a point of view from both nations\".<ref name=\"Orriss pp. 194\u2013195\" /> He was helped out by his son, [[Richard D.

I felt he was not only uncomfortable directing this kind of movie but also he wasn't used to having somebody tell him how he should make his film. He always had complete autonomy, and nobody would dare make a suggestion to Kurosawa about the budget, or shooting schedule, or anything like that. And then here he was, with Darryl Zanuck on his back and Richard Zanuck on him and Elmo Williams and the production managers, and it was all stuff that he never had run into before, because he was always untouchable. I think he was getting more and more nervous and more insecure about how he was going to work on this film. And of course, the press got a hold of a lot of this unrest on the set and they made a lot out of that in Japan, and it was more pressure on him, and he wasn't used to that kind of pressure.<ref>Galbraith, Stewart. \"[[Stuart Galbraith IV]] interview of Richard Fleischer.\" ''Tora!

These were used for much of the Japanese scenes on ship's decks. The one error introduced, however, was that the model ''Akagi''{{'}}s bridge was built on the starboard side instead of the port side. Only two Japanese carriers were built in this fashion, with bridges on the port side: ''Akagi'' and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiry\u016b||2}}. This was done because it was known that for the launching scenes filmed in the US, a US carrier would be used and the islands of US carriers were always on the starboard side. A few of the modified aircraft were also converted in Japan for the flight scenes filmed there.\n\nIn preparation for filming, ''Yorktown'' was berthed at [[NAS North Island]] in San Diego to load all the aircraft, maintenance, and film crew prior to sailing to Hawaii. The night before filming the \"Japanese\" take-off scenes she sailed to a spot a few miles west of San Diego and at dawn the film crew filmed the launches of all the aircraft. Since these \"Japanese\" aircraft were not actual carrier-based aircraft, they did not have [[arresting gear]] with which to land back on the carrier, and continued on to land at North Island Naval Air Station. ''Yorktown'' sailed back to North Island and re-loaded the aircraft. She then sailed to Hawaii and the aircraft were off-loaded and used to film the attack scenes in and around Pearl Harbor. Aircraft Specialties of Mesa, Arizona performed maintenance on the aircraft while in Hawaii.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}<!-- The whole paragraph -->\n\nA [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]]'s actual crash landing during filming, a result of a jammed landing gear, was filmed and used in the final cut.<ref>http://ww2f.com/threads/about-tora-tora-tora.16059/.

The aircraft stayed aloft to use up as much fuel as possible, which gave the film crew some time to prepare, prior to landing. After viewing the \"single gear\" landing footage they decided to include it in the movie. In the sequence depicting the crash, only the final crash was actual footage. For the scenes leading up to the crash they manually retracted the starboard landing gear on a functioning B-17 and filmed the scenes of its final approach. After touching down on one wheel the pilot simply applied power and took off again. The B-17 that actually landed with one gear up sustained only minor damage to the starboard wing and propellers and was repaired and returned to service. A total of five Boeing B-17s were obtained for filming. Other U.S. aircraft used are the [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] and, especially, the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] (two flyable examples were used). Predominantly, P-40 fighter aircraft are used to depict the U.S. defenders with a full-scale P-40 used as a template for fiberglass replicas (some with working engines and props) that were strafed and blown up during filming.<ref>[[#refHathaway1969|Hathaway 1969]], p. 52.</ref> Fleischer also said a scene involving a P-40 model crashing into the middle of a line of P-40s was unintended, as it was supposed to crash at the end of the line.

The reason for this anomaly is because the aft section model was used in the film to portray both USS ''Nevada'' and USS ''Arizona''. The ships looked remarkably similar except that ''Arizona'' had four triple turrets and a slightly different stern section. Footage and photographs not used in the film show the cage mast as being built on the ground. The USS ''Nevada''/USS ''Arizona'' stern section was shown exploding to represent the explosion that destroyed ''Arizona'', although in reality the explosion took place in #2 [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazine|magazine]], forward, and ''Arizona''{{'}}s stern section remains essentially intact to this day.\n\nThe film has a Japanese [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero]] fighter being damaged over a naval base and then deliberately crashing into a naval base hangar. This is actually a composite of three incidents at [[Pearl Harbor attack]]: in the first wave, a Japanese Zero crashed into [[Fort Kamehameha]]'s ordnance building; in the second wave, a Japanese Zero did deliberately crash into a hillside after U.S. Navy CPO [[John William Finn]] at Naval Air Station at [[K\u0101ne\u02bbohe Bay]] had shot and damaged the aircraft; also during the second wave, a Japanese aircraft that was damaged crashed into the [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Curtiss|AV-4|6}}.<ref>[[#refCarnes1996|Carnes 1996]], pp. 228\u2013231.</ref>\n\nDuring a number of shots of the attack squadrons traversing across Oahu, a white cross can be seen standing on one of the mountainsides. The cross was actually erected after the attack as a memorial to the victims of the attack.<ref>[http://www.hawaiiforvisitors.com/oahu/attractions/central-oahu-introduction.htm \"Introduction to Central Oahu.\"] ''hawaiiforvisitors.com.''

An abridged version of the quotation is also featured in the 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]''. The 2019 film ''[[Midway_(2019_film)|Midway]]'' also features Admiral Yamamoto speaking aloud the sleeping giant quote.

Tora! Tora!'', [[Richard Fleischer]], stated that while Yamamoto may never have said those words, the film's producer, [[Elmo Williams]], had found the line written in Yamamoto's diary. Williams, in turn, has stated that Larry Forrester, the screenwriter, found a 1943 letter from Yamamoto to the Admiralty in [[Tokyo]] containing the quotation. However, Forrester cannot produce the letter, nor can anyone else, American or Japanese, recall it or find it.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nAt the time of its initial release, ''Tora! Tora!

In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally-produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel.

The ten-episode season is broadcast on Mondays at 9:00{{nbsp}}pm (Eastern) in the United States on AMC; excluding the premiere episode which was broadcast on a Sunday. [[Bob Odenkirk]] ([[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman]]), [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] reprise their roles from previous seasons and are joined by [[Tony Dalton]], promoted to the main cast from his recurring role in season four. ''Better Call Saul'' is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[prequel]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created by [[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to [[Kim Wexler]]'s (Seehorn) dismay. In addition, [[Lalo Salamanca]]'s (Dalton) presence disrupts [[Gus Fring]]'s (Esposito) plans to build a \"superlab\" that will enable him to bypass the Mexican cocaine cartel by selling locally-produced methamphetamine, while [[Nacho Varga]] (Mando) is caught between both sides of the cartel. [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] (Banks) struggles with his killing of [[Werner Ziegler (Better Call Saul)|Werner Ziegler]], which he carried out on Gus's order.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nOn July 28, 2018, AMC renewed ''Better Call Saul'' for a fifth season, just prior to the airing of the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Otterson |first=Joe |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |title='Better Call Saul,' 'Fear the Walking Dead,' 'McMafia' Renewed at AMC |date=July 28, 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=November 25, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815134454/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/better-call-saul-season-5-fear-the-walking-dead-season-5-mcmafia-season-2-renewed-amc-1202889278/ |archive-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nOn what to expect in the fifth season, series co-creator Peter Gould said:\n{{cquote|\nIt seems like [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy]]'s first move is to try to leverage all the contacts he has in the world of selling drop phones. But don't forget, he also knows the vet [Caldera] ... and the vet is sort of [[Craigslist|Craig's List]] for the underworld in Albuquerque. So he can get quite far. The question is: how does he establish a reputation as not just a [[Criminal defense lawyer|criminal lawyer]] but a [[Attorney misconduct|{{em|criminal}} lawyer]]? And what does that mean to him at this point? Because situations may require him to do things and turn a blind eye to things that Jimmy McGill would not be able to stomach.<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\">{{Cite news |last=Snierson |first=Dan |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/12/better-call-saul-creator-season-5-preview/ |title='Better Call Saul' creator on what lies ahead in season 5&nbsp;\u2013 and the return of Gene |date=December 12, 2018 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=December 14, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213021058/https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/12/better-call-saul-creator-season-5-preview/ |archive-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Casting ===\nMain cast members [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Jonathan Banks]], [[Rhea Seehorn]], [[Patrick Fabian]], [[Michael Mando]], and [[Giancarlo Esposito]] return from previous seasons as Jimmy McGill / Saul Goodman, [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], [[Kim Wexler]],<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\" /> [[Howard Hamlin]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://meaww.com/better-call-saul-star-patrick-fabian-interview-evolution-howard-rhea-seehorn-season-5-expectations |title='Better Call Saul' star Patrick Fabian on the evolution of Howard, his soft spot for Rhea Seehorn and what to expect from season 5 |last=Pai |first=Akshay |date=November 13, 2018 |website=Meaww |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224034537/https://meaww.com/better-call-saul-star-patrick-fabian-interview-evolution-howard-rhea-seehorn-season-5-expectations |archive-date=December 24, 2018 |access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> [[Nacho Varga]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lofficielusa.com/film-tv/michael-mando-the-hummingbird-project-tiff-2018 |title=Michael Mando Is Living a Real Life Hollywood Fairy Tale |last=Scott |first=Savannah |date=December 11, 2018 |website=L'Officiel |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224033938/https://www.lofficielusa.com/film-tv/michael-mando-the-hummingbird-project-tiff-2018 |archive-date=December 24, 2018 |access-date=December 24, 2018}}</ref> and [[Gus Fring]].<ref name=\"EW Dec2018\" /> [[Tony Dalton]], who recurred in season four as [[Lalo Salamanca]], was promoted to the main cast for the fifth season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/better-call-saul-tony-dalton-series-regular-season-5-1202591334/ |title='Better Call Saul' Adds Tony Dalton As Series Regular For Season 5 |last=Ramos |first=Dino-Ray |date=April 8, 2019 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409061114/https://deadline.com/2019/04/better-call-saul-tony-dalton-series-regular-season-5-1202591334/ |archive-date=April 9, 2019 |access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> In January 2020, it was announced that ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' actors [[Dean Norris]] and [[Steven Michael Quezada]] would reprise their roles as [[Hank Schrader]] and [[Steven Gomez]], along with actor [[Robert Forster]] who appeared posthumously as [[Ed Galbraith]].<ref name=\"BBCharacters\">{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/16/better-call-saul-season-5-robert-forster-dean-norris/ |title='Better Call Saul' season 5 to feature the late Robert Forster, Dean Norris |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=January 16, 2020 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200117041936/https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/16/better-call-saul-season-5-robert-forster-dean-norris/ |archive-date=January 17, 2020 |access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref> The first episode of the season was dedicated to Forster.<ref name=\"sepinwall\">{{Cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-1-magic-man-954059/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season Premiere Recap: \u2018Magic Man\u2019 |date=February 23, 2020 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=February 23, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming for the fifth season began on April 10, 2019, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1300873/better-call-saul-begins-filming-season-5-in-abq.html |title='Better Call Saul' begins filming season 5 in ABQ |last=Gomez |first=Adrian |date=April 8, 2019 |website=[[Albuquerque Journal]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190414143824/https://www.abqjournal.com/1300873/better-call-saul-begins-filming-season-5-in-abq.html |archive-date=April 14, 2019 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/04/09/better-call-saul-season-5-amc-confirms-filming-this-week-patrick-fabian-briefly-talks-howard/ |title='Better Call Saul' Season 5: AMC Confirms Filming Begins This Week;

Lalo accepts Gus' cover story but remains suspicious. Saul gives away his remaining cell phones to publicize his criminal law practice. Gus shuts down lab construction because of Lalo's suspicions and Mike sends Werner's crew home. Upset over Gus' lack of compassion for Werner, Mike refuses to accept payment during the downtime. Saul's camera crew helps generate publicity for his practice by faking a confrontation with Deputy District Attorney Oakley. Kim's client refuses a favorable plea bargain.

Limassol's historical centre is located around its medieval [[Limassol Castle]] and the Old Port. Today the city spreads along the [[Mediterranean]] coast and has extended much farther than the castle and port, with its suburbs stretching along the coast to Amathus. To the west of the city, is the Akrotiri Area of the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].\n\n===Ancient===\n[[File:Amathus31.JPG|thumb|Ancient Amathus]]\n[[File:Episkopi 01-2017 img03 Kourion.jpg|thumb|[[Kourion]] Greco-Roman theatre.]]\nThe city of Limassol is situated between the ancient cities of [[Amathus]] and [[Kourion|Kourion (Curium)]]. Limassol was probably built after Amathus had been ruined. However, the town of Limassol has been inhabited since very [[ancient history|ancient times]]. Graves found there date back to 2000 BC and others date back to the 8th and 4th centuries BC. These few remains show that a small colonisation must have existed which did not manage to develop and flourish. Ancient writers mention nothing about the foundation of the town.\nIn 85 BC,  Armenian emperor [[Tigranes the Great]] ({{Lang-hy|\u054f\u056b\u0563\u0580\u0561\u0576 \u0544\u0565\u056e}} ''Tigran Mets''; {{lang-el|\u03a4\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2}} ''Tigr\u00e1nes ho M\u00e9gas'') had reached Limassol in order to establish security and protection of local Greek allies against Rome in a result followed by his conquest of Syria, Lebanon and Anatolia.\n[[File:Tigranes four Kings.jpg|thumb|Tigranes the Great and the Four Kings]]\n\nAccording to the [[Council of Chalcedon]] which took place in 451, the local bishop as well as the bishops of Amathus and Arsinoe were involved in the foundation of the city, which would be known by the names of Theodosiana and Neapolis.<ref>''The acts of the Council of Chalcedon'' by Council of Chalcedon, Richard Price, Michael Gaddis 2006 {{ISBN|0-85323-039-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&pg=PA94&dq=Chalcedon+catholic+anglican+eastern&hl=en&ei=ql_gTMj_Lon5sgafnez6Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref> Bishop [[Leontios of Neapolis]] was an important church writer in the 7th century. The records of the 7th Synod (757) refer to it as the bishop's see. The town was known as Lemesos in the 10th century.\n\n===Medieval===\n[[File:Kolossi Castle 01.JPG|thumb|View of [[Kolossi Castle]] built in 1210 by the Frankish military.]]\nThe history of Limassol is largely known by the events associated with the [[Third Crusade]]. The king of England, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], was travelling to the [[Holy Land]] in 1190.<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/history/17.htm |title=Cyprus History: Cyprus under Richard I \u2013 cypnet.co.uk |first=|last=Cypnet.co.uk |work=cypnet.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> His fianc\u00e9e [[Berengaria of Navarre|Berengaria]] and his sister [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan, Queen of Sicily]], were also travelling on a different ship. Because of a storm, the ship with the queens arrived in Limassol.<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\"/> [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], the renegade Byzantine Greek governor of Cyprus invited the queens ashore, with the intention of holding them to ransom, but they refused. So he refused them fresh water and they had to put out to sea again or yield to capture. When Richard arrived in Limassol and met Isaac Komnenos, he asked him to contribute to the crusade for the liberation of [[Holy Land|the Holy Land]].<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\"/> While at the beginning Isaac had accepted, he later on refused to give any help. Richard then chased him and finally arrested him; the entire island was therefore taken over by the [[Anglo-Normans]], bringing the long Byzantine dominion of Cyprus to an end.<ref>Wolff and Hazard, pp. 63\u201364</ref> Richard celebrated his marriage with Berengaria who had received the crown as queen of England in Cyprus. Richard destroyed Amathus and the inhabitants were transferred to Limassol.<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\"/>\n\nA year later, in AD 1191 Cyprus was sold for the sum of 100,000 [[bezant]]s to the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], rich monks and soldiers whose aim was the protection of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\"/> The knights enforced high taxes, in order to get back the money that had been given for the purchase of Cyprus. This led to the revolt of the Cypriots, who wished to get rid of the bond of the promise. Richard accepted their request and a new purchaser was found: [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy de Lusignan]], a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] from [[Poitou]]. Cyprus was therefore handed over to the French dynasty of the house of [[Lusignan]], thus establishing the medieval [[Kingdom of Cyprus]].\n\nFor a period of about three centuries 1175\u20131489, Limassol enjoyed remarkable prosperity. Cyprus was characterised by its great number of Latin bishops. This lasted until the occupation of Cyprus by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in AD 1570. Latin battalions which established monasteries were settled down there. The settlement of merchants in Cyprus and particularly in Limassol in the 13th century led to the financial welfare of its inhabitants. Its harbour as a centre of transportation and commerce, contributed greatly to the financial and [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural development]].\n\n===Venetian rule===\nCyprus was sold in 1489 to [[Venice]] by the Cypriot Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]].<ref name=\"ChurchillDavenport1900\">{{cite book|last1=Churchill|first1=Lady Randolph Spencer|last2=Davenport|first2=Cyril James Humphries|title=The Anglo-Saxon Review|url=https://archive.org/details/anglosaxonrevie08churgoog|accessdate=13 March 2013|year=1900|publisher=John Lane|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anglosaxonrevie08churgoog/page/n261 215]\u201322}}</ref> The [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] did not have Cyprus' best interest at heart, they were only interested in receiving the taxes and in exploiting the country's resources. The Venetians strengthened the [[Limassol Castle|Castle of Limassol]].\n\n===Under the Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:Limassol 01-2017 img21 Castle exterior.jpg|thumb|The [[Limassol Castle|Limassol Medieval Castle]] was rebuilt in 1590 by the Ottomans.]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|invaded Cyprus]] in 1570\u20131577 and occupied it.<ref name=\"Turnbull57\">Turnbull (2000), p. 57</ref><ref name=\"Abulafia447\">Abulafia (2012), p. 447</ref>  Limassol was conquered in July 1570 without any resistance.\n\nSome neighbourhoods, mostly to the east of the city were predominantly Greek, to the west predominantly Turkish with an evenly mixed area around the castle. The church played an important role in the education of Greeks during the years 1754\u20131821. During those years new schools were set up in all the towns. Greek intellectuals used to teach [[History of Greece|Greek history]], Turkish and French. The following schools operated in the town of Limassol:\n* The Greek School which was established in 1819.\n* The first public school which was established in 1841.\n* The Girls\u2019 School which was established in 1861.\n\n===British Colonial administration===\n[[File:Limassol Old Town 19.JPG|thumb|160px|Limassol old town with British colonial architecture]]\n[[File:Tonneaux de vin sur le port de Limassol.jpg|thumb|left|Barrels of wine in Limassol port in 1930s]]\nThe [[British Empire|British]] took over in Cyprus in 1878.

The roads were cleaned, the animals were removed from the centre, roads were fixed, trees were planted and docks were constructed for the loading and unloading of those ships that were anchored off-shore. Lanterns for the lighting of the central areas were also installed in the 1880. In 1912, electricity replaced the old lanterns.<ref name=\"Daedalus\"/>\n\nFrom the very first years of the British occupation, a [[post office]], a telegraph office and a hospital began to operate.<ref name= Daedalus/> In 1880 the first [[printing press]] started working. It was in this printing press that the newspapers ''Alithia'' and ''Anagennisis'' were published in 1897. The newspaper ''Salpinx'' was published at the same time.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the very first hotels began to operate. Among these were Europe and Amathus.\n\nThese changes that the British brought about contributed to the development of an intellectual and artistic life.\nSchools, theatres, clubs, [[art museum|art galleries]], [[music hall]]s, sport societies, [[football team|football clubs]] etc. were all set up and meant a great deal to the cultural life of Limassol.\n\n==Politics and government==\n[[File:EPP Summit Limassol Jan. 2013 (8389039511).jpg|thumb|[[European People's Party]] summit in Limassol in 2013]]\n[[File:Angela Merkel (9307209906).jpg |thumb|left|[[Angela Merkel]] and [[Nicos Anastasiades]] attending the EPP summit in Limassol in 2013]]\nThe first [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups in Cyprus formed in Limassol in the early 1920s; in 1926, the [[Communist party]] of Cyprus was formed in the city.

The list of participants in the summit included [[European Council]] members, government representatives, [[European Commission]] representatives, opposition members and leaders, and [[European Parliament]] representatives.

From December to March the weather is unsettled and can be rainy and windy but you can also often expect great amounts of sunshine averaging around 6 hours a day. During this season there are a few days when the daytime highs might not exceed {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and the night time lows might be as low as {{convert|2|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but usually the temperature ranges from {{convert|16|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in the day and from {{convert|7|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in the night. Rain tends to be heavy this time of the year and thunderstorms occur often though they usually do not last for a long time. \n\nSnow in Limassol is a very rare occurrence and usually falls mixed with rain every 7\u201313 years. In recent years, snow mixed with rain fell in February 2004, in January 2008 and in February 2012. In spring \u2013 March the weather is mild to warm and pleasant. It is sunny almost every day and the temperatures are around {{convert|19|-|20|C|F}} in the day and {{convert|9|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in the night.

Limassol has many beaches, suitable for sunbathing and swimming. A bathing beach with all the necessary facilities, provided by the [[Cyprus Tourism Organisation]] (CTO), is operating in the town of Limassol, in Dasoudi area.\n\nThe [[Port of Limassol]] became the major sea [[port]] of the Republic of Cyprus in 1974. Before 1974, that role had been filled by [[Famagusta]], which is now located in Northern Cyprus, and is not recognised as a legal port by any country except Turkey.\n\nLimassol is the base for many of the island's [[wine]] companies, serving the wine-growing regions on the southern slopes of the [[Troodos Mountains]] including [[Commandaria]]. Companies include [[KEO (beer)|KEO]], LOEL, SODAP and ETKO. Wines and cognacs (brandies) that are produced by the grapes here have won several awards in international exhibitions.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} There is a considerable consumption of wine products in Cyprus by the locals and the foreign visitors. Big quantities are exported to Europe.\n\nThe town of Limassol is the biggest industrial centre of the province. There are about 350 [[industrial park|industrial units]] with 90 industry wares. These industries concern dressmaking, furniture, shoes, drinks, food, prints, metal industry, electric devices, plastic wares as well as many other different industries.\n\nLimassol is an important trade centre of Cyprus. This is due to the presence of the [[Sovereign Base Areas|UK sovereign base]] at Episkopi and [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Akrotiri]], and to the displacement of the population in Limassol after the Turkish invasion in 1974. The trade markets are gathered in the centre of the town and in the tourist area along the coast that begins from the old harbour and ends in Amathus area. Most of the hotels, restaurants, confectioneries, discos and places of entertainment in general, are to be found in this area.\n\nLimassol has two ports, commonly referred to as the \"old port\" and the \"new port\". The new port has the greatest commercial and passenger flow of traffic and it is the biggest port in the Republic of Cyprus. The old harbour has a breakwater {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and it is only able to receive three small ships at a time. It is thus normally used by fishing boats. The new harbour is {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=off}} deep and has break-waters that are {{convert|1,300|m|ft|abbr=off}} long. It is able to receive about ten ships depending on their size.\nExports of grapes, wines, carobs, [[citrus|citrus fruits]] and imports of cereals, vehicles, machines, textiles, agricultural medicines, fertilizers, iron etc. are exported and imported through these ports.\n\nLimassol is today the largest [[ship management]] service centre in Europe{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} with more than 60 ship management companies located in the city, as due to the Cyprus Shipping tax system (a choice between corporation tax or a [[tonnage tax]] system) it makes it very attractive for [[crew management]] companies and ship management companies to have their main offices in Limassol. These ship management companies employ more than 40,000 seafarers.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In fact, the Cyprus registry today is ranked as the tenth among international fleets.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nA marina located to the west of Limassol Castle, between the old and new ports, has been built. This new development allows berthing of ocean-going yachts and was opened to public in 2014, having hosted its first yachts in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Limassol Marina open to the public|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/06/10/limassol-marina-open-to-the-public/|newspaper=Cyprus Mail|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref> The marina has a capacity of 1,000 vessels.\n\nDuring the last years,{{when|date=September 2016}} Limassol has experienced a construction boom fuelled by the tourist sector as well as from increasing foreign investments in the city. Public projects like the redesigning of the city's {{convert|1|km|mi|spell=in|adj=mid|abbr=off}} promenade, are improving the quality of life of the people and the image of the city as a cosmopolitan destination. Infrastructure improvements partly funded by European programmes have helped solve traffic problems that the city faced with the construction of new highway flyovers and roundabouts.\n\nThe [[Port of Limassol]] is one of the busiest ports in the Mediterranean transit trade and the largest port in Cyprus. It has also become one of the most important [[tourism]], trade, and service-providing centres in the area. Limassol is home to the [[Cyprus University of Technology]], one of the best young universities in the entire Europe. A number of [[museum]]s and [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[Archaeological site|site]]s are available to visitors. Limassol attracts a wide range of tourists mostly during an extended summer season to be accommodated in a wide range of hotels and apartments. A large marina lies near the [[old town]], {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=off}} from the Limassol medieval castle.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Armenians in Cyprus|Russians in Cyprus}}\n[[File:Limassol - Agia Napa 2 Innenraum.jpg|thumb|Ayia Napa Church]]\nInternal migration since the 1960s and influx of [[displaced person]]s after 1974 significantly increased the population of Limassol and its suburbs. Greater Limassol today includes the municipality of Limassol (includes the suburb of Agia Fyla) and the municipalities of Polemidia, Mesa Geitonia, [[Ayios Athanasios, Cyprus|Agios Athanasios]], Germasogeia and [[Ypsonas]].\n\nLimassol traditionally had a mixed population of [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]], [[Turkish Cypriots]] and [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian Cypriots]]. The majority of Turkish Cypriots moved to the north in 1974. Accordingly, many [[Greek Cypriots]] from the north of Cyprus, who became refugees following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]], settled down in Limassol. During the 1990s several Cypriot [[Romani people]] (considered Turkish Cypriots according to the constitution) returned from the North of the island to the Turkish quarter of Limassol. Armenians remained in Limassol and continued residence in surroundings of [[Sourp Kevork]] Armenian Apostolic Church and maintain an elementary school named Nareg (\u0546\u0561\u0580\u0565\u056f \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u056a\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576). There is also an Armenian village in Limassol District named [[Armenochori, Cyprus|Armenochori]] ({{lang-gr|\u0391\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9}}).\n\nThe rise of the population [[birth rate]] during the late 19th and 20th centuries (1878\u20131960) was 70%. The number of inhabitants was 6,131 in 1881, while in 1960 the number had risen to 43,593. The number of the Greek population was estimated at 37,478, while the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] population at 6,115.\n\nLimassol is home to a large community of [[Pontic Greeks]], who settled in Cyprus after the collapse of Soviet Union.\n\nIn recent years, the city has also become increasingly popular with Russian or other post-Soviet nationals and expatriates. Today, some 17% of the population of Limassol are Russian-speaking, and 8% of the population are Russian citizens.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/cystat/statistics.nsf/populationcondition_22main_gr/populationcondition_22main_gr?OpenForm&sub=2&sel=2 |script-title=el:\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u2013 \u03a0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039a\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u2013 \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03a0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u2013 \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 |language=el |publisher=Mof.gov.cy |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Cyprus - Limassol castle 10.JPG|thumb|Limassol castle]]\n[[File:Limassol, Cyprus 2.jpg|thumb|View from the coastal front.]]\n[[File:Limassol Castle Square 6.JPG|thumb|The medieval (Crusader) castle.]]\n\n* The [[Limassol Castle|medieval castle]] is one of the [[List of castles in Cyprus|ten castles of Cyprus]]. It was built by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] around 1000 AD. Around the same period, a chapel was also built there. [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] is supposed to have married his fianc\u00e9e Princess [[Berengaria of Navarre]] on this site after her ship was grounded nearby in 1191 as she accompanied him to the [[Third Crusade]], on his way to [[Holy Land]]. The Castle was used as a prison between 1790 and 1940 and it now serves as a medieval museum. The collection that the museum provides covers the era of 400 \u2013 1870 AD. A visitor can see numerous exhibits: cannons, [[wood carving]]s of the 17th and 18th century, paintings and tombstones, statues, suits of armour, coins, terracotta, metalware and pottery, glass and marble articrafts.\n* The Archaeological Museum provides a very interesting collection of antiquities found in the district of Limassol, dating from the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]] to the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]]. Some of the archaeological discoveries are: Stone axes of the Neolithic and [[Chalcolithic]] period, potteries and objects of the ancient cities of Curium and Amathus, as well as Roman terracottas, gold jewellery, coins, sculptures, columns, vases, earrings, rings, necklaces, marble statues etc.\n* The [[Folk art|Folk Art]] Museum is based in a preserved old house which contains a collection of Cypriot Folk Art of the last two centuries. Objects in the collection include: national costumes, tapestry, embroidery, wooden chests, waistcoats, men's jackets, necklaces, a variety of light clothes, town costumes, country tools etc. The museum was established in 1985. More than 500 exhibits are housed in its six rooms. The museum was awarded the [[Europa Nostra]] prize in 1989. Here, the visitor can study Cypriot culture through the hand-made exhibits.\n* Public Garden is situated on the coastal road. It provides a great variety of vegetation: eucalyptus trees, [[pine|pine trees]] and cypresses. Inside the garden, there is a small zoo. There, the visitor can see deer, [[mouflon|moufflon]]s, [[ostrich]]es, [[pheasant]]s, tigers, lions, monkeys, [[vulture]]s, pelicans and other animals and different kinds of birds. Not far from the zoo there is the small [[natural history museum]] and the garden theatre that is reconstructed to host international groups.\n* A series of public sculptures commissioned by the Limassol Municipality, can be found on the reclamation (now Twin Cities park), spanning {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} of seafront [[land reclamation|reclaimed land]].

Limassol's historical centre is located around its medieval [[Limassol Castle]] and the Old Port. Today the city spreads along the [[Mediterranean]] coast and has extended much farther than the castle and port, with its suburbs stretching along the coast to Amathus. To the west of the city, is the Akrotiri Area of the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].\n\n===Ancient===\n[[File:Amathus31.JPG|thumb|Ancient Amathus]]\n[[File:Episkopi 01-2017 img03 Kourion.jpg|thumb|[[Kourion]] Greco-Roman theatre.]]\nThe city of Limassol is situated between the ancient cities of [[Amathus]] and [[Kourion|Kourion (Curium)]]. Limassol was probably built after Amathus had been ruined. However, the town of Limassol has been inhabited since very [[ancient history|ancient times]]. Graves found there date back to 2000 BC and others date back to the 8th and 4th centuries BC. These few remains show that a small colonisation must have existed which did not manage to develop and flourish. Ancient writers mention nothing about the foundation of the town.\nIn 85 BC,  Armenian emperor [[Tigranes the Great]] ({{Lang-hy|\u054f\u056b\u0563\u0580\u0561\u0576 \u0544\u0565\u056e}} ''Tigran Mets''; {{lang-el|\u03a4\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2}} ''Tigr\u00e1nes ho M\u00e9gas'') had reached Limassol in order to establish security and protection of local Greek allies against Rome in a result followed by his conquest of Syria, Lebanon and Anatolia.\n[[File:Tigranes four Kings.jpg|thumb|Tigranes the Great and the Four Kings]]\n\nAccording to the [[Council of Chalcedon]] which took place in 451, the local bishop as well as the bishops of Amathus and Arsinoe were involved in the foundation of the city, which would be known by the names of Theodosiana and Neapolis.<ref>''The acts of the Council of Chalcedon'' by Council of Chalcedon, Richard Price, Michael Gaddis 2006 {{ISBN|0-85323-039-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6IUaOOT1G3UC&pg=PA94&dq=Chalcedon+catholic+anglican+eastern&hl=en&ei=ql_gTMj_Lon5sgafnez6Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref> Bishop [[Leontios of Neapolis]] was an important church writer in the 7th century. The records of the 7th Synod (757) refer to it as the bishop\u2019s see.

The king of England, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], was travelling to the [[Holy Land]] in 1190.<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/history/17.htm |title=Cyprus History: Cyprus under Richard I \u2013 cypnet.co.uk |first=|last=Cypnet.co.uk |work=cypnet.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> His fianc\u00e9e [[Berengaria of Navarre|Berengaria]] and his sister [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan, Queen of Sicily]], were also travelling on a different ship. Because of a storm, the ship with the queens arrived in Limassol.<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\"/> [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], the renegade Byzantine Greek governor of Cyprus invited the queens ashore, with the intention of holding them to ransom, but they refused. So he refused them fresh water and they had to put out to sea again or yield to capture. When Richard arrived in Limassol and met Isaac Komnenos, he asked him to contribute to the crusade for the liberation of [[Holy Land|the Holy Land]].<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\"/> While at the beginning Isaac had accepted, he later on refused to give any help. Richard then chased him and finally arrested him; the entire island was therefore taken over by the [[Anglo-Normans]], bringing the long Byzantine dominion of Cyprus to an end.<ref>Wolff and Hazard, pp. 63\u201364</ref> Richard celebrated his marriage with Berengaria who had received the crown as queen of England in Cyprus. Richard destroyed Amathus and the inhabitants were transferred to Limassol.<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\"/>\n\nA year later, in AD 1191 Cyprus was sold for the sum of 100,000 [[bezant]]s to the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], rich monks and soldiers whose aim was the protection of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"CyprusHistory\"/> The knights enforced high taxes, in order to get back the money that had been given for the purchase of Cyprus. This led to the revolt of the Cypriots, who wished to get rid of the bond of the promise. Richard accepted their request and a new purchaser was found: [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy de Lusignan]], a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] from [[Poitou]]. Cyprus was therefore handed over to the French dynasty of the house of [[Lusignan]], thus establishing the medieval [[Kingdom of Cyprus]].\n\nFor a period of about three centuries 1175\u20131489, Limassol enjoyed remarkable prosperity. Cyprus was characterised by its great number of Latin bishops. This lasted until the occupation of Cyprus by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in AD 1570. Latin battalions which established monasteries were settled down there. The settlement of merchants in Cyprus and particularly in Limassol in the 13th century led to the financial welfare of its inhabitants. Its harbour as a centre of transportation and commerce, contributed greatly to the financial and [[Sociocultural evolution|cultural development]].\n\n===Venetian rule===\nCyprus was sold in 1489 to [[Venice]] by the Cypriot Queen [[Catherine Cornaro]].<ref name=\"ChurchillDavenport1900\">{{cite book|last1=Churchill|first1=Lady Randolph Spencer|last2=Davenport|first2=Cyril James Humphries|title=The Anglo-Saxon Review|url=https://archive.org/details/anglosaxonrevie08churgoog|accessdate=13 March 2013|year=1900|publisher=John Lane|pages=[https://archive.org/details/anglosaxonrevie08churgoog/page/n261 215]\u201322}}</ref> The [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] did not have Cyprus' best interest at heart, they were only interested in receiving the taxes and in exploiting the country\u2019s resources.

The church played an important role in the education of Greeks during the years 1754\u20131821. During those years new schools were set up in all the towns. Greek intellectuals used to teach [[History of Greece|Greek history]], Turkish and French. The following schools operated in the town of Limassol:\n* The Greek School which was established in 1819.\n* The first public school which was established in 1841.\n* The Girls\u2019 School which was established in 1861.\n\n===British Colonial administration===\n[[File:Limassol Old Town 19.JPG|thumb|160px|Limassol old town with British colonial architecture]]\n[[File:Tonneaux de vin sur le port de Limassol.jpg|thumb|left|Barrels of wine in Limassol port in 1930s]]\nThe [[British Empire|British]] took over in Cyprus in 1878.

The roads were cleaned, the animals were removed from the centre, roads were fixed, trees were planted and docks were constructed for the loading and unloading of those ships that were anchored off-shore. Lanterns for the lighting of the central areas were also installed in the 1880. In 1912, electricity replaced the old lanterns.<ref name=\"Daedalus\"/>\n\nFrom the very first years of the British occupation, a [[post office]], a telegraph office and a hospital began to operate.<ref name= Daedalus/> In 1880 the first [[printing press]] started working. It was in this printing press that the newspapers ''Alithia'' and ''Anagennisis'' were published in 1897. The newspaper ''Salpinx'' was published at the same time.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the very first hotels began to operate. Among these were Europe and Amathus.\n\nThese changes that the British brought about contributed to the development of an intellectual and artistic life.\nSchools, theatres, clubs, [[art museum|art galleries]], [[music hall]]s, sport societies, [[football team|football clubs]] etc. were all set up and meant a great deal to the cultural life of Limassol.\n\n==Politics and government==\n[[File:EPP Summit Limassol Jan. 2013 (8389039511).jpg|thumb|[[European People's Party]] summit in Limassol in 2013]]\n[[File:Angela Merkel (9307209906).jpg |thumb|left|[[Angela Merkel]] and [[Nicos Anastasiades]] attending the EPP summit in Limassol in 2013]]\nThe first [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups in Cyprus formed in Limassol in the early 1920s; in 1926, the [[Communist party]] of Cyprus was formed in the city.

During this season there are a few days when the daytime highs might not exceed {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and the night time lows might be as low as {{convert|2|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} but usually the temperature ranges from {{convert|16|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in the day and from {{convert|7|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in the night. Rain tends to be heavy this time of the year and thunderstorms occur often though they usually do not last for a long time. \n\nSnow in Limassol is a very rare occurrence and usually falls mixed with rain every 7\u201313 years. In recent years, snow mixed with rain fell in February 2004, in January 2008 and in February 2012. In spring \u2013 March the weather is mild to warm and pleasant. It is sunny almost every day and the temperatures are around {{convert|19|-|20|C|F}} in the day and {{convert|9|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in the night. Rain showers and thunderstorms are common especially in late March and April. Sometimes during the spring dust comes from the [[Sahara]] desert which affects badly the visibility of the city. Summer for Limassol is the longest season of the year, and lasts about six months; it begins in May and ends in October. At this time of the year the weather is sunny every day and rain is rare. The temperatures range between {{convert|19|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in June and September and {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|40|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in July and August. In June sea mist can sometimes occur usually resolves early in the mornings. Autumn is warm and usually sunny. It begins in the end of November and in December. During this period of the year expect temperatures from as low as {{convert|12|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and as high as {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThis season the weather differs from year to year and it can be very wet with violent thunderstorms sometimes (October 2009; rainfall of around {{convert|90|mm|1|abbr=on}}) or very dry (October 2007; rainfall of 2-5mm). Finally Limassol receives around {{convert|410|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain each year but this varies from year to year and sometimes droughts do occur (every 3\u20135 years). The rainy season 2009\u20132010 was a wet one with precipitation being as high as {{convert|515|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some areas whilst the rainy season of 2007\u20132008 was dry with only {{convert|300|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain.

Limassol has many beaches, suitable for sunbathing and swimming. A bathing beach with all the necessary facilities, provided by the [[Cyprus Tourism Organisation]] (CTO), is operating in the town of Limassol, in Dasoudi area.\n\nThe [[Port of Limassol]] became the major sea [[port]] of the Republic of Cyprus in 1974. Before 1974, that role had been filled by [[Famagusta]], which is now located in Northern Cyprus, and is not recognised as a legal port by any country except Turkey.\n\nLimassol is the base for many of the island's [[wine]] companies, serving the wine-growing regions on the southern slopes of the [[Troodos Mountains]] including [[Commandaria]]. Companies include [[KEO (beer)|KEO]], LOEL, SODAP and ETKO. Wines and cognacs (brandies) that are produced by the grapes here have won several awards in international exhibitions.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} There is a considerable consumption of wine products in Cyprus by the locals and the foreign visitors. Big quantities are exported to Europe.\n\nThe town of Limassol is the biggest industrial centre of the province. There are about 350 [[industrial park|industrial units]] with 90 industry wares. These industries concern dressmaking, furniture, shoes, drinks, food, prints, metal industry, electric devices, plastic wares as well as many other different industries.\n\nLimassol is an important trade centre of Cyprus. This is due to the presence of the [[Sovereign Base Areas|UK sovereign base]] at Episkopi and [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Akrotiri]], and to the displacement of the population in Limassol after the Turkish invasion in 1974. The trade markets are gathered in the centre of the town and in the tourist area along the coast that begins from the old harbour and ends in Amathus area. Most of the hotels, restaurants, confectioneries, discos and places of entertainment in general, are to be found in this area.\n\nLimassol has two ports, commonly referred to as the \"old port\" and the \"new port\". The new port has the greatest commercial and passenger flow of traffic and it is the biggest port in the Republic of Cyprus. The old harbour has a breakwater {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and it is only able to receive three small ships at a time. It is thus normally used by fishing boats. The new harbour is {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=off}} deep and has break-waters that are {{convert|1,300|m|ft|abbr=off}} long. It is able to receive about ten ships depending on their size.\nExports of grapes, wines, carobs, [[citrus|citrus fruits]] and imports of cereals, vehicles, machines, textiles, agricultural medicines, fertilizers, iron etc. are exported and imported through these ports.\n\nLimassol is today the largest [[ship management]] service centre in Europe{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} with more than 60 ship management companies located in the city, as due to the Cyprus Shipping tax system (a choice between corporation tax or a [[tonnage tax]] system) it makes it very attractive for [[crew management]] companies and ship management companies to have their main offices in Limassol. These ship management companies employ more than 40,000 seafarers.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In fact, the Cyprus registry today is ranked as the tenth among international fleets.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nA marina located to the west of Limassol Castle, between the old and new ports, has been built. This new development allows berthing of ocean-going yachts and was opened to public in 2014, having hosted its first yachts in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Limassol Marina open to the public|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/06/10/limassol-marina-open-to-the-public/|newspaper=Cyprus Mail|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref> The marina has a capacity of 1,000 vessels.\n\nDuring the last years,{{when|date=September 2016}} Limassol has experienced a construction boom fuelled by the tourist sector as well as from increasing foreign investments in the city. Public projects like the redesigning of the city's {{convert|1|km|mi|spell=in|adj=mid|abbr=off}} promenade, are improving the quality of life of the people and the image of the city as a cosmopolitan destination. Infrastructure improvements partly funded by European programmes have helped solve traffic problems that the city faced with the construction of new highway flyovers and roundabouts.\n\nThe [[Port of Limassol]] is one of the busiest ports in the Mediterranean transit trade and the largest port in Cyprus. It has also become one of the most important [[tourism]], trade, and service-providing centres in the area. Limassol is home to the [[Cyprus University of Technology]], one of the best young universities in the entire Europe. A number of [[museum]]s and [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[Archaeological site|site]]s are available to visitors. Limassol attracts a wide range of tourists mostly during an extended summer season to be accommodated in a wide range of hotels and apartments. A large marina lies near the [[old town]], {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=off}} from the Limassol medieval castle.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Armenians in Cyprus|Russians in Cyprus}}\n[[File:Limassol - Agia Napa 2 Innenraum.jpg|thumb|Ayia Napa Church]]\nInternal migration since the 1960s and influx of [[displaced person]]s after 1974 significantly increased the population of Limassol and its suburbs. Greater Limassol today includes the municipality of Limassol (includes the suburb of Agia Fyla) and the municipalities of Polemidia, Mesa Geitonia, [[Ayios Athanasios, Cyprus|Agios Athanasios]], Germasogeia and [[Ypsonas]].\n\nLimassol traditionally had a mixed population of [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]], [[Turkish Cypriots]] and [[Armenians in Cyprus|Armenian Cypriots]]. The majority of Turkish Cypriots moved to the north in 1974. Accordingly, many [[Greek Cypriots]] from the north of Cyprus, who became refugees following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]], settled down in Limassol. During the 1990s several Cypriot [[Romani people]] (considered Turkish Cypriots according to the constitution) returned from the North of the island to the Turkish quarter of Limassol. Armenians remained in Limassol and continued residence in surroundings of [[Sourp Kevork]] Armenian Apostolic Church and maintain an elementary school named Nareg (\u0546\u0561\u0580\u0565\u056f \u0540\u0561\u0575\u056f\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u054e\u0561\u0580\u056a\u0561\u0580\u0561\u0576). There is also an Armenian village in Limassol District named [[Armenochori, Cyprus|Armenochori]] ({{lang-gr|\u0391\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9}}).\n\nThe rise of the population [[birth rate]] during the late 19th and 20th centuries (1878\u20131960) was 70%. The number of inhabitants was 6,131 in 1881, while in 1960 the number had risen to 43,593. The number of the Greek population was estimated at 37,478, while the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] population at 6,115.\n\nLimassol is home to a large community of [[Pontic Greeks]], who settled in Cyprus after the collapse of Soviet Union.\n\nIn recent years, the city has also become increasingly popular with Russian or other post-Soviet nationals and expatriates. Today, some 17% of the population of Limassol are Russian-speaking, and 8% of the population are Russian citizens.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/cystat/statistics.nsf/populationcondition_22main_gr/populationcondition_22main_gr?OpenForm&sub=2&sel=2 |script-title=el:\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u2013 \u03a0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039a\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b8\u03ae\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u2013 \u0391\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03a0\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u2013 \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03a3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 |language=el |publisher=Mof.gov.cy |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Cyprus - Limassol castle 10.JPG|thumb|Limassol castle]]\n[[File:Limassol, Cyprus 2.jpg|thumb|View from the coastal front.]]\n[[File:Limassol Castle Square 6.JPG|thumb|The medieval (Crusader) castle.]]\n\n* The [[Limassol Castle|medieval castle]] is one of the [[List of castles in Cyprus|ten castles of Cyprus]]. It was built by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] around 1000 AD. Around the same period, a chapel was also built there. [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] is supposed to have married his fianc\u00e9e Princess [[Berengaria of Navarre]] on this site after her ship was grounded nearby in 1191 as she accompanied him to the [[Third Crusade]], on his way to [[Holy Land]]. The Castle was used as a prison between 1790 and 1940 and it now serves as a medieval museum. The collection that the museum provides covers the era of 400 \u2013 1870 AD. A visitor can see numerous exhibits: cannons, [[wood carving]]s of the 17th and 18th century, paintings and tombstones, statues, suits of armour, coins, terracotta, metalware and pottery, glass and marble articrafts.\n* The Archaeological Museum provides a very interesting collection of antiquities found in the district of Limassol, dating from the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]] to the [[Roman Empire|Roman period]]. Some of the archaeological discoveries are: Stone axes of the Neolithic and [[Chalcolithic]] period, potteries and objects of the ancient cities of Curium and Amathus, as well as Roman terracottas, gold jewellery, coins, sculptures, columns, vases, earrings, rings, necklaces, marble statues etc.\n* The [[Folk art|Folk Art]] Museum is based in a preserved old house which contains a collection of Cypriot Folk Art of the last two centuries. Objects in the collection include: national costumes, tapestry, embroidery, wooden chests, waistcoats, men\u2019s jackets, necklaces, a variety of light clothes, town costumes, country tools etc. The museum was established in 1985. More than 500 exhibits are housed in its six rooms. The museum was awarded the [[Europa Nostra]] prize in 1989. Here, the visitor can study Cypriot culture through the hand-made exhibits.\n* Public Garden is situated on the coastal road. It provides a great variety of vegetation: eucalyptus trees, [[pine|pine trees]] and cypresses. Inside the garden, there is a small zoo. There, the visitor can see deer, [[mouflon|moufflon]]s, [[ostrich]]es, [[pheasant]]s, tigers, lions, monkeys, [[vulture]]s, pelicans and other animals and different kinds of birds. Not far from the zoo there is the small [[natural history museum]] and the garden theatre that is reconstructed to host international groups.\n* A series of public sculptures commissioned by the Limassol Municipality, can be found on the reclamation (now Twin Cities park), spanning {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} of seafront [[land reclamation|reclaimed land]].

It is the principal city of and is included in the [[Lima, Ohio metropolitan statistical area]], which is included in the [[Lima\u2013Van Wert\u2013Wapakoneta, OH, combined statistical area]]. Lima was founded in 1831.\n\nThe [[Lima Army Tank Plant]], built in 1941, is the sole producer of the [[M1 Abrams]].\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Shawnee and establishment===\nIn the years after the [[American Revolution]], the [[Shawnee]] were the most prominent residents of west central Ohio, growing in numbers and permanency after the 1794 [[Treaty of Greenville]]. By 1817, the United States had created the [[Ottawa River (Auglaize River)|Hog Creek]] Reservation for the local Shawnee, covering portions of what would become [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen]] and [[Auglaize County, Ohio|Auglaize counties]], and including part of present-day Lima.<ref name=\"Henry\">\n{{cite book\n | last      = Harvey\n | first     = Henry\n | title     = History of the Shawnee Indians: From the Year 1681 to 1854, Inclusive\n | publisher = Cincinnati: Ephraim Morgan & Sons\n | date      = 1855\n | chapter   = Chapter XXVII - Treaty with Cass and McArthur in 1817, by which the Shawnee receive land at Wapaughkonneta - Names of the Shawnee, heads of Families\n | page      = [https://archive.org/details/historyshawneei00henrgoog/page/n171 165]\n | url       = https://archive.org/details/historyshawneei00henrgoog\n}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the Shawnee reservation freed other lands in the area for settlement, and in February 1820, the Ohio legislature formally established Allen County. In 1831 the Shawnee were forced to surrender all their land in the area to the United States and relocated to [[Kansas]], opening all of Allen County to settlement. The Ohio legislature mandated that a [[county seat]] be established and \"Lima\" was the result.\n\nThe name \"Lima\" was reputedly chosen in a nod to the [[Lima|Peruvian capital]] which, during the 1800s, was a major source of [[quinine]], an anti-[[malaria]] drug for which there had been a demand in the region, an area known as the [[Great Black Swamp]].<ref>[http://www.webcore.me/lima-ohios-origin-the-great-black-swamp-malaria-and-quinine/ Lima Ohio\u2019s Origin, The Great Black Swamp, Malaria and Quinine, by John C. Monahan | Nov 12, 2013]</ref>\n\n===Leadership and growth===\n[[File:Allen County Courthouse, Lima, southeastern angle.jpg|thumb|[[Allen County Courthouse (Ohio)|Allen County Courthouse]]]]\nSince 1831, Lima has been the center of government for Allen County, the first of its three courthouses erected in the city's first year. The foundations of city life followed in quick order. The first school appeared in 1832. Lima's first surgeon, Doctor William McHenry arrived in 1834. 1836 brought the first newspaper to Lima. Lima was officially organized as a city in 1842. Henry DeVilliers Williams was its first mayor. The first public school opened in 1850. In 1854, the first train appeared in Lima, a harbinger of later economic success.\n\nAlso in 1854, a [[cholera]] outbreak in [[Delphos, Ohio|Delphos]] (a town in Allen County northwest of Lima) spread throughout west central Ohio. Countywide problems caused by the contaminated water supply were not solved until 1886 when Lima started a [[municipal water system]]. Lima's role as a regional center for industry began early. The Lima Agricultural Works began operations in 1869. The company changed names and types of manufacturing through the years. In 1882, under the name Lima Machine Works, the industry built the first [[Shay locomotive|Shay-geared locomotive]].\n\nStimulated by the economic boom in nearby [[Findlay, Ohio|Findlay]], in 1885 Lima businessman Benjamin C. Faurot drilled for natural gas at his [[paper mill]]. On May 19, oil was discovered instead of gas. The oil well never realized enormous profits, but it triggered Lima's oil industry, bringing [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]] to the city. Lima's oil field was, for about a decade, the largest in the US.\n\nEconomic development brought money for arts and entertainment. Benjamin Faurot's Opera House opened in 1882, a nationally renowned structure so impressive that New Yorkers used it as a model for their own theaters. In 1907, Lima built its first movie theater.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Benjamin A. Gramm and his close friend Max Bernstein formed the [[Gramm-Bernstein Company]], which became a pioneer in the motor truck industry. During World War I, Gramm created the \"[[Liberty truck]]\", which was welcomed upon its arrival in Washington, D.C., by President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Thousands were sent to Europe to help the Allied war effort.\n\n===The Roaring Twenties===\nAfter World War I, Allen County's population growth lagged the state and the nation. Galvin was an assistant superintendent at the Peru Steel Casting Co. of Peru, Ind. He then became acting manager at American Steel Foundries in Pittsburgh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://the419.com/john-e-galvin-limas-man-steel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205052248/http://the419.com/john-e-galvin-limas-man-steel/ |archivedate=2015-02-05 }} John E. Galvin: Lima\u2019s own Man of Steel</ref> In 1921, Lima voters approved a change in the structure of Lima city government. Voters now elected five [[commissioners]], with the commission chair serving as mayor. The charter sought to establish professional management, requiring the commissioners to hire a [[city manager]], who reported to the mayor. Lima proved itself to be very much in the Progressive tradition with these changes, after flirting with radicalism in 1912 when the voters elected a Socialist mayor.\n\nThe darker side of the progressive era revealed itself in the prominence of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the city. It was a center for the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], a notoriously violent subset of the Klan. On August 1, 1923, a KKK parade in Lima drew a crowd estimated at 100,000 people.\n\nEconomically, the 1920s were a time of industrial expansion in Lima. In 1925, [[Lima Locomotive Works|Lima Locomotive Works, Inc.]] built the \"Lima A-1\", a 2-8-4 model that became the prototype for the modern steam locomotive. The Locomotive Works also created a new division, the Ohio Power Shovel Company. In 1927, local industrialist John E. Galvin helped found [[Superior Coach Company]]. It became the world's largest producer of school buses and funeral coaches within two decades. In 1930, eight railroad companies served Lima.\n\n===Great Depression===\nAllen County's population grew significantly faster than the state during the [[Great Depression]]. In 1933, Lima again reorganized its government. The citizens adopted a \"strong mayor\" model to replace the city manager of the 1920s. Despite the hardships of the decade, Lima residents supported the construction of a hospital to serve the area. Lima Memorial Hospital, named in honor of World War I veterans, opened on [[Memorial Day]], 1933.\n\nThe Lima area was not safe from the increased crime rate of the 1930s. In 1933, gangster [[John Dillinger]] was in the Allen County Jail, arrested for robbing the Citizens National Bank in nearby [[Bluffton, Ohio|Bluffton]]. Dillinger's cohorts broke him out of jail, killing Allen County Sheriff Jess Sarber in the process. The murder and jailbreak put Dillinger at the top of the [[FBI's ten most wanted list]]. His was not the only crime outfit to plague Lima during the decade. In 1936, the notorious Brady Gang robbed a local jewelry store twice.\n\nThe Great Depression slowed the pace of industrial expansion. In 1930, a Lima directory listed 93 industrial employers with some 8,000 employees. By 1934, industrial employment was reduced by half. In 1935, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] located a Small Motor Division in Lima to build fractional horsepower electric motors. The Ohio Steel Foundry turned the corner and grew, eventually expanding its successes in its industry. The thirties were a decade for organizing labor in Lima. By 1940 there were at least fifty labor unions representing local workers.\n\n===World War II===\nLima benefited from increased production during World War II and a growing population, but suffered a significant economic decline at the end of the decade when industry retooled for peacetime production. In May 1941, based in the steel foundry, construction began on [[Lima Army Tank Plant]] to manufacture centrifugally cast gun tubes. In November 1942, United Motors Services took over operation of the plant to process vehicles under government contract. The plant prepared many vehicles for Europe, including the [[M5 light tank]] and the [[M26 Pershing|T-26 Pershing tank]]. At its peak during the war, the Lima Tank Depot (now the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, operated by [[General Dynamics]]), employed over 5,000 people.\n\n===Post-war boom===\nThe area's expanding population in the 1940s and 1950s brought hospital and school expansion. St Rita's Hospital, founded in 1918, opened a seven-story addition in 1948. With voter support, school leadership built six new elementary schools and the new centralized [[Lima Senior High School]] during the 1950s. Lima's industrial production grew in the decade. During the [[Korean War]], the Lima Tank Depot resumed manufacturing, at a level expanded from World War II standards.\n\n===Civil rights===\nDuring the 1960s, Lima experienced both growth and community unrest. In 1962, a new Allen County Airport was built in [[Perry Township, Allen County, Ohio|Perry Township]]. With the passage of the city [[income tax]] in 1966, Lima constructed a new facility for the Lima Police Department. Also during the 1960s, The [[Ohio State University]] established a regional campus in Lima.\n\nCivil rights issues had rocked Lima in the 1950s, perhaps most prominently in the efforts to [[desegregation|desegregate]] the city's only public swimming pool in Schoonover Park. Civil unrest continued in the 1960s and into the 1970s.\n\n===Rust belt decline===\nIn January 1969, a [[crude oil]] line in south Lima ruptured, causing {{convert|77000|gal|litre}} of oil to escape into the city's sewer system. Explosions and fire erupted from sewers as 7,000 residents were evacuated. Governor [[Jim Rhodes]] ordered the [[Ohio National Guard]] into the area to maintain order. In August 1970, further conflict erupted when a black woman was killed by police as she tried to prevent the arrest of a juvenile. Several officers were wounded in the violence that followed. Mayor Christian P. Morris declared a [[state of emergency]] and the National Guard was again called in to aid local police.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, a number of industries left Lima, part of the \"[[Rust Belt]]\" decline affecting all of Ohio. In April 1971, the last \"Cincinnatian,\"  of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] stopped in Lima.  The Cincinnatian was an iconic lightweight [[streamliner]] serving the B&O's Detroit line from Cincinnati.  Lima had also been served by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s \"Broadway Limited,\" a high speed New York to Chicago service, the \"Capital Limited\" Chicago to Washington D.C. service, via Pittsburgh, the [[Nickel Plate Road]]'s \"Blue Arrow,\" and \"Blue Dart,\" which provided high speed service to Buffalo, Cleveland and St. Louis, and the [[Erie Lackawanna]]'s \"Lake Cities,\" which provided service to New York, Cleveland, and Chicago with direct service both ways.  Many of these services were maintained by [[Amtrak]] until 1991, when the former Erie Lackawanna and Pennsylvania Railroad mainlines between New York and Chicago were downgraded.\n\nIn 1973, Lima's District [[Tuberculosis]] Center, which served five counties, closed its doors. [[Superior Coach Company]], once the nation's largest producer of buses, closed in 1981, as did Clark Equipment.  Airfoil Textron closed in 1985, and Sundstrand (formerly Westinghouse) followed ten years later. By the mid-1990s, Lima had lost more than 8,000 jobs. Lima's population dropped from 52,000 in the 1970s to 45,000 in 1999. Lima's plight and its subsequent efforts to re-define itself were captured in the [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Lost in Middle America]].''\n\n==Oil history==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Faurot Oil Well.jpg|thumb|Ohio [[historical marker]] outlining Lima's oil history with Faurot]]\nWith the discovery of oil in Lima in 1885, Ohio began what came to be called the \"Oil Boom of Northwest Ohio.\" Discovery actually began in [[Findlay, Ohio]], a city forty miles north of Lima. The discovery of natural gas deposits there in 1884 led to national marketing efforts advertising free gas, as Findlay's business leaders tried to \"boom\" the town. In 1885, Benjamin C. Faurot of Lima was one of hundreds of businessmen who visited Findlay to see the seemingly unlimited supply of natural gas burning day and night. Faurot owned the Lima Paper Mill. He spent $2,500 on energy consumption annually. Water for his operation was also a problem. So Faurot decided to drill in Lima \u2013 for gas or water. Faurot's first oil, found along the Ottawa River on May 19, 1885, was more accidental discovery than deliberate scientific experiment.\n\nDuring the first week, the well produced more than {{convert|200|oilbbl|m3}} of oil. Faurot quickly organized local businessmen into a syndicate that would purchase oil leases from farm owners. The company was called the Trenton Rock Oil Company, and by 1886, had 250 wells from Lima to [[St. Marys, Ohio]], and west to [[Indiana]].\n\nWhen the news broke that northwest Ohio had oil, [[Standard Oil]] of Cleveland decided to build a [[oil refinery|refinery]] in Lima. Unlike [[Pennsylvania]]'s oil, northwest Ohio's \"sour crude\" was high in [[sulfur]] content, smelling like rotten eggs, and customers shunned it. Lima's new Solar Refinery was charged with solving the sulfur problem. Until then, Standard bought and stored as much northwest Ohio crude as was possible to maintain their monopoly. It dropped the price of crude from more than sixty cents a barrel to forty cents in an attempt to discourage further production.\n\nOil drilling fever hit northwest Ohio and \"boom towns\" sprang up overnight. Additional crude glutted the market, and trying to slow production, Standard Oil lowered its price to fifteen cents a barrel. This decision had little effect on the large producers elsewhere, but the smaller Lima producers, whose oil wells could not keep up, found themselves severely hampered. Fourteen independent Lima producers formed a combine \u2013 the Ohio Oil Company. Eventually, it became [[Marathon Oil]], still located in Findlay, Ohio.\n\nLima's Solar Refinery General Manager John Van Dyke and Herman Frasch, Standard's chemist, solved the distillation problem for sour crude by devising a method for removing the sulfur. The gamble that [[John D. Rockefeller]] took building pipelines and storage tanks for Ohio's sour crude paid off. By 1901, the excitement about Ohio oil slowed with the news of a [[Beaumont, Texas]], gusher producing {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.\n\nIn 1911, the courts declared Standard Oil Trust a monopoly and broke it into several companies. Between 1887 and 1905, the Lima Oil Field was a world-class producer, yielding {{convert|300|Moilbbl|m3}}. Lima was also a pipeline center. Within three years of the discovery of oil, a trunk line reached Chicago. Lima oil lit the buildings of the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 World's Fair]]. Production peaked in 1904, and then dropped off rapidly. By 1910, the field was regarded as virtually played out. Still, the Lima Refinery has survived, continuing to operate for more than 125 years under a succession of owners\u2014Solar Refining Company (1886), a subsidiary of [[Standard Oil]] until the breakup in 1911, [[SOHIO]] (1931), [[British Petroleum]] (1987), Clark USA (1998), [[Premcor]] (2000), [[Valero Energy Corporation]] (2005), and most recently [[Husky Energy]] (2007).<ref>{{cite web |title=Husky Energy to Buy Valero's Refinery in Ohio |url=http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2007/05/02/husky-energy-to-buy-valeros-refinery-in-ohio |date=2 May 2007 |first=Dina |last=O'Meara |work=Hard Assets |agency=Canadian Press |accessdate=24 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324201911/http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2007/05/02/husky-energy-to-buy-valeros-refinery-in-ohio |archive-date=2014-03-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Railroads and locomotives==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\nFor most of its history, smokestack industries and a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] [[work ethic]] defined Lima. Nothing played a bigger part in shaping the city's self-image than its connection to railroads and railroading \u2013 as a Midwestern rail hub and even more as home to the [[Lima Locomotive Works]], whose products for more than 70 years carried the city's name globally.\n\nThe first [[locomotive]] appeared in [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen County]] in 1854, brought in from [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] as freight on the [[Miami and Erie Canal]]. Named the Lima, the engine was used on construction of the county's first railroad, the [[Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway|Ohio and Indiana]]. East-west passenger service to Lima began in 1856, when the Ohio & Indiana consolidated with the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago. North-south passenger service began in 1858 on the Dayton & Michigan Railroad. [[Machine shop]]s for the Dayton & Michigan were built in Lima by 1860, and for the [[Lake Erie and Western Railroad]] by 1880. By the early years of the 20th century, the railroad shops employed 1,000 people in Lima.\n\nIn 1906, an average of 143 trains and 7,436 cars, carrying 223,080&nbsp;tons of freight, passed through Lima every 24 hours. In addition, 49 steam and 28 electric trains landed passengers in Lima daily. Lima service on the electric interurban Ohio Western Railway began in 1902 and Lima became the hub of an interurban network that reached [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Cincinnati]] as well as [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. In 1920, Lima was served by five steam railroads and Allen County by eight, in addition to five electric interurban lines.\n\nFor years, Lima was a crossroads for famous passenger trains including the [[Nickel Plate Road]]'s ''Clover Leaf'' ''Commercial Traveler'' and the [[Erie Railroad]]'s ''[[Erie Limited]]'' and ''[[Lake Cities (train)|Lake Cities]].'' The Erie Railroad had its own train station. The other train companies used the [[Lima station (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Pennsylvania station]]. [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] train such as the ''Admiral,'' ''General,'' and ''Manhattan Limited'' made stops in Lima's Pennsylvania station.<ref>Pennsylvania Railroad timetable, August 1950, Tables 8, 9 http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/PRR50TT.pdf</ref> \n\nRailroads began to cut back passenger service to Lima during the [[Great Depression]]. Electric interurban service ceased in 1937. After a brief boom for railroads during World War II, passenger service declined sharply in the 1950s. The Nickel Plate Road ended scheduled passenger service to Lima in 1959. The formerly elite ''[[Broadway Limited]]'' began making stops in 1968 after the [[New York Central]] and the Pennsylvania railroad merged to form the [[Penn Central]]. The [[Erie-Lackawanna]] ran its last train into Lima in 1970 and the [[Baltimore & Ohio]] and the [[Penn Central]] their last in 1971. Freight still moves over most of the historic rail routes in and out of the city, but the last passenger train to stop in Lima was the ''Broadway Limited'', then operated by [[Amtrak]], on November 11, 1990.\n\nCurrently, there are only a handful of railroads that serve Lima. The Chicago, Fort Wayne, and Eastern and the Indiana and Ohio railroad are owned by [[Genesee & Wyoming]] and are in the north and east parts of town. [[CSX Transportation]] runs through town frequently and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] has one train each day to Lima. The [[R.J. Corman]] Railroad/Western Ohio Line runs southwest from town on former [[Erie-Lackawanna]] trackage.\n\n===Lima Locomotive Works===\n{{Main|Lima Locomotive Works}}\n\nThe [[Lima Locomotive Works]] \u2013 \"the Loco,\" as it was commonly called in Lima \u2013 had its beginnings in 1869 when John Carnes and four partners bought a machine shop that was called the Lima Agricultural Works. The company initially manufactured and repaired agricultural equipment, then moved into the production of steam power equipment and [[sawmill]] machinery. The shop designed its first narrow-gauge steam locomotive in 1878. The same year, the shop first worked on a geared locomotive designed by [[Michigan]] lumberman [[Ephraim Shay]]. The [[Shay locomotive]] was built for steep grades, heavy loads and tight turns. In 1881, Shay granted the Lima works an exclusive license to manufacture his locomotives. By 1882, locomotives were the company's main product. In time, the Lima Locomotive Works \u2013 a name formally adopted in 1916 \u2013 would produce 2,761 Shay locomotives, which were sent to 48 states and 24 foreign countries. As of 2005, some were in use 100 years after they were shipped.\n\nBy 1910, the company was moving aggressively into direct-drive locomotives for general railroad use. A new \"super power\" design, introduced in 1925, enabled Lima to capture 20% of the national market for locomotives. The \"super power\" locomotive was created by mechanical engineer William E. Woodard. Designed to make more efficient use of [[steam]] at high speed, it became, in the words of railroad historian Eric Hirsimaki, \"one of the most influential locomotives in the history of steam power.\" Later years saw the introduction of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] 2-6-6-6, one of the largest locomotives ever built, and the glamorous [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] \"Daylights,\" designed to complement the Pacific Coast scenery.\n\nThe locomotive works dabbled in other product lines. It produced railroad cars in the early years and acquired the Ohio Power Shovel Company in 1928. During World War II, the plant produced 1,655 [[Sherman tank]]s. Employment grew from 150 in the 1890s to 1,100 in 1912 and 2,000 in 1915, peaking at 4,300 in 1944. Over the course of its history, the Locomotive Works was a microcosm of the community, a place where each successive wave of newcomers took its place in turn. First the Germans and Italians, later African-Americans and ultimately women joining the work force during World War II. Labor organizing efforts were under way at the plant at least by the 1890s.\n\nPost-war mergers attempting to keep the plant operating created the Lima-Hamilton Corporation in 1947 and later [[Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton]] in 1950. The last [[steam locomotive]] built at the plant, Nickel Plate No. 779, was delivered May 13, 1949. It is now on display in Lima's Lincoln Park. The final diesel locomotive, built by Lima-Hamilton, was delivered in 1951. After the end of locomotive production, the plant continued to produce cranes and road building equipment. The plant was sold to Clark Equipment in 1971. Clark employed 1,500 as late as 1974, but the plant closed permanently in 1981. As of 2006, the Lima Locomotive Works plant has been razed.\n\n==Roads==\nLima is at the intersection of Ohio [[State Route 309 (Ohio)|State Route 309]] (the original [[Lincoln Highway]]) and state routes 65, 81 and 117. [[Interstate 75 (Ohio)|Interstate 75]], which replaced [[U.S. Route 25 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 25]], one of the routes of the [[Dixie Highway]] passes on the eastern perimeter of Lima.

Locals sometimes refer to the river as \"Hawg Creek\". This resembles a traditional local name used dating back to the Hog Creek [[Shawnee]] community that existed between Lima and present Ada, prior to the [[Indian Removal|Shawnee removal]] of 1831. This removal made possible the official founding of \"Lima\" as a formal town in that year.\n\n===Surrounding communities===\n{{Geographic Location\n|Center = Lima\n|North = [[American Township, Allen County, Ohio|American Township]] and [[Bath Township, Allen County, Ohio|Bath Township]]\n|Northeast = [[Bath Township, Allen County, Ohio|Bath Township]]\n|East = [[Bath Township, Allen County, Ohio|Bath Township]] and [[Perry Township, Allen County, Ohio|Perry Township]]\n|Southeast = [[Perry Township, Allen County, Ohio|Perry Township]]\n|South = [[Shawnee Township, Allen County, Ohio|Shawnee Township]] and [[Perry Township, Allen County, Ohio|Perry Township]]\n|Southwest = [[Shawnee Township, Allen County, Ohio|Shawnee Township]]\n|West = [[Shawnee Township, Allen County, Ohio|Shawnee Township]] and [[American Township, Allen County, Ohio|American Township]]\n|Northwest = [[American Township, Allen County, Ohio|American Township]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\n\nLima's climate is largely reflective of the variable climate of Ohio. The region's climate can best be described as a [[humid continental climate]], according to the Koppen Climate Maps. The city lies roughly halfway between [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Dayton]], Ohio and weather is at a similar medium. Summers are hot and humid and winters are generally cool to cold, with moderate precipitation year-round. Due to the city's inland location the moderating effects of [[Lake Erie]] are diminished, causing the city to experience higher averages in the summer and colder plunges in the winter than Toledo. On average the city sees around 4 more inches of snow annually than Dayton. During the summer months, Lima is prone to smog and allergens lingering when heat indexes exceed 85&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location=Lima, Ohio ([[Lima Ohio'l]]), 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1897\u2013present\n|single line=Yes\n|Jan high F = 34.6\n|Feb high F = 39.3\n|Mar high F = 49.5\n|Apr high F = 60.6\n|May high F = 70.7\n|Jun high F = 80.4\n|Jul high F = 84.6\n|Aug high F = 84.1\n|Sep high F = 76.7\n|Oct high F = 65.5\n|Nov high F = 50.9\n|Dec high F = 37.5\n|Jan low F = 17.4\n|Feb low F = 20.3\n|Mar low F = 28.7\n|Apr low F = 38.9\n|May low F = 49.2\n|Jun low F = 59.3\n|Jul low F = 62.7\n|Aug low F = 60.8\n|Sep low F = 52.6\n|Oct low F = 41.8\n|Nov low F = 32.9\n|Dec low F = 22.1\n|year low F = 40.6\n\n|source 1=NOAA (relative humidity and sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=iwx\n| title = NowData - NOAA Online Weather Data\n| publisher =[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = June 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=NOAAtxt>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/USW00014827.normals.txt\n| title = IN FT Wayne INTL AP\n| publisher =[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = June 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=NOAAsun>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_IV/US/GROUP3/72533.TXT\n| title = WMO Climate Normals for Fort Wayne/Municipal, IN 1961\u20131990\n| publisher =[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = June 6, 2015}}</ref> \n|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 757\n|1860= 1989\n|1870= 4500\n|1880= 7567\n|1890= 15981\n|1900= 21723\n|1910= 30508\n|1920= 41326\n|1930= 42287\n|1940= 44711\n|1950= 50246\n|1960= 51037\n|1970= 53734\n|1980= 47827\n|1990= 45549\n|2000= 40081\n|2010= 38771\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=36862\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe percentage of college graduates is 9.5%, according to the US Census Bureau.<ref name=\"2000_census\">[http://censtats.census.gov/data/OH/1603943554.pdf U.S. Census Bureau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911193949/http://censtats.census.gov/data/OH/1603943554.pdf |date=2008-09-11 }} General Demographic Profile of Lima (pdf format)</ref> The city has the highest crime rate for a city its size (20\u201360,000) in Ohio and also the 9th highest per capita in 2006, according to the FBI.<ref name=\"FBI_crim_statistics\">[https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/documents/06tbl08oh.xls ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023175251/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/documents/06tbl08oh.xls |date=October 23, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 38,771 people, 14,221 households, and 8,319 families residing in the city.

The Ottawa Valley Hospital, which opened in 1909 as the District [[Tuberculosis]] Hospital, was one of the first in the state dedicated to the treatment of tubercular patients. The hospital treated patients from seven to 90 years old, at a time when tuberculosis was nearly always fatal. The average stay was three to five years. As treatment improved, the hospital closed, though the building was used until 1973.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe facility originally known as the Lima State Hospital for the Criminally Insane was situated on {{convert|628|acre|km2}} three miles (5&nbsp;km) north of downtown Lima. The hospital was constructed between 1908 and 1915. Built at a cost of $2.1&nbsp;million, it was the largest poured-concrete structure in the country until supplanted by the Pentagon.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} Patients sometimes staged dramatic protests against the conditions of their confinement, and frequently escaped (more than 300 escapes by 1978). Conditions improved significantly after 1974 as a result of a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of the patients. In a landmark ruling, US District Judge Nicholas J. Walinski spelled out detailed requirements for assuring each patient's rights to \"dignity, privacy and human care.\" In its last years, the state hospital was used for the filming of a made-for-television movie about the [[Attica Prison riots]] in New York.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} Starting in 1982, Lima State Hospital became a medium-security prison, the Lima Correctional Institution. The prison closed in 2004, though a smaller prison on the site, the Allen Correctional Institution, remains.\n\n==Historic architecture==\nAmong the city's most distinctive residential neighborhoods, the \"Golden Block\" on the west side, was almost entirely demolished in the 1960s; only the MacDonell House, part of the [[Allen County Museum]], and the YWCA survived.<ref>Hopkins, Phyllis G.

It is the principal city of and is included in the [[Lima, Ohio metropolitan statistical area]], which is included in the [[Lima\u2013Van Wert\u2013Wapakoneta, OH, combined statistical area]]. Lima was founded in 1831.\n\nThe [[Lima Army Tank Plant]], built in 1941, is the sole producer of the [[M1 Abrams]].\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Shawnee and establishment===\nIn the years after the [[American Revolution]], the [[Shawnee]] were the most prominent residents of west central Ohio, growing in numbers and permanency after the 1794 [[Treaty of Greenville]]. By 1817, the United States had created the [[Ottawa River (Auglaize River)|Hog Creek]] Reservation for the local Shawnee, covering portions of what would become [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen]] and [[Auglaize County, Ohio|Auglaize counties]], and including part of present-day Lima.<ref name=\"Henry\">\n{{cite book\n | last      = Harvey\n | first     = Henry\n | title     = History of the Shawnee Indians: From the Year 1681 to 1854, Inclusive\n | publisher = Cincinnati: Ephraim Morgan & Sons\n | date      = 1855\n | chapter   = Chapter XXVII - Treaty with Cass and McArthur in 1817, by which the Shawnee receive land at Wapaughkonneta - Names of the Shawnee, heads of Families\n | page      = [https://archive.org/details/historyshawneei00henrgoog/page/n171 165]\n | url       = https://archive.org/details/historyshawneei00henrgoog\n}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the Shawnee reservation freed other lands in the area for settlement, and in February 1820, the Ohio legislature formally established Allen County. In 1831 the Shawnee were forced to surrender all their land in the area to the United States and relocated to [[Kansas]], opening all of Allen County to settlement. The Ohio legislature mandated that a [[county seat]] be established and \"Lima\" was the result.\n\nThe name \"Lima\" was reputedly chosen in a nod to the [[Lima|Peruvian capital]] which, during the 1800s, was a major source of [[quinine]], an anti-[[malaria]] drug for which there had been a demand in the region, an area known as the [[Great Black Swamp]].<ref>[http://www.webcore.me/lima-ohios-origin-the-great-black-swamp-malaria-and-quinine/ Lima Ohio\u2019s Origin, The Great Black Swamp, Malaria and Quinine, by John C. Monahan | Nov 12, 2013]</ref>\n\n===Leadership and growth===\n[[File:Allen County Courthouse, Lima, southeastern angle.jpg|thumb|[[Allen County Courthouse (Ohio)|Allen County Courthouse]]]]\nSince 1831, Lima has been the center of government for Allen County, the first of its three courthouses erected in the city's first year. The foundations of city life followed in quick order. The first school appeared in 1832. Lima's first surgeon, Doctor William McHenry arrived in 1834. 1836 brought the first newspaper to Lima. Lima was officially organized as a city in 1842. Henry DeVilliers Williams was its first mayor. The first public school opened in 1850. In 1854, the first train appeared in Lima, a harbinger of later economic success.\n\nAlso in 1854, a [[cholera]] outbreak in [[Delphos, Ohio|Delphos]] (a town in Allen County northwest of Lima) spread throughout west central Ohio. Countywide problems caused by the contaminated water supply were not solved until 1886 when Lima started a [[municipal water system]]. Lima's role as a regional center for industry began early. The Lima Agricultural Works began operations in 1869. The company changed names and types of manufacturing through the years. In 1882, under the name Lima Machine Works, the industry built the first [[Shay locomotive|Shay-geared locomotive]].\n\nStimulated by the economic boom in nearby [[Findlay, Ohio|Findlay]], in 1885 Lima businessman Benjamin C. Faurot drilled for natural gas at his [[paper mill]]. On May 19, oil was discovered instead of gas. The oil well never realized enormous profits, but it triggered Lima's oil industry, bringing [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]] to the city. Lima's oil field was, for about a decade, the largest in the US.\n\nEconomic development brought money for arts and entertainment. Benjamin Faurot's Opera House opened in 1882, a nationally renowned structure so impressive that New Yorkers used it as a model for their own theaters. In 1907, Lima built its first movie theater.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Benjamin A. Gramm and his close friend Max Bernstein formed the [[Gramm-Bernstein Company]], which became a pioneer in the motor truck industry. During World War I, Gramm created the \"[[Liberty truck]]\", which was welcomed upon its arrival in Washington, D.C., by President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Thousands were sent to Europe to help the Allied war effort.\n\n===The Roaring Twenties===\nAfter World War I, Allen County's population growth lagged the state and the nation. Galvin was an assistant superintendent at the Peru Steel Casting Co. of Peru, Ind. He then became acting manager at American Steel Foundries in Pittsburgh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://the419.com/john-e-galvin-limas-man-steel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205052248/http://the419.com/john-e-galvin-limas-man-steel/ |archivedate=2015-02-05 }} John E. Galvin: Lima\u2019s own Man of Steel</ref> In 1921, Lima voters approved a change in the structure of Lima city government. Voters now elected five [[commissioners]], with the commission chair serving as mayor. The charter sought to establish professional management, requiring the commissioners to hire a [[city manager]], who reported to the mayor. Lima proved itself to be very much in the Progressive tradition with these changes, after flirting with radicalism in 1912 when the voters elected a Socialist mayor.\n\nThe darker side of the progressive era revealed itself in the prominence of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the city. It was a center for the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], a notoriously violent subset of the Klan. On August 1, 1923, a KKK parade in Lima drew a crowd estimated at 100,000 people.\n\nEconomically, the 1920s were a time of industrial expansion in Lima. In 1925, [[Lima Locomotive Works|Lima Locomotive Works, Inc.]] built the \"Lima A-1\", a 2-8-4 model that became the prototype for the modern steam locomotive. The Locomotive Works also created a new division, the Ohio Power Shovel Company. In 1927, local industrialist John E. Galvin helped found [[Superior Coach Company]]. It became the world's largest producer of school buses and funeral coaches within two decades. In 1930, eight railroad companies served Lima.\n\n===Great Depression===\nAllen County's population grew significantly faster than the state during the [[Great Depression]]. In 1933, Lima again reorganized its government. The citizens adopted a \"strong mayor\" model to replace the city manager of the 1920s. Despite the hardships of the decade, Lima residents supported the construction of a hospital to serve the area. Lima Memorial Hospital, named in honor of World War I veterans, opened on [[Memorial Day]], 1933.\n\nThe Lima area was not safe from the increased crime rate of the 1930s. In 1933, gangster [[John Dillinger]] was in the Allen County Jail, arrested for robbing the Citizens National Bank in nearby [[Bluffton, Ohio|Bluffton]]. Dillinger's cohorts broke him out of jail, killing Allen County Sheriff Jess Sarber in the process. The murder and jailbreak put Dillinger at the top of the [[FBI's ten most wanted list]]. His was not the only crime outfit to plague Lima during the decade. In 1936, the notorious Brady Gang robbed a local jewelry store twice.\n\nThe Great Depression slowed the pace of industrial expansion. In 1930, a Lima directory listed 93 industrial employers with some 8,000 employees. By 1934, industrial employment was reduced by half. In 1935, [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] located a Small Motor Division in Lima to build fractional horsepower electric motors. The Ohio Steel Foundry turned the corner and grew, eventually expanding its successes in its industry. The thirties were a decade for organizing labor in Lima. By 1940 there were at least fifty labor unions representing local workers.\n\n===World War II===\nLima benefited from increased production during World War II and a growing population, but suffered a significant economic decline at the end of the decade when industry retooled for peacetime production. In May 1941, based in the steel foundry, construction began on [[Lima Army Tank Plant]] to manufacture centrifugally cast gun tubes. In November 1942, United Motors Services took over operation of the plant to process vehicles under government contract. The plant prepared many vehicles for Europe, including the [[M5 light tank]] and the [[M26 Pershing|T-26 Pershing tank]]. At its peak during the war, the Lima Tank Depot (now the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, operated by [[General Dynamics]]), employed over 5,000 people.\n\n===Post-war boom===\nThe area's expanding population in the 1940s and 1950s brought hospital and school expansion. St Rita's Hospital, founded in 1918, opened a seven-story addition in 1948. With voter support, school leadership built six new elementary schools and the new centralized [[Lima Senior High School]] during the 1950s. Lima's industrial production grew in the decade. During the [[Korean War]], the Lima Tank Depot resumed manufacturing, at a level expanded from World War II standards.\n\n===Civil rights===\nDuring the 1960s, Lima experienced both growth and community unrest. In 1962, a new Allen County Airport was built in [[Perry Township, Allen County, Ohio|Perry Township]]. With the passage of the city [[income tax]] in 1966, Lima constructed a new facility for the Lima Police Department. Also during the 1960s, The [[Ohio State University]] established a regional campus in Lima.\n\nCivil rights issues had rocked Lima in the 1950s, perhaps most prominently in the efforts to [[desegregation|desegregate]] the city's only public swimming pool in Schoonover Park. Civil unrest continued in the 1960s and into the 1970s.\n\n===Rust belt decline===\nIn January 1969, a [[crude oil]] line in south Lima ruptured, causing {{convert|77000|gal|litre}} of oil to escape into the city's sewer system. Explosions and fire erupted from sewers as 7,000 residents were evacuated. Governor [[Jim Rhodes]] ordered the [[Ohio National Guard]] into the area to maintain order. In August 1970, further conflict erupted when a black woman was killed by police as she tried to prevent the arrest of a juvenile. Several officers were wounded in the violence that followed. Mayor Christian P. Morris declared a [[state of emergency]] and the National Guard was again called in to aid local police.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, a number of industries left Lima, part of the \"[[Rust Belt]]\" decline affecting all of Ohio. In April 1971, the last \"Cincinnatian,\"  of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] stopped in Lima.  The Cincinnatian was an iconic lightweight [[streamliner]] serving the B&O's Detroit line from Cincinnati.  Lima had also been served by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]'s \"Broadway Limited,\" a high speed New York to Chicago service, the \"Capital Limited\" Chicago to Washington D.C. service, via Pittsburgh, the [[Nickel Plate Road]]'s \"Blue Arrow,\" and \"Blue Dart,\" which provided high speed service to Buffalo, Cleveland and St. Louis, and the [[Erie Lackawanna]]'s \"Lake Cities,\" which provided service to New York, Cleveland, and Chicago with direct service both ways.  Many of these services were maintained by [[Amtrak]] until 1991, when the former Erie Lackawanna and Pennsylvania Railroad mainlines between New York and Chicago were downgraded.\n\nIn 1973, Lima's District [[Tuberculosis]] Center, which served five counties, closed its doors. [[Superior Coach Company]], once the nation's largest producer of buses, closed in 1981, as did Clark Equipment.  Airfoil Textron closed in 1985, and Sundstrand (formerly Westinghouse) followed ten years later. By the mid-1990s, Lima had lost more than 8,000 jobs. Lima's population dropped from 52,000 in the 1970s to 45,000 in 1999. Lima's plight and its subsequent efforts to re-define itself were captured in the [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Lost in Middle America]].''\n\n==Oil history==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Faurot Oil Well.jpg|thumb|Ohio [[historical marker]] outlining Lima's oil history with Faurot]]\nWith the discovery of oil in Lima in 1885, Ohio began what came to be called the \"Oil Boom of Northwest Ohio.\" Discovery actually began in [[Findlay, Ohio]], a city forty miles north of Lima. The discovery of natural gas deposits there in 1884 led to national marketing efforts advertising free gas, as Findlay's business leaders tried to \"boom\" the town. In 1885, Benjamin C. Faurot of Lima was one of hundreds of businessmen who visited Findlay to see the seemingly unlimited supply of natural gas burning day and night. Faurot owned the Lima Paper Mill. He spent $2,500 on energy consumption annually. Water for his operation was also a problem. So Faurot decided to drill in Lima \u2013 for gas or water. Faurot's first oil, found along the Ottawa River on May 19, 1885, was more accidental discovery than deliberate scientific experiment.\n\nDuring the first week, the well produced more than {{convert|200|oilbbl|m3}} of oil. Faurot quickly organized local businessmen into a syndicate that would purchase oil leases from farm owners. The company was called the Trenton Rock Oil Company, and by 1886, had 250 wells from Lima to [[St. Marys, Ohio]], and west to [[Indiana]].\n\nWhen the news broke that northwest Ohio had oil, [[Standard Oil]] of Cleveland decided to build a [[oil refinery|refinery]] in Lima. Unlike [[Pennsylvania]]'s oil, northwest Ohio's \"sour crude\" was high in [[sulfur]] content, smelling like rotten eggs, and customers shunned it. Lima's new Solar Refinery was charged with solving the sulfur problem. Until then, Standard bought and stored as much northwest Ohio crude as was possible to maintain their monopoly. It dropped the price of crude from more than sixty cents a barrel to forty cents in an attempt to discourage further production.\n\nOil drilling fever hit northwest Ohio and \"boom towns\" sprang up overnight. Additional crude glutted the market, and trying to slow production, Standard Oil lowered its price to fifteen cents a barrel. This decision had little effect on the large producers elsewhere, but the smaller Lima producers, whose oil wells could not keep up, found themselves severely hampered. Fourteen independent Lima producers formed a combine \u2013 the Ohio Oil Company. Eventually, it became [[Marathon Oil]], still located in Findlay, Ohio.\n\nLima's Solar Refinery General Manager John Van Dyke and Herman Frasch, Standard's chemist, solved the distillation problem for sour crude by devising a method for removing the sulfur. The gamble that [[John D. Rockefeller]] took building pipelines and storage tanks for Ohio's sour crude paid off. By 1901, the excitement about Ohio oil slowed with the news of a [[Beaumont, Texas]], gusher producing {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.\n\nIn 1911, the courts declared Standard Oil Trust a monopoly and broke it into several companies. Between 1887 and 1905, the Lima Oil Field was a world-class producer, yielding {{convert|300|Moilbbl|m3}}. Lima was also a pipeline center. Within three years of the discovery of oil, a trunk line reached Chicago. Lima oil lit the buildings of the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 World's Fair]]. Production peaked in 1904, and then dropped off rapidly. By 1910, the field was regarded as virtually played out. Still, the Lima Refinery has survived, continuing to operate for more than 125 years under a succession of owners\u2014Solar Refining Company (1886), a subsidiary of [[Standard Oil]] until the breakup in 1911, [[SOHIO]] (1931), [[British Petroleum]] (1987), Clark USA (1998), [[Premcor]] (2000), [[Valero Energy Corporation]] (2005), and most recently [[Husky Energy]] (2007).<ref>{{cite web |title=Husky Energy to Buy Valero's Refinery in Ohio |url=http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2007/05/02/husky-energy-to-buy-valeros-refinery-in-ohio |date=2 May 2007 |first=Dina |last=O'Meara |work=Hard Assets |agency=Canadian Press |accessdate=24 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324201911/http://www.resourceinvestor.com/2007/05/02/husky-energy-to-buy-valeros-refinery-in-ohio |archive-date=2014-03-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Railroads and locomotives==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}\nFor most of its history, smokestack industries and a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] [[work ethic]] defined Lima. Nothing played a bigger part in shaping the city's self-image than its connection to railroads and railroading \u2013 as a Midwestern rail hub and even more as home to the [[Lima Locomotive Works]], whose products for more than 70 years carried the city's name globally.\n\nThe first [[locomotive]] appeared in [[Allen County, Ohio|Allen County]] in 1854, brought in from [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] as freight on the [[Miami and Erie Canal]]. Named the Lima, the engine was used on construction of the county's first railroad, the [[Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway|Ohio and Indiana]]. East-west passenger service to Lima began in 1856, when the Ohio & Indiana consolidated with the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago. North-south passenger service began in 1858 on the Dayton & Michigan Railroad. [[Machine shop]]s for the Dayton & Michigan were built in Lima by 1860, and for the [[Lake Erie and Western Railroad]] by 1880. By the early years of the 20th century, the railroad shops employed 1,000 people in Lima.\n\nIn 1906, an average of 143 trains and 7,436 cars, carrying 223,080&nbsp;tons of freight, passed through Lima every 24 hours. In addition, 49 steam and 28 electric trains landed passengers in Lima daily. Lima service on the electric interurban Ohio Western Railway began in 1902 and Lima became the hub of an interurban network that reached [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Cincinnati]] as well as [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. In 1920, Lima was served by five steam railroads and Allen County by eight, in addition to five electric interurban lines.\n\nFor years, Lima was a crossroads for famous passenger trains including the [[Nickel Plate Road]]'s ''Clover Leaf'' ''Commercial Traveler'' and the [[Erie Railroad]]'s ''[[Erie Limited]]'' and ''[[Lake Cities (train)|Lake Cities]].'' The Erie Railroad had its own train station. The other train companies used the [[Lima station (Pennsylvania Railroad)|Pennsylvania station]]. [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] train such as the ''Admiral,'' ''General,'' and ''Manhattan Limited'' made stops in Lima's Pennsylvania station.<ref>Pennsylvania Railroad timetable, August 1950, Tables 8, 9 http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/PRR50TT.pdf</ref> \n\nRailroads began to cut back passenger service to Lima during the [[Great Depression]]. Electric interurban service ceased in 1937. After a brief boom for railroads during World War II, passenger service declined sharply in the 1950s. The Nickel Plate Road ended scheduled passenger service to Lima in 1959. The formerly elite ''[[Broadway Limited]]'' began making stops in 1968 after the [[New York Central]] and the Pennsylvania railroad merged to form the [[Penn Central]]. The [[Erie-Lackawanna]] ran its last train into Lima in 1970 and the [[Baltimore & Ohio]] and the [[Penn Central]] their last in 1971. Freight still moves over most of the historic rail routes in and out of the city, but the last passenger train to stop in Lima was the ''Broadway Limited'', then operated by [[Amtrak]], on November 11, 1990.\n\nCurrently, there are only a handful of railroads that serve Lima. The Chicago, Fort Wayne, and Eastern and the Indiana and Ohio railroad are owned by [[Genesee & Wyoming]] and are in the north and east parts of town. [[CSX Transportation]] runs through town frequently and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] has one train each day to Lima. The [[R.J. Corman]] Railroad/Western Ohio Line runs southwest from town on former [[Erie-Lackawanna]] trackage.\n\n===Lima Locomotive Works===\n{{Main|Lima Locomotive Works}}\n\nThe [[Lima Locomotive Works]] \u2013 \"the Loco,\" as it was commonly called in Lima \u2013 had its beginnings in 1869 when John Carnes and four partners bought a machine shop that was called the Lima Agricultural Works. The company initially manufactured and repaired agricultural equipment, then moved into the production of steam power equipment and [[sawmill]] machinery. The shop designed its first narrow-gauge steam locomotive in 1878. The same year, the shop first worked on a geared locomotive designed by [[Michigan]] lumberman [[Ephraim Shay]]. The [[Shay locomotive]] was built for steep grades, heavy loads and tight turns. In 1881, Shay granted the Lima works an exclusive license to manufacture his locomotives. By 1882, locomotives were the company's main product. In time, the Lima Locomotive Works \u2013 a name formally adopted in 1916 \u2013 would produce 2,761 Shay locomotives, which were sent to 48 states and 24 foreign countries. As of 2005, some were in use 100 years after they were shipped.\n\nBy 1910, the company was moving aggressively into direct-drive locomotives for general railroad use. A new \"super power\" design, introduced in 1925, enabled Lima to capture 20% of the national market for locomotives. The \"super power\" locomotive was created by mechanical engineer William E. Woodard. Designed to make more efficient use of [[steam]] at high speed, it became, in the words of railroad historian Eric Hirsimaki, \"one of the most influential locomotives in the history of steam power.\" Later years saw the introduction of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] 2-6-6-6, one of the largest locomotives ever built, and the glamorous [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] \"Daylights,\" designed to complement the Pacific Coast scenery.\n\nThe locomotive works dabbled in other product lines. It produced railroad cars in the early years and acquired the Ohio Power Shovel Company in 1928. During World War II, the plant produced 1,655 [[Sherman tank]]s. Employment grew from 150 in the 1890s to 1,100 in 1912 and 2,000 in 1915, peaking at 4,300 in 1944. Over the course of its history, the Locomotive Works was a microcosm of the community, a place where each successive wave of newcomers took its place in turn. First the Germans and Italians, later African-Americans and ultimately women joining the work force during World War II. Labor organizing efforts were under way at the plant at least by the 1890s.\n\nPost-war mergers attempting to keep the plant operating created the Lima-Hamilton Corporation in 1947 and later [[Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton]] in 1950. The last [[steam locomotive]] built at the plant, Nickel Plate No. 779, was delivered May 13, 1949. It is now on display in Lima's Lincoln Park. The final diesel locomotive, built by Lima-Hamilton, was delivered in 1951. After the end of locomotive production, the plant continued to produce cranes and road building equipment. The plant was sold to Clark Equipment in 1971. Clark employed 1,500 as late as 1974, but the plant closed permanently in 1981. As of 2006, the Lima Locomotive Works plant has been razed.\n\n==Roads==\nLima is at the intersection of Ohio [[State Route 309 (Ohio)|State Route 309]] (the original [[Lincoln Highway]]) and state routes 65, 81 and 117. [[Interstate 75 (Ohio)|Interstate 75]], which replaced [[U.S. Route 25 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 25]], one of the routes of the [[Dixie Highway]] passes on the eastern perimeter of Lima. [[U.S. Route 30]] passes east-west a few miles north of Lima.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lima Ohio September 2018.jpg|thumb|left|Air photo of Lima, September 2018]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|13.80|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|13.57|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.23|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2013-01-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Ottawa River (Auglaize River)|Ottawa River]] flows through the city. Locals sometimes refer to the river as \"Hawg Creek\". This resembles a traditional local name used dating back to the Hog Creek [[Shawnee]] community that existed between Lima and present Ada, prior to the [[Indian Removal|Shawnee removal]] of 1831. This removal made possible the official founding of \"Lima\" as a formal town in that year.\n\n===Surrounding communities===\n{{Geographic Location\n|Center = Lima\n|North = [[American Township, Allen County, Ohio|American Township]] and [[Bath Township, Allen County, Ohio|Bath Township]]\n|Northeast = [[Bath Township, Allen County, Ohio|Bath Township]]\n|East = [[Bath Township, Allen County, Ohio|Bath Township]] and [[Perry Township, Allen County, Ohio|Perry Township]]\n|Southeast = [[Perry Township, Allen County, Ohio|Perry Township]]\n|South = [[Shawnee Township, Allen County, Ohio|Shawnee Township]] and [[Perry Township, Allen County, Ohio|Perry Township]]\n|Southwest = [[Shawnee Township, Allen County, Ohio|Shawnee Township]]\n|West = [[Shawnee Township, Allen County, Ohio|Shawnee Township]] and [[American Township, Allen County, Ohio|American Township]]\n|Northwest = [[American Township, Allen County, Ohio|American Township]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\n\nLima's climate is largely reflective of the variable climate of Ohio. The region's climate can best be described as a [[humid continental climate]], according to the Koppen Climate Maps. The city lies roughly halfway between [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Dayton]], Ohio and weather is at a similar medium. Summers are hot and humid and winters are generally cool to cold, with moderate precipitation year-round. Due to the city's inland location the moderating effects of [[Lake Erie]] are diminished, causing the city to experience higher averages in the summer and colder plunges in the winter than Toledo. On average the city sees around 4 more inches of snow annually than Dayton. During the summer months, Lima is prone to smog and allergens lingering when heat indexes exceed 85&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location=Lima, Ohio ([[Lima Ohio'l]]), 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1897\u2013present\n|single line=Yes\n|Jan high F = 34.6\n|Feb high F = 39.3\n|Mar high F = 49.5\n|Apr high F = 60.6\n|May high F = 70.7\n|Jun high F = 80.4\n|Jul high F = 84.6\n|Aug high F = 84.1\n|Sep high F = 76.7\n|Oct high F = 65.5\n|Nov high F = 50.9\n|Dec high F = 37.5\n|Jan low F = 17.4\n|Feb low F = 20.3\n|Mar low F = 28.7\n|Apr low F = 38.9\n|May low F = 49.2\n|Jun low F = 59.3\n|Jul low F = 62.7\n|Aug low F = 60.8\n|Sep low F = 52.6\n|Oct low F = 41.8\n|Nov low F = 32.9\n|Dec low F = 22.1\n|year low F = 40.6\n\n|source 1=NOAA (relative humidity and sun 1961\u20131990)<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=iwx\n| title = NowData - NOAA Online Weather Data\n| publisher =[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = June 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=NOAAtxt>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/USW00014827.normals.txt\n| title = IN FT Wayne INTL AP\n| publisher =[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = June 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name=NOAAsun>{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_IV/US/GROUP3/72533.TXT\n| title = WMO Climate Normals for Fort Wayne/Municipal, IN 1961\u20131990\n| publisher =[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = June 6, 2015}}</ref> \n|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1850= 757\n|1860= 1989\n|1870= 4500\n|1880= 7567\n|1890= 15981\n|1900= 21723\n|1910= 30508\n|1920= 41326\n|1930= 42287\n|1940= 44711\n|1950= 50246\n|1960= 51037\n|1970= 53734\n|1980= 47827\n|1990= 45549\n|2000= 40081\n|2010= 38771\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=36862\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Ohio|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p37_ch02.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Ohio: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-37.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe percentage of college graduates is 9.5%, according to the US Census Bureau.<ref name=\"2000_census\">[http://censtats.census.gov/data/OH/1603943554.pdf U.S. Census Bureau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911193949/http://censtats.census.gov/data/OH/1603943554.pdf |date=2008-09-11 }} General Demographic Profile of Lima (pdf format)</ref> The city has the highest crime rate for a city its size (20\u201360,000) in Ohio and also the 9th highest per capita in 2006, according to the FBI.<ref name=\"FBI_crim_statistics\">[https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/documents/06tbl08oh.xls ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023175251/https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/documents/06tbl08oh.xls |date=October 23, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> of 2010, there were 38,771 people, 14,221 households, and 8,319 families residing in the city.

Currently, the city's two hospitals serve a 10-county area of northwest and west central Ohio. [[St. Rita's Medical Center]], a level 2 trauma center, with nearly 4,000 employees as of June 2006, is Allen County's largest employer while [[Lima Memorial Health System]] ranks third. In 2005, St. Rita's embarked on a $130&nbsp;million expansion expected to create up to 500 more jobs, this new addition is known as \"The Medical Center of the Future\". In 2018 St. Rita\u2019s name was changed to \u201cMercy Health St. Rita\u2019s Medical Center,\u201d After the company \u201cMercy Health\u201d who had owned St. Rita\u2019s for awhile now. This name change brought new signs and uniforms to the hospital. Almost immediately after the name change \u201cMercy Health\u201d was acquired by another company by the name of Bon Secours. This merge has brought no changes to the hospital though. \n\n[[File:Mercy Health education expansion.jpg|thumb|Planned education expansion]]\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church [[Sisters of Mercy]] opened St. Rita's in December 1918, in the midst of a national (and global) [[1918 influenza epidemic|influenza epidemic]]. The hospital saw major expansions 1945 and 1967. The hospital has also created satellite facilities in the surrounding towns of [[Ottawa, Ohio|Ottawa]], [[Delphos, Ohio|Delphos]] and [[Wapakoneta, Ohio|Wapakoneta]]. SRMC also houses a separate hospital with the walls of the main facility. This \"interior\" facility, \"Triumph\", was implemented to serve poverty-level citizens who are unable to afford continuing care otherwise. In July 2008, St. Rita's Medical Center purchased Lima Allen County Paramedics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://limaohio.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?avis=LI&date=20100505&category=news&lopenr=305059980&Ref=AR |title=Lima Allen County Paramedics opens new home |date=23 August 2013 |work=LimaOhio.com |accessdate=24 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324214353/http://limaohio.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?avis=LI&date=20100505&category=news&lopenr=305059980&Ref=AR |archivedate=24 March 2014 }}</ref> \n\nLima Memorial Health System, formerly Lima Memorial Hospital, a level 2 trauma center, can trace its roots to 1899, when it began as Lima City Hospital. Formed by the Pastors Union of Lima, the 13-bed facility was the first community hospital in northwest Ohio. During the [[Great Depression]], the city of Lima helped to finance a larger hospital, which opened on [[Memorial Day]] 1933 on the city's east side. The region's first open-heart surgery was performed at Lima Memorial on April 22, 1997. In 1999 LMHS entered into a joint venture with Blanchard Valley Health Association (\"BVHA\") and [[ProMedica Health System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limamemorial.org/AVP/Web_pages/?id=2|title=Lima Memorial Hospital history|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010043943/http://www.limamemorial.org/AVP/Web_pages/?id=2|archivedate=2006-10-10}}</ref>\n\nFor decades, Lima also had two other hospitals with different missions. The Ottawa Valley Hospital, which opened in 1909 as the District [[Tuberculosis]] Hospital, was one of the first in the state dedicated to the treatment of tubercular patients. The hospital treated patients from seven to 90 years old, at a time when tuberculosis was nearly always fatal. The average stay was three to five years. As treatment improved, the hospital closed, though the building was used until 1973.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe facility originally known as the Lima State Hospital for the Criminally Insane was situated on {{convert|628|acre|km2}} three miles (5&nbsp;km) north of downtown Lima. The hospital was constructed between 1908 and 1915. Built at a cost of $2.1&nbsp;million, it was the largest poured-concrete structure in the country until supplanted by the Pentagon.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} Patients sometimes staged dramatic protests against the conditions of their confinement, and frequently escaped (more than 300 escapes by 1978). Conditions improved significantly after 1974 as a result of a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of the patients. In a landmark ruling, US District Judge Nicholas J. Walinski spelled out detailed requirements for assuring each patient's rights to \"dignity, privacy and human care.\" In its last years, the state hospital was used for the filming of a made-for-television movie about the [[Attica Prison riots]] in New York.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} Starting in 1982, Lima State Hospital became a medium-security prison, the Lima Correctional Institution. The prison closed in 2004, though a smaller prison on the site, the Allen Correctional Institution, remains.\n\n==Historic architecture==\nAmong the city's most distinctive residential neighborhoods, the \"Golden Block\" on the west side, was almost entirely demolished in the 1960s; only the MacDonell House, part of the [[Allen County Museum]], and the YWCA survived.<ref>Hopkins, Phyllis G.
