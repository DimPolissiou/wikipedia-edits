The parkway is a major [[commuter]] route into [[New York City]] from [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] counties in New York and [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] in New Jersey. The southern terminus of the route is at the [[George Washington Bridge]] in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], where it connects to [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|Interstate&nbsp;95]] (I-95),  [[Route 4 (New Jersey)|Route&nbsp;4]] and [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]]. Its northern terminus is at a [[traffic circle]] in [[Fort Montgomery, New York]], where the PIP meets [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]] and [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]] at the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. At exit&nbsp;18, the PIP forms a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]] for the remaining duration of its run.\n\nThe route is named for the [[The Palisades (Hudson River)|New Jersey Palisades]], a line of cliffs rising along the western side of the [[Hudson River]]. The PIP is designated, but [[unsigned highway|not signed]] as '''Route&nbsp;445''' in New Jersey and '''New York State Route&nbsp;987C''' ('''NY&nbsp;987C'''), an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]], in New York. As with most [[parkway]]s in the [[New York metropolitan area]], commercial traffic is prohibited from using the PIP.

Passengers riding northbound on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) must be in local lanes to directly get on the PIP. Once the PIP leaves the GWB, it proceeds north along the New Jersey Palisades, past the Englewood Cliffs Service Area. Unlike service areas further north along the parkway, there are two in Englewood, one for northbound drivers and one for southbound drivers. The others are in the center median shared by drivers going in both directions. There are also three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades near the northern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]] at the [[Harlem River]]. After this, the PIP parallels US&nbsp;9W and the [[Hudson River]] for its entire run in New Jersey. All four exits in New Jersey are either with US&nbsp;9W, or within mere feet of the route.

At about the border the PIP changes direction from due north along the Hudson River to a north-west direction. Shortly after the Kings Ferry Service Area in the center median, the first two exits in New York are key exits for two colleges in Rockland County. Exit&nbsp;5 provides a link to [[St. Thomas Aquinas College]], and exit&nbsp;6 provides a link to [[Dominican College (New York)|Dominican College]]. In [[West Nyack, New York|West Nyack]], the PIP has a key interchange with the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]] and [[Interstate 287|I-287]]). This intersection is about seven miles (11&nbsp;km) west of the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]]. After the PIP's interchange with the NY Thruway, the PIP turns slightly north-east. At exit&nbsp;13, the PIP intersects [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]] as the route crosses south of [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] in [[Mount Ivy, New York|Mount Ivy]]. This is the first of two meetings between the PIP and US&nbsp;202. At exit&nbsp;15, the PIP has its last busy intersection in Rockland County with [[County Route 106 (Rockland County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;106]] (CR&nbsp;106, formerly part of [[New York State Route 210|NY&nbsp;210]]) in Stony Point. From here, the PIP enters Harriman State Park, and at exit&nbsp;16, the PIP intersects [[Lake Welch Parkway]], which is one of several parkways commissioned within the park.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nThe parkway enters [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] north of Lake Welch Parkway at exit&nbsp;16 and south of the [[Palisades Interstate Park Commission]] Visitor Center, located in the center median in what was originally a parkway service area. The first interchange in Orange County is exit&nbsp;17 at Anthony Wayne Recreation Area. At exit&nbsp;18, the PIP intersects [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]] and [[Seven Lakes Drive]]. US&nbsp;6 west heads toward the Thruway and [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] five miles (8&nbsp;km) west in [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]]. US&nbsp;6 east forms the PIP's only [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] for the last two miles (3&nbsp;km) of the PIP's run. Seven Lakes Drive joins the two routes for one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) before departing at exit&nbsp;19. The two routes then enter [[Bear Mountain State Park]] in an eastern direction. Finally, the Palisades Interstate Parkway meets its end at US&nbsp;9W and US&nbsp;202 at a traffic circle inches from the Hudson River and the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]].

Accessed April 7, 2016. \"In 1934 Welch formally presented the map, entitled ''Key Map Preliminary Survey Top of Palisades and Palisades Interstate Park New Jersey Section'' to the PIPC. In addition to the survey, Welch and Shurtleff also prepared a paper entitled ''A Scenic Parkway on the Top of the Palisades within the Palisades Interstate Park, State of New Jersey''. This report, subsequently referred to as Welch's 'Parkway Plan', included a suggested route for the parkway, a design concept and a strategy for accomplishing the project.\"</ref> The plan was to build a parkway to connect the New Jersey Palisades with the state parks along the Hudson River in Rockland and Orange counties. Welch would soon garner the support of [[John D. Rockefeller]], who donated {{convert|700|acre|km2}} of land along the New Jersey Palisades overlooking the [[Hudson River]] in 1933.<ref name=opening/> With this favorable momentum for the new route, the proposed route was accepted as a Civil Works Administration project under [[Franklin D.

The plan originally was to have the PIP stretch from the [[Garden State Parkway]], along the Hudson River, to the [[George Washington Bridge]], and then north along its present-day route ending at the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current PIP in New York on April&nbsp;1, 1947.

The parkway is a major [[commuter]] route into [[New York City]] from [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] counties in New York and [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]] in New Jersey. The southern terminus of the route is at the [[George Washington Bridge]] in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], where it connects to [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|Interstate&nbsp;95]] (I-95),  [[Route 4 (New Jersey)|Route&nbsp;4]] and [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]]. Its northern terminus is at a [[traffic circle]] in [[Fort Montgomery, New York]], where the PIP meets [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]] and [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]] at the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. At exit&nbsp;18, the PIP forms a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]] for the remaining duration of its run.\n\nThe route is named for the [[The Palisades (Hudson River)|New Jersey Palisades]], a line of cliffs rising along the western side of the [[Hudson River]]. The PIP is designated, but [[unsigned highway|not signed]] as '''Route&nbsp;445''' in New Jersey and '''New York State Route&nbsp;987C''' ('''NY&nbsp;987C'''), an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]], in New York. As with most [[parkway]]s in the [[New York metropolitan area]], commercial traffic is prohibited from using the PIP. The Palisades Interstate Parkway was built from 1947\u20131958, and fully opened to traffic on August&nbsp;28, 1958.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2018-07-22 09 43 45 View south along New Jersey State Route 445 (Palisades Interstate Parkway) between Exit 2 and Exit 1 in Tenafly, Bergen County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|Typical scene along the Palisades Interstate Parkway.

Passengers from the upper level of the GWB can directly get on the PIP northbound, while passengers from the lower level of the bridge must travel through [[George Washington Bridge Plaza|GWB Plaza]] on [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]] before getting on the parkway. Passengers riding northbound on the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) must be in local lanes to directly get on the PIP. Once the PIP leaves the GWB, it proceeds north along the New Jersey Palisades, past the Englewood Cliffs Service Area. Unlike service areas further north along the parkway, there are two in Englewood, one for northbound drivers and one for southbound drivers. The others are in the center median shared by drivers going in both directions. There are also three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades near the northern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]] at the [[Harlem River]]. After this, the PIP parallels US&nbsp;9W and the [[Hudson River]] for its entire run in New Jersey. All four exits in New Jersey are either with US&nbsp;9W, or within mere feet of the route. The PIP leaves New Jersey into New York in the borough of [[Rockleigh, New Jersey|Rockleigh]].<ref name=\"google\">{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Palisades+Interstate+Parkway,+United+States&sll=42.209384,-89.0043&sspn=0.007089,0.014591&ie=UTF8&ll=41.166249,-73.990173&spn=0.922163,1.867676&z=9&iwloc=addr&om=1 |title=overview map of Palisades Interstate Parkway |accessdate=September 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe entire New Jersey portion of the Palisades Interstate Parkway is within [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]].

At about the border the PIP changes direction from due north along the Hudson River to a north-west direction. Shortly after the Kings Ferry Service Area in the center median, the first two exits in New York are key exits for two colleges in Rockland County. Exit&nbsp;5 provides a link to [[St. Thomas Aquinas College]], and exit&nbsp;6 provides a link to [[Dominican College (New York)|Dominican College]]. In [[West Nyack, New York|West Nyack]], the PIP has a key interchange with the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]] and [[Interstate 287|I-287]]). This intersection is about seven miles (11&nbsp;km) west of the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]]. After the PIP's interchange with the NY Thruway, the PIP turns slightly north-east. At exit&nbsp;13, the PIP intersects [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]] as the route crosses south of [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] in [[Mount Ivy, New York|Mount Ivy]]. This is the first of two meetings between the PIP and US&nbsp;202. At exit&nbsp;15, the PIP has its last busy intersection in Rockland County with [[County Route 106 (Rockland County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;106]] (CR&nbsp;106, formerly part of [[New York State Route 210|NY&nbsp;210]]) in Stony Point. From here, the PIP enters Harriman State Park, and at exit&nbsp;16, the PIP intersects [[Lake Welch Parkway]], which is one of several parkways commissioned within the park.<ref name=\"google\" />\n\nThe parkway enters [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] north of Lake Welch Parkway at exit&nbsp;16 and south of the [[Palisades Interstate Park Commission]] Visitor Center, located in the center median in what was originally a parkway service area. The first interchange in Orange County is exit&nbsp;17 at Anthony Wayne Recreation Area. At exit&nbsp;18, the PIP intersects [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]] and [[Seven Lakes Drive]]. US&nbsp;6 west heads toward the Thruway and [[New York State Route 17|NY&nbsp;17]] five miles (8&nbsp;km) west in [[Harriman, New York|Harriman]]. US&nbsp;6 east forms the PIP's only [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] for the last two miles (3&nbsp;km) of the PIP's run.

Welch]], who was general manager and chief engineer of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.<ref>[http://www.njpalisades.org/pdfs/bywayCmp.pdf#page=66 ''Palisades Scenic Byway Corridor Management Plan''], [[Palisades Interstate Park Commission]]. Accessed April 7, 2016. \"In 1934 Welch formally presented the map, entitled ''Key Map Preliminary Survey Top of Palisades and Palisades Interstate Park New Jersey Section'' to the PIPC. In addition to the survey, Welch and Shurtleff also prepared a paper entitled ''A Scenic Parkway on the Top of the Palisades within the Palisades Interstate Park, State of New Jersey''. This report, subsequently referred to as Welch's 'Parkway Plan', included a suggested route for the parkway, a design concept and a strategy for accomplishing the project.\"</ref> The plan was to build a parkway to connect the New Jersey Palisades with the state parks along the Hudson River in Rockland and Orange counties. Welch would soon garner the support of [[John D. Rockefeller]], who donated {{convert|700|acre|km2}} of land along the New Jersey Palisades overlooking the [[Hudson River]] in 1933.<ref name=opening/> With this favorable momentum for the new route, the proposed route was accepted as a Civil Works Administration project under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal coalition]]. However, the New Jersey Highway Commission did not support construction, so the idea of a parkway was put on hold.<ref name=opening>Ingraham, Joseph C.

The plan originally was to have the PIP stretch from the [[Garden State Parkway]], along the Hudson River, to the [[George Washington Bridge]], and then north along its present-day route ending at the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. This southern extension was never built, but construction began on the current PIP in New York on April&nbsp;1, 1947. Construction on the New Jersey portion began about one year later.<ref name=opening1 /> Construction was delayed twice due to material shortages, but that did not stop the PIP from being opened in stages during the 1940s and 1950s. The route was completed in New Jersey in 1957, and on August&nbsp;28, 1958, the final piece of the PIP was completed between exits&nbsp;5 and&nbsp;9 in southern Rockland County.<ref name=opening1>Staff.

In particular, pain intensity, pain control, and resiliency to pain has been implicated as outcomes influenced by different levels and types of social support. Much of this research has focused on emotional, instrumental, tangible and informational social support. People with persistent pain conditions tend to rely on their social support as a coping mechanism and therefore have better outcomes when they are a part of larger more supportive social networks. Across a majority of studies investigated, there was a direct significant association between social activities or social support and pain. Higher levels of pain were associated with a decrease in social activities, lower levels of social support, and reduced social functioning.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Molton IR, Terrill AL | title = Overview of persistent pain in older adults | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 197\u2013207 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24547805 | doi = 10.1037/a0035794 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zaza C, Baine N | title = Cancer pain and psychosocial factors: a critical review of the literature | journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 526\u201342 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12547052 | doi = 10.1016/s0885-3924(02)00497-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Effect on cognition===\nChronic pain's impact on cognition is an under-researched area, but several tentative conclusions have been published.

In particular, pain intensity, pain control, and resiliency to pain has been implicated as outcomes influenced by different levels and types of social support. Much of this research has focused on emotional, instrumental, tangible and informational social support. People with persistent pain conditions tend to rely on their social support as a coping mechanism and therefore have better outcomes when they are a part of larger more supportive social networks. Across a majority of studies investigated, there was a direct significant association between social activities or social support and pain. Higher levels of pain were associated with a decrease in social activities, lower levels of social support, and reduced social functioning.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Molton IR, Terrill AL | title = Overview of persistent pain in older adults | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 197\u2013207 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24547805 | doi = 10.1037/a0035794 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zaza C, Baine N | title = Cancer pain and psychosocial factors: a critical review of the literature | journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 526\u201342 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12547052 | doi = 10.1016/s0885-3924(02)00497-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Effect on cognition===\nChronic pain's impact on cognition is an under-researched area, but several tentative conclusions have been published.

Though arrests were made and time was served, most of the diamonds stolen remain unrecovered.\n\n==Site==\nThe vault that housed the diamonds is situated two floors below the main floor. It was protected by multiple security mechanisms, including a lock with 100 million possible combinations, infrared heat detectors, a seismic sensor, [[Doppler radar]], and a magnetic field. The building itself had a private security force.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n==Robbery==\nLeonardo [[Notarbartolo]] had rented a sparsely furnished office for approximately 25,000 Belgian francs ($700) per month in the [[Antwerp World Diamond Centre]]. This was a technique pioneered by New York City-based Serbian criminal authority \"Mr. Stan\", [[Vojislav Stanimirovi\u0107 (criminal)|Vojislav Stanimirovi\u0107]]. It was first accomplished in New York's diamond center many years prior to this robbery. It included creating access to the [[safe deposit box]] located in the vault beneath the building. The method also provided a tenant ID card offering 24-hour access to the building.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph Cummins |title=Heists: Gripping Expos\u00e9s of the World's Most Notorious Robberies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS7vqrdtYNcC&pg=PT138 |accessdate=9 June 2011 |date=1 February 2011 |publisher=Pier 9 |isbn=978-1-74196-805-7 |pages=138\u2013}}</ref> There, he posed as an Italian diamond merchant in order to gain credibility. The robbery required eighteen months of preparation. The group used a variety of ingenious methods to overcome the security systems and left investigators confused as to how they had managed to successfully gain entry without triggering the security systems:<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n* The group conducted detailed surveillance of the Diamond Centre, using camera pens for taking pictures of the centre and the vault covertly. Notarbartolo's frequent visits, under the guise of being a diamond merchant, caused security to become used to his presence and thus lax. \n* A small camera was hidden above the vault door by the group, being difficult to see when the ceiling lights were on. It would observe guards opening the door and record the combination he used. It would then broadcast its data to sensor, which the group had hidden inside a ordinary-looking red fire extinguisher in a nearby storage room in the centre (the extinguisher was fully functional but had a watertight chamber hidden inside it which housed electronics to receive the camera's data).\n* The group allegedly practised with a full scale replica of the vault (Notarbartolo claims this was produced with help from an diamond trader insider)\n* The day before the robbery, Notarbartolo visited the vault, posing as a routine visit. While inside, he quickly sprayed women's hair spray on the thermal-motion sensors (having practised the necessary motion for a swift spray), as the oil from the product was transparent but would temporarily insulate the sensor from thermal fluctuations in the room and the sensor would only go off if it detected both heat and motion. This would last many hours but not forever and the group used it as a temporary measure until they could properly disable the sensor system. While the security camera recorded his actions, the guard was used to his visits and was not paying attention.\n* Notarbartolo remained in a nearby getaway vehicle during the robbery, listening to a police scanner and prepared to leave as soon as the group was done. \n* The team wore plastic gloves to avoid leaving finger prints. \n* To avoid the large number of security cameras in the area around the bank, the King of Keys picked the lock to an abandoned office building that adjoined the Diamond Centre, as it shared a private garden with the Diamond Centre that wasn't under video surveillance.\n* The garden allowed access to a small balcony on the centre, which the group accessed via ladder. An infrared sensor monitored the terrace but the Genius used a large, homemade polyester shield to hide his thermal signature as he approached the sensor and placed the shield in front of it, preventing it from detecting the group. He then disabled an alarm on the balcony's windows.\n* Security cameras in the antechamber were covered with black plastic bags to allow the group to turn on the lights. \n* The vault door had a magnetic lock on it that consisted of two plates - when armed, they would trigger a magnetic field and when the door opened, the field would break, triggering an alarm. The Genius overcome this by using a custom made aluminium plate, to which he attached heavy-duty double-sided tape to one side of it. He then stuck it on the two bolts and unscrewed them. While they were lose from their proper position, they were still side by side and generating a magnetic field. They were pivoted out of the way and taped to the antechamber wall. \n* The King of Keys had used video footage to successfully make a duplicate of the almost impossible to duplicate, foot-long vault key. However, during the robbery, he knew that guards often visited the utility room just before opening the door and decided to investigate. Inside the unlocked room he found the vault key. He decided to steal the original key, as it would ensure the vault's manufacturers did not realise the key could be duplicated and indeed, it was not until Notarbartolo revealed this occurred that the police would know a duplicate had been created. The group turned off the antechamber lights before opening the vault door to avoid tripping light sensors in the vault \n* After the King of Keys picked the lock to the internal gate, the Monster, working in darkness, moved to the middle of the room (having practised the number of steps in the replica), reached up to the ceiling and pushed back a panel, locating the security systems inbound and outbound wires. An electric pulse shot along these wires and if any sensor was tripped or broken, the circuit would break and trigger the alarm. To overcome this, the Monster carefully stripped the wire's plastic coating and attached a piece of new wire to the exposed copper wiring, rerouting the circuit and ensuring that it was irrelevant of the sensors were tripped. \n* Heat sensors were blinded with Styrofoam boxes and light sensors with tape. The men worked in darkness, having memorised the layout of the vault. They would occasionally flick on their lights for a brief moment in order to position their drill over the lock boxes.\n* The King of Keys used a hand cranked drill to break the locks on each of the security boxes. The contents were then emptied into duffel bags.\n* At 5:30am they finished and left, returning to the office building (a process which took almost an hour due to the need for caution). They then put the bags in Notarbartolo's car, which then drove to the apartment while the men headed there on foot.\n\nThe group was caught after Notarbartolo and Speedy went to dispose of the evidence of their plans, planning to burn it in France. Speedy was overcome with panic at the prospect of transporting such incriminating evidence and insisted they dispose of it in a nearby forest. However, Speedy suffered a panic-attack and disposed of the evidence poorly, hurling it into the bushes and mud rather than burning it. Notarbartolo was busy burning his own evidence and when he discovered what Speedy had done, he decided it would take too long to gather everything up and they needed to leave, confident that nobody would find their rubbish. However, a local hunter owned the land and called the police when he found the rubbish the next day (believing it to be caused by local teenagers he had previously had disputes with). When he mentioned that some of the rubbish consisted of envelopes from the Antwerp Diamond Centre, the police immediately investigated. The evidence from the rubbish was enough to allow the police to gain a lead and they were eventually able to identify Notarbartolo from security footage from a nearby grocery store where he had purchased a sandwich (a receipt for the sandwich was amongst the rubbish).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n \nAfter the robbery, Notarbartolo and his team stole the security footage to conceal their identities.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://listverse.com/2009/12/01/10-largest-robberies-in-history/ 10 Largest Robberies in History].

Though arrests were made and time was served, most of the diamonds stolen remain unrecovered.\n\n==Site==\nThe vault that housed the diamonds is situated two floors below the main floor. It was protected by multiple security mechanisms, including a lock with 100 million possible combinations, infrared heat detectors, a seismic sensor, [[Doppler radar]], and a magnetic field. The building itself had a private security force.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n==Robbery==\nLeonardo [[Notarbartolo]] had rented a sparsely furnished office for approximately 25,000 Belgian francs ($700) per month in the [[Antwerp World Diamond Centre]]. This was a technique pioneered by New York City-based Serbian criminal authority \"Mr. Stan\", [[Vojislav Stanimirovi\u0107 (criminal)|Vojislav Stanimirovi\u0107]]. It was first accomplished in New York's diamond center many years prior to this robbery. It included creating access to the [[safe deposit box]] located in the vault beneath the building. The method also provided a tenant ID card offering 24-hour access to the building.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph Cummins |title=Heists: Gripping Expos\u00e9s of the World's Most Notorious Robberies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS7vqrdtYNcC&pg=PT138 |accessdate=9 June 2011 |date=1 February 2011 |publisher=Pier 9 |isbn=978-1-74196-805-7 |pages=138\u2013}}</ref> There, he posed as an Italian diamond merchant in order to gain credibility. The robbery required eighteen months of preparation. The group used a variety of ingenious methods to overcome the security systems and left investigators confused as to how they had managed to successfully gain entry without triggering the security systems:<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n* The group conducted detailed surveillance of the Diamond Centre, using camera pens for taking pictures of the centre and the vault covertly. Notarbartolo's frequent visits, under the guise of being a diamond merchant, caused security to become used to his presence and thus lax. \n* A small camera was hidden above the vault door by the group, being difficult to see due when the ceiling lights were on. It would observe guards opening the door and record the combination he used. It would then broadcast its data to sensor, which the group had hidden inside a ordinary-looking red fire extinguisher in a nearby storage room in the centre (the extinguisher was fully functional but had a watertight chamber hidden inside it which housed electronics to receive the camera's data). \n* The group allegedly practised with a full scale replica of the vault (Notarbartolo claims this was produced with help from an diamond trader insider)\n* The day before the robbery, Notarbartolo visited the vault, posing as a routine visit. While inside, he quickly sprayed women's hair spray on the thermal-motion sensors (having practised the necessary motion for a swift spray), as the oil from the product was transparent but would temporarily insulate the sensor from thermal fluctuations in the room and the sensor would only go off if it detected both heat and motion. This would last many hours but not forever and the group used it as a temporary measure until they could properly disable the sensor system. While the security camera recorded his actions, the guard was used to his visits and was not paying attention.\n* Notarbartolo remained in a nearby getaway vehicle during the robbery, listening to a police scanner and prepared to leave as soon as the group was done. \n* The team wore plastic gloves to avoid leaving finger prints. \n* To avoid the large number of security cameras in the area around the bank, the King of Keys picked the lock to an abandoned office building that adjoined the Diamond Centre, as it shared a private garden with the Diamond Centre that wasn't under video surveillance.\n* The garden allowed access to a small balcony on the centre, which the group accessed via ladder. An infrared sensor monitored the terrace but the Genius used a large, homemade polyester shield to hide his thermal signature as he approached the sensor and placed the shield in front of it, preventing it from detecting the group. He then disabled an alarm on the balcony's windows.\n* Security cameras in the antechamber were covered with black plastic bags to allow the group to turn on the lights. \n* The vault door had a magnetic lock on it that consisted of two plates - when armed, they would trigger a magnetic field and when the door opened, the field would break, triggering an alarm. The Genius overcome this by using a custom made aluminium plate, to which he attached heavy-duty double-sided tape to one side of it. He then stuck it on the two bolts and unscrewed them. While they were lose from their proper position, they were still side by side and generating a magnetic field. They were pivoted out of the way and taped to the antechamber wall. \n* The King of Keys had used video footage to successfully make a duplicate of the almost impossible to duplicate, foot-long vault key. However, during the robbery, he knew that guards often visited the utility room just before opening the door and decided to investigate. Inside the unlocked room he found the vault key. He decided to steal the original key, as it would ensure the vault's manufacturers did not realise the key could be duplicated and indeed, it was not until Notarbartolo revealed this occurred that the police would know a duplicate had been created. The group turned off the antechamber lights before opening the vault door to avoid tripping light sensors in the vault \n* After the King of Keys picked the lock to the internal gate, the Monster, working in darkness, moved to the middle of the room (having practised the number of steps in the replica), reached up to the ceiling and pushed back a panel, locating the security systems inbound and outbound wires. An electric pulse shot along these wires and if any sensor was tripped or broken, the circuit would break and trigger the alarm. To overcome this, the Monster carefully stripped the wire's plastic coating and attached a piece of new wire to the exposed copper wiring, rerouting the circuit and ensuring that it was irrelevant of the sensors were tripped. \n* Heat sensors were blinded with Styrofoam boxes and light sensors with tape. The men worked in darkness, having memorised the layout of the vault. They would occasionally flick on their lights for a brief moment in order to position their drill over the lock boxes.\n* The King of Keys used a hand cranked drill to break the locks on each of the security boxes. The contents were then emptied into duffel bags.\n* At 5:30am they finished and left, returning to the office building (a process which took almost an hour due to the need for caution). They then put the bags in Notarbartolo's car, which then drove to the apartment while the men headed there on foot.\n\nThe group was caught after Notarbartolo and Speedy went to dispose of the evidence of their plans, planning to burn it in France. Speedy was overcome with panic at the prospect of transporting such incriminating evidence and insisted they dispose of it in a nearby forest. However, Speedy suffered a panic-attack and disposed of the evidence poorly, hurling it into the bushes and mud rather than burning it. Notarbartolo was busy burning his own evidence and when he discovered what Speedy had done, he decided it would take too long to gather everything up and they needed to leave, confident that nobody would find their rubbish. However, a local hunter owned the land and called the police when he found the rubbish the next day (believing it to be caused by local teenagers he had previously had disputes with). When he mentioned that some of the rubbish consisted of envelopes from the Antwerp Diamond Centre, the police immediately investigated. The evidence from the rubbish was enough to allow the police to gain a lead and they were eventually able to identify Notarbartolo from security footage from a nearby grocery store where he had purchased a sandwich (a receipt for the sandwich was amongst the rubbish).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n \nAfter the robbery, Notarbartolo and his team stole the security footage to conceal their identities.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://listverse.com/2009/12/01/10-largest-robberies-in-history/ 10 Largest Robberies in History].

Upon further investigation, the rap trio and 12 members of their entourage were arrested for possession of marijuana and another Schedule II controlled substance, possession of firearms within a school safety zone, possession of firearms during the commission of a crime, and possession of firearms by convicted felons.<ref name=\"S'boro Herald\">{{cite web|title=Migos rap group members arrested at Hanner show|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427110959/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"George-Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Gorla|first1=Lauren|title=Migos arrested following delayed Spring Concert|url=http://www.thegeorgeanne.com/news/article_ab86f90c-e7bd-11e4-9c47-abc8c27a3824.html|publisher=The George-Anne|access-date=April 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile university officials had been aware of Migos' reputation, the group was allowed to perform, as it had received the most votes among the seven bands and artists up for consideration for the Spring concert in a student poll, and student fees and ticket sales had been used to pay for the concert.<ref name=\"S'boro Herald 2\">{{cite web|last1=Saxon|first1=Holli|title=Two Migos rappers post bond; one held in jail|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143531/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the performance contract, the group were to be paid $30,000 with their promoter Big House Collective receiving an additional $3,000.

The University Police Department, the Statesboro Police Department and the [[Bulloch County, Georgia|Bulloch County]] Sheriff's Office, who were present at the concert as security detail, detected a strong scent of marijuana from the group's vans, and the drivers were questioned by law enforcement. Upon further investigation, the rap trio and 12 members of their entourage were arrested for possession of marijuana and another Schedule II controlled substance, possession of firearms within a school safety zone, possession of firearms during the commission of a crime, and possession of firearms by convicted felons.<ref name=\"S'boro Herald\">{{cite web|title=Migos rap group members arrested at Hanner show|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427110959/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67214/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"George-Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Gorla|first1=Lauren|title=Migos arrested following delayed Spring Concert|url=http://www.thegeorgeanne.com/news/article_ab86f90c-e7bd-11e4-9c47-abc8c27a3824.html|publisher=The George-Anne|access-date=April 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile university officials had been aware of Migos' reputation, the group was allowed to perform, as it had received the most votes among the seven bands and artists up for consideration for the Spring concert in a student poll, and student fees and ticket sales had been used to pay for the concert.<ref name=\"S'boro Herald 2\">{{cite web|last1=Saxon|first1=Holli|title=Two Migos rappers post bond; one held in jail|url=http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|publisher=Statesboro Herald|access-date=April 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427143531/http://www.statesboroherald.com/section/1/article/67224/|archive-date=April 27, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to the performance contract, the group were to be paid $30,000 with their promoter Big House Collective receiving an additional $3,000.

Possamai explores the intersection between [[late modernity]] and [[spirituality]], noting the emphasis on the authority of the self replacing external forms of conventional [[religious authority]] (such as authority vested in [[imams]], [[priests]] and [[rabbis]], or in communally interpreted [[sacred texts]]). Hyper-real religions constitute new forms of [[spirituality]] where [[traditional]] and [[Modern history|modern]] religious ideas are [[Consumption (sociology)|consumed]] and projected into completely [[wikt:reconstruction|reconstructed]] forms. Examples cited by Possamai include the [[Church of All Worlds]], [[the Church of Satan]], and Jedi religion ([[Jediism]], see also [[Jedi census phenomenon]]). Carole Cusack in her book ''Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith'' stated that \"Adam Possamai,... to date is the only sociologist of religion (indeed the only scholar) to examine it [Jediism] in any detail prior to this study\" (p 124).<ref>Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith - Carol Cusack (2010) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289968682_Invented_religions_imagination_fiction_and_faith</ref> His work also considers the complex interplay between [[fundamentalist]] [[Christians|Christian]] groups that resist the [[synergy]] between popular culture and religion (as in the phenomenon of [[Harry Potter]], [[fantasy]]-[[role playing games]]), and yet [[reappropriate]] aspects of pop culture to promote fundamentalism.<ref>Religion and Popular Culture: A Hyper-Real Testament {{cite web|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=14609&concordeid=29272 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715065820/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=14609&concordeid=29272 |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe second area of scholarly innovation is found in Possamai's work on New Age spirituality. On the basis of both field research in alternative spirituality festivals and new theoretical approaches, Possamai has contested the scholarly ''status quo'' in the interpretation and classification of New Age spirituality. His field research demonstrates that very few practitioners of what scholars call [[New Age]], actually accept the term. He argues that the term New Age is imprecise and the previous scholarly conceptualisations of New Age are either limited or misleading. In his new schema, New Age spirituality is but one facet of a much wider cultural phenomenon that he has dubbed a perennist spirituality. It follows that by culturally consuming selected practices, myths, and teachings from pre-modern times, and then reframing them for the contemporary scene, seekers aspire to personal transformation and perhaps resolving global woes.\n\nAt the heart of this conceptualisation of reality lies a commitment to what Possamai has dubbed \"perennism\", the notion that a [[holistic]] understanding of truth is accessible in [[esoteric]] wisdom or [[gnosis]] that is unfettered by the [[dogmas]] of the world's religions. According to Possamai, the key features of perennism are that in this [[syncretic]] spirituality the cosmos is interpreted as a [[monistic]] reality, which partakes of a single unifying being, or principle, and all parts of the cosmos are inter-related to this ultimate reality. Those who participate in this spirituality are engaged in [[self-development]] to attain their [[potential]], and they pursue spiritual knowledge of both self and ultimate reality.<ref>In Search of New Age Spiritualities https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315252490</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110224095237/http://pubapps.uws.edu.au/expert/expert_details.php?eid=37 UWS Expert Directory]\n* [https://uws.academia.edu/AdamPossamai Adam Possamai on Academia.edu]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Possamai, Adam}}\n[[Category:Belgian academics]]\n[[Category:21st-century Belgian novelists]]\n[[Category:Belgian male novelists]]\n[[Category:Belgian sociologists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sociologists of religion]]\n[[Category:Researchers of new religious movements and cults]]\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Western Sydney University faculty]]\n[[Category:21st-century Belgian male writers]]\n[[Category:Sociology]]\n[[Category:Australian sociologists]]\n[[Category:Sociologists]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox scientist\n|name              = Adam Possamai\n|image             =\n|image_size        =\n|birth_date        = 1970\n|birth_place       = Belgium\n|residence         = Australia\n|nationality       =\n|work_institutions = [[Western Sydney University]]\n|occupation        = [[Professor]] in [[Sociology]] and Director of Research in the School of Social Sciences and Psychology. \n}}\n'''Adam Possamai''' is a [[sociologist]] and [[novelist]] born in [[Belgium]] and living in [[Australia]].

Carole Cusack in her book ''Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith'' stated that \"Adam Possamai,... to date is the only sociologist of religion (indeed the only scholar) to examine it [Jediism] in any detail prior to this study\" (p 124).<ref>Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith - Carol Cusack (2010) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289968682_Invented_religions_imagination_fiction_and_faith</ref> His work also considers the complex interplay between [[fundamentalist]] [[Christians|Christian]] groups that resist the [[synergy]] between popular culture and religion (as in the phenomenon of [[Harry Potter]], [[fantasy]]-[[role playing games]]), and yet [[reappropriate]] aspects of pop culture to promote fundamentalism.<ref>Religion and Popular Culture: A Hyper-Real Testament {{cite web|url=http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=14609&concordeid=29272 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715065820/http://www.peterlang.com/index.cfm?event=cmp.ccc.seitenstruktur.detailseiten&seitentyp=produkt&pk=14609&concordeid=29272 |archivedate=15 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe second area of scholarly innovation is found in Possamai's work on New Age spirituality. On the basis of both field research in alternative spirituality festivals and new theoretical approaches, Possamai has contested the scholarly ''status quo'' in the interpretation and classification of New Age spirituality. His field research demonstrates that very few practitioners of what scholars call [[New Age]], actually accept the term. He argues that the term New Age is imprecise and the previous scholarly conceptualisations of New Age are either limited or misleading. In his new schema, New Age spirituality is but one facet of a much wider cultural phenomenon that he has dubbed a perennist spirituality. It follows that by culturally consuming selected practices, myths, and teachings from pre-modern times, and then reframing them for the contemporary scene, seekers aspire to personal transformation and perhaps resolving global woes.\n\nAt the heart of this conceptualisation of reality lies a commitment to what Possamai has dubbed \"perennism\", the notion that a [[holistic]] understanding of truth is accessible in [[esoteric]] wisdom or [[gnosis]] that is unfettered by the [[dogmas]] of the world's religions. According to Possamai, the key features of perennism are that in this [[syncretic]] spirituality the cosmos is interpreted as a [[monistic]] reality, which partakes of a single unifying being, or principle, and all parts of the cosmos are inter-related to this ultimate reality. Those who participate in this spirituality are engaged in [[self-development]] to attain their [[potential]], and they pursue spiritual knowledge of both self and ultimate reality.<ref>In Search of New Age Spiritualities https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781315252490</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110224095237/http://pubapps.uws.edu.au/expert/expert_details.php?eid=37 UWS Expert Directory]\n* [https://uws.academia.edu/AdamPossamai Adam Possamai on Academia.edu]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Possamai, Adam}}\n[[Category:Belgian academics]]\n[[Category:21st-century Belgian novelists]]\n[[Category:Belgian male novelists]]\n[[Category:Belgian sociologists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sociologists of religion]]\n[[Category:Researchers of new religious movements and cults]]\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Western Sydney University faculty]]\n[[Category:21st-century male writers]]\n[[Category:Sociology]]\n[[Category:Australian sociologists]]\n[[Category:Sociologists]]\n", "name_user": "Bearcat", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:recat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Possamai"}
