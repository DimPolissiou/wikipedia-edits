[[\u010cukarica]], more precisely in the working-class neighborhood of the Belgrade municipality, which is located on the right bank of the [[Sava|Sava River]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The club was formed on 4 July 1926 during a meeting that took place in a restaurant named ''Majdan'', where the club got its official name, ''\u010cSK''\u2013''\u010cukari\u010dki sport klub'', and the decision was made that the club colors should be black and white, a tradition which is still present.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The first president was Milo\u0161 Ili\u0107, known as the first Serbian aviator respectively combat pilots of the 1st class, and by that time a reservist of the [[Yugoslav Royal Air Force]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The first players of the club were amateurs, which organized the pitch, made their own jerseys and nets.\n\n\u010cSK started in the third league of the Belgrade League system, but in 1928 managed to promoted to the second Belgrade League, where the club was able to keep several seasons.<ref name=\"85 godina\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pageflip-flap.com/read?r=tOqdiQoYQtfej3f5jl|title=85 godina SD Cukaricki_za CIP|access-date=19

1931\u201332, \u010cSK became champion and thus played from the next season in the Belgrad B-League, which they gained finally in 1935.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> So, the club celebrated its first decade of existence with championship success. During this first period of success, especially striker [[Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107 (footballer born 1914)|Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107]], called ''Pikavac'', was one of the most important figures of the club.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> Coming from [[FK Palilulac Beograd|Palilulac Belgrade]] in 1932, he played in \u010cSK until 1936, when he was transferred to [[SK Jugoslavija]], one of the major national clubs.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> As a member of the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslav national team]], he is remembered as one of the best dribblers of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\nIn 1936, \u010cSK entered to the [[Belgrade Football Subassociation|Belgrade First A-League]], which was one of the [[Yugoslav Second League]]\u00b4s at that time, but relegated after two years.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> The generational change in the squad is considered to be the reason for such a bad season, but after only one year, the club was back and won immediately the championship.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> However, in that season the club was merged with ''FK Istra'', a move that was not supported by many members of the direction board, and much less among the players.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> Because of this, local popularity fell and the vast majority of the players moved to neighbouring clubs ''Banovac'', ''Maki\u0161'' and ''\u0160e\u0107eranac''.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> This made a stagnation in the club and during the following seasons the club did not compete in any level until 1942.<ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\n===The club during the World War II (1942\u20131944)===\nDuring the [[World War II]], the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded in April 1941 by the [[Axis powers]] and divided. Parts of Serbia fell to the [[Independent State of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], or were under [[Nazi-Germany]] administration, among Belgrade, which was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]]. Under difficult circumstances, it was permitted for certain clubs to play football, including \u010cSK. Already after the invasion, the club returned 1942 after six years of abstinence successfully in the competition and won the First Belgrade League, thus played next season in the [[Serbian Football League (1940\u20131944)|Serbian League]], the top national tier during the war. In the [[1942\u201343 Serbian League|1942\u201343]] season the club finished 4th, a remarkable achievement because they finished in front of several favourites like [[SK Jedinstvo Beograd|Jedinstvo Belgrade]] or [[FK BASK|BASK]].<ref>[http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 Miroslav Milovanovi\u0107: \"Na\u0161 Plavi Bukvar\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512115722/http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 |date=12 May 2012 }}, pag. 85</ref>\n\nIn that period there was a popular domestic tournament named ''Letnji Pehar'' (Summer Trophy), where the best clubs competed like [[OFK Beograd|BSK]], [[SK Jugoslavija|SK 1903]], [[FK Obili\u0107|Obili\u0107 Belgrade]] and so also \u010cSK. Finally, the club defeated ''SK Banovac'' in the quarter-finals (2\u20131, 0\u20131), but lost against SK 1903 in the semi-finals (0\u20132, 0\u20132).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The 1943\u201344 Belgrade First League season was formed by 10 clubs however after 8 rounds it was interrupted with \u010cSK placed as 6th. By the end of the war the club did not play under its name, only restoring its name in 1948 as FK \u010cukari\u010dki, now part of the \u010cukari\u010dki Sports Association.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /><ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\n===From the subclass to the first league (1944\u20132003)===\n[[File:Milan Dudic.JPG|thumb|Ex-national player [[Milan Dudi\u0107]] started his professional career at \u010cukari\u010dki and played from 1999 to 2002 for the club.]]\nIn 1948, playing in the Belgrade Second League, which was the 6th tier of the newly formed league system of the [[Socialist Yugoslavia]], the club finished 4th. It was coached by Jovan Veselinovi\u0107 and the squad was formed mostly by experienced older players. In 1950\u201351 with an already renovated squad, it finishes third and qualified to the Belgrade First League where it also finished third achieving promotion to the 1953\u201354 Belgrade Podsavezna League, the national fourth tier, where they finished third, again. Led by the coach \u017dikica Spasojevi\u0107 and striker Petar Popovi\u0107 they archived the promotion to the 1954\u201355 Serbian League, the third tier.\n\nIn summer 1955, Vule Radosavljevi\u0107 was made the main coach, however the club ended the first half of the season at bottom. Radosavljevi\u0107 was replaced by Dragomir Kojadinovi\u0107 and there were also changes at club direction board which may have contributed to a comeback with the team finishing the season in 8th place. This earned them participation in the pley-off for the [[Yugoslav Second League]], however they failed to qualify. In 1955\u201356 many players left the club, and led by coach Brana A\u0107imovi\u0107 they finished 2nd in the Belgrade Podsavezna League. 1956 is the year of the beginning of the fall as many important club players retired in that period.\n\nAlso, numerous club directions and coaches succeeded. So, the club played constantly in Belgrade leagues. Great achievement was brought on to the club ten years later in the 1966\u201367 season when they finished first in the Second Belgrade League and won the Belgrade Cup the same year.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> They were promoted to the Serbian League where they were constantly on top.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> So, these seasons, the club competed for promotion to the Yugoslav Second league, which he reached as a champion of the 1971\u201372 season. There, \u010cukari\u010dki held for several years, but did not succeed to promotion to the [[Yugoslav First League]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\nIn the early 1990s, the club played again in the third tier and between 1993 and 1995 in the second league of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> In the 1994\u201395 season, the club managed finally for the first time in its history the promotion to the first league, where they played until 1998.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> In the [[Yugoslav Cup]] in 1995, \u010cukari\u010dki came into the quarterfinals and also competed in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 1996|1996]] and [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 1997|1997]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> Their biggest success during this period came in the 1999\u201300 season, when they finished 6th in the first league, in which 21 teams participated.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The club remained till 2003 in the first division.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\n===From insolvency to privatization (2003\u2013present)===\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0448 \u041d\u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b.jpg|thumb|[[Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107]], here as a player of [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], came from the youth school of the club and played three years as professional for \u010cukari\u010dki.]]\nAfter four years in the first league, \u010cukari\u010dki relegate in 2003. Although succeeded in 2004 as champion of the group West the direct re-promotion, the club relegated again in 2005. \u010cukari\u010dki was renamed in the early 2000s, as the Serbian company ''Stankom'' dedicated as the main sponsor and funder. Therefore, the club was known for a long time under the name ''\u010cukari\u010dki Stankom''. By the arrival of Stankom the club was stabilized. So, they improved the organization, increased the stadium capacity to 7,000 and also brought a better financial situation. In 2007, \u010cukari\u010dki finally reached the top division, the [[Serbian SuperLiga]].\n\n[[File:Aleksandar Kolarov.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleksandar Kolarov]], here in the jersey of [[Manchester City]], played from 2003 to 2006 for the club and is regarded as the most famous player who ever played for \u010cukari\u010dki.]]\nFrom August 2007 to December 2008 the former [[Bundesliga]] manager [[Dragoslav Stepanovi\u0107]] coached the club. After seven defeats in a row and the time between last place in the 2008\u201309 season, he was relieved of his duties. At the end of the season, the team made the 9th place in the table under coach [[Dejan \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107]] and remained in the league.\n\nThe 2009\u201310 season ended for \u010cukari\u010dki with the 13th place and escaped with three points ahead of [[Napredak Kru\u0161evac]] barely the relegation. This happiness the team should does not have anymore in the 2010\u201311 season. The club could not win a single one of its thirty league matches and finished with just five points on the last place and relegated in the [[Serbian First League]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\nAlso in the Second League, \u010cukari\u010dki was not very successful. With 41 points they were equal on points with [[Banat Zrenjanin]] and [[Radni\u010dki Sombor]]. Because of the direct comparison between all three teams only Radni\u010dki Sombor had to join the 3rd league as 15th of the final table. The club was in a very difficult financial situation and was on the verge of [[bankruptcy]], however, the year 2011 marked a turning point, as the construction and wholesale company ADOC, which operates in the [[pharmacy]], [[diagnostics]] and [[construction industry]], bought up \u010cukari\u010dki and immediately invested in the club, making \u010cukari\u010dki the first professional football club in [[Serbia]], which was privatized, and also one of the few clubs in [[Southeast Europe]], which are privately owned.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka1\" />\n\nThrough the privatization, the financial and organizational situation of the club improved significantly, but also in the infrastructure and the squad has been invested.<ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka1\" /> In the 2012\u201313 season the club then managed the runner-up of the second league and the return to the first league.

[[\u010cukarica]], more precisely in the working-class neighborhood of the Belgrade municipality, which is located on the right bank of the [[Sava|Sava River]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The club was formed on 4 July 1926 during a meeting that took place in a restaurant named ''Majdan'', where the club got its official name, ''\u010cSK''\u2013''\u010cukari\u010dki sport klub'', and the decision was made that the club colors should be black and white, a tradition which is still present.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The first president was Milo\u0161 Ili\u0107, known as the first Serbian aviator respectively combat pilots of the 1st class, and by that time a reservist of the [[Yugoslav Royal Air Force]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The first players of the club were amateurs, which organized the pitch, made their own jerseys and nets.\n\n\u010cSK started in the third league of the Belgrade League system, but in 1928 managed to promoted to the second Belgrade League, where the club was able to keep several seasons.<ref name=\"85 godina\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pageflip-flap.com/read?r=tOqdiQoYQtfej3f5jl|title=85 godina SD Cukaricki_za CIP|access-date=19

1931\u201332, \u010cSK became champion and thus played from the next season in the Belgrad B-League, which they gained finally in 1935.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> So, the club celebrated its first decade of existence with championship success. During this first period of success, especially striker [[Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107 (footballer born 1914)|Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107]], called ''Pikavac'', was one of the most important figures of the club.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> Coming from [[FK Palilulac Beograd|Palilulac Belgrade]] in 1932, he played in \u010cSK until 1936, when he was transferred to [[SK Jugoslavija]], one of the major national clubs.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> As a member of the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslav national team]], he is remembered as one of the best dribblers of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\nIn 1936, \u010cSK entered to the [[Belgrade Football Subassociation|Belgrade First A-League]], which was one of the [[Yugoslav Second League]]\u00b4s at that time, but relegated after two years.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> The generational change in the squad is considered to be the reason for such a bad season, but after only one year, the club was back and won immediately the championship.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> However, in that season the club was merged with ''FK Istra'', a move that was not supported by many members of the direction board, and much less among the players.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> Because of this, local popularity fell and the vast majority of the players moved to neighbouring clubs ''Banovac'', ''Maki\u0161'' and ''\u0160e\u0107eranac''.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> This made a stagnation in the club and during the following seasons the club did not compete in any level until 1942.<ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\n===The club during the World War II (1942\u20131944)===\nDuring the [[World War II]], the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded in April 1941 by the [[Axis powers]] and divided. Parts of Serbia fell to the [[Independent State of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], or were under [[Nazi-Germany]] administration, among Belgrade, which was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]]. Under difficult circumstances, it was permitted for certain clubs to play football, including \u010cSK. Already after the invasion, the club returned 1942 after six years of abstinence successfully in the competition and won the First Belgrade League, thus played next season in the [[Serbian Football League (1940\u20131944)|Serbian League]], the top national tier during the war. In the [[1942\u201343 Serbian League|1942\u201343]] season the club finished 4th, a remarkable achievement because they finished in front of several favourites like [[SK Jedinstvo Beograd|Jedinstvo Belgrade]] or [[FK BASK|BASK]].<ref>[http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 Miroslav Milovanovi\u0107: \"Na\u0161 Plavi Bukvar\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512115722/http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 |date=12 May 2012 }}, pag. 85</ref>\n\nIn that period there was a popular domestic tournament named ''Letnji Pehar'' (Summer Trophy), where the best clubs competed like [[OFK Beograd|BSK]], [[SK Jugoslavija|SK 1903]], [[FK Obili\u0107|Obili\u0107 Belgrade]] and so also \u010cSK. Finally, the club defeated ''SK Banovac'' in the quarter-finals (2\u20131, 0\u20131), but lost against SK 1903 in the semi-finals (0\u20132, 0\u20132).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The 1943\u201344 Belgrade First League season was formed by 10 clubs however after 8 rounds it was interrupted with \u010cSK placed as 6th. By the end of the war the club did not play under its name, only restoring its name in 1948 as FK \u010cukari\u010dki, now part of the \u010cukari\u010dki Sports Association.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /><ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\n===From the subclass to the first league (1944\u20132003)===\n[[File:Milan Dudic.JPG|thumb|Ex-national player [[Milan Dudi\u0107]] started his professional career at \u010cukari\u010dki and played from 1999 to 2002 for the club.]]\nIn 1948, playing in the Belgrade Second League, which was the 6th tier of the newly formed league system of the [[Socialist Yugoslavia]], the club finished 4th. It was coached by Jovan Veselinovi\u0107 and the squad was formed mostly by experienced older players. In 1950\u201351 with an already renovated squad, it finishes third and qualified to the Belgrade First League where it also finished third achieving promotion to the 1953\u201354 Belgrade Podsavezna League, the national fourth tier, where they finished third, again. Led by the coach \u017dikica Spasojevi\u0107 and striker Petar Popovi\u0107 they archived the promotion to the 1954\u201355 Serbian League, the third tier.\n\nIn summer 1955, Vule Radosavljevi\u0107 was made the main coach, however the club ended the first half of the season at bottom. Radosavljevi\u0107 was replaced by Dragomir Kojadinovi\u0107 and there were also changes at club direction board which may have contributed to a comeback with the team finishing the season in 8th place. This earned them participation in the pley-off for the [[Yugoslav Second League]], however they failed to qualify. In 1955\u201356 many players left the club, and led by coach Brana A\u0107imovi\u0107 they finished 2nd in the Belgrade Podsavezna League. 1956 is the year of the beginning of the fall as many important club players retired in that period.\n\nAlso, numerous club directions and coaches succeeded. So, the club played constantly in Belgrade leagues. Great achievement was brought on to the club ten years later in the 1966\u201367 season when they finished first in the Second Belgrade League and won the Belgrade Cup the same year.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> They were promoted to the Serbian League where they were constantly on top.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> So, these seasons, the club competed for promotion to the Yugoslav Second league, which he reached as a champion of the 1971\u201372 season. There, \u010cukari\u010dki held for several years, but did not succeed to promotion to the [[Yugoslav First League]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\nIn the early 1990s, the club played again in the third tier and between 1993 and 1995 in the second league of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> In the 1994\u201395 season, the club managed finally for the first time in its history the promotion to the first league, where they played until 1998.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> In the [[Yugoslav Cup]] in 1995, \u010cukari\u010dki came into the quarterfinals and also competed in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 1996|1996]] and [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 1997|1997]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> Their biggest success during this period came in the 1999\u201300 season, when they finished 6th in the first league, in which 21 teams participated.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The club remained till 2003 in the first division.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\n===From insolvency to privatization (2003\u2013present)===\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0448 \u041d\u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b.jpg|thumb|[[Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107]], here as a player of [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], came from the youth school of the club and played three years as professional for \u010cukari\u010dki.]]\nAfter four years in the first league, \u010cukari\u010dki relegate in 2003. Although succeeded in 2004 as champion of the group West the direct re-promotion, the club relegated again in 2005. \u010cukari\u010dki was renamed in the early 2000s, as the Serbian company ''Stankom'' dedicated as the main sponsor and funder. Therefore, the club was known for a long time under the name ''\u010cukari\u010dki Stankom''. By the arrival of Stankom the club was stabilized. So, they improved the organization, increased the stadium capacity to 7,000 and also brought a better financial situation. In 2007, \u010cukari\u010dki finally reached the top division, the [[Serbian SuperLiga]].\n\n[[File:Aleksandar Kolarov.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleksandar Kolarov]], here in the jersey of [[Manchester City]], played from 2003 to 2006 for the club and is regarded as the most famous player who ever played for \u010cukari\u010dki.]]\nFrom August 2007 to December 2008 the former [[Bundesliga]] manager [[Dragoslav Stepanovi\u0107]] coached the club. After seven defeats in a row and the time between last place in the 2008\u201309 season, he was relieved of his duties. At the end of the season, the team made the 9th place in the table under coach [[Dejan \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107]] and remained in the league.\n\nThe 2009\u201310 season ended for \u010cukari\u010dki with the 13th place and escaped with three points ahead of [[Napredak Kru\u0161evac]] barely the relegation. This happiness the team should does not have anymore in the 2010\u201311 season. The club could not win a single one of its thirty league matches and finished with just five points on the last place and relegated in the [[Serbian First League]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\nAlso in the Second League, \u010cukari\u010dki was not very successful. With 41 points they were equal on points with [[Banat Zrenjanin]] and [[Radni\u010dki Sombor]]. Because of the direct comparison between all three teams only Radni\u010dki Sombor had to join the 3rd league as 15th of the final table. The club was in a very difficult financial situation and was on the verge of [[bankruptcy]], however, the year 2011 marked a turning point, as the construction and wholesale company ADOC, which operates in the [[pharmacy]], [[diagnostics]] and [[construction industry]], bought up \u010cukari\u010dki and immediately invested in the club, making \u010cukari\u010dki the first professional football club in [[Serbia]], which was privatized, and also one of the few clubs in [[Southeast Europe]], which are privately owned.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka1\" />\n\nThrough the privatization, the financial and organizational situation of the club improved significantly, but also in the infrastructure and the squad has been invested.<ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka1\" /> In the 2012\u201313 season the club then managed the runner-up of the second league and the return to the first league. In the following 2013\u201314 season, the upswing of the club continued, so \u010cukari\u010dki was able to secure a surprising 5th place in the league.\n\n==European record==\n\n===Matches===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-!

Originally a fastball pitcher, he became reliant on keeping his pitches low across the plate, regardless of the type of pitch thrown. The adjustments proved successful. After a month and a half, he was promoted to Double-A [[Tennessee Smokies|Tennessee]], and a month later, to Triple-A [[Syracuse Chiefs|Syracuse]]. By mid-season, he was back in the Blue Jays' rotation.

In 133.0 innings, he went 8\u20138 with a 4.20 ERA. He walked 39 batters, seven more than he had walked in 2003 when he had pitched twice as many innings. He later revealed that he had been injured throughout the entire season with a \"tired throwing arm\", which he believed was from intense workouts in preseason.\n\nThe [[2005 Toronto Blue Jays season|2005]] season began successfully for Halladay, as he posted a 12\u20134 record with a 2.41 ERA in 19 starts. He was selected to his third All-Star team and was slated to be the starting pitcher for the [[American League]] at the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[Comerica Park|Detroit]]. However, on July 8, Halladay's leg was broken by a [[line drive]] off the bat of [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] left fielder [[Kevin Mench]].<ref name=\"ESPN1\" /> As a result, he was replaced in the All-Star Game by [[Matt Clement]] of the [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], while [[Mark Buehrle]] of the [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] was named the starting pitcher for the American League. Despite rehabilitation of his leg, Halladay would sit out the remainder of the season.\n\nOn March 16, [[2006 Toronto Blue Jays season|2006]], Halladay signed a [[United States dollar|$]]40 million three-year contract extension through 2010.<ref name=\"ESPN1\">{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2371102|title=Halladay agrees to extension through 2010|date=March 16, 2006|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|access-date=December 17, 2009}}</ref> During that year, Halladay finished near the top of the MLB in wins with 16. He was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve on July 3, along with four of his Blue Jays teammates. It marked the second-most appearances in club history, and Halladay's fourth as an All-Star. Although Halladay's strikeout total was lower in 2006 than in previous seasons, his [[ground ball/fly ball ratio]], complete games, and innings pitched were all among the American League leaders.\n\n====2007\u20132009====\nHalladay was the American League [[Pitcher of the Month|pitcher of the month]] in April [[2007 Toronto Blue Jays season|2007]], going 4\u20130, highlighted by a 10-inning complete game win over the [[2007 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. However, he pitched poorly in his two starts in May, and on May 11 was placed on the disabled list and underwent an [[appendectomy]]. He returned to the rotation in his usual form on May 31 against the [[Chicago White Sox]]. Halladay went 7 innings, giving up just six hits and allowing no runs on his way to his 100th career win. 2007 also saw Halladay hit his first career RBI. Against the [[2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] on June 10, his ground ball single to center field allowed [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] to score. He shut out the [[2007 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] on July 22, allowing only three hits.\n\nIn [[2008 Toronto Blue Jays season|2008]], for the sixth consecutive year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record.<ref name=\"YahooSports1\">{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/6134/news|title=Roy Halladay - Toronto - Major League Baseball - Yahoo! Sports|website=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}</ref> He lost 3\u20132 in a pitcher's duel with New York's [[Chien-Ming Wang]]. His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched [[Josh Beckett]] in his season debut.\n\nIn his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the [[2008 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]], in a 4\u20131 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the [[2008 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], he was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of [[Nyjer Morgan]]. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman [[Scott Rolen]], ending the inning. Halladay was able to walk back to the dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given a clean bill of health for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] against the [[Seattle Mariners]] on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' [[Mark Mulder]] for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out [[Lance Berkman]]. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year.

He often led the league in innings pitched and complete games, while ranking among the leaders in WHIP and ERA.\n\nPrior to and during each start, Halladay had a distinct trademark in which he went into a complete \"isolation mode,\" immersing himself in complete concentration in order to plan every pitch he would pitch while on the mound. During this time, he would not talk to anyone except the manager or the pitching coach.

In 133.0 innings, he went 8\u20138 with a 4.20 ERA. He walked 39 batters, seven more than he had walked in 2003 when he had pitched twice as many innings. He later revealed that he had been injured throughout the entire season with a \"tired throwing arm\", which he believed was from intense workouts in preseason.\n\nThe [[2005 Toronto Blue Jays season|2005]] season began successfully for Halladay, as he posted a 12\u20134 record with a 2.41 ERA in 19 starts. He was selected to his third All-Star team and was slated to be the starting pitcher for the [[American League]] at the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] in [[Comerica Park|Detroit]]. However, on July 8, Halladay's leg was broken by a [[line drive]] off the bat of [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] left fielder [[Kevin Mench]].<ref name=\"ESPN1\" /> As a result, he was replaced in the All-Star Game by [[Matt Clement]] of the [[2005 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], while [[Mark Buehrle]] of the [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] was named the starting pitcher for the American League.

It marked the second-most appearances in club history, and Halladay's fourth as an All-Star. Although Halladay's strikeout total was lower in 2006 than in previous seasons, his [[ground ball/fly ball ratio]], complete games, and innings pitched were all among the American League leaders.\n\n====2007\u20132009====\nHalladay was the American League [[Pitcher of the Month|pitcher of the month]] in April [[2007 Toronto Blue Jays season|2007]], going 4\u20130, highlighted by a 10-inning complete game win over the [[2007 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. However, he pitched poorly in his two starts in May, and on May 11 was placed on the disabled list and underwent an [[appendectomy]]. He returned to the rotation in his usual form on May 31 against the [[Chicago White Sox]]. Halladay went 7 innings, giving up just six hits and allowing no runs on his way to his 100th career win. 2007 also saw Halladay hit his first career RBI. Against the [[2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] on June 10, his ground ball single to center field allowed [[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]] to score. He shut out the [[2007 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] on July 22, allowing only three hits.\n\nIn [[2008 Toronto Blue Jays season|2008]], for the sixth consecutive year, Halladay was Toronto's opening-day starter, improving his own club record.<ref name=\"YahooSports1\">{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/6134/news|title=Roy Halladay - Toronto - Major League Baseball - Yahoo!

His first win of the season came in his next start against Boston, when he outpitched [[Josh Beckett]] in his season debut.\n\nIn his third start, Halladay pitched a complete game against the [[2008 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]], in a 4\u20131 win. Three of his nine complete game efforts resulted in losses due to Toronto's underachieving offense early in the season. In fact, those three complete game losses came in three consecutive starts. On June 20 against the [[2008 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], he was struck in the temple by a line-drive off the bat of [[Nyjer Morgan]]. The ball caromed off Halladay's head and was caught by third baseman [[Scott Rolen]], ending the inning. Halladay was able to walk back to the dugout, but was taken out of the game for safety concerns. Although he was given a clean bill of health for his next start, it was later suggested by television commentators that Halladay may have in fact suffered a temporary lapse in recognition of what happened on the play. Halladay pitched his 10th career [[shutouts in baseball|shutout]] against the [[Seattle Mariners]] on June 30. He limited them to four hits in his sixth complete game of the season. The shutout tied him with the Cardinals' [[Mark Mulder]] for 10th among active pitchers. On July 11, 2008, Halladay pitched his 7th complete game and second shutout of the season against the New York Yankees, allowing 0 runs on 2 hits for his 38th career complete game. Halladay was named to the American League All-Star Team as a reserve. He pitched in the fourth inning, yielding only one hit and striking out [[Lance Berkman]]. In his last start of the season, he fittingly pitched a complete game against the Yankees to win his 20th game of the year. In so doing, he became the first pitcher to win five games against the Yankees in a single season since [[Luis Tiant]] in 1974. In addition, he led the AL with a 1.05 [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]].

Halladay's efficiency and durability were reflected in his total innings pitched every year, also due to his ability to strike out hitters and induce ground ball outs to escape jams. He often led the league in innings pitched and complete games, while ranking among the leaders in WHIP and ERA.\n\nPrior to and during each start, Halladay had a distinct trademark in which he went into a complete \"isolation mode,\" immersing himself in complete concentration in order to plan every pitch he would pitch while on the mound. During this time, he would not talk to anyone except the manager or the pitching coach. He would not even reply to a \"hello\" or wave from a teammate or spectator, nor talk to the media until he had been relieved or completed the game.<ref name=\"Sports Illustrated\">{{cite news|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Why+is+baseball%27s+best+pitcher+also+the+hardest+worker+in+-+04.05.10+-+SI+Vault&expire=&urlID=423852833&fb=Y&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1167875%2F1%2Findex.htm&partnerID=289881|title=What Makes Roy Run|date=April 5, 2010|access-date=August 2, 2010|first=Tom|last=Verducci|work=Sports Illustrated}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Personal life==\nHalladay had two children, Braden and Ryan,<ref name=\"family\" /> with his wife, Brandy (n\u00e9e Gates).

The sports body responsible for determining which substances are banned in athletics is the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA).\n\nTypically, any athlete who tests positive for banned substances after having served a previous ban receives a lifetime ban from the sport of athletics. Many high-profile sportspeople to receive doping bans have come from the sport of athletics, with significant past cases concerning [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]], [[Lance Armstrong]], [[Alberto Contador]], [[Shane Warne]], [[Diego Maradona]], [[Shoaib Akhtar]], [[Marion Jones]] and [[Tim Montgomery]]. Furthermore, a number of athletes who underwent state-sponsored [[Doping in East Germany|doping programmes in East Germany]] and the [[Doping in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] between the 1950s and 1980s were competitors in athletics, but the quality of the international anti-doping work was so poor that only one East German athlete ever tested positive.<ref name=Berendonk/> Following allegations of state-sponsored [[doping in Russia]], the IAAF suspended the country's athletes from competition, including the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\n{{Compact

Athletes who are found to have used such banned substances, whether through a positive drugs test, the [[biological passport]] system, an investigation or public admission, may receive a competition [[Ban (law)|ban]] for a length of time which reflects the severity of the infraction. Athletes who are found to have banned substances in their possession, or who tamper with or refuse to submit to drug testing can also receive bans from the sport. Competitive bans may also be given to athletes who test positive for prohibited [[recreational drugs]] or stimulants with little performance-enhancing effect for competitors in athletics. The sports body responsible for determining which substances are banned in athletics is the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA).\n\nTypically, any athlete who tests positive for banned substances after having served a previous ban receives a lifetime ban from the sport of athletics. Many high-profile sportspeople to receive doping bans have come from the sport of athletics, with significant past cases concerning [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]], [[Lance Armstrong]], [[Alberto Contador]], [[Shane Warne]], [[Diego Maradona]], [[Shoaib Akhtar]], [[Marion Jones]] and [[Tim Montgomery]]. Furthermore, a number of athletes who underwent state-sponsored [[Doping in East Germany|doping programmes in East Germany]] between the 1960s and 1980s were competitors in athletics, but the quality of the international anti-doping work was so poor that only one East German athlete ever tested positive.<ref name=Berendonk/> Following allegations of state-sponsored [[doping in Russia]], the IAAF

Modern [[LHB Coaches]] with a MPS (Maximum Permissible Speed) of 160 Kmph are more comfortable. The new coaches, based on a German technology Linke Hoffman Busch (LHB), are made of stainless steel which do not turn turtle during accidents.

In 2011, the town hosted the 51st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Extent of municipal area===\nThe maximum distance from the northern town border to the southern border is {{convert|7.2|km|0|abbr=on}} the maximum distance from east to west is {{convert|13.0|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n'''Altitude'''\n*Krebsm\u00fchle (Wei\u00dfkirchen): 138 m above sea level\n*Town Hall: 198 m above sea level\n*Hohemark: 300 m above sea level\n*The nearly Grosse Feldberg is the highest spot in the [[Taunus]]: 820 m above sea level\n\n===Neighbouring communities===\nTo the north Oberursel borders with [[Schmitten, Germany|Schmitten]], to the east with [[Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he]], to the south-east with [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], to the southwest with [[Steinbach (Taunus)|Steinbach]] and to the west with [[Kronberg]].\n\n===Town districts===\nBesides the town centre (including [[Bommersheim]]), Oberursel is divided into the districts [[Oberstedten]] (population 6,118), [[Stierstadt]] (5,541) and [[Wei\u00dfkirchen (Oberursel)]] (5,151). Bommersheim was annexed before the municipal reform of 1972 and therefore is not an independent district.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stadtplan Oberursel (Historisch).png|thumb|left|Oberursel town wall]]\n[[File:Ou-marktplatz001.jpg|thumb|Old town hall at market place]] \n[[File:St.ursula003.jpg|thumb|Footpath from market place to ''St Ursula'']]\n\nThe town was first mentioned as \"Ursella\" in 791 in a deed recording a donation to the monastery [[Lorsch]]. In the year 880 the first church in the area, called \"monasterium ad ursellam\", was mentioned. In 1317 the first trading activities were documented. \nIn 1444 Oberursel was officially sanctioned as a town. Two years later, the town wall was finished. Since the town was growing so fast in the 15th century the town walls had to be expanded in 1481 towards the east. In the early 16th century a school for Latin language was established next to the church.\n\n1535 Oberursel become property of [[Earl Ludwig von Stolberg-K\u00f6nigstein]] and becomes a Protestant town.\n1557 [[Nicolaus Henricus]] built the first [[printing plant]] in Oberursel.\n1605 due to the [[counter-reformation]] Oberursel becomes [[Catholic]] again.\nThe most important industry in the late Middle Ages and in the early modern times was the [[cloth merchant|clothier]] business.\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] the town was destroyed three times, in 1622 and 1645, and the number of inhabitants decreased from 1,600 to 600. During the 1645 razing, most buildings were destroyed by fire; the three surviving buildings were the old town hall, the bakery, and one apartment house near the marketplace. This is the reason why nearly all houses in the old town of Oberursel are from the 17th century.\n\nAs the town was rebuilt and grew, many mills and forges were founded along the \"Urselbachtal\".\nBy 1858, [[industrialisation]] had begun in Oberursel, with several cotton-spinning mills being built.\nIn 1860 Oberursel was linked to the railway between [[Bad Homburg]] and [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]].\nIn 1899 a subway was opened privately in the direction of Hohemark (currently Line U3).\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], many captured American and British airmen passed through Oberursel as they were interrogated and processed into the German POW camp system at the \"Durchgangslager der Luftwaffe\" or \"Transit Camp of the Luftwaffe\" located in the town. The camp name was commonly shortened to [[Dulag luft|\"Dulag Luft\"]], or simply \"Dulag\". Almost all allied airmen who were shot down and captured spent some time at that camp before being moved to their permanent assigned \"[[Stalag]]\".\n\nAfter the occupation of Oberursel by the U.S. in April 1945, the \"Dulag\" area was taken over by the US Army.\nThe existing buildings were transformed into [[Camp King]], which began as an intelligence post, then later a transportation post until its de-activation in 1993.

It is located to the north west of [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], in the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] county. It is the 14th smallest town in [[Hesse]]. In 2011, the town hosted the 51st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Extent of municipal area===\nThe maximum distance from the northern town border to the southern border is {{convert|7.2|km|0|abbr=on}} the maximum distance from east to west is {{convert|13.0|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n'''Altitude'''\n*Krebsm\u00fchle (Wei\u00dfkirchen): 138 m above sea level\n*Town Hall: 198 m above sea level\n*Hohemark: 300 m above sea level\n*The nearly Grosse Feldberg is the highest spot in the [[Taunus]]: 820 m above sea level\n\n===Neighbouring communities===\nTo the north Oberursel borders with [[Schmitten, Germany|Schmitten]], to the east with [[Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he]], to the south-east with [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], to the southwest with [[Steinbach (Taunus)|Steinbach]] and to the west with [[Kronberg]].\n\n===Town districts===\nBesides the town centre (including [[Bommersheim]]), Oberursel is divided into the districts [[Oberstedten]] (population 6,118), [[Stierstadt]] (5,541) and [[Wei\u00dfkirchen (Oberursel)]] (5,151). Bommersheim was annexed before the municipal reform of 1972 and therefore is not an independent district.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stadtplan Oberursel (Historisch).png|thumb|left|Oberursel town wall]]\n[[File:Ou-marktplatz001.jpg|thumb|Old town hall at market place]] \n[[File:St.ursula003.jpg|thumb|Footpath from market place to ''St Ursula'']]\n\nThe town was first mentioned as \"Ursella\" in 791 in a deed recording a donation to the monastery [[Lorsch]]. In the year 880 the first church in the area, called \"monasterium ad ursellam\", was mentioned. In 1317 the first trading activities were documented. \nIn 1444 Oberursel was officially sanctioned as a town. Two years later, the town wall was finished. Since the town was growing so fast in the 15th century the town walls had to be expanded in 1481 towards the east. In the early 16th century a school for Latin language was established next to the church.\n\n1535 Oberursel become property of [[Earl Ludwig von Stolberg-K\u00f6nigstein]] and becomes a Protestant town.\n1557 [[Nicolaus Henricus]] built the first [[printing plant]] in Oberursel.\n1605 due to the [[counter-reformation]] Oberursel becomes [[Catholic]] again.\nThe most important industry in the late Middle Ages and in the early modern times was the [[cloth merchant|clothier]] business.\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] the town was destroyed three times, in 1622 and 1645, and the number of inhabitants decreased from 1,600 to 600. During the 1645 razing, most buildings were destroyed by fire; the three surviving buildings were the old town hall, the bakery, and one apartment house near the marketplace. This is the reason why nearly all houses in the old town of Oberursel are from the 17th century.\n\nAs the town was rebuilt and grew, many mills and forges were founded along the \"Urselbachtal\".\nBy 1858, [[industrialisation]] had begun in Oberursel, with several cotton-spinning mills being built.\nIn 1860 Oberursel was linked to the railway between [[Bad Homburg]] and [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]].\nIn 1899 a subway was opened privately in the direction of Hohemark (currently Line U3).\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], many captured American and British airmen passed through Oberursel as they were interrogated and processed into the German POW camp system at the \"Durchgangslager der Luftwaffe\" or \"Transit Camp of the Luftwaffe\" located in the town. The camp name was commonly shortened to [[Dulag luft|\"Dulag Luft\"]], or simply \"Dulag\". Almost all allied airmen who were shot down and captured spent some time at that camp before being moved to their permanent assigned \"[[Stalag]]\".\n\nAfter the occupation of Oberursel by the U.S. in April 1945, the \"Dulag\" area was taken over by the US Army.\nThe existing buildings were transformed into [[Camp King]], which began as an intelligence post, then later a transportation post until its de-activation in 1993. Today the former Camp King is a residential area, still populated by several former US soldiers.\n\n===Growth===\nIn 1929 [[Bommersheim]] was annexed; in 1972 [[Oberstedten]], [[Stierstadt]] and [[Wei\u00dfkirchen (Oberursel)|Wei\u00dfkirchen]] followed.\n\n===Number of Inhabitants===\n[[File:Oberursel altstadt.jpg|thumb|350px|Old town view from St. Ursula church.]]\n:1542: 1,100\n:1618: 1,600\n:1648: 600\n:1799: 7,999\n:1972 (before annexations): 25,000\n:1972 (after annexations): 37,000\n:2001: 42,736\n:2005: 42,839\n:2006: 43,165\n\n==Politics==\nSince the 2016 municipal elections the city council has the following distribution of seats:<ref>\"[http://www.statistik-hessen.de/k2016/html/EG434008.htm Ergebnis der Gemeindewahl am 6.

While Ram is a money-minded, egoistic, selfish but cowardly millionaire, Raj is an intelligent, brave and selfless young man. Though Raj worships his brother, Ram considers the former as an outcast and uses him only when required. The story takes a turn when Raj is falsely accused of murdering Inspector Mallayya whom he had earlier beaten and jailed in the prison where there is another enemy of Raj in a political gangster. However, Raj manages to escape to meet his brother and prove his innocence only to find that the latter has been murdered in his farmhouse. After secretly cremating Ram, Raj returns to the city in guise of Ram to prove his innocence and find his brother's killer. As he begins his investigation he is confronted by [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] officer Sethurama Iyer aka Iyer. Iyer who is tasked with finding Raj wishes to interrogate Ram (in reality Raj). He, however, reveals that he suspects some foul play and does not believe that the Ram in the office is in fact the real Ram. In order to clear his doubts he hires a network of spies to keep an eye on Raj and goes to an extent of brutally torturing Raj's friends so as to prove that the person who dons the appearance of Ram is Raj. While trying to convince the officer, he starts to receive mysterious calls from an anonymous employee of Ram who claims to know the real identity of Raj and threatens to expose it if he continues his drama as Ram. What happens later forms the crux of the story.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Darshan (actor)|Darshan]] as Ram and Raj\n* [[Navya Nair]] as Rani\n* [[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]] as Sethurama Iyer\n* [[Rekha Vedavyas]] as Sonu\n* [[Umashri]] as Lakshmi \n* [[Sumithra (actress)|Sumithra]] as Ram and Raj's mother \n* [[Rangayana Raghu]] as Nandu\n* [[Bullet Prakash]] as Kumara \n* Killer Venkatesh as Inspector Mallayya \n* [[Supreeth]] as Chotta Bhai\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[V.

Raghuraj]], who turns into direction from photo-journalism. [[Darshan (actor)|Darshan]] and [[Navya Nair]] are the lead pair of the film. [[V. Harikrishna]] has composed the music for the film. This film also features popular Tamil actor [[Prabhu Ganesan]] playing the role of a CBI officer.\n\nThe film was successful but not in a huge on box-office. Subsequently, the film was dubbed in Hindi as \"Double Boss\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://southymania.blogspot.in/2013/07/new-south-movie-double-boss.html|title=Boss Movie Dubbed in Hindi|publisher=Southy Mania|accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDespite being look-alike twins, Ram and Raj are complete opposites of each other. While Ram is a money-minded, egoistic, selfish but cowardly millionaire, Raj is an intelligent, brave and selfless young man. Though Raj worships his brother, Ram considers the former as an outcast and uses him only when required. The story takes a turn when Raj is falsely accused of murdering Inspector Mallayya whom he had earlier beaten and jailed in the prison where there is another enemy of Raj in a political gangster. However, Raj manages to escape to meet his brother and prove his innocence only to find that the latter has been murdered in his farmhouse. After secretly cremating Ram, Raj returns to the city in guise of Ram to prove his innocence and find his brother's killer. As he begins his investigation he is confronted by [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] officer Sethurama Iyer aka Iyer. Iyer who is tasked with finding Raj wishes to interrogate Ram (in reality Raj). He, however, reveals that he suspects some foul play and does not believe that the Ram in the office is in fact the real Ram. In order to clear his doubts he hires a network of spies to keep an eye on Raj and goes to an extent of brutally torturing Raj's friends so as to prove that the person who dons the appearance of Ram is Raj. While trying to convince the officer, he starts to receive mysterious calls from an anonymous employee of Ram who claims to know the real identity of Raj and threatens to expose it if he continues his drama as Ram. What happens later forms the crux of the story.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Darshan (actor)|Darshan]] as Ram and Raj\n* [[Navya Nair]] as Rani\n* [[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]] as Sethurama Iyer\n* [[Rekha Vedavyas]] as Sonu\n* [[Umashri]] as Lakshmi \n* [[Sumithra (actress)|Sumithra]] as Ram and Raj's mother \n* [[Rangayana Raghu]] as Nandu\n* [[Bullet Prakash]] as Kumara \n* Killer Venkatesh as Inspector Mallayya \n* [[Supreeth]] as Chotta Bhai\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[V.
