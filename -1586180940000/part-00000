Within that plain, terrain variations run in bands east to west. \n\nThe Baltic coast has two natural [[harbor]]s, the larger one in the [[Tricity, Poland|Gda\u0144sk-Gdynia]] region, and a smaller one near [[Szczecin]] in the far northwest. The northeastern region, also known as the [[Masurian Lake District]] with more than 2,000 lakes,<ref name=\"mazury.info\">[http://mazury.info.pl/ Masurian Lake District, at mazury.info.pl] &nbsp;{{in lang|pl}}</ref> is densely wooded and sparsely populated. To the south of the lake district, and across central Poland a vast region of plains extends all the way to the [[Sudeten mountains|Sudetes]] on the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] borders southwest, and to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] on the Czech, Slovak and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] borders southeast. The central lowlands had been formed by [[Glacier#Glacial erosion|glacial erosion]] in the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]. The neighboring countries are Germany to the west, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south, Ukraine and [[Belarus]] to the east, and [[Lithuania]] and the [[Russia]]n exclave of [[Kaliningrad]] to the northeast.\n\n==Topography==\nThe country extends 876 kilometers from north to south and 689 kilometers from east to west. The total area is {{convert|312,679|km2|sqmi}} and includes inland waters. The average [[elevation]] is 173 meters, and only 3% of Polish territory, along the southern border, is higher than 500 meters. The highest elevation is [[Rysy|Mount Rysy]], which rises 2,499 meters in the [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra]] Range of the Carpathian Mountains, 95 kilometers south of [[Krak\u00f3w]]. About 63 square kilometers along the [[Gulf of Gda\u0144sk]] are below sea level.

Along the eastern border, this zone reaches from the far northeast to within 200 kilometers of the southern border. The terrain in the central lowlands is quite flat, and earlier [[Glacier#Glacial erosion|glacial lakes]] have been filled by sediment. The region is cut by several major rivers, including the [[Oder River|Oder]] (Odra), which defines the [[Silesian Lowlands]] in the southwest, and the [[Vistula River|Vistula]] (Wisla), which defines the lowland areas of east-central Poland.\n\nTo the south of the lowlands are the lesser Poland uplands, a belt varying in width from 90 to 200 kilometers, formed by the gently sloping foothills of the Sudeten and Carpathian mountain ranges and the uplands that connect the ranges in southcentral Poland. The topography of this region is divided transversely into higher and lower elevations, reflecting its underlying [[geology|geological]] structure. In the western section, the Silesia-Krak\u00f3w Upthrust contains rich [[coal]] deposits.\n{{further|List of mountains in Poland}}\n\nThe third topographic area is located on either side of Poland's southern border and is formed by the Sudeten and Carpathian ranges. Within Poland, neither of these ranges is forbidding enough to prevent substantial habitation; the Carpathians are especially densely populated. The rugged form of the Sudeten range derives from the geological shifts that formed the later Carpathian uplift. The highest elevation in the Sudeten is [[\u015anie\u017cka]] (1,602 meters) in the [[Karkonosze Mountains]]. The Carpathians in Poland, formed as a discrete topographical unit in the relatively recent [[Tertiary|Tertiary Era]], are the highest mountains in the country. They are the northernmost edge of a much larger range that extends into the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]]. Within Poland the range includes two major basins, the [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] and [[Sandomierz]], which are rich in several minerals and [[natural gas]].\n\nTo the north of the central lowlands, the lake region includes [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest|primeval forests]] - one of the last  remaining in Europe and much of Poland's shrinking unspoiled natural habitat. Glacial action in this region formed lakes and low hills in the otherwise flat terrain adjacent to Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. Small lakes dot the entire northern half of Poland, and the glacial formations that characterize the lake region extend as much as 200 kilometers inland in western Poland. Wide river valleys divide the lake region into three parts. In the northwest, [[Pomerania]] is located south of the Baltic coastal region and north of the [[Warta River|Warta]] and [[Note\u0107]] rivers. [[Masuria]] occupies the remainder of northern Poland and features a string of larger lakes. Most of Poland's 9,300 lakes that are more than 10,000 square metres in area are located in the northern part of the lake region, where they occupy about 10% of the surface area.\n\nThe Baltic coastal plains are a low-lying region formed of sediments deposited by the sea. The coastline was shaped by the action of the rising sea after the [[Scandinavia]]n ice sheet retreated. The two major inlets in the smooth coast are the [[Pomeranian Bay]] on the German border in the far northwest and the Gulf of Gda\u0144sk in the east. The Oder River empties into the former, and the Vistula forms a large delta at the head of the latter. Sandbars with large dunes form lagoons and coastal lakes along much of the coast.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:\u015al\u0105skie Kamienie - D\u00edv\u010di Kameny.JPG|thumb|left|[[Granite]] [[outcrop]] [[\u015al\u0105skie Kamienie|Silesian Rocks]] at [[Krkono\u0161e|Karkonosze]] in the [[Sudetes]], south-western Poland]]\nThe geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the [[continental collision]] of [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] over the past 60&nbsp;million years on the one hand and the other by the [[Quaternary]] [[glacier|glaciations]] of northern Europe. Both processes shaped the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or [[loam]], while the ice age [[river valley]]s of the south often contain [[loess]]. The Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland, the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the [[Beskids]], and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Polish Jura Chain]] is one of the oldest [[mountain range]]s on earth.\n\n[[File:Giewont z Zakopanego.jpg|thumb|[[Giewont]] in the [[Tatra Mountains]]; the mountainous south is a popular destination for hikers]]\nPoland has 70 mountains over {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation, all in the [[Tatras]]. The Polish Tatras, which consist of the High Tatras and the Western Tatras, is the highest mountain group of Poland and of the entire Carpathian range. In the High Tatras lies Poland's highest point, the north-western [[summit]] of [[Rysy]], {{convert|2499|m|ft|0}} in elevation. At its foot lies the mountain lakes of [[Czarny Staw pod Rysami]] (Black Lake below Mount Rysy), and [[Morskie Oko]] (the Marine Eye).\n\nThe second highest mountain group in Poland is the Beskids, whose highest peak is [[Babia G\u00f3ra]], at {{convert|1725|m|ft|0}}. The next highest mountain groups is the [[Krkono\u0161e|Karkonosze]] in the [[Sudetes]], whose highest point is [[Sn\u011b\u017eka|\u015anie\u017cka]], at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0}}; [[\u015anie\u017cnik Mountains]] whose highest point is [[Kr\u00e1lick\u00fd Sn\u011b\u017en\u00edk|\u015anie\u017cnik]], at {{convert|1425|m|ft|0}}.\n\nTourists also frequent the [[Bieszczady Mountains]] in the far southeast of Poland, whose highest point in Poland is [[Tarnica]], with an elevation of {{convert|1346|m|ft|0}}, [[Gorce Mountains]] in [[Gorce National Park]], whose highest point is [[Turbacz]], with elevations {{convert|1310|m|ft|0}}, and the [[Pieniny National Park (Poland)|Pieniny National Park]] in the [[Pieniny|Pieniny Mountains]], whose highest point is [[Trzy Korony]] with elevations of {{convert|982|m|ft|0}} (the highest mountain of this range, [[Wysokie Ska\u0142ki]] (Wysoka), with elevations {{convert|1050|m|ft|0}}, is located outside of the national park). The lowest point in Poland \u2013 at {{convert|2|m|ft|1}} below sea level \u2013 is at Raczki Elbl\u0105skie, near [[Elbl\u0105g]] in the Vistula Delta.\n\n[[File:2 SPN 01.jpg|thumb|left|Dunes in [[S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park]]]]\n\nThe only [[desert]] located in Poland stretches over the [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie]] (the Coal Fields of [[D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza|D\u0105browa]]) region.

It is one of only five natural [[List of deserts#Europe|deserts in Europe]]. But also, it is the warmest desert that appears at this [[latitude]]. B\u0142\u0119d\u00f3w Desert was created thousands of years ago by a [[melting glacier]]. The specific geological structure has been of big importance. The average thickness of the sand layer is about {{convert|40|m|ft|0}}, with a maximum of {{convert|70|m|ft|0}}, which made the fast and deep [[drainage]] very easy.\n\nThe Baltic Sea activity in [[S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park]] created [[sand dunes]] which in the course of time separated [[Gda\u0144sk Bay|the bay]] from the sea. As waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move, at a speed of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|1}} meters per year. Some dunes are quite high \u2013 up to {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}. The highest peak of the park \u2013 Rowokol ({{convert|115|m|ft|0|disp=or}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]) \u2014 is also an excellent [[observation point]].\n\n==Land use==\n[[File:Bia\u0142a R\u0119ka Ojcowski PN.jpg|thumb|left|Forests of the [[Ojc\u00f3w National Park]]]]\n\nPoland is the fourth most forested country in Europe.

For the most part, Poland has a smooth coastline, which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds. This continual [[erosion]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] has formed cliffs, dunes, and spits, many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons, such as \u0141ebsko Lake in S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park.\n\nPrior to the end of the [[Second World War]] and subsequent [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|change in national borders]], Poland had only a very small coastline; this was situated at the end of the '[[Polish Corridor]]', the only internationally recognised Polish territory which afforded the country access to the sea. However, after World War II, the redrawing of Poland's borders and resulting 'shift' of the country's borders left it with a greatly expanded coastline, thus allowing for far greater access to the sea than was ever previously possible. The significance of this event, and importance of it to Poland's future as a major industrialised nation, was alluded to by the 1945 [[Poland's Wedding to the Sea|Wedding to the Sea]].\n\nThe largest spits are [[Hel Peninsula]] and the [[Vistula Spit]]. The largest Polish Baltic island is [[Wolin]]. The largest sea [[harbour]]s are [[Port of Szczecin|Szczecin]], [[Port of \u015awinouj\u015bcie|\u015awinouj\u015bcie]], [[Port of Gda\u0144sk|Gda\u0144sk]], [[Port of Gdynia|Gdynia]], [[Port of Police|Police]] and [[Port of Ko\u0142obrzeg|Ko\u0142obrzeg]].

About half the country is drained by the Vistula, which originates in the [[Silesian Beskids]] in far south-central Poland.\n\nThe [[Vistula Basin]] includes most of the eastern half of the country and is drained by a system of rivers that mainly join the Vistula from the east. One of the tributaries, the [[Bug River|Bug]], defines 280 kilometers of Poland's eastern border with Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nThe Oder and its major tributary, the [[Warta River|Warta]], and a few smaller rivers as [[K\u0142odnica]], [[Ma\u0142a Panew]], [[B\u00f3br]], [[Lusatian Neisse]] (Nysa \u0141u\u017cycka) and [[Ina (river)|Ina]], form a basin that drains the western third of Poland into the [[Bay of Szczecin]]. The drainage effect on a large part of Polish terrain is weak, however, especially in the lake region and the inland areas to its south. The predominance of [[swamp]]land, level terrain, and small, shallow lakes hinders large-scale movement of water. The rivers have two high-water periods per year. The first is caused by melting snow and ice dams in spring adding to the volume of lowland rivers; the second is caused by heavy rains in July.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map POL present.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] types of Poland]]\n[[File:Pla\u017ca w Pucku - kitesurfers - beach in Puck (4).jpg|thumb|The average daytime summer temperature at sea level along the Baltic coast is {{convert|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.<ref name=\"zalewszczecinski\">{{cite web|author =|url = http://zalewszczecinski.net/akweny/wybrzeze-morza-baltyckiego|title = Wybrze\u017ce Morza Ba\u0142tyckiego|work = www.zalewszczecinski.net|publisher =|pages =|page =|date =|accessdate = 16 November 2009|language=pl}}</ref> [[Bay of Puck]] (''Zatoka Pucka'')]]\n\nPoland's long-term and short-term weather patterns are made transitional and variable by the collision of diverse air masses above the country's surface. Maritime air moves across [[Western Europe]], [[Arctic]] air sweeps down from the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], and subtropical air arrives from the [[South Atlantic Ocean]]. Although the Polar air dominates for much of the year, its conjunction with warmer currents generally moderates temperatures and generates considerable [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], clouds, and fog. When the moderating influences are lacking, winter temperatures in mountain valleys may drop to a minimum of {{convert|-20|\u00b0C}}.\n\nThe spring arrives slowly in March or April, bringing mainly sunny days after a period of alternating wintertime and springtime conditions. Summer, which extends from June to August, is generally less humid than winter. Showers and thunderstorms alternate with dry sunny weather that is generated when southern and eastern winds prevail. Early autumn is generally sunny and warm before a period of rainy, colder weather in November begins the transition into winter. Winter, which may last from one to three months, brings frequent snowstorms but relatively low total precipitation.\n\n[[File:Tarnow Rynek 20080708 4153.jpg|thumb|left|A sunny morning in [[Tarn\u00f3w]]]]\nThe range of mean temperatures is {{convert|6|\u00b0C|1}} in the northeast to {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} in the southwest, but individual readings in Poland's regions vary widely by season. On the highest mountain peaks, the mean temperature is below {{convert|0|\u00b0C}}.

The other temperature extreme is in the southeast along the border with Ukraine, where the greatest seasonal differences occur and winter temperatures average 4.5&nbsp;\u00b0C below those in western Poland. The hottest cities in Poland are [[Tarn\u00f3w]], [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[S\u0142ubice]].\n\n[[File:Park zdrojowy, 1827, 1939, po 1945 (73).JPG|thumb|Summer in the Spa-Park in the resort of [[\u015awinouj\u015bcie]]]]\nThe average temperatures are rising,<ref>http://www.ekoedu.uw.edu.pl/rep/pdf/22fe31f808780c906db3ae3df0bb1728.pdf</ref> however.

A few areas, notably along the Vistula between [[Warsaw]] and the Baltic Sea and in the far northwest, average less than {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. In winter about half the precipitation in the lowlands and the entire amount in the mountains falls as snow. On average, precipitation in summer is twice of that in winter, providing a dependable supply of water for crops.

Within that plain, terrain variations run in bands east to west. \n\nThe Baltic coast has two natural [[harbor]]s, the larger one in the [[Tricity, Poland|Gda\u0144sk-Gdynia]] region, and a smaller one near [[Szczecin]] in the far northwest. The northeastern region, also known as the [[Masurian Lake District]] with more than 2,000 lakes,<ref name=\"mazury.info\">[http://mazury.info.pl/ Masurian Lake District, at mazury.info.pl] &nbsp;{{in lang|pl}}</ref> is densely wooded and sparsely populated. To the south of the lake district, and across central Poland a vast region of plains extends all the way to the [[Sudeten mountains|Sudetes]] on the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] borders southwest, and to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] on the Czech, Slovak and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] borders southeast. The central lowlands had been formed by [[Glacier#Glacial erosion|glacial erosion]] in the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]. The neighboring countries are Germany to the west, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south, Ukraine and [[Belarus]] to the east, and [[Lithuania]] and the [[Russia]]n exclave of [[Kaliningrad]] to the northeast.\n\n==Topography==\nThe country extends 876 kilometers from north to south and 689 kilometers from east to west. The total area is {{convert|312,679|km2|sqmi}} and includes inland waters. The average [[elevation]] is 173 meters, and only 3% of Polish territory, along the southern border, is higher than 500 meters. The highest elevation is [[Rysy|Mount Rysy]], which rises 2,499 meters in the [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra]] Range of the Carpathian Mountains, 95 kilometers south of [[Krak\u00f3w]]. About 63 square kilometers along the [[Gulf of Gda\u0144sk]] are below sea level.

Along the eastern border, this zone reaches from the far northeast to within 200 kilometers of the southern border. The terrain in the central lowlands is quite flat, and earlier [[Glacier#Glacial erosion|glacial lakes]] have been filled by sediment. The region is cut by several major rivers, including the [[Oder River|Oder]] (Odra), which defines the [[Silesian Lowlands]] in the southwest, and the [[Vistula River|Vistula]] (Wisla), which defines the lowland areas of east-central Poland.\n\nTo the south of the lowlands are the lesser Poland uplands, a belt varying in width from 90 to 200 kilometers, formed by the gently sloping foothills of the Sudeten and Carpathian mountain ranges and the uplands that connect the ranges in southcentral Poland. The topography of this region is divided transversely into higher and lower elevations, reflecting its underlying [[geology|geological]] structure. In the western section, the Silesia-Krak\u00f3w Upthrust contains rich [[coal]] deposits.\n{{further|List of mountains in Poland}}\n\nThe third topographic area is located on either side of Poland's southern border and is formed by the Sudeten and Carpathian ranges. Within Poland, neither of these ranges is forbidding enough to prevent substantial habitation; the Carpathians are especially densely populated. The rugged form of the Sudeten range derives from the geological shifts that formed the later Carpathian uplift. The highest elevation in the Sudeten is [[\u015anie\u017cka]] (1,602 meters) in the [[Karkonosze Mountains]]. The Carpathians in Poland, formed as a discrete topographical unit in the relatively recent [[Tertiary|Tertiary Era]], are the highest mountains in the country. They are the northernmost edge of a much larger range that extends into the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]]. Within Poland the range includes two major basins, the [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] and [[Sandomierz]], which are rich in several minerals and [[natural gas]].\n\nTo the north of the central lowlands, the lake region includes [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest|primeval forests]] - one of the last  remaining in Europe and much of Poland's shrinking unspoiled natural habitat. Glacial action in this region formed lakes and low hills in the otherwise flat terrain adjacent to Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. Small lakes dot the entire northern half of Poland, and the glacial formations that characterize the lake region extend as much as 200 kilometers inland in western Poland. Wide river valleys divide the lake region into three parts. In the northwest, [[Pomerania]] is located south of the Baltic coastal region and north of the [[Warta River|Warta]] and [[Note\u0107]] rivers. [[Masuria]] occupies the remainder of northern Poland and features a string of larger lakes. Most of Poland's 9,300 lakes that are more than 10,000 square metres in area are located in the northern part of the lake region, where they occupy about 10% of the surface area.\n\nThe Baltic coastal plains are a low-lying region formed of sediments deposited by the sea. The coastline was shaped by the action of the rising sea after the [[Scandinavia]]n ice sheet retreated. The two major inlets in the smooth coast are the [[Pomeranian Bay]] on the German border in the far northwest and the Gulf of Gda\u0144sk in the east. The Oder River empties into the former, and the Vistula forms a large delta at the head of the latter. Sandbars with large dunes form lagoons and coastal lakes along much of the coast.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:\u015al\u0105skie Kamienie - D\u00edv\u010di Kameny.JPG|thumb|left|[[Granite]] [[outcrop]] [[\u015al\u0105skie Kamienie|Silesian Rocks]] at [[Krkono\u0161e|Karkonosze]] in the [[Sudetes]], south-western Poland]]\nThe geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the [[continental collision]] of [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] over the past 60&nbsp;million years on the one hand and the other by the [[Quaternary]] [[glacier|glaciations]] of northern Europe. Both processes shaped the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or [[loam]], while the ice age [[river valley]]s of the south often contain [[loess]]. The Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland, the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the [[Beskids]], and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Polish Jura Chain]] is one of the oldest [[mountain range]]s on earth.\n\n[[File:Giewont z Zakopanego.jpg|thumb|[[Giewont]] in the [[Tatra Mountains]]; the mountainous south is a popular destination for hikers]]\nPoland has 70 mountains over {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation, all in the [[Tatras]]. The Polish Tatras, which consist of the High Tatras and the Western Tatras, is the highest mountain group of Poland and of the entire Carpathian range. In the High Tatras lies Poland's highest point, the north-western [[summit]] of [[Rysy]], {{convert|2499|m|ft|0}} in elevation. At its foot lies the mountain lakes of [[Czarny Staw pod Rysami]] (Black Lake below Mount Rysy), and [[Morskie Oko]] (the Marine Eye).\n\nThe second highest mountain group in Poland is the Beskids, whose highest peak is [[Babia G\u00f3ra]], at {{convert|1725|m|ft|0}}. The next highest mountain groups is the [[Krkono\u0161e|Karkonosze]] in the [[Sudetes]], whose highest point is [[Sn\u011b\u017eka|\u015anie\u017cka]], at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0}}; [[\u015anie\u017cnik Mountains]] whose highest point is [[Kr\u00e1lick\u00fd Sn\u011b\u017en\u00edk|\u015anie\u017cnik]], at {{convert|1425|m|ft|0}}.\n\nTourists also frequent the [[Bieszczady Mountains]] in the far southeast of Poland, whose highest point in Poland is [[Tarnica]], with an elevation of {{convert|1346|m|ft|0}}, [[Gorce Mountains]] in [[Gorce National Park]], whose highest point is [[Turbacz]], with elevations {{convert|1310|m|ft|0}}, and the [[Pieniny National Park (Poland)|Pieniny National Park]] in the [[Pieniny|Pieniny Mountains]], whose highest point is [[Trzy Korony]] with elevations of {{convert|982|m|ft|0}} (the highest mountain of this range, [[Wysokie Ska\u0142ki]] (Wysoka), with elevations {{convert|1050|m|ft|0}}, is located outside of the national park). The lowest point in Poland \u2013 at {{convert|2|m|ft|1}} below sea level \u2013 is at Raczki Elbl\u0105skie, near [[Elbl\u0105g]] in the Vistula Delta.\n\n[[File:2 SPN 01.jpg|thumb|left|Dunes in [[S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park]]]]\n\nThe only [[desert]] located in Poland stretches over the [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie]] (the Coal Fields of [[D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza|D\u0105browa]]) region.

It is one of only five natural [[List of deserts#Europe|deserts in Europe]]. But also, it is the warmest desert that appears at this [[latitude]]. B\u0142\u0119d\u00f3w Desert was created thousands of years ago by a [[melting glacier]]. The specific geological structure has been of big importance. The average thickness of the sand layer is about {{convert|40|m|ft|0}}, with a maximum of {{convert|70|m|ft|0}}, which made the fast and deep [[drainage]] very easy.\n\nThe Baltic Sea activity in [[S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park]] created [[sand dunes]] which in the course of time separated [[Gda\u0144sk Bay|the bay]] from the sea. As waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move, at a speed of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|1}} meters per year. Some dunes are quite high \u2013 up to {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}. The highest peak of the park \u2013 Rowokol ({{convert|115|m|ft|0|disp=or}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]) \u2014 is also an excellent [[observation point]].\n\n==Land use==\n[[File:Bia\u0142a R\u0119ka Ojcowski PN.jpg|thumb|left|Forests of the [[Ojc\u00f3w National Park]]]]\n\nPoland is the fourth most forested country in Europe.

For the most part, Poland has a smooth coastline, which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds. This continual [[erosion]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] has formed cliffs, dunes, and spits, many of which have migrated landwards to close off former lagoons, such as \u0141ebsko Lake in S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park.\n\nPrior to the end of the [[Second World War]] and subsequent [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|change in national borders]], Poland had only a very small coastline; this was situated at the end of the '[[Polish Corridor]]', the only internationally recognised Polish territory which afforded the country access to the sea. However, after World War II, the redrawing of Poland's borders and resulting 'shift' of the country's borders left it with a greatly expanded coastline, thus allowing for far greater access to the sea than was ever previously possible. The significance of this event, and importance of it to Poland's future as a major industrialised nation, was alluded to by the 1945 [[Poland's Wedding to the Sea|Wedding to the Sea]].\n\nThe largest spits are [[Hel Peninsula]] and the [[Vistula Spit]]. The largest Polish Baltic island is [[Wolin]].

About half the country is drained by the Vistula, which originates in the [[Silesian Beskids]] in far south-central Poland.\n\nThe [[Vistula Basin]] includes most of the eastern half of the country and is drained by a system of rivers that mainly join the Vistula from the east. One of the tributaries, the [[Bug River|Bug]], defines 280 kilometers of Poland's eastern border with Ukraine and Belarus.\n\nThe Oder and its major tributary, the [[Warta River|Warta]], and a few smaller rivers as [[K\u0142odnica]], [[Ma\u0142a Panew]], [[B\u00f3br]], [[Lusatian Neisse]] (Nysa \u0141u\u017cycka) and [[Ina (river)|Ina]], form a basin that drains the western third of Poland into the [[Bay of Szczecin]]. The drainage effect on a large part of Polish terrain is weak, however, especially in the lake region and the inland areas to its south. The predominance of [[swamp]]land, level terrain, and small, shallow lakes hinders large-scale movement of water. The rivers have two high-water periods per year. The first is caused by melting snow and ice dams in spring adding to the volume of lowland rivers; the second is caused by heavy rains in July.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map POL present.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] types of Poland]]\n[[File:Pla\u017ca w Pucku - kitesurfers - beach in Puck (4).jpg|thumb|The average daytime summer temperature at sea level along the Baltic coast is {{convert|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.<ref name=\"zalewszczecinski\">{{cite web|author =|url = http://zalewszczecinski.net/akweny/wybrzeze-morza-baltyckiego|title = Wybrze\u017ce Morza Ba\u0142tyckiego|work = www.zalewszczecinski.net|publisher =|pages =|page =|date =|accessdate = 16 November 2009|language=pl}}</ref> [[Bay of Puck]] (''Zatoka Pucka'')]]\n\nPoland's long-term and short-term weather patterns are made transitional and variable by the collision of diverse air masses above the country's surface. Maritime air moves across [[Western Europe]], [[Arctic]] air sweeps down from the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], and subtropical air arrives from the [[South Atlantic Ocean]]. Although the Polar air dominates for much of the year, its conjunction with warmer currents generally moderates temperatures and generates considerable [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], clouds, and fog. When the moderating influences are lacking, winter temperatures in mountain valleys may drop to a minimum of {{convert|-20|\u00b0C}}.\n\nThe spring arrives slowly in March or April, bringing mainly sunny days after a period of alternating wintertime and springtime conditions. Summer, which extends from June to August, is generally less humid than winter. Showers and thunderstorms alternate with dry sunny weather that is generated when southern and eastern winds prevail. Early autumn is generally sunny and warm before a period of rainy, colder weather in November begins the transition into winter. Winter, which may last from one to three months, brings frequent snowstorms but relatively low total precipitation.\n\n[[File:Tarnow Rynek 20080708 4153.jpg|thumb|left|A sunny morning in [[Tarn\u00f3w]]]]\nThe range of mean temperatures is {{convert|6|\u00b0C|1}} in the northeast to {{convert|10|\u00b0C}} in the southwest, but individual readings in Poland's regions vary widely by season.

The settlement now known as Pochutla was founded around the same time as nearby [[Loxicha]], [[Cozoaltepec]] and others. The area was part of the dominion of [[Tututepec]].<ref name=\"parroquia\"/>\nAt the time of the Spanish conquest, the Spanish town of Pochutla was founded by Pedro Molina, Isidro Salinas, Julio Diaz and others, initially with the name of Huehuetan. The locals were converted to Christianity and the first church was founded just south of the modern town and called San Pedro Huehuet\u00e1n Laguna. Much of the modern city is built on what was a lakebed. Because of illnesses such as [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], this lake was drained. Later in the colonial period, the name was changed to Pochutla due to the number of kapok trees in the area.<ref name=\"parroquia\"/>\n\nAccording to tradition and archeological evidence located in the hills of Vig\u00eda, Espino and El Cometa, there were arms hidden here by pirates, who were called Pichiling\u00fces.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nIn 1833, Conservative rebels led by General [[Valent\u00edn Canalizo]] fled through here as they were pursued by government troops. Their last battle was at the nearby Soledad Ranch in which they were destroyed by federal forces, forcing the remaining soldiers to scatter.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nConservative rebels continued to be active in this region until the 1860s with Jos\u00e9 Eustaquio Manzano and Apolonio Manzano leading the rebel cause, reinvigorated due to the passage of the Reform Laws. In 1858 and 1859, federal forces were dispatched here to subdue the rebels who had taken to guerrilla warfare. The last battle between the Manzano brothers and federal troops took place in 1860, with the brothers captured and taken to the state capital in 1861.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\nThe municipality has a petroleum reserve called Arag\u00f3n, five km from the community of Puerto Angel. The deposit was going to be exploited by an English company, who brought over equipment in 1937, but expropriation of oil in 1938 by President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] brought this to a halt. It has yet to be tapped.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nUntil late in the 20th century, much of the population of the area lived on subsistence farming, with the only work available during the harvest season on the coffee plantations. In the 1970, the state government expropriated most of the coastal land from Zipolite to Zapotengo and made it [[ejido]] or communal land with the aim of development.<ref name=\"parroquia\"/>\nDuring the [[2006 Oaxaca protests|2006 teachers strike]] in the state of Oaxaca, groups supporting and opposing the strike clashed here on the main road, Highway 175. The highway was blocked by those supporting the strike to prevent those opposing it from realizing their \u201cMarch for Education.\u201d  The highway was blocked with busses and cars preventing those bound for the state capital from leaving.<ref name=\"suarez\">{{cite news|title=Zafarrancho en Pochutla, Oaxaca |first=Reyes H\u00e9ctor |last=Suarez |url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/545447.html |newspaper=Noticieros Televisa |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2009-12-26 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Clearing out in Pochutla, Oaxaca |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925184522/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/545447.html |archivedate=2008-09-25 }}</ref> \n\nOther recent strikes include those by taxi drivers and others in transportation who have blocked roads resulting in monetary losses for the municipality.

The city also has the highest population density in the province of Laguna and in the whole [[Calabarzon]] region, having 14,000 people/km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n\n==History==\nSan Pedro de Tunas\u00e1n became a town on January 18, 1725, when King [[Charles II of Spain]] decreed that the town formerly known as \"Tabuko\" be a separate town from \"Kabullaw\" (now known as the city of [[Cabuyao, Laguna|Cabuyao]]).<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nBy virtue of the last will of [[Philip V of Spain]], Rodriguez de Figueroa or \"Don Esteban\", a group of Augustinian Fathers gained the ownership of the Tunas\u00e1n Estate. Later on, San Pedro became an hacienda of Colegio de San Jos\u00e9, a group of Jesuits friars who took over the property which now is known as \"San Pedro Tunas\u00e1n\". ''Tunas\u00e1n'' literally means \"a place where there is Tun\u00e1s\" (''Nymphaea nouchali''<ref>[http://www.stuartxchange.com/Lauas.html ''Nymphaea nouchali'']</ref>), a medicinal plant abundant on shoreline area.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nDuring that period, agriculture, fishing, duck raising, fruit trees, and sampaguita were the main source of income of its residents. This period was highlighted by the growing tenant/landlord dispute. The tenants of Hacienda San Pedro Tunas\u00e1n fought for their birthrights over their ancestral lands. This struggle took almost 423&nbsp;years of unsuccessful resistance to Colegio de San Jos\u00e9, and in 1938, the government bought the home sites of the San Pedro Tunas\u00e1n Hacienda from the Colegio for re-sale to its tenants. This event laid to rest the tenants/landlord problem in the town.\n\nIn the year 1902, the name ''San Pedro de Tunas\u00e1n'' was simplified to San Pedro.\n\nFrom the Spanish time until after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the scenario did change a bit, when on August 30, 1954, beginning to the Philippine Commonwealth forces against the Japanese, President [[Ramon Magsaysay|Ram\u00f3n Magsaysay]] signed at the historic town plaza the Land Tenancy Act. By virtue of this law, farm lots of the hacienda were bought by the Philippine government to be sold at cost to the tenants or occupants of the farm lots in [[Bayan-Bayanan]] under the Narra Settlement Project of the Magsaysay Administration.\n\n===Cityhood===\n[[File:SanPedro,Lagunahalljf2471 07.JPG|thumb|left|San Pedro City Hall]]\n\nOn March 27, 2013, President Benigno Aquino signed the 64-page Republic Act No. 10420<ref>http://www.gov.ph/2013/03/27/republic-act-no-10420/</ref> converting the municipality into a new component city of the province of Laguna.  The cityhood of San Pedro was ratified through a plebiscite scheduled by the [[Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC). The date for the ratification is December 28, 2013 after the National Barangay Elections.

Matthew 16:19: \u201dI will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d\n\n====Shapes and colors====\n\n* Circles have no beginning nor end. They protect, they endure, they restrict. They confine what's within and keep things out. They offer safety and connection. They suggest community, integrity, and perfection.\n* White is color at its most complete and pure, the color of perfection. It means purity, innocence, wholeness and completion. White is the base color of the logo.\n* The Red Circle suggests excitement, energy, passion, love, desire, speed, strength, power, thus contributing to the success of all things intense and passionate.\n* The Black Circle suggests power, sophistication, formality, and elegance.\n* The Green Circle suggests balance, growth and self-reliance.\n* Gold is the color of success, achievement and triumph. It is also associated with abundance and prosperity, luxury and quality, prestige and sophistication, value and elegance. Its color psychology implies affluence, material wealth and extravagance.\n* Blue stands for peace, tranquility, calm, stability, harmony, unity, trust, truth, confidence, conservatism, security, cleanliness, order, loyalty, sky, water, and technology. It is the color of trust and peace. It can suggest loyalty and integrity.\n* San Pedro Arch, the logo's main element, reflect the city's status as a gateway to and from Metro Manila, Laguna Province and the whole of Calabarzon.\n\n====Roosters====\n\n* These roosters, porched on the Arch, represent the incident where Peter denied Jesus, followed by the crowing of the roosters. The Christian world calls this the Incident of Repentance. For the crowing of the rooster was followed by Saint Peter's bitter cry and plea for forgiveness.\n\n====Keys====\n\n* The keys symbolize the power to enter the kingdom of heaven, and Saint Peter holding the keys tightly means he holds the most important thing that leads to heaven, that is Knowledge of God.\n* The Gold Ancient Keys in the Arch also represent greatness and power, among others. These keys symbolize the city's never-ending quest for opportunities that will contribute to its growth and progress.\n\n====Sampaguita garland====\n\n* This symbolizes San Pedro's distinction as the [[Sampaguita]] Capital of the Philippines. Some would question this title due to the absence now of a tangible heritage, which are the vast tracks of Sampaguita farms that gave rise to the Sampaguita industry in San Pedro during the olden times. But the claim to this title is justified by the fact that the city still owns the intangible heritage of having the most skillful and most creative makers of Sampaguita products in the country. Moreover, the Sampaguita Festival which is being celebrated annually by San Pedro is the only festival in the country which gives honor and recognition to the national flower.\n* The twenty Sampaguita buds forming a lei represent the 20 barangays of San Pedro. It also symbolizes unity and harmony among the city constituents. The number of buds may be increased through time should new barangays are created in the future.\n\n====Sun====\n\n* This Star is our logo's connection to the Philippine National Flag. Its 8 rays symbolize the 8 provinces (including Laguna) which first revolted against Spanish colonization during the 19th century.\n\n====Words and date====\n\n* The words and date of 2013 note the city's status as a component city of the province of Laguna and as part of the number of cities of the Philippines,  as well as the very year of the granting of its city charter. <small>'''NOTE:''' Approved by the Sangguniang Panlungsod on February 17, 2014 under Resolution 2014-26 and City Ordinance 2014\u201310.</small>\n\n==Notable people==\n\n=== Entertainment ===\n* [[Jane De Leon]], [[It's Showtime (variety show)| It's Showtime]] GirlTrend member, Actress. \n* [[Cacai Bautista]], comedian\n* [[Julia Clarete]], TV host, actress\n* [[John Lloyd Cruz]], actor, model\n*[[Ogie Diaz]], comedian, columnist and TV host\n*[[Paw Diaz]], actress\n*[[Marlann Flores]], actress\n*[[Kristine Hermosa]], actress\n*[[Jan Manual]], actor\n*[[Rocco Nacino]], actor\n*[[Jamilla Obispo]], actress\n*[[Gladys Reyes]], actress\n*[[Gladys Reyes#Biography|Christopher Roxas]], actor\n*[[Princess Snell]], actress\n*[[Nikki Valdez]], actress\n\n=== Music ===\n\n*[[Rico Blanco]], singer, former vocalist of [[Rivermaya]]\n\n=== Pageants ===\n\n* Jennifer Hammond - Miss Intercontinental 2016\n* [[Stephanie Retuya]], contestant and runner-up in ''[[Asia's Next Top Model (cycle 1)|Asia's Next Top Model]]'' (cycle 1)\n*[[Miss Universe 1984|Desiree Verdadero]], Miss Universe 1984 3rd runner-up\n\n=== Politics ===\n\n*[[Salvador Laurel]], [[List of Vice Presidents of the Philippines|8th]] [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President of the Philippines (under Corazon C.

The city also has the highest population density in the province of Laguna and in the whole [[Calabarzon]] region, having 14,000 people/km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n\n==History==\nSan Pedro de Tunas\u00e1n became a town on January 18, 1725, when King [[Charles II of Spain]] decreed that the town formerly known as \"Tabuko\" be a separate town from \"Kabullaw\" (now known as the city of [[Cabuyao, Laguna|Cabuyao]]).<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nBy virtue of the last will of [[Philip V of Spain]], Rodriguez de Figueroa or \"Don Esteban\", a group of Augustinian Fathers gained the ownership of the Tunas\u00e1n Estate. Later on, San Pedro became an hacienda of Colegio de San Jos\u00e9, a group of Jesuits friars who took over the property which now is known as \"San Pedro Tunas\u00e1n\". ''Tunas\u00e1n'' literally means \"a place where there is Tun\u00e1s\" (''Nymphaea nouchali''<ref>[http://www.stuartxchange.com/Lauas.html ''Nymphaea nouchali'']</ref>), a medicinal plant abundant on shoreline area.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nDuring that period, agriculture, fishing, duck raising, fruit trees, and sampaguita were the main source of income of its residents. This period was highlighted by the growing tenant/landlord dispute. The tenants of Hacienda San Pedro Tunas\u00e1n fought for their birthrights over their ancestral lands. This struggle took almost 423&nbsp;years of unsuccessful resistance to Colegio de San Jos\u00e9, and in 1938, the government bought the home sites of the San Pedro Tunas\u00e1n Hacienda from the Colegio for re-sale to its tenants. This event laid to rest the tenants/landlord problem in the town.\n\nIn the year 1902, the name ''San Pedro de Tunas\u00e1n'' was simplified to San Pedro.\n\nFrom the Spanish time until after the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the scenario did change a bit, when on August 30, 1954, beginning to the Philippine Commonwealth forces against the Japanese, President [[Ramon Magsaysay|Ram\u00f3n Magsaysay]] signed at the historic town plaza the Land Tenancy Act. By virtue of this law, farm lots of the hacienda were bought by the Philippine government to be sold at cost to the tenants or occupants of the farm lots in [[Bayan-Bayanan]] under the Narra Settlement Project of the Magsaysay Administration.\n\n===Cityhood===\n[[File:SanPedro,Lagunahalljf2471 07.JPG|thumb|left|San Pedro City Hall]]\n\nOn March 27, 2013, President Benigno Aquino signed the 64-page Republic Act No. 10420<ref>http://www.gov.ph/2013/03/27/republic-act-no-10420/</ref> converting the municipality into a new component city of the province of Laguna.  The cityhood of San Pedro was ratified through a plebiscite scheduled by the [[Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC). The date for the ratification is December 28, 2013 after the National Barangay Elections. It became the sixth city of Laguna after the cities of [[Bi\u00f1an]], [[Cabuyao]], [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], [[San Pablo, Laguna|San Pablo]] and [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], and also the third to be a city in the 1st congressional district of Laguna - making it the first city district in the province.\n\n[[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|COMELEC]] officially proclaimed the first-class municipality of San Pedro as a component city of Laguna on December 29, 2013. Juanito Icarro, regional director of Calabarzon and Mimaropa, and Marianne Marfori, provincial election supervisor, made the proclamation at the municipal hall after San Pedro residents voted for the cityhood in a plebiscite held on December 28, 2013. \"Yes\" votes for cityhood totaled 16,996 (which is an additional 50 votes added in some precincts mostly in the San Vicente area to win the \"yes\" vote), and \"no\" votes, only 869, in 501 clustered precincts in San Pedro. Only 11% of 165,777 registered voters in San Pedro's 20 barangays took part in the plebiscite.\n\n===San Pedro City eyed as 18th member of Metro Manila===\nSupport groups from the local government and non-government organizations are striving to incorporate San Pedro into [[Metro Manila]].<ref>http://www.pna.gov.ph/index.php?&sid=10++.&pfn=720424&arch=1&go=Go&search_arch&andor&mdte_arch=12&ddte_arch=30&ydte_arch=2014</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/san-pedro-city-eyed-as-18th-member-of-mmda/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231114421/http://www.mb.com.ph/san-pedro-city-eyed-as-18th-member-of-mmda/ |archivedate=2014-12-31 }}</ref>\n\nFormer [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority|Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA)]] Chairman [[Francis Tolentino]] is pushing for the inclusion of San Pedro City in the National Capital Region, and eventually become its 18th member city.

Matthew 16:19: \u201dI will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d\n\n====Shapes and colors====\n\n* Circles have no beginning nor end. They protect, they endure, they restrict. They confine what's within and keep things out. They offer safety and connection. They suggest community, integrity, and perfection.\n* White is color at its most complete and pure, the color of perfection. It means purity, innocence, wholeness and completion. White is the base color of the logo.\n* The Red Circle suggests excitement, energy, passion, love, desire, speed, strength, power, thus contributing to the success of all things intense and passionate.\n* The Black Circle suggests power, sophistication, formality, and elegance.\n* The Green Circle suggests balance, growth and self-reliance.\n* Gold is the color of success, achievement and triumph. It is also associated with abundance and prosperity, luxury and quality, prestige and sophistication, value and elegance. Its color psychology implies affluence, material wealth and extravagance.\n* Blue stands for peace, tranquility, calm, stability, harmony, unity, trust, truth, confidence, conservatism, security, cleanliness, order, loyalty, sky, water, and technology. It is the color of trust and peace. It can suggest loyalty and integrity.\n* San Pedro Arch, the logo's main element, reflect the city's status as a gateway to and from Metro Manila, Laguna Province and the whole of Calabarzon.\n\n====Roosters====\n\n* These roosters, porched on the Arch, represent the incident where Peter denied Jesus, followed by the crowing of the roosters. The Christian world calls this the Incident of Repentance. For the crowing of the rooster was followed by Saint Peter's bitter cry and plea for forgiveness.\n\n====Keys====\n\n* The keys symbolize the power to enter the kingdom of heaven, and Saint Peter holding the keys tightly means he holds the most important thing that leads to heaven, that is Knowledge of God.\n* The Gold Ancient Keys in the Arch also represent greatness and power, among others. These keys symbolize the city's never-ending quest for opportunities that will contribute to its growth and progress.\n\n====Sampaguita garland====\n\n* This symbolizes San Pedro's distinction as the [[Sampaguita]] Capital of the Philippines. Some would question this title due to the absence now of a tangible heritage, which are the vast tracks of Sampaguita farms that gave rise to the Sampaguita industry in San Pedro during the olden times. But the claim to this title is justified by the fact that the city still owns the intangible heritage of having the most skillful and most creative makers of Sampaguita products in the country. Moreover, the Sampaguita Festival which is being celebrated annually by San Pedro is the only festival in the country which gives honor and recognition to the national flower.\n* The twenty Sampaguita buds forming a lei represent the 20 barangays of San Pedro. It also symbolizes unity and harmony among the city constituents. The number of buds may be increased through time should new barangays are created in the future.\n\n====Sun====\n\n* This Star is our logo's connection to the Philippine National Flag. Its 8 rays symbolize the 8 provinces (including Laguna) which first revolted against Spanish colonization during the 19th century.\n\n====Words and date====\n\n* The words and date of 2013 note the city's status as a component city of the province of Laguna and as part of the number of cities of the Philippines,  as well as the very year of the granting of its city charter. <small>'''NOTE:''' Approved by the Sangguniang Panlungsod on February 17, 2014 under Resolution 2014-26 and City Ordinance 2014-10.</small>\n\n==Notable people==\n\n=== Entertainment ===\n* [[Jane De Leon]], [[It's Showtime (variety show)| It's Showtime]] GirlTrend member, Actress. \n* [[Cacai Bautista]], comedian\n* [[Julia Clarete]], TV host, actress\n* [[John Lloyd Cruz]], actor, model\n*[[Ogie Diaz]], comedian, columnist and TV host\n*[[Paw Diaz]], actress\n*[[Marlann Flores]], actress\n*[[Kristine Hermosa]], actress\n*[[Jan Manual]], actor\n*[[Rocco Nacino]], actor\n*[[Jamilla Obispo]], actress\n*[[Gladys Reyes]], actress\n*[[Gladys Reyes#Biography|Christopher Roxas]], actor\n*[[Princess Snell]], actress\n*[[Nikki Valdez]], actress\n\n=== Music ===\n\n*[[Rico Blanco]], singer, former vocalist of [[Rivermaya]]\n\n=== Pageants ===\n\n* Jennifer Hammond - Miss Intercontinental 2016\n* [[Stephanie Retuya]], contestant and runner-up in ''[[Asia's Next Top Model (cycle 1)|Asia's Next Top Model]]'' (cycle 1)\n*[[Miss Universe 1984|Desiree Verdadero]], Miss Universe 1984 3rd runner-up\n\n=== Politics ===\n\n*[[Salvador Laurel]], [[List of Vice Presidents of the Philippines|8th]] [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President of the Philippines (under Corazon C.
