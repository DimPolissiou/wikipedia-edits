Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here.

This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest.

This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\" <ref>(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)</ref> Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.\n\nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg.

Not only did he have a profound understanding of human anatomy due to his medical training, but he also understood animal biology and its role in human-animal trans-species boundaries in disease transmission.  At the time there was no way of knowing how important this connection would be to the history and discovery of vaccinations.

This left them seven points behind United, with two games to go, confirming the Manchester club as champions once more.\n\nThe three relegation spots were occupied by [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] who each lasted one season in the league, along with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] who went down after seven seasons.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2005\u201306 Football League Championship|Championship]]. The promoted teams were [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] (playing in the top flight for the first time ever), [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] (playing top flight football for the first time in twelve years) and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] (returning after a six-year absence). They replaced [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], ending their top flight spells of four, two and one year respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2006\u201307 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England

The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous youth and the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest prankster\". The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate [[practical joke]]s, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle.\n\nAndy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His antagonists include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney and usually tries to impress her. He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] when the [[freeze frame shot|screen freezes]] in [[black and white]] \u2013 a distinctive feature of the show referred to as \"Doodle Vision\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/new-cinegroupe-series-coming-teletoon-and-fox-family-channel|title=New Cinegroupe Series Coming To Teletoon And Fox Family Channel.|website=Animation World Network}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe first season of ''What's with Andy?'' was set in the United States. In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband who also used to be a prankster, known as \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\".

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!

The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous youth and the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest prankster\". The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate [[practical joke]]s, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle.\n\nAndy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His antagonists include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney and usually tries to impress her. He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] when the [[freeze frame shot|screen freezes]] in [[black and white]] \u2013 a distinctive feature of the show referred to as \"Doodle Vision\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/new-cinegroupe-series-coming-teletoon-and-fox-family-channel|title=New Cinegroupe Series Coming To Teletoon And Fox Family Channel.|website=Animation World Network}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe first season of ''What's with Andy?'' was set in the United States. In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband and presumably \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\".\n* '''Frieda Larkin''': Andy and Jen's mother and Al's wife.\n* '''Jennifer \"Jen\" Larkin''': Andy's older sister who is always cranky and irritable.

The series started airing on June 30, 2001<ref name=vancouversun /><ref name=crtclogs>{{cite web|url=ftp://support.crtc.gc.ca/logs/|title=Television Program Logs|date=2016-03-02|publisher=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/support_crtc_gc_ca15052016|archive-date=2016-05-16|url-status=live}}</ref> and ended on March 4, 2007.<ref name=crtclogs />\n\n==Production==\nThe show is based on [[Andy Griffiths (author)|Andy Griffiths]]' children's series of ''[[Just!]]'' books (which were illustrated by [[Terry Denton]]), although many episodes are not directly based on the books. Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!
