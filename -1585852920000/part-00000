It was the first time that the [[Olympic Games]] were held outside Europe.\n\nTensions caused by the [[Russo\u2013Japanese War]] and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis in 1904 may have contributed to the fact that very few top ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in these Games. Only 62 of the 651 athletes who competed came from outside North America, and only 12\u201315 nations were represented in all. Some events combined the U.S. national championship with the Olympic championship.<ref name=athletes_number>{{cite web|title=The Olympic Summer Games Factsheet|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Olympic_Summer_Games.pdf|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=August 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe current three-medal (gold, silver, and bronze for first, second, and third places) format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics.\n\n==Background==\n[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] won the bid to host the 1904 Summer Olympics,<ref name=\"stead1901\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/340/mode/2up | title=The Americanization of the World | publisher=Horace Markley | author=Stead, W. T. | year=1901 | pages=341}}</ref> but the organizers of the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in St. Louis would not accept another international event in the same timeframe.\n\nThe exposition organization began to plan for its own sports activities, informing the Chicago OCOG that its own international sports events intended to eclipse the Olympic Games unless they were moved to St. Louis. [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the modern Olympic movement, stepped in and awarded the Games to St. Louis.\n\n==The Games==\n===Highlights===\n[[File:Ainu archery - anthropological day - 1904 olympics.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Ainu people|Ainu]] man competing in an archery contest during \"[[Anthropology Days]]\"]]\n[[Boxing]], [[dumbbells]], [[freestyle wrestling]] and the [[decathlon]] made their debuts. The swimming events were held in a temporary pond near Skinker and Wydown Boulevards, where \"lifesaving demonstrations\" of unsinkable lifeboats for ocean liners took place. \n\nOne of the most remarkable athletes was the American gymnast [[George Eyser]], who won six medals even though his left leg was made of wood, and [[Frank Kugler]] won four medals in freestyle wrestling, weightlifting and tug of war, making him the only competitor to win a medal in three different sports at the same Olympic Games.\n[[File:1904 tug of war.jpg|thumb|left|A [[tug of war]] competition at the 1904 Summer Olympics]]\nChicago runner [[James Lightbody]] won the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] and the 800&nbsp;m and then set a world record in the 1500&nbsp;m. [[Harry Hillman]] won both the 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m hurdles and also the flat 400&nbsp;m. [[Sprint (running)|Sprinter]] [[Archie Hahn]] was champion in the 60&nbsp;m, 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m. In this last race, he set an Olympic record in 21.6, a record that stood for 28 years. In the [[Discus throw|discus]], after American [[Martin Sheridan]] had thrown exactly the same distance as his compatriot, [[Ralph Rose]] (39.28&nbsp;m), the judges gave them both an extra throw to decide the winner. Sheridan won the decider and claimed the gold medal. [[Ray Ewry]] again won all three standing jumps.\n\nThe team representing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] was awarded a total of two medals, both won by Irish athletes. The top non-USA athlete was [[Emil Rausch]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], who won three swimming events. [[Zolt\u00e1n Halmay]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Charles Daniels (swimmer)|Charles Daniels]] of the United States each won two swimming gold medals. [[Galt Football Club]] from Canada won the gold medal in [[association football|football]].\n\nThe organizers of the World's Fair held \"[[Anthropology Days]]\" on August 12 and 13. Since the [[1889 Paris Exposition]], [[human zoos]], as a key feature of world's fairs, functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race, progress, and civilization. These goals were followed also at the 1904 World's Fair. Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that showed them in their natural habitats.<ref>Parezo 2008, p. 63.</ref> Another 1600 indigenous people displayed their culture in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (LPE),<ref>Brownell 2008, p. 32.</ref> including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School,<ref>Peavy, Linda and Ursula Smith, 2008, p. 246.</ref> where [[Indian Residential School|American Indian boarding schools]] students demonstrated their successful [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation]]. The sporting event itself took place with the participation of about 100 paid indigenous men (no women participated in Anthropology Days, though some, notably the [[Fort Shaw Indian School]] girls basketball team, did compete in other athletic events at the LPE). Contests included \"baseball throwing, shot put, running, broad jumping, weight lifting, pole climbing, and tugs-of-war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand\".<ref>Parezo 2008, p. 59.</ref> According to theorist Susan Brownell, world's fairs \u2013 with their inclusion of human zoos \u2013 and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time, as they \"were both linked to an underlying cultural logic that gave them a natural affinity\".<ref>Brownell, 2008, p. 29.</ref> Also, one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events.<ref name=\"Parezo 2008, p. 84\">Parezo 2008, p. 84.</ref><ref>Brownell 2008, p. 34.</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n94 events<ref>The [http://www.olympic.org/st-louis-1904-summer-olympics IOC site for the 1904 Olympic Games] gives the figure of 91 events, while the [http://www.olympic.org/content/results-and-medalists/eventresultpagegeneral/?athletename=&country=&sport2=&games2=1904%2f1&event2=&mengender=true&womengender=true&mixedgender=true&goldmedal=true&silvermedal=true&bronzemedal=true&worldrecord=true&olympicrecord=false&teamclassification=true&individualclassification=true&winter=true&summer=true IOC database] lists 94.

It was the first time that the [[Olympic Games]] were held outside Europe.\n\nTensions caused by the [[Russo\u2013Japanese War]] and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis in 1904 may have contributed to the fact that very few top ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in these Games. Only 62 of the 651 athletes who competed came from outside North America, and only 12\u201315 nations were represented in all. Some events combined the U.S. national championship with the Olympic championship.<ref name=athletes_number>{{cite web|title=The Olympic Summer Games Factsheet|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Olympic_Summer_Games.pdf|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=August 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe current three-medal (gold, silver, and bronze for first, second, and third places) format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics.\n\n==Background==\n[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] won the bid to host the 1904 Summer Olympics,<ref name=\"stead1901\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/340/mode/2up | title=The Americanization of the World | publisher=Horace Markley | author=Stead, W. T. | year=1901 | pages=341}}</ref> but the organizers of the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in St. Louis would not accept another international event in the same timeframe.\n\nThe exposition organization began to plan for its own sports activities, informing the Chicago OCOG that its own international sports events intended to eclipse the Olympic Games unless they were moved to St. Louis. [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the modern Olympic movement, stepped in and awarded the Games to St. Louis.\n\n==The Games==\n===Highlights===\n[[File:Ainu archery - anthropological day - 1904 olympics.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Ainu people|Ainu]] man competing in an archery contest during \"[[Anthropology Days]]\"]]\n[[Boxing]], [[dumbbells]], [[freestyle wrestling]] and the [[decathlon]] made their debuts. The swimming events were held in a temporary pond near Skinker and Wydown Boulevards, where \"lifesaving demonstrations\" of unsinkable lifeboats for ocean liners took place. \n\nThe organizers of the World's Fair held \"[[Anthropology Days]]\" on August 12 and 13. Since the [[1889 Paris Exposition]], [[human zoos]], as a key feature of world's fairs, functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race, progress, and civilization. These goals were followed also at the 1904 World's Fair. Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that showed them in their natural habitats.<ref>Parezo 2008, p. 63.</ref> Another 1600 indigenous people displayed their culture in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (LPE),<ref>Brownell 2008, p. 32.</ref> including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School,<ref>Peavy, Linda and Ursula Smith, 2008, p. 246.</ref> where [[Indian Residential School|American Indian boarding schools]] students demonstrated their successful [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation]]. The sporting event itself took place with the participation of about 100 paid indigenous men (no women participated in Anthropology Days, though some, notably the [[Fort Shaw Indian School]] girls basketball team, did compete in other athletic events at the LPE). Contests included \"baseball throwing, shot put, running, broad jumping, weight lifting, pole climbing, and tugs-of-war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand\".<ref>Parezo 2008, p. 59.</ref> According to theorist Susan Brownell, world's fairs \u2013 with their inclusion of human zoos \u2013 and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time, as they \"were both linked to an underlying cultural logic that gave them a natural affinity\".<ref>Brownell, 2008, p. 29.</ref> Also, one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events.<ref name=\"Parezo 2008, p. 84\">Parezo 2008, p. 84.</ref><ref>Brownell 2008, p. 34.</ref>\n\nOne of the most remarkable athletes was the American gymnast [[George Eyser]], who won six medals even though his left leg was made of wood, and [[Frank Kugler]] won four medals in freestyle wrestling, weightlifting and tug of war, making him the only competitor to win a medal in three different sports at the same Olympic Games.\n[[File:1904 tug of war.jpg|thumb|left|A [[tug of war]] competition at the 1904 Summer Olympics]]\nChicago runner [[James Lightbody]] won the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]] and the 800&nbsp;m and then set a world record in the 1500&nbsp;m. [[Harry Hillman]] won both the 200&nbsp;m and 400&nbsp;m hurdles and also the flat 400&nbsp;m. [[Sprint (running)|Sprinter]] [[Archie Hahn]] was champion in the 60&nbsp;m, 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m. In this last race, he set an Olympic record in 21.6, a record that stood for 28 years. In the [[Discus throw|discus]], after American [[Martin Sheridan]] had thrown exactly the same distance as his compatriot, [[Ralph Rose]] (39.28&nbsp;m), the judges gave them both an extra throw to decide the winner. Sheridan won the decider and claimed the gold medal. [[Ray Ewry]] again won all three standing jumps.\n\nThe team representing [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] was awarded a total of two medals, both won by Irish athletes. The top non-USA athlete was [[Emil Rausch]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], who won three swimming events. [[Zolt\u00e1n Halmay]] of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Charles Daniels (swimmer)|Charles Daniels]] of the United States each won two swimming gold medals. [[Galt Football Club]] from Canada won the gold medal in [[association football|football]].\n\n==Sports==\n94 events<ref>The [http://www.olympic.org/st-louis-1904-summer-olympics IOC site for the 1904 Olympic Games] gives the figure of 91 events, while the [http://www.olympic.org/content/results-and-medalists/eventresultpagegeneral/?athletename=&country=&sport2=&games2=1904%2f1&event2=&mengender=true&womengender=true&mixedgender=true&goldmedal=true&silvermedal=true&bronzemedal=true&worldrecord=true&olympicrecord=false&teamclassification=true&individualclassification=true&winter=true&summer=true IOC database] lists 94.

The governing [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] was reelected, going from a minority to a majority government, and gave Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] his third term. The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], led by [[Robert Stanfield]], did well in the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]], and in the [[Western Canada|West]], but the Liberal support in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] ensured a majority Liberal government.\n\n==Overview ==\n\nThe previous election had resulted in the Liberals emerging as the largest party, but far short of a majority, and only two seats ahead of the Progressive Conservatives. They were able to form a government with the support of the [[New Democratic Party]], but the NDP withdrew their backing in May 1974 and voted with the Progressive Conservatives to bring down Trudeau's government in protest of a budget proposed by finance minister [[John Turner]], which the opposition parties felt did not go far enough to control spiralling [[inflation]].\n\nThe issue of inflation would become key in the election campaign. Stanfield had proposed a \"90-day wage and price freeze\" to break the momentum of inflation. Trudeau had ridiculed this policy as an intrusion on the rights of businesses and employees to set or negotiate their own prices and wages with the catch-phrase, \"Zap! You're frozen!\" In 1975, Trudeau introduced his own wage and price control system under the auspices of the \"Anti-Inflation Board\".\n\nWhile polls at the election's outset had projected that the Progressive Conservatives would at least win a minority government, they in fact lost nearly a dozen seats. The Conservative campaign was also hurt by other factors, including Stanfield giving what was considered to be a poor interview immediately after the vote of no confidence in Trudeau's government, in which he could not name any potential Tory policies for the forthcoming election, and then by a bungled photo op later in the campaign when he attempted to play catch with some assembled journalists, only to fumble and drop the football.\n\nThe New Democratic Party, led by [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], lost less than two-and-a-half percentage points in the popular vote, but lost almost half of their seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. It was the worst result in the party's history up until that point, with only their performances in [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993]] and [[2000 Canadian federal election|2000]] to date being worse. They were hurt principally by the collapse of their vote in British Columbia; having won the popular vote and most seats in the province two years prior, the NDP were almost totally wiped out there during this election, losing all but two of their seats and finishing a distant third behind the Liberals and Tories. Their poor showing was blamed primarily on Lewis strongly hinting prior to the election that he would back Stanfield over Trudeau in the event of another minority parliament - which may have caused left-wing voters to vote for the Liberals in order to keep the Tories out of power - and also by an unpopular mineral tax introduced by the provincial British Columbia government of [[Dave Barrett]], which would lead to Barrett's government suffering a landslide loss in the following year's [[1975 British Columbia general election|provincial election]].\n\nThe [[Social Credit Party of Canada]], led by [[R\u00e9al Caouette]], continued to lose ground, and fell to 11 seats, one short of the number required to be recognized as a party in the House of Commons (and therefore qualify for research funds and parliamentary committee memberships). This status was nonetheless extended to the party by the governing Liberals, who believed that Social Credit's support came primarily at the expense of the Tories.\n\nOne seat was won in [[New Brunswick]] by independent candidate [[Leonard Jones]]. Jones, the former mayor of [[Moncton]], had secured the Progressive Conservative nomination, but PC leader Stanfield refused to sign Jones' nomination papers because he was a vocal opponent of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]], which the PC Party supported.  Jones had opposed providing services in French in the City of Moncton even though 30% of the city's population was [[francophone]]. Jones ran and won as an independent. After the election, Social Credit leader Caouette invited Jones to join the Socred caucus, which would have given that party enough members for official status. Caouette justified the invitation on the basis that Jones agreed with providing bilingual education at the primary school level. Jones declined Caouette's invitation, and sat as an independent.\n\nOf the four major party leaders, only Trudeau would remain in place for the following federal election five years later. Stanfield, having failed to defeat the Liberals in any of his three elections as leader, faced pressure to stand down and eventually did so in 1976, being succeeded by [[Joe Clark]]. Lewis's position was rendered untenable by the loss of his own seat, and he was forced to stand down within a year of the election (though it later transpired that he had intended to retire in 1975 regardless of the election result, as he had secretly been battling [[leukaemia]]); [[Ed Broadbent]] initially replaced him as interim leader, and was subsequently elected to the position permanently. Caouette, who had only been able to play a minimal role in the election due to injuries sustained in a snowmobiling accident, stood down as leader of the Socreds in late 1976 and died not long afterwards; a succession of leaders took charge in the years ahead, ultimately leaving [[Fabien Roy]] as the man who would lead them into the next election.\n\n==National results==\n[[File:Chambre des

The governing [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] was reelected, going from a minority to a majority government, and gave Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] his third term. The [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]], led by [[Robert Stanfield]], did well in the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]], and in the [[Western Canada|West]], but the Liberal support in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] ensured a majority Liberal government.\n\n==Overview ==\n\nThe previous election had resulted in the Liberals emerging as the largest party, but far short of a majority, and only two seats ahead of the Progressive Conservatives. They were able to form a government with the support of the [[New Democratic Party]], but the NDP withdrew their backing in May 1974 and voted with the Progressive Conservatives to bring down Trudeau's government in protest of a budget proposed by finance minister [[John Turner]], which the opposition parties felt did not go far enough to control spiralling [[inflation]].\n\nThe issue of inflation would become key in the election campaign. Stanfield had proposed a \"90-day wage and price freeze\" to break the momentum of inflation. Trudeau had ridiculed this policy as an intrusion on the rights of businesses and employees to set or negotiate their own prices and wages with the catch-phrase, \"Zap! You're frozen!\" In 1975, Trudeau introduced his own wage and price control system under the auspices of the \"Anti-Inflation Board\".\n\nWhile polls at the election's outset had projected that the Progressive Conservatives would at least win a minority government, they in fact lost nearly a dozen seats. The Conservative campaign was also hurt by other factors, including Stanfield giving what was considered to be a poor interview immediately after the vote of no confidence in Trudeau's government, in which he could not name any potential Tory policies for the forthcoming election, and then by a bungled photo op later in the campaign when he attempted to play catch with some assembled journalists, only to fumble and drop the football.\n\nThe New Democratic Party, led by [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], lost less than two-and-a-half percentage points in the popular vote, but lost almost half of their seats in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. It was the worst result in the party's history up until that point, with only their performances in [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993]] and [[2000 Canadian federal election|2000]] to date being worse. They were hurt principally by the collapse of their vote in British Columbia; having won the popular vote and most seats in the province two years prior, the NDP were almost totally wiped out there during this election, losing all but two of their seats and finishing a distant third behind the Liberals and Tories. Their poor showing was blamed primarily on Lewis strongly hinting prior to the election that he would back Stanfield over Trudeau in the event of another minority parliament - which may have caused left-wing voters to vote for the Liberals in order to keep the Tories out of power - and also by an unpopular mineral tax introduced by the provincial British Columbia government of [[Dave Barrett]], which would lead to Barrett's government suffering a landslide loss in the following year's [[1975 British Columbia general election|provincial election]].\n\nThe [[Social Credit Party of Canada]], led by [[R\u00e9al Caouette]], continued to lose ground, and fell to 11 seats, one short of the number required to be recognized as a party in the House of Commons (and therefore qualify for research funds and parliamentary committee memberships). This status was nonetheless extended to the party by the governing Liberals, who believed that Social Credit's support came primarily at the expense of the Tories.\n\nOne seat was won in [[New Brunswick]] by independent candidate [[Leonard Jones]]. Jones, the former mayor of [[Moncton]], had secured the Progressive Conservative nomination, but PC leader Stanfield refused to sign Jones' nomination papers because he was a vocal opponent of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]], which the PC Party supported.  Jones had opposed providing services in French in the City of Moncton even though 30% of the city's population was [[francophone]]. Jones ran and won as an independent. After the election, Social Credit leader Caouette invited Jones to join the Socred caucus, which would have given that party enough members for official status. Caouette justified the invitation on the basis that Jones agreed with providing bilingual education at the primary school level. Jones declined Caouette's invitation, and sat as an independent.\n\nOf the four major party leaders, only Trudeau would remain in place for the following federal election five years later. Stanfield, having failed to defeat the Liberals in any of his three elections as leader, faced pressure to stand down and eventually did so in 1976, being succeeded by [[Joe Clark]]. Lewis's position was rendered untenable by the loss of his own seat, and he was forced to stand down within a year of the election (though it later transpired that he had intended to retire in 1975 regardless of the election result, as he had secretly been battling [[leukaemia]]); [[Ed Broadbent]] initially replaced him as interim leader, and was subsequently elected to the position permanently. Caouette, who had only been able to play a minimal role in the election due to injuries sustained in a snowmobiling accident, stood down as leader of the Socreds in late 1976 and died not long afterwards; a succession of leaders took charge in the years ahead, ultimately leaving [[Fabien Roy]] as the man who would lead them into the next election.\n\n==National results==\n[[File:Chambre des

The earliest recorded syllables are on tablets written around 2800 BC in the [[Sumer]]ian city of [[Ur]]. This shift from [[pictogram]]s to syllables has been called \"the most important advance in the [[history of writing]]\".<ref>[[Geoffrey Blainey]], ''[[A Short History of the World (Geoffrey Blainey)|A Short History of the World]]'', p.87, citing J.T.

Similar terms include '''disyllable''' (and ''disyllabic''; also ''bisyllable'' and ''bisyllabic'') for a word of two syllables; '''trisyllable''' (and ''trisyllabic'') for a word of three syllables; and '''polysyllable''' (and ''polysyllabic''), which may refer either to a word of more than three syllables or to any word of more than one syllable.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Syllable'' is an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] variation of [[Old French]] ''sillabe'', from [[Latin]] ''syllaba'', from [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ae}} ''syllab\u1e17'' ({{IPA-grc|syl\u02d0ab\u025b\u030c\u02d0}}).<!-- This is actually a Classical-era, not Koine, pronunciation, because Help:IPA/Greek only supports Classical pronunciation at the moment. --> {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ae}} means \"what is taken together\", referring to letters that are taken together to make a single sound.<ref>{{OEtymD|syllable|accessdate=2015-01-05}}</ref>\n\n{{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ae}} is a verbal noun from the verb {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9}} ''syllamb\u00e1n\u014d'', a compound of the preposition {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd}} ''s\u00fdn'' \"with\" and the verb {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9}} ''lamb\u00e1n\u014d'' \"take\".<ref>{{LSJ|lamba/nw|\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9|ref}}</ref> The noun uses the [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2-}}, which appears in the [[Aorist (Ancient Greek)|aorist]] tense; the [[Ancient Greek verbs#Present tense|present tense]] stem {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd-}} is formed by adding a [[nasal infix]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|\u03bc}}}} ''{{angbr|m}}'' before the {{lang|grc|\u03b2}} ''b'' and a [[suffix]] {{lang|grc|-\u03b1\u03bd}} ''-an'' at the end.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=\u00a7523: present stems formed by suffixes containing {{lang|grc|\u03bd}}}}</ref>\n\n==Transcription==\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the period {{angbr IPA|.}} marks syllable breaks, as in the word \"astronomical\" {{angbr IPA|/\u02cc\u00e6s.tr\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m.\u026ak.\u0259l/}}.\n\nIn practice, however, IPA transcription is typically divided into words by spaces, and often these spaces are also understood to be syllable breaks. In addition, the stress mark {{angbr IPA|\u02c8}} is placed immediately before a stressed syllable, and when the stressed syllable is in the middle of a word, the stress mark also marks a syllable break, for example in the word \"understood\" {{angbr IPA|/\u028cnd\u0259r\u02c8st\u028ad/}}.\n\nWhen a word space comes in the middle of a syllable (that is, when a syllable spans words), a tie bar {{angbr IPA|\u203f}} can be used for [[liaison (French)|liaison]], as in the French combination ''les amis'' {{angbr IPA|/le.z\u203fa.mi/}}. The liaison tie is also used to join lexical words into [[phonological word]]s, for example ''hot dog'' {{angbr IPA|/\u02c8h\u0252t\u203fd\u0252\u0261/}}.\n\nA Greek sigma, {{angbr|\u03c3}}, is used as a wild card for 'syllable', and a dollar/peso sign, {{angbr|$}}, marks a syllable boundary where the usual period might be misunderstood. For example, {{angbr|\u03c3\u03c3}} is a pair of syllables, and {{angbr|V$}} is a syllable-final vowel.\n\n== Components ==\n{{Unreferencedsect|date=September 2018}} \n[[Image:Syllable.svg|thumb|Syllable components as a [[directed graph]]]]\n[[Image:Syllable illustration 1.svg|thumb|Segmental model for ''cat'' and ''sing'']]\n\n=== Typical model ===\n\nIn the typical theory{{fact|date=September 2018}} of syllable structure, the general structure of a syllable (\u03c3) consists of three segments. These segments are grouped into two components:\n\n; [[#Onset|Onset]] (\u03c9): a [[consonant]] or [[consonant cluster]], obligatory in some languages, optional or even restricted in others\n; [[#Rime|Rime]] (\u03c1): right branch, contrasts with onset, splits into nucleus and coda\n:; [[#Nucleus|Nucleus]] (\u03bd): a [[vowel]] or [[syllabic consonant]], obligatory in most languages\n:; [[#Coda|Coda]] (\u03ba): consonant, optional in some languages, highly restricted or prohibited in others\n\nThe syllable is usually considered right-branching, i.e. nucleus and coda are grouped together as a \"rime\" and are only distinguished at the second level.\n\nThe ''nucleus'' is usually the vowel in the middle of a syllable. The ''onset'' is the sound or sounds occurring before the nucleus, and the ''coda'' (literally 'tail') is the sound or sounds that follow the nucleus. They are sometimes collectively known as the ''shell''. The term ''rime'' covers the nucleus plus coda. In the one-syllable English word ''cat'', the nucleus is ''a'' (the sound that can be shouted or sung on its own), the onset ''c'', the coda ''t'', and the rime ''at''. This syllable can be abstracted as a ''consonant-vowel-consonant'' syllable, abbreviated ''CVC''.  Languages vary greatly in the restrictions on the sounds making up the onset, nucleus and coda of a syllable, according to what is termed a language's [[phonotactics]].\n\nAlthough every syllable has supra-segmental features, these are usually ignored if not semantically relevant, e.g. in [[tonal language]]s.\n\n; [[Tone (linguistics)|Tone]] (\u03c4): may be carried by the syllable as a whole or by the rime\n\n=== Chinese model ===\n{{anchor|initial}}{{anchor|medial}}{{anchor|final}}\n[[Image:Chinese syllable tree.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Traditional Chinese syllable structure]]\n\nIn [[Sinitic Languages|Chinese]] syllable structure, the onset is replaced with an initial, and a semivowel or liquid forms another segment, called the medial. These four segments are grouped into two slightly different components:{{example needed |date=September 2017}}<!-- Example needed, like the examples of \"cat\" and \"sing\". -->\n\n; [[#Initial|Initial]] (\u03b9): optional onset, excluding sonorants\n; [[#Final|Final]] (\u03c6): medial, nucleus, and final consonant<ref>More generally, the letter \u03c6 indicates a prosodic [[foot (prosody)|foot]] of two syllables</ref>\n:; [[#Medial|Medial]] (\u03bc): optional semivowel or liquid<ref>More generally, the letter \u03bc indicates a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]</ref>\n:; [[#Nucleus|Nucleus]] (\u03bd): a [[vowel]] or syllabic consonant\n:; [[#Coda|Coda]] (\u03ba): optional final consonant\n\nIn many languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the syllable structure is expanded to include an additional, optional segment known as a '''medial''', which is located between the onset (often termed the ''initial'' in this context) and the rime.  The medial is normally a [[semivowel]], but reconstructions of [[Old Chinese]] generally include [[liquid consonant|liquid]] medials ({{IPA|/r/}} in modern reconstructions, {{IPA|/l/}} in older versions), and many reconstructions of [[Middle Chinese]] include a medial contrast between {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}, where the {{IPA|/i/}} functions phonologically as a glide rather than as part of the nucleus.  In addition, many reconstructions of both Old and Middle Chinese include complex medials such as {{IPA|/rj/}}, {{IPA|/ji/}}, {{IPA|/jw/}} and {{IPA|/jwi/}}.  The medial groups phonologically with the rime rather than the onset, and the combination of medial and rime is collectively known as the '''final'''.\n\nSome linguists, especially when discussing the modern Chinese varieties, use the terms \"final\" and \"rime/rhyme\" interchangeably.  In [[historical Chinese phonology]], however, the distinction between \"final\" (including the medial) and \"rime\" (not including the medial) is important in understanding the [[rime dictionary|rime dictionaries]] and [[rime table]]s that form the primary sources for [[Middle Chinese]], and as a result most authors distinguish the two according to the above definition.\n\n=== Grouping of components ===\n\n[[Image:Syllable onset rhyme.png|640px]]\n[[Image:Syllable illustration 2.svg|thumb|Hierarchical model for ''cat'' and ''sing'']]\n[[Image:Syllable body coda.png|thumb|upright=2.5]]\n\nIn some theories of phonology, syllable structures are displayed as [[Parse tree|tree diagrams]] (similar to the trees found in some types of syntax). Not all phonologists agree that syllables have internal structure; in fact, some phonologists doubt the existence of the syllable as a theoretical entity.<ref>See [http://www.cunyphonologyforum.net/syllable.php CUNY Conference on the Syllable] for discussion of the theoretical existence of the syllable.</ref>\n\nThere are many arguments for a hierarchical relationship, rather than a linear one, between the syllable constituents. One hierarchical model groups the syllable nucleus and coda into an intermediate level, the ''rime''.  The hierarchical model accounts for the role that the ''nucleus''+''coda'' constituent plays in verse (i.e., rhyming words such as ''cat'' and ''bat'' are formed by matching both the nucleus and coda, or the entire rime), and for the [[Syllable weight|distinction between heavy and light syllables]], which plays a role in phonological processes such as, for example, [[sound change]] in [[Old English]] ''scipu'' and ''wordu''.<ref>{{cite book | title = A Prosodic Grammar of Chinese | last = Feng | first = Shengli | page = 3 | publisher = University of Kansas | year = 2003}}</ref>{{Elucidate|date=November 2016}}\n\n==== Body ====\n\nIn some traditional descriptions of certain languages such as [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], the syllable is considered left-branching, i.e. onset and nucleus group below a higher-level unit, called a \"body\" or \"core\". This contrasts with the coda.\n<!-- (\u03c0) [not in diagram yet] --> <!-- July 1 2017 - left this comment (to the left) here, pretty sure the image to the right is a diagram of this? -->\n\n==== Rime ====\n\nThe '''rime''' or '''rhyme''' of a syllable consists of a [[#Nucleus|nucleus]] and an optional [[#Coda|coda]].  It is the part of the syllable used in most [[Rhyme|poetic rhyme]]s, and the part that is lengthened or stressed when a person elongates or stresses a word in speech.\n\nThe rime is usually the portion of a syllable from the first [[vowel]] to the end.  For example, {{IPA|/\u00e6t/}} is the rime of all of the words ''at'', ''sat'', and ''flat''.  However, the nucleus does not necessarily need to be a vowel in some languages.  For instance, the rime of the second syllables of the words ''bottle'' and ''fiddle'' is just {{IPA|/l/}}, a [[liquid consonant]].\n\nJust as the rime branches into the nucleus and coda, the nucleus and coda may each branch into multiple [[phoneme]]s. The limit for the number of phonemes which may be contained in each varies by language.  For example, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and most [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] do not have consonant clusters at the beginning or end of syllables, whereas many Eastern European languages can have more than two consonants at the beginning or end of the syllable.  In English, the onset, nucleus, and coda may all have two phonemes, as in the word ''flouts'': [fl] in the onset, the [[diphthong]] [a\u028a] in the nucleus, and [ts] in the coda.\n\n''Rime'' and ''rhyme'' are variants of the same word, but the rarer form ''rime'' is sometimes used to mean specifically ''syllable rime'' to differentiate it from the concept of poetic [[rhyme]]. This distinction is not made by some linguists and does not appear in most dictionaries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples <br><small>C = consonant, V = vowel, optional components are in parentheses.</small>\n! structure: !! syllable = !! onset !! + rhyme\n|-\n!

The name is a metaphor, based on the nucleus or coda having lines that branch in a tree diagram.\n\nIn some languages, heavy syllables include both VV (branching nucleus) and VC (branching rime) syllables, contrasted with V, which is a '''light syllable'''.\nIn other languages, only VV syllables are considered heavy, while both VC and V syllables are light.\nSome languages distinguish a third type of '''superheavy syllable''', which consists of VVC syllables (with both a branching nucleus and rime) or VCC syllables (with a coda consisting of two or more consonants) or both.\n\nIn [[mora (linguistics)|moraic theory]], heavy syllables are said to have two moras, while light syllables are said to have one and superheavy syllables are said to have three. [[Japanese phonology]] is generally described this way.\n\nMany languages forbid superheavy syllables, while a significant number forbid any heavy syllable.  Some languages strive for constant syllable weight; for example, in stressed, non-final syllables in [[Italian language|Italian]], short vowels co-occur with closed syllables while long vowels co-occur with open syllables, so that all such syllables are heavy (not light or superheavy).\n\nThe difference between heavy and light frequently determines which syllables receive [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] \u2013 this is the case in [[Latin]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], for example.  The system of [[meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] in many classical languages, such as [[Classical Greek]], [[Classical Latin]], [[Tamil language|Old Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], is based on syllable weight rather than stress (so-called ''quantitative rhythm'' or ''quantitative meter'').\n\n==Syllabification==\n{{see also|Syllabification|Phonotactics|Sonority hierarchy}}\n'''Syllabification''' is the separation of a word into syllables, whether spoken or written. In most languages, the actually spoken syllables are the basis of syllabification in writing too. Due to the very weak correspondence between sounds and letters in the spelling of modern English, for example, written syllabification in English has to be based mostly on etymological i.e. morphological instead of phonetic principles. English written syllables therefore do not correspond to the actually spoken syllables of the living language.\n\nPhonotactic rules determine which sounds are allowed or disallowed in each part of the syllable. [[English language|English]] allows very complicated syllables; syllables may begin with up to three consonants (as in ''string'' or ''splash''), and occasionally end with as many as four (as in ''prompts'').  Many other languages are much more restricted; [[Japanese language|Japanese]], for example, only allows {{IPA|/\u0274/}} and a [[chroneme]] in a coda, and theoretically has no consonant clusters at all, as the onset is composed of at most one consonant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shibatani |first=Masayoshi |chapter=Japanese |pages=855\u201380 |title=The World's Major Languages |editor=Bernard Comrie |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-19-520521-9}}</ref>\n\n===Ambisyllabicity===\nThere can be disagreement about the location of some divisions between syllables in spoken language. The problems of dealing with such cases have been most commonly discussed with relation to English. In the case of a word such as \"hurry\", the division may be {{IPA|/h\u028cr.i/}} or {{IPA|/h\u028c.ri/}}, neither of which seems a satisfactory analysis for a non-rhotic accent such as RP (British English): {{IPA|/h\u028cr.i/}} results in a syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}}, which is not normally found, while {{IPA|/h\u028c.ri/}} gives a syllable-final short stressed vowel, which is also non-occurring. Arguments can be made in favour of one solution or the other: Wells (2002)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/syllabif.htm |title=Wells: Syllabification and allophony |website=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref> proposes a general rule that \"Subject to certain conditions ..., consonants are syllabified with the more strongly stressed of two flanking syllables\", while many other phonologists prefer to divide syllables with the consonant or consonants attached to the following syllable wherever possible. However, an alternative that has received some support is to treat an intervocalic consonant as ''ambisyllabic'', i.e. belonging both to the preceding and to the following syllable: {{IPA|/h\u028c\u1e5bi/}}. This is discussed in more detail in {{Section link|English phonology|Phonotactics}}.\n\n===Onset===\nThe '''onset''' (also known as '''anlaut''') is the consonant sound or sounds at the beginning of a syllable, occurring before the [[#Nucleus|nucleus]]. Most syllables have an onset. Syllables without an onset may be said to have a ''[[zero (linguistics)|zero]] onset'' &ndash; that is, nothing where the onset would be.\n\n====Onset cluster====\nSome languages restrict onsets to be only a single consonant, while others allow multiconsonant onsets according to various rules. For example, in English, onsets such as ''pr-'', ''pl-'' and ''tr-'' are possible but ''tl-'' is not, and ''sk-'' is possible but ''ks-'' is not. In [[Greek language|Greek]], however, both ''ks-'' and ''tl-'' are possible onsets, while contrarily in [[Classical Arabic]] no multiconsonant onsets are allowed at all.\n\n====Null onset====\nSome languages forbid '''null onsets'''. In these languages, words beginning in a vowel, like the English word ''at'', are impossible.\n\nThis is less strange than it may appear at first, as most such languages allow syllables to begin with a phonemic [[glottal stop]] (the sound in the middle of English \"uh-oh\" or, in some dialects, the double T in \"button\", represented in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] as {{IPA|/\u0294/}}).  In English, a word that begins with a vowel may be pronounced with an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] glottal stop when following a pause, though the glottal stop may not be a [[phoneme]] in the language.\n\nFew languages make a phonemic distinction between a word beginning with a vowel and a word beginning with a glottal stop followed by a vowel, since the distinction will generally only be audible following another word. However, [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and some [[Polynesian languages]] do make such a distinction, as in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] {{IPA|/ahi/}} \"fire\" and {{IPA|/\u0294ahi}}/ \"tuna\".\n\n[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] forbid empty onsets. The names ''Israel'', ''Abel'', ''Abraham'', ''Iran'', ''Omar'', ''Abdullah'', and ''Iraq'' appear not to have onsets in the first syllable, but in the original Hebrew and Arabic forms they actually begin with various consonants: the semivowel {{IPAslink|j}} in ''yisr\u0101\u0294\u0113l'', the glottal fricative in {{IPAslink|h}} ''he\u1e05el'', the glottal stop {{IPAslink|\u0294}} in ''\u0294a\u1e05r\u0101h\u0101m'' and ''\u0294\u012br\u0101n'', or the pharyngeal fricative {{IPAslink|\u0295}} in ''\u0295umar'', ''\u0295abdu\u1e37\u1e37\u0101h'', and ''\u0295ir\u0101q''. Conversely, the [[Arrernte language]] of central Australia may prohibit onsets altogether; if so, all syllables have the [[underlying representation|underlying shape]] VC(C).<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4179048|title = Arrernte: A Language with No Syllable Onsets|journal = Linguistic Inquiry|volume = 30|issue = 1|pages = 1\u201325|last1 = Breen|first1 = Gavan|last2 = Pensalfini|first2 = Rob|year = 1999|doi = 10.1162/002438999553940|url = https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209796/UQ209796_OA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe difference between a syllable with a null onset and one beginning with a glottal stop is often purely a difference of [[phonology|phonological]] analysis, rather than the actual pronunciation of the syllable.  In some cases, the pronunciation of a (putatively) vowel-initial word when following another word \u2013 particularly, whether or not a glottal stop is inserted \u2013 indicates whether the word should be considered to have a null onset.  For example, many [[Romance languages]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] never insert such a glottal stop, while [[English language|English]] does so only some of the time, depending on factors such as conversation speed; in both cases, this suggests that the words in question are truly vowel-initial.  But there are exceptions here, too.  For example, standard [[German language|German]] (excluding many southern accents) and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] both require that a glottal stop be inserted between a word and a following, putatively vowel-initial word. Yet such words are said to begin with a vowel in German but a glottal stop in Arabic. The reason for this has to do with other properties of the two languages. For example, a glottal stop does not occur in other situations in German, e.g. before a consonant or at the end of word. On the other hand, in Arabic, not only does a glottal stop occur in such situations (e.g. Classical {{IPA|/sa\u0294ala/}} \"he asked\", {{IPA|/ra\u0294j/}} \"opinion\", {{IPA|/d\u02e4aw\u0294/}} \"light\"), but it occurs in alternations that are clearly indicative of its phonemic status (cf. Classical {{IPA|/ka\u02d0tib/}} \"writer\" vs. /mak{{IPA|tu\u02d0b/}} \"written\", {{IPA|/\u0294a\u02d0kil/}} \"eater\" vs. {{IPA|/ma\u0294ku\u02d0l/}} \"eaten\").\n\nThe writing system of a language may not correspond with the phonological analysis of the language in terms of its handling of (potentially) null onsets.  For example, in some languages written in the [[Latin alphabet]], an initial glottal stop is left unwritten;{{examples|date=February 2015}} on the other hand, some languages written using non-Latin alphabets such as [[abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s have a special [[zero consonant]] to represent a null onset.  As an example, in [[Hangul]], the alphabet of the [[Korean language]], a null onset is represented with \u3147 at the left or top section of a [[grapheme]], as in \uc5ed \"station\", pronounced ''yeok'', where the [[diphthong]] ''yeo'' is the nucleus and ''k'' is the coda.\n\n===Nucleus===\n[[File:Syllable onset nucleus coda.png|375px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ Examples of syllable nuclei\n|-\n!

Generally, every syllable requires a nucleus (sometimes called the ''peak''), and the minimal syllable consists only of a nucleus, as in the English words \"eye\" or \"owe\". The syllable nucleus is usually a vowel, in the form of a [[monophthong]], [[diphthong]], or [[triphthong]], but sometimes is a [[syllabic consonant]].\n\nIn most [[Germanic language]]s, [[tenseness|lax vowels]] can occur only in closed syllables. Therefore, these vowels are also called [[Checked and free vowels|checked vowels]], as opposed to the tense vowels that are called ''free vowels'' because they can occur even in open syllables.\n\n====Consonant nucleus====\n{{Main|Syllabic consonant}}\nThe notion of syllable is challenged by languages that allow long strings of [[obstruent]]s without any intervening vowel or [[sonorant]].  By far the most common syllabic consonants are sonorants like {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[r]}}, {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}} or {{IPA|[\u014b]}}, as in English ''bott'''le''''', ''ch'''ur'''ch'' (in rhotic accents), ''rhyth'''m''''', ''butt'''on''''' and ''lock {{'}}'''n''' key''. However, English allows syllabic obstruents in a few para-verbal [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] utterances such as ''shh'' (used to command silence) and ''psst'' (used to attract attention). All of these have been analyzed as phonemically syllabic. Obstruent-only syllables also occur phonetically in some prosodic situations when unstressed vowels elide between obstruents, as in ''potato'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u02c8te\u026a\u027e\u0259\u028a]}} and ''today'' {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u02c8de\u026a]}}, which do not change in their number of syllables despite losing a syllabic nucleus.\n\nA few languages have so-called ''[[syllabic fricative]]s'', also known as ''fricative vowels'', at the phonemic level. (In the context of [[Standard Chinese phonology|Chinese phonology]], the related but non-synonymous term ''apical vowel'' is commonly used.) [[Mandarin Chinese]] is famous for having such sounds in at least some of its dialects, for example the [[pinyin]] syllables ''s\u012b sh\u012b r\u012b'', sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[s\u017a\u0329 \u0282\u0290\u0329\u0301 \u0290\u0290\u0329\u0301]}} respectively. Though, like the nucleus of rhotic English ''church'', there is debate over whether these nuclei are consonants or vowels.\n\nLanguages of the northwest coast of North America, including [[Salishan languages|Salishan]], [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan]] and [[Chinookan languages|Chinookan]] languages, allow [[stop consonant]]s and [[voiceless fricative]]s as syllables at the phonemic level, in even the most careful enunciation. An example is Chinook {{IPA|[\u026ct\u02b0p\u02b0t\u0361\u0283\u02b0k\u02b0t\u02b0]}} 'those two women are coming this way out of the water'. Linguists have analyzed this situation in various ways, some arguing that such syllables have no nucleus at all and some arguing that the concept of \"syllable\" cannot clearly be applied at all to these languages.\n\nOther examples:\n; [[Nux\u00e1lk language|Nux\u00e1lk]] (Bella Coola)\n: {{IPA|[\u026c\u03c7\u02b7t\u02b0\u026ct\u0361s\u02b0x\u02b7]}} 'you spat on me'\n: {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u02bck\u02b0t\u02b0sk\u02b7\u02b0t\u0361s\u02bc]}} 'he arrived'\n: {{IPA|[x\u026cp\u02bc\u03c7\u02b7\u026ct\u02b0\u026cp\u02b0\u026c\u026cs]}} 'he had in his possession a bunchberry plant'<ref>(Bagemihl 1991:589, 593, 627)</ref>\n: {{IPA|[sxs]}} 'seal blubber'\n\nIn Bagemihl's survey of previous analyses, he finds that the Bella Coola word {{IPA|/t\u0361s\u02bcktsk\u02b7t\u0361s\u02bc/}} 'he arrived' would have been parsed into 0, 2, 3, 5, or 6 syllables depending on which analysis is used. One analysis would consider all vowel and consonant segments as syllable nuclei, another would consider only a small subset ([[fricative]]s or [[sibilant]]s) as nuclei candidates, and another would simply deny the existence of syllables completely. However, when working with recordings rather than transcriptions, the syllables can be obvious in such languages, and native speakers have strong intuitions as to what the syllables are.\n\nThis type of phenomenon has also been reported in [[Berber languages]] (such as Indlawn Tashlhiyt Berber), [[Moroccan Arabic]] (apparently under Berber influence), [[Mon\u2013Khmer languages]] (such as [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Temiar language|Temiar]], [[Khmu language|Khmu]]) and the \u014cgami dialect of [[Miyako language|Miyako]], a [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/52/95/98/PDF/irl-ogami.pdf |title=Ogami (Miyako Ryukyuan) |author=Thomas Pellard |website=Halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>\n; Indlawn Tashlhiyt Berber\n: {{IPA|[tftktst tfktstt]}} 'you sprained it and then gave it'\n: {{IPA|[rkkm]}} 'rot' (imperf.)<ref>(Dell & Elmedlaoui 1985, 1988)</ref>\n; Semai\n: {{IPA|[kckmr\u0294\u025b\u02d0c]}} 'short, fat arms'<ref>(Sloan 1988)</ref>\n\n===Coda===\nThe '''coda''' (also known as '''auslaut''') comprises the [[consonant]] sounds of a syllable that follow the [[#Nucleus|nucleus]]. The sequence of nucleus and coda is called a [[#Rime|rime]]. Some syllables consist of only a nucleus, only an onset and a nucleus with no coda, or only a nucleus and coda with no onset.\n\nThe [[phonotactics]] of many languages forbid syllable codas. Examples are [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]. In others, codas are restricted to a small subset of the consonants that appear in onset position. At a phonemic level in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], for example, a coda may only be a nasal (homorganic with any following consonant) or, in the middle of a word, [[gemination]] of the following consonant. (On a phonetic level, other codas occur due to elision of /i/ and /u/.) In other languages, nearly any consonant allowed as an onset is also allowed in the coda, even [[consonant cluster|clusters of consonants]]. In English, for example, all onset consonants except {{IPA|/h/}} are allowed as syllable codas.\n\nIf the coda consists of a consonant cluster, the sonority decreases from left to right, as in the English word ''help''. This is called the sonority profile.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Harrington and Felicity Cox |url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonology/syllable/syll_phonotactic.html |title=The Syllable and Phonotactic Constraints |website=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref> English onset and coda clusters are therefore different. The onset ''str'' in ''strengths'' does not appear as a coda in any English word, and likewise the coda ''ngths'' does not appear as an onset in any word.\n\n{{anchor|open syllable|checked syllable|closed syllable}}\n\n====Open and closed====\n{{Redirect|Checked syllable|checked syllables in Chinese|Checked tone}}\nA coda-less syllable of the form V, CV, CCV, etc. (V = vowel, C = consonant) is called an '''open syllable''' or '''free syllable''', while a syllable that has a coda (VC, CVC, CVCC, etc.) is called a '''closed syllable''' or '''checked syllable'''.  Note that they have nothing to do with [[open vowel|open]] and [[close vowel]]s, but are defined according to the phoneme that ends the syllable: a vowel (open syllable) or a consonant (closed syllable). Almost all languages allow open syllables, but some, such as [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], do not have closed syllables.\n\nWhen a syllable is not the last syllable in a word, the nucleus normally must be followed by two consonants in order for the syllable to be closed. This is because a single following consonant is typically considered the onset of the following syllable. For example, Spanish ''casar'' \"to marry\" is composed of an open syllable followed by a closed syllable (''ca-sar''), whereas ''cansar'' \"to get tired\" is composed of two closed syllables (''can-sar''). When a geminate (double) consonant occurs, the syllable boundary occurs in the middle, e.g. Italian ''panna'' \"cream\" (''pan-na''); cf. Italian ''pane'' \"bread\" (''pa-ne'').\n\nEnglish words may consist of a single closed syllable, with nucleus denoted by \u03bd, and coda denote by \u03ba:\n*i''n'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/n/}}\n*cu''p'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u028c/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/p/}}\n*ta''ll'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/l/}}\n*mi''lk'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/lk/}}\n*ti''nts'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/nts/}}\n*fi''fths'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/f\u03b8s/}}\n*si''xths'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/ks\u03b8s/}}\n*twe''lfths'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/lf\u03b8s/}}\n*stre''ngths'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/\u014b\u03b8s/}}\n\nEnglish words may also consist of a single open syllable, ending in a nucleus, without a coda:\n*glue, \u03bd = {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}\n*pie, \u03bd = {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}\n*though, \u03bd = {{IPA|/o\u028a/}}\n*boy, \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}}\n\nA list of examples of syllable codas in English is found at [[English phonology#Coda|English phonology: Coda]].\n\n====Null coda====\nSome languages, such as [[Hawaiian phonology#Phonotactics|Hawaiian]], forbid codas, so that all syllables are open.\n\n==Suprasegmental features==\nThe domain of [[Suprasegmental|suprasegmental features]] is the syllable and not a specific sound, that is to say, they affect all the segments of a syllable:\n*[[Lexical stress|Stress]]\n*[[Tone (linguistics)|Tone]]\n*{{lang|da|[[St\u00f8d]]}}\n*[[Palatalization (phonetics)#Types|Suprasegmental palatalization]]\n\nSometimes [[syllable length]] is also counted as a suprasegmental feature; for example, in some Germanic languages, long vowels may only exist with short consonants and vice versa. However, syllables can be analyzed as compositions of long and short phonemes, as in Finnish and Japanese, where consonant gemination and vowel length are independent.\n\n===Tone===\n{{main|Tone (linguistics)}}\nIn most languages, the pitch or pitch contour in which a syllable is pronounced conveys shades of meaning such as emphasis or surprise, or distinguishes a statement from a question.  In tonal languages, however, the pitch affects the basic lexical meaning (e.g. \"cat\" vs. \"dog\") or grammatical meaning (e.g. past vs. present). In some languages, only the pitch itself (e.g. high vs. low) has this effect, while in others, especially East Asian languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the shape or contour (e.g. level vs. rising vs. falling) also needs to be distinguished.\n\n===Accent===\n{{main|Accent (phonetics)}}\nSyllable structure often interacts with stress or pitch accent. In [[Latin]], for example, stress is regularly determined by [[syllable weight]], a syllable counting as heavy if it has at least one of the following:\n* a long vowel in its [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]]\n* a [[diphthong]] in its nucleus\n* one or more [[Syllable coda|codas]]\nIn each case the syllable is considered to have two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]].\n\nThe first syllable of a word is the '''initial syllable''' and the last syllable is the '''final syllable'''.\n\nIn languages accented on one of the last three syllables, the last syllable is called the [[Ultima (linguistics)|ultima]], the next-to-last is called the [[penult]], and the third syllable from the end is called the antepenult. These terms come from Latin ''{{lang|la|ultima}}'' \"last\", ''{{lang|la|paenultima}}'' \"almost last\", and ''{{lang|la|antepaenultima}}'' \"before almost last\".\n\nIn [[Ancient Greek]], there are three [[Greek diacritics|accent marks]] (acute, circumflex, and grave), and terms were used to describe words based on the position and type of accent. Some of these terms are used in the description of other languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" | Placement of accent\n|-\n! Antepenult !!

Similar terms include '''disyllable''' (and ''disyllabic''; also ''bisyllable'' and ''bisyllabic'') for a word of two syllables; '''trisyllable''' (and ''trisyllabic'') for a word of three syllables; and '''polysyllable''' (and ''polysyllabic''), which may refer either to a word of more than three syllables or to any word of more than one syllable.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Syllable'' is an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] variation of [[Old French]] ''sillabe'', from [[Latin]] ''syllaba'', from [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ae}} ''syllab\u1e17'' ({{IPA-grc|syl\u02d0ab\u025b\u030c\u02d0}}).<!-- This is actually a Classical-era, not Koine, pronunciation, because Help:IPA/Greek only supports Classical pronunciation at the moment. --> {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ae}} means \"what is taken together\", referring to letters that are taken together to make a single sound.<ref>{{OEtymD|syllable|accessdate=2015-01-05}}</ref>\n\n{{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03ae}} is a verbal noun from the verb {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9}} ''syllamb\u00e1n\u014d'', a compound of the preposition {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd}} ''s\u00fdn'' \"with\" and the verb {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9}} ''lamb\u00e1n\u014d'' \"take\".<ref>{{LSJ|lamba/nw|\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9|ref}}</ref> The noun uses the [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2-}}, which appears in the [[Aorist (Ancient Greek)|aorist]] tense; the [[Ancient Greek verbs#Present tense|present tense]] stem {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd-}} is formed by adding a [[nasal infix]] {{angbr|{{lang|grc|\u03bc}}}} ''{{angbr|m}}'' before the {{lang|grc|\u03b2}} ''b'' and a [[suffix]] {{lang|grc|-\u03b1\u03bd}} ''-an'' at the end.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smyth|1920|loc=\u00a7523: present stems formed by suffixes containing {{lang|grc|\u03bd}}}}</ref>\n\n==Transcription==\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the period {{angbr IPA|.}} marks syllable breaks, as in the word \"astronomical\" {{angbr IPA|/\u02cc\u00e6s.tr\u0259\u02c8n\u0252m.\u026ak.\u0259l/}}.\n\nIn practice, however, IPA transcription is typically divided into words by spaces, and often these spaces are also understood to be syllable breaks. In addition, the stress mark {{angbr IPA|\u02c8}} is placed immediately before a stressed syllable, and when the stressed syllable is in the middle of a word, the stress mark also marks a syllable break, for example in the word \"understood\" {{angbr IPA|/\u028cnd\u0259r\u02c8st\u028ad/}}.\n\nWhen a word space comes in the middle of a syllable (that is, when a syllable spans words), a tie bar {{angbr IPA|\u203f}} can be used for [[liaison (French)|liaison]], as in the French combination ''les amis'' {{angbr IPA|/le.z\u203fa.mi/}}. The liaison tie is also used to join lexical words into [[phonological word]]s, for example ''hot dog'' {{angbr IPA|/\u02c8h\u0252t\u203fd\u0252\u0261/}}.\n\nA Greek sigma, {{angbr|\u03c3}}, is used as a wild card for 'syllable', and a dollar/peso sign, {{angbr|$}}, marks a syllable boundary where the usual period might be misunderstood. For example, {{angbr|\u03c3\u03c3}} is a pair of syllables, and {{angbr|V$}} is a syllable-final vowel.\n\n== Components ==\n{{Unreferencedsect|date=September 2018}} \n[[Image:Syllable.svg|thumb|Syllable components as a [[directed graph]]]]\n[[Image:Syllable illustration 1.svg|thumb|Segmental model for ''cat'' and ''sing'']]\n\n=== Typical model ===\n\nIn the typical theory{{fact|date=September 2018}} of syllable structure, the general structure of a syllable (\u03c3) consists of three segments. These segments are grouped into two components:\n\n; [[#Onset|Onset]] (\u03c9): a [[consonant]] or [[consonant cluster]], obligatory in some languages, optional or even restricted in others\n; [[#Rime|Rime]] (\u03c1): right branch, contrasts with onset, splits into nucleus and coda\n:; [[#Nucleus|Nucleus]] (\u03bd): a [[vowel]] or [[syllabic consonant]], obligatory in most languages\n:; [[#Coda|Coda]] (\u03ba): consonant, optional in some languages, highly restricted or prohibited in others\n\nThe syllable is usually considered right-branching, i.e. nucleus and coda are grouped together as a \"rime\" and are only distinguished at the second level.\n\nThe ''nucleus'' is usually the vowel in the middle of a syllable. The ''onset'' is the sound or sounds occurring before the nucleus, and the ''coda'' (literally 'tail') is the sound or sounds that follow the nucleus. They are sometimes collectively known as the ''shell''. The term ''rime'' covers the nucleus plus coda. In the one-syllable English word ''cat'', the nucleus is ''a'' (the sound that can be shouted or sung on its own), the onset ''c'', the coda ''t'', and the rime ''at''. This syllable can be abstracted as a ''consonant-vowel-consonant'' syllable, abbreviated ''CVC''.  Languages vary greatly in the restrictions on the sounds making up the onset, nucleus and coda of a syllable, according to what is termed a language's [[phonotactics]].\n\nAlthough every syllable has supra-segmental features, these are usually ignored if not semantically relevant, e.g. in [[tonal language]]s.\n\n; [[Tone (linguistics)|Tone]] (\u03c4): may be carried by the syllable as a whole or by the rime\n\n=== Chinese model ===\n{{anchor|initial}}{{anchor|medial}}{{anchor|final}}\n[[Image:Chinese syllable tree.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Traditional Chinese syllable structure]]\n\nIn [[Sinitic Languages|Chinese]] syllable structure, the onset is replaced with an initial, and a semivowel or liquid forms another segment, called the medial. These four segments are grouped into two slightly different components:{{example needed |date=September 2017}}<!-- Example needed, like the examples of \"cat\" and \"sing\". -->\n\n; [[#Initial|Initial]] (\u03b9): optional onset, excluding sonorants\n; [[#Final|Final]] (\u03c6): medial, nucleus, and final consonant<ref>More generally, the letter \u03c6 indicates a prosodic [[foot (prosody)|foot]] of two syllables</ref>\n:; [[#Medial|Medial]] (\u03bc): optional semivowel or liquid<ref>More generally, the letter \u03bc indicates a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]</ref>\n:; [[#Nucleus|Nucleus]] (\u03bd): a [[vowel]] or syllabic consonant\n:; [[#Coda|Coda]] (\u03ba): optional final consonant\n\nIn many languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the syllable structure is expanded to include an additional, optional segment known as a '''medial''', which is located between the onset (often termed the ''initial'' in this context) and the rime.  The medial is normally a [[semivowel]], but reconstructions of [[Old Chinese]] generally include [[liquid consonant|liquid]] medials ({{IPA|/r/}} in modern reconstructions, {{IPA|/l/}} in older versions), and many reconstructions of [[Middle Chinese]] include a medial contrast between {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}, where the {{IPA|/i/}} functions phonologically as a glide rather than as part of the nucleus.  In addition, many reconstructions of both Old and Middle Chinese include complex medials such as {{IPA|/rj/}}, {{IPA|/ji/}}, {{IPA|/jw/}} and {{IPA|/jwi/}}.  The medial groups phonologically with the rime rather than the onset, and the combination of medial and rime is collectively known as the '''final'''.\n\nSome linguists, especially when discussing the modern Chinese varieties, use the terms \"final\" and \"rime/rhyme\" interchangeably.  In [[historical Chinese phonology]], however, the distinction between \"final\" (including the medial) and \"rime\" (not including the medial) is important in understanding the [[rime dictionary|rime dictionaries]] and [[rime table]]s that form the primary sources for [[Middle Chinese]], and as a result most authors distinguish the two according to the above definition.\n\n=== Grouping of components ===\n\n[[Image:Syllable onset rhyme.png|640px]]\n[[Image:Syllable illustration 2.svg|thumb|Hierarchical model for ''cat'' and ''sing'']]\n[[Image:Syllable body coda.png|thumb|upright=2.5]]\n\nIn some theories of phonology, syllable structures are displayed as [[Parse tree|tree diagrams]] (similar to the trees found in some types of syntax). Not all phonologists agree that syllables have internal structure; in fact, some phonologists doubt the existence of the syllable as a theoretical entity.<ref>See [http://www.cunyphonologyforum.net/syllable.php CUNY Conference on the Syllable] for discussion of the theoretical existence of the syllable.</ref>\n\nThere are many arguments for a hierarchical relationship, rather than a linear one, between the syllable constituents. One hierarchical model groups the syllable nucleus and coda into an intermediate level, the ''rime''.  The hierarchical model accounts for the role that the ''nucleus''+''coda'' constituent plays in verse (i.e., rhyming words such as ''cat'' and ''bat'' are formed by matching both the nucleus and coda, or the entire rime), and for the [[Syllable weight|distinction between heavy and light syllables]], which plays a role in phonological processes such as, for example, [[sound change]] in [[Old English]] ''scipu'' and ''wordu''.<ref>{{cite book | title = A Prosodic Grammar of Chinese | last = Feng | first = Shengli | page = 3 | publisher = University of Kansas | year = 2003}}</ref>{{Elucidate|date=November 2016}}\n\n==== Body ====\n\nIn some traditional descriptions of certain languages such as [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], the syllable is considered left-branching, i.e. onset and nucleus group below a higher-level unit, called a \"body\" or \"core\". This contrasts with the coda.\n<!-- (\u03c0) [not in diagram yet] --> <!-- July 1 2017 - left this comment (to the left) here, pretty sure the image to the right is a diagram of this? -->\n\n==== Rime ====\n\nThe '''rime''' or '''rhyme''' of a syllable consists of a [[#Nucleus|nucleus]] and an optional [[#Coda|coda]].  It is the part of the syllable used in most [[Rhyme|poetic rhyme]]s, and the part that is lengthened or stressed when a person elongates or stresses a word in speech.\n\nThe rime is usually the portion of a syllable from the first [[vowel]] to the end.  For example, {{IPA|/\u00e6t/}} is the rime of all of the words ''at'', ''sat'', and ''flat''.  However, the nucleus does not necessarily need to be a vowel in some languages.  For instance, the rime of the second syllables of the words ''bottle'' and ''fiddle'' is just {{IPA|/l/}}, a [[liquid consonant]].\n\nJust as the rime branches into the nucleus and coda, the nucleus and coda may each branch into multiple [[phoneme]]s. The limit for the number of phonemes which may be contained in each varies by language.  For example, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and most [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] do not have consonant clusters at the beginning or end of syllables, whereas many Eastern European languages can have more than two consonants at the beginning or end of the syllable.  In English, the onset, nucleus, and coda may all have two phonemes, as in the word ''flouts'': [fl] in the onset, the [[diphthong]] [a\u028a] in the nucleus, and [ts] in the coda.\n\n''Rime'' and ''rhyme'' are variants of the same word, but the rarer form ''rime'' is sometimes used to mean specifically ''syllable rime'' to differentiate it from the concept of poetic [[rhyme]]. This distinction is not made by some linguists and does not appear in most dictionaries.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples <br><small>C = consonant, V = vowel, optional components are in parentheses.</small>\n! structure: !! syllable = !! onset !! + rhyme\n|-\n!

The name is a metaphor, based on the nucleus or coda having lines that branch in a tree diagram.\n\nIn some languages, heavy syllables include both VV (branching nucleus) and VC (branching rime) syllables, contrasted with V, which is a '''light syllable'''.\nIn other languages, only VV syllables are considered heavy, while both VC and V syllables are light.\nSome languages distinguish a third type of '''superheavy syllable''', which consists of VVC syllables (with both a branching nucleus and rime) or VCC syllables (with a coda consisting of two or more consonants) or both.\n\nIn [[mora (linguistics)|moraic theory]], heavy syllables are said to have two moras, while light syllables are said to have one and superheavy syllables are said to have three. [[Japanese phonology]] is generally described this way.\n\nMany languages forbid superheavy syllables, while a significant number forbid any heavy syllable.  Some languages strive for constant syllable weight; for example, in stressed, non-final syllables in [[Italian language|Italian]], short vowels co-occur with closed syllables while long vowels co-occur with open syllables, so that all such syllables are heavy (not light or superheavy).\n\nThe difference between heavy and light frequently determines which syllables receive [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] \u2013 this is the case in [[Latin]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], for example.  The system of [[meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] in many classical languages, such as [[Classical Greek]], [[Classical Latin]], [[Tamil language|Old Tamil]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], is based on syllable weight rather than stress (so-called ''quantitative rhythm'' or ''quantitative meter'').\n\n==Syllabification==\n{{see also|Syllabification|Phonotactics|Sonority hierarchy}}\n'''Syllabification''' is the separation of a word into syllables, whether spoken or written. In most languages, the actually spoken syllables are the basis of syllabification in writing too. Due to the very weak correspondence between sounds and letters in the spelling of modern English, for example, written syllabification in English has to be based mostly on etymological i.e. morphological instead of phonetic principles. English written syllables therefore do not correspond to the actually spoken syllables of the living language.\n\nPhonotactic rules determine which sounds are allowed or disallowed in each part of the syllable. [[English language|English]] allows very complicated syllables; syllables may begin with up to three consonants (as in ''string'' or ''splash''), and occasionally end with as many as four (as in ''prompts'').  Many other languages are much more restricted; [[Japanese language|Japanese]], for example, only allows {{IPA|/\u0274/}} and a [[chroneme]] in a coda, and theoretically has no consonant clusters at all, as the onset is composed of at most one consonant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shibatani |first=Masayoshi |chapter=Japanese |pages=855\u201380 |title=The World's Major Languages |editor=Bernard Comrie |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-19-520521-9}}</ref>\n\n===Ambisyllabicity===\nThere can be disagreement about the location of some divisions between syllables in spoken language. The problems of dealing with such cases have been most commonly discussed with relation to English. In the case of a word such as \"hurry\", the division may be {{IPA|/h\u028cr.i/}} or {{IPA|/h\u028c.ri/}}, neither of which seems a satisfactory analysis for a non-rhotic accent such as RP (British English): {{IPA|/h\u028cr.i/}} results in a syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}}, which is not normally found, while {{IPA|/h\u028c.ri/}} gives a syllable-final short stressed vowel, which is also non-occurring. Arguments can be made in favour of one solution or the other: Wells (2002)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/syllabif.htm |title=Wells: Syllabification and allophony |website=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref> proposes a general rule that \"Subject to certain conditions ..., consonants are syllabified with the more strongly stressed of two flanking syllables\", while many other phonologists prefer to divide syllables with the consonant or consonants attached to the following syllable wherever possible. However, an alternative that has received some support is to treat an intervocalic consonant as ''ambisyllabic'', i.e. belonging both to the preceding and to the following syllable: {{IPA|/h\u028c\u1e5bi/}}. This is discussed in more detail in {{Section link|English phonology|Phonotactics}}.\n\n===Onset===\nThe '''onset''' (also known as '''anlaut''') is the consonant sound or sounds at the beginning of a syllable, occurring before the [[#Nucleus|nucleus]]. Most syllables have an onset. Syllables without an onset may be said to have a ''[[zero (linguistics)|zero]] onset'' &ndash; that is, nothing where the onset would be.\n\n====Onset cluster====\nSome languages restrict onsets to be only a single consonant, while others allow multiconsonant onsets according to various rules. For example, in English, onsets such as ''pr-'', ''pl-'' and ''tr-'' are possible but ''tl-'' is not, and ''sk-'' is possible but ''ks-'' is not. In [[Greek language|Greek]], however, both ''ks-'' and ''tl-'' are possible onsets, while contrarily in [[Classical Arabic]] no multiconsonant onsets are allowed at all.\n\n====Null onset====\nSome languages forbid '''null onsets'''. In these languages, words beginning in a vowel, like the English word ''at'', are impossible.\n\nThis is less strange than it may appear at first, as most such languages allow syllables to begin with a phonemic [[glottal stop]] (the sound in the middle of English \"uh-oh\" or, in some dialects, the double T in \"button\", represented in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] as {{IPA|/\u0294/}}).  In English, a word that begins with a vowel may be pronounced with an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] glottal stop when following a pause, though the glottal stop may not be a [[phoneme]] in the language.\n\nFew languages make a phonemic distinction between a word beginning with a vowel and a word beginning with a glottal stop followed by a vowel, since the distinction will generally only be audible following another word. However, [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and some [[Polynesian languages]] do make such a distinction, as in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] {{IPA|/ahi/}} \"fire\" and {{IPA|/\u0294ahi}}/ \"tuna\".\n\n[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] forbid empty onsets. The names ''Israel'', ''Abel'', ''Abraham'', ''Iran'', ''Omar'', ''Abdullah'', and ''Iraq'' appear not to have onsets in the first syllable, but in the original Hebrew and Arabic forms they actually begin with various consonants: the semivowel {{IPAslink|j}} in ''yisr\u0101\u0294\u0113l'', the glottal fricative in {{IPAslink|h}} ''he\u1e05el'', the glottal stop {{IPAslink|\u0294}} in ''\u0294a\u1e05r\u0101h\u0101m'' and ''\u0294\u012br\u0101n'', or the pharyngeal fricative {{IPAslink|\u0295}} in ''\u0295umar'', ''\u0295abdu\u1e37\u1e37\u0101h'', and ''\u0295ir\u0101q''. Conversely, the [[Arrernte language]] of central Australia may prohibit onsets altogether; if so, all syllables have the [[underlying representation|underlying shape]] VC(C).<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4179048|title = Arrernte: A Language with No Syllable Onsets|journal = Linguistic Inquiry|volume = 30|issue = 1|pages = 1\u201325|last1 = Breen|first1 = Gavan|last2 = Pensalfini|first2 = Rob|year = 1999|doi = 10.1162/002438999553940|url = https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209796/UQ209796_OA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe difference between a syllable with a null onset and one beginning with a glottal stop is often purely a difference of [[phonology|phonological]] analysis, rather than the actual pronunciation of the syllable.  In some cases, the pronunciation of a (putatively) vowel-initial word when following another word \u2013 particularly, whether or not a glottal stop is inserted \u2013 indicates whether the word should be considered to have a null onset.  For example, many [[Romance languages]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] never insert such a glottal stop, while [[English language|English]] does so only some of the time, depending on factors such as conversation speed; in both cases, this suggests that the words in question are truly vowel-initial.  But there are exceptions here, too.  For example, standard [[German language|German]] (excluding many southern accents) and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] both require that a glottal stop be inserted between a word and a following, putatively vowel-initial word. Yet such words are said to begin with a vowel in German but a glottal stop in Arabic. The reason for this has to do with other properties of the two languages. For example, a glottal stop does not occur in other situations in German, e.g. before a consonant or at the end of word. On the other hand, in Arabic, not only does a glottal stop occur in such situations (e.g. Classical {{IPA|/sa\u0294ala/}} \"he asked\", {{IPA|/ra\u0294j/}} \"opinion\", {{IPA|/d\u02e4aw\u0294/}} \"light\"), but it occurs in alternations that are clearly indicative of its phonemic status (cf. Classical {{IPA|/ka\u02d0tib/}} \"writer\" vs. /mak{{IPA|tu\u02d0b/}} \"written\", {{IPA|/\u0294a\u02d0kil/}} \"eater\" vs. {{IPA|/ma\u0294ku\u02d0l/}} \"eaten\").\n\nThe writing system of a language may not correspond with the phonological analysis of the language in terms of its handling of (potentially) null onsets.  For example, in some languages written in the [[Latin alphabet]], an initial glottal stop is left unwritten;{{examples|date=February 2015}} on the other hand, some languages written using non-Latin alphabets such as [[abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s have a special [[zero consonant]] to represent a null onset.  As an example, in [[Hangul]], the alphabet of the [[Korean language]], a null onset is represented with \u3147 at the left or top section of a [[grapheme]], as in \uc5ed \"station\", pronounced ''yeok'', where the [[diphthong]] ''yeo'' is the nucleus and ''k'' is the coda.\n\n===Nucleus===\n[[File:Syllable onset nucleus coda.png|375px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ Examples of syllable nuclei\n|-\n!

Generally, every syllable requires a nucleus (sometimes called the ''peak''), and the minimal syllable consists only of a nucleus, as in the English words \"eye\" or \"owe\". The syllable nucleus is usually a vowel, in the form of a [[monophthong]], [[diphthong]], or [[triphthong]], but sometimes is a [[syllabic consonant]].\n\nIn most [[Germanic language]]s, [[tenseness|lax vowels]] can occur only in closed syllables. Therefore, these vowels are also called [[Checked and free vowels|checked vowels]], as opposed to the tense vowels that are called ''free vowels'' because they can occur even in open syllables.\n\n====Consonant nucleus====\n{{Main|Syllabic consonant}}\nThe notion of syllable is challenged by languages that allow long strings of [[obstruent]]s without any intervening vowel or [[sonorant]].  By far the most common syllabic consonants are sonorants like {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[r]}}, {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}} or {{IPA|[\u014b]}}, as in English ''bott'''le''''', ''ch'''ur'''ch'' (in rhotic accents), ''rhyth'''m''''', ''butt'''on''''' and ''lock {{'}}'''n''' key''. However, English allows syllabic obstruents in a few para-verbal [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] utterances such as ''shh'' (used to command silence) and ''psst'' (used to attract attention). All of these have been analyzed as phonemically syllabic. Obstruent-only syllables also occur phonetically in some prosodic situations when unstressed vowels elide between obstruents, as in ''potato'' {{IPA|[p\u02b0\u02c8te\u026a\u027e\u0259\u028a]}} and ''today'' {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u02c8de\u026a]}}, which do not change in their number of syllables despite losing a syllabic nucleus.\n\nA few languages have so-called ''[[syllabic fricative]]s'', also known as ''fricative vowels'', at the phonemic level. (In the context of [[Standard Chinese phonology|Chinese phonology]], the related but non-synonymous term ''apical vowel'' is commonly used.) [[Mandarin Chinese]] is famous for having such sounds in at least some of its dialects, for example the [[pinyin]] syllables ''s\u012b sh\u012b r\u012b'', sometimes pronounced {{IPA|[s\u017a\u0329 \u0282\u0290\u0329\u0301 \u0290\u0290\u0329\u0301]}} respectively. Though, like the nucleus of rhotic English ''church'', there is debate over whether these nuclei are consonants or vowels.\n\nLanguages of the northwest coast of North America, including [[Salishan languages|Salishan]], [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan]] and [[Chinookan languages|Chinookan]] languages, allow [[stop consonant]]s and [[voiceless fricative]]s as syllables at the phonemic level, in even the most careful enunciation. An example is Chinook {{IPA|[\u026ct\u02b0p\u02b0t\u0361\u0283\u02b0k\u02b0t\u02b0]}} 'those two women are coming this way out of the water'. Linguists have analyzed this situation in various ways, some arguing that such syllables have no nucleus at all and some arguing that the concept of \"syllable\" cannot clearly be applied at all to these languages.\n\nOther examples:\n; [[Nux\u00e1lk language|Nux\u00e1lk]] (Bella Coola)\n: {{IPA|[\u026c\u03c7\u02b7t\u02b0\u026ct\u0361s\u02b0x\u02b7]}} 'you spat on me'\n: {{IPA|[t\u0361s\u02bck\u02b0t\u02b0sk\u02b7\u02b0t\u0361s\u02bc]}} 'he arrived'\n: {{IPA|[x\u026cp\u02bc\u03c7\u02b7\u026ct\u02b0\u026cp\u02b0\u026c\u026cs]}} 'he had in his possession a bunchberry plant'<ref>(Bagemihl 1991:589, 593, 627)</ref>\n: {{IPA|[sxs]}} 'seal blubber'\n\nIn Bagemihl's survey of previous analyses, he finds that the Bella Coola word {{IPA|/t\u0361s\u02bcktsk\u02b7t\u0361s\u02bc/}} 'he arrived' would have been parsed into 0, 2, 3, 5, or 6 syllables depending on which analysis is used. One analysis would consider all vowel and consonant segments as syllable nuclei, another would consider only a small subset ([[fricative]]s or [[sibilant]]s) as nuclei candidates, and another would simply deny the existence of syllables completely. However, when working with recordings rather than transcriptions, the syllables can be obvious in such languages, and native speakers have strong intuitions as to what the syllables are.\n\nThis type of phenomenon has also been reported in [[Berber languages]] (such as Indlawn Tashlhiyt Berber), [[Moroccan Arabic]] (apparently under Berber influence), [[Mon\u2013Khmer languages]] (such as [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Temiar language|Temiar]], [[Khmu language|Khmu]]) and the \u014cgami dialect of [[Miyako language|Miyako]], a [[Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/52/95/98/PDF/irl-ogami.pdf |title=Ogami (Miyako Ryukyuan) |author=Thomas Pellard |website=Halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>\n; Indlawn Tashlhiyt Berber\n: {{IPA|[tftktst tfktstt]}} 'you sprained it and then gave it'\n: {{IPA|[rkkm]}} 'rot' (imperf.)<ref>(Dell & Elmedlaoui 1985, 1988)</ref>\n; Semai\n: {{IPA|[kckmr\u0294\u025b\u02d0c]}} 'short, fat arms'<ref>(Sloan 1988)</ref>\n\n===Coda===\nThe '''coda''' (also known as '''auslaut''') comprises the [[consonant]] sounds of a syllable that follow the [[#Nucleus|nucleus]]. The sequence of nucleus and coda is called a [[#Rime|rime]]. Some syllables consist of only a nucleus, only an onset and a nucleus with no coda, or only a nucleus and coda with no onset.\n\nThe [[phonotactics]] of many languages forbid syllable codas. Examples are [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]. In others, codas are restricted to a small subset of the consonants that appear in onset position. At a phonemic level in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], for example, a coda may only be a nasal (homorganic with any following consonant) or, in the middle of a word, [[gemination]] of the following consonant. (On a phonetic level, other codas occur due to elision of /i/ and /u/.) In other languages, nearly any consonant allowed as an onset is also allowed in the coda, even [[consonant cluster|clusters of consonants]]. In English, for example, all onset consonants except {{IPA|/h/}} are allowed as syllable codas.\n\nIf the coda consists of a consonant cluster, the sonority decreases from left to right, as in the English word ''help''. This is called the sonority profile.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Harrington and Felicity Cox |url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonology/syllable/syll_phonotactic.html |title=The Syllable and Phonotactic Constraints |website=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref> English onset and coda clusters are therefore different. The onset ''str'' in ''strengths'' does not appear as a coda in any English word, and likewise the coda ''ngths'' does not appear as an onset in any word.\n\n{{anchor|open syllable|checked syllable|closed syllable}}\n\n====Open and closed====\n{{Redirect|Checked syllable|checked syllables in Chinese|Checked tone}}\nA coda-less syllable of the form V, CV, CCV, etc. (V = vowel, C = consonant) is called an '''open syllable''' or '''free syllable''', while a syllable that has a coda (VC, CVC, CVCC, etc.) is called a '''closed syllable''' or '''checked syllable'''.  Note that they have nothing to do with [[open vowel|open]] and [[close vowel]]s, but are defined according to the phoneme that ends the syllable: a vowel (open syllable) or a consonant (closed syllable). Almost all languages allow open syllables, but some, such as [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], do not have closed syllables.\n\nWhen a syllable is not the last syllable in a word, the nucleus normally must be followed by two consonants in order for the syllable to be closed. This is because a single following consonant is typically considered the onset of the following syllable. For example, Spanish ''casar'' \"to marry\" is composed of an open syllable followed by a closed syllable (''ca-sar''), whereas ''cansar'' \"to get tired\" is composed of two closed syllables (''can-sar''). When a geminate (double) consonant occurs, the syllable boundary occurs in the middle, e.g. Italian ''panna'' \"cream\" (''pan-na''); cf. Italian ''pane'' \"bread\" (''pa-ne'').\n\nEnglish words may consist of a single closed syllable, with nucleus denoted by \u03bd, and coda denote by \u03ba:\n*i''n'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/n/}}\n*cu''p'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u028c/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/p/}}\n*ta''ll'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/l/}}\n*mi''lk'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/lk/}}\n*ti''nts'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/nts/}}\n*fi''fths'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/f\u03b8s/}}\n*si''xths'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/ks\u03b8s/}}\n*twe''lfths'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/lf\u03b8s/}}\n*stre''ngths'': \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, \u03ba = {{IPA|/\u014b\u03b8s/}}\n\nEnglish words may also consist of a single open syllable, ending in a nucleus, without a coda:\n*glue, \u03bd = {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}\n*pie, \u03bd = {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}\n*though, \u03bd = {{IPA|/o\u028a/}}\n*boy, \u03bd = {{IPA|/\u0254\u026a/}}\n\nA list of examples of syllable codas in English is found at [[English phonology#Coda|English phonology: Coda]].\n\n====Null coda====\nSome languages, such as [[Hawaiian phonology#Phonotactics|Hawaiian]], forbid codas, so that all syllables are open.\n\n==Suprasegmental features==\nThe domain of [[Suprasegmental|suprasegmental features]] is the syllable and not a specific sound, that is to say, they affect all the segments of a syllable:\n*[[Lexical stress|Stress]]\n*[[Tone (linguistics)|Tone]]\n*{{lang|da|[[St\u00f8d]]}}\n*[[Palatalization (phonetics)#Types|Suprasegmental palatalization]]\n\nSometimes [[syllable length]] is also counted as a suprasegmental feature; for example, in some Germanic languages, long vowels may only exist with short consonants and vice versa. However, syllables can be analyzed as compositions of long and short phonemes, as in Finnish and Japanese, where consonant gemination and vowel length are independent.\n\n===Tone===\n{{main|Tone (linguistics)}}\nIn most languages, the pitch or pitch contour in which a syllable is pronounced conveys shades of meaning such as emphasis or surprise, or distinguishes a statement from a question.  In tonal languages, however, the pitch affects the basic lexical meaning (e.g. \"cat\" vs. \"dog\") or grammatical meaning (e.g. past vs. present). In some languages, only the pitch itself (e.g. high vs. low) has this effect, while in others, especially East Asian languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Thai language|Thai]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the shape or contour (e.g. level vs. rising vs. falling) also needs to be distinguished.\n\n===Accent===\n{{main|Accent (phonetics)}}\nSyllable structure often interacts with stress or pitch accent. In [[Latin]], for example, stress is regularly determined by [[syllable weight]], a syllable counting as heavy if it has at least one of the following:\n* a long vowel in its [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]]\n* a [[diphthong]] in its nucleus\n* one or more [[Syllable coda|codas]]\nIn each case the syllable is considered to have two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]].\n\nThe first syllable of a word is the '''initial syllable''' and the last syllable is the '''final syllable'''.\n\nIn languages accented on one of the last three syllables, the last syllable is called the [[Ultima (linguistics)|ultima]], the next-to-last is called the [[penult]], and the third syllable from the end is called the antepenult. These terms come from Latin ''{{lang|la|ultima}}'' \"last\", ''{{lang|la|paenultima}}'' \"almost last\", and ''{{lang|la|antepaenultima}}'' \"before almost last\".\n\nIn [[Ancient Greek]], there are three [[Greek diacritics|accent marks]] (acute, circumflex, and grave), and terms were used to describe words based on the position and type of accent. Some of these terms are used in the description of other languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" | Placement of accent\n|-\n! Antepenult !!
