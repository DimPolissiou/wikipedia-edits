It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], later General of the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Army |date=1926 |pages=165}}</ref><!--Doolittle did not receive his General Rank until 1985 actually when he was in the Air Force Reserves. See [[Jimmy Doolittle]].-->\n\nSixteen [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25B Mitchell]] medium bombers were launched without fighter escort from the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} deep in the Western Pacific Ocean, each with a crew of five men. The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan and to continue westward to land in China. The bombing raid killed about 50 people, including civilians, and injured 400. Fifteen aircraft reached China but all crashed, while the 16th landed at [[Vladivostok]] in the Soviet Union. Of the 80 crew members, 77 survived the mission. Eight airmen were captured by Japanese Army troops in China; three were later executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year before being allowed to \"escape\" via [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Soviet-occupied]] [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]] with the help of the [[NKVD]]. Fourteen complete crews of five returned to the United States or to American forces, except for one crewman who was killed in action.<ref name=\"bravemen\" /><ref name=\"Glines 1998, pp. 166\u2013168\">Glines 1998, pp. 166\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe raid caused negligible material damage to Japan, but it had major psychological effects. In the United States, it raised morale. In Japan, it raised doubt about the ability of military leaders to defend the home islands, but the bombing and strafing of civilians also steeled Japanese resolve to gain retribution, and this was exploited for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"hist reex\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historynet.com/aftermath-doolittle-raid-reexamined.htm |title = Aftermath: How the Doolittle Raid Shook Japan|date = 27 July 2015}}</ref> It also pushed forward Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plans to attack [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]] in the Central Pacific, an attack that turned into a decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]]. The consequences were most severely felt in China, where [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign|Japanese reprisals]] caused the deaths of 250,000 civilians and 70,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"hist reex\" />\n\nDoolittle initially believed that the loss of all his aircraft would lead to his court-martial, but he instead received the [[Medal of Honor]] and was promoted two ranks to brigadier general.\n\n== Background ==\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] spoke to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in a meeting at the [[White House]] on 21 December 1941 and said that Japan should be bombed as soon as possible to boost public morale after Pearl Harbor.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 10.</ref> Doolittle recounted in his autobiography that the raid was intended to bolster American morale and to cause the Japanese to begin doubting their leadership. \"An attack on the Japanese homeland would cause confusion in the minds of the Japanese people and sow doubt about the reliability of their leaders.\u2026 Americans badly needed a morale boost.\"<ref>Doolittle and Glines 1991, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolittle Raider, Plane 1.jpg|thumb|Crew No. 1 in front of B-25#40-2344 on the deck of {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, 18 April 1942.

Leonard, flight engineer/gunner.]]\nThe concept for the attack came from Navy Captain [[Francis S. Low]], Assistant Chief of Staff for antisubmarine warfare. He reported to Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] on 10 January 1942 that he thought that twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at [[Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 13.</ref> \n\nDoolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war, was assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the raid. The aircraft to be used would need a cruising range of {{convert|2400|nmi|km}} with a {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load, so Doolittle selected the B-25B Mitchell to carry out the mission. The range of the Mitchell was about 1,300 miles, so the bombers had to be modified to hold nearly twice the normal fuel reserves. Doolittle also considered the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]], [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], and [[Douglas B-23 Dragon]],<ref>Glines 1998, p. 19.</ref> but the B-26 had questionable takeoff characteristics from a carrier deck and the B-23's wingspan was nearly 50-percent greater than the B-25's, reducing the number that could be taken aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship's superstructure. The B-18 was one of the final two types that Doolittle considered, and he rejected it for the same reason.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> The B-25 had yet to see combat,{{refn|The first bombing mission by B-25s preceded the Doolittle Raid by only 12 days. On 6 April 1942, six Mitchells bombed [[Gasmata]], [[New Britain]]. This was followed on 12 and 13 April by two days of attacks against [[Cebu City]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] in the Philippines. All of these were conducted by the [[3d Operations Group|3rd Bomb Group]], which staged 10 Mitchells through [[Darwin, Australia]] to [[Mindanao]].|group=Note}}<ref>Martin and Stephenson 2008, pp. 174, 182\u201383.</ref> but tests indicated that it could fulfill the mission's requirements.\n\nDoolittle's first report on the plan suggested that the bombers might land in [[Vladivostok]], shortening the flight by {{convert|600|nmi|km}} on the basis of turning over the B-25s as [[Lend-Lease]].<ref>Glines 1998, p. 27.</ref> Negotiations with the Soviet Union were fruitless for permission to land because it had signed a [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact|neutrality pact with Japan]] in April 1941.<ref name=\"doo\" /> China's [[Chiang Kai-shek]] agreed to the landing sites in China despite the concern of Japanese reprisals.

The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]].<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.</ref>\n\nThe 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from [[Pendleton, Oregon]], was immediately moved cross-country to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] at [[West Columbia, South Carolina]], ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \"extremely hazardous\", but unspecified mission. On 19 February, the group was detached from the Eighth Air Force and officially assigned to [[III Bomber Command]].<ref>Craven and Cate 1948, p. 614.</ref>\n\nInitial planning called for 20 aircraft to fly the mission,<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 440.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 440.</ref> and 24 of the group's B-25B Mitchell bombers were diverted to the [[Mid-Continent Airlines]] modification center in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota. With support provided by two senior airline managers, [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Wold-Chamberlain Field's]] maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. From nearby [[Fort Snelling]], the 710th Military Police Battalion provided tight security around this hangar. B-25B aircraft modifications included the following:\n* Removal of the lower gun turret.\n* Installation of [[de-ice]]rs and [[Antifreeze|anti-icers]].\n* Mounting of steel blast plates on the fuselage around the upper turret.\n* Removal of the liaison radio set to save weight.\n* Installation of a 160-gallon collapsible neoprene auxiliary fuel tank, fixed to the top of the bomb bay, and installation of support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, crawlway, and lower turret area, to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 [[U.S. gallon]]s (538 to 950 [[Gallon#Imperial gallon|imperial gallons]], or 2,445 to 4,319 L).\n* Installation of mock gun barrels in the tail cone.\n* Replacement of the [[Norden bombsight]] with a makeshift aiming sight devised by pilot Capt. [[Charles Ross Greening|C. Ross Greening]] dubbed the \"Mark Twain\". The materials for this bombsight cost only 20 cents.<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\" />\n\nTwo bombers also had cameras mounted to record the results of the bombing.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nThe 24 crews were selected and picked up the modified bombers in Minneapolis and flew them to [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]], Florida, beginning 1 March 1942. There, the crews received concentrated training for three weeks in simulated carrier deck takeoffs, low-level and night flying, low-altitude bombing, and over-water navigation, operating primarily out of [[Wagner Field|Eglin Auxiliary Field #1]], a more secluded site. [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Henry L. Miller, a [[U.S. Navy]] flight instructor from nearby [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], supervised their takeoff training and accompanied the crews to the launch.

Fifteen made up the mission force and the 16th, by last-minute agreement with the Navy, was loaded so that it could be launched shortly after departure from San Francisco to demonstrate to the Army pilots that there was sufficient deck space for a safe takeoff. Instead, that bomber was made part of the mission force.{{refn|1st Lt. Richard Joyce was to have flown this aircraft back to the mainland with Navy Lieut. Miller as his copilot.

Eventually, they were relocated to [[Ashgabat|Ashkhabad]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} from the Iranian border, and York managed to \"bribe\" a smuggler, who helped them cross the border into Iran, which at the time was [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|under British-Soviet occupation]].

Meanwhile, Soviet forces had gained the strategic initiative in Europe. Even if the Americans' \"escape\" managed to gain significant attention in Tokyo, it was by then thought extremely unlikely that Japan would respond with any sort of military retaliation.\n\nDoolittle and his crew, after parachuting into China, received assistance from Chinese soldiers and civilians, as well as [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], an American [[missionary]] in China.

Lawson]] \u2013 a pilot who participated in the raid, focuses on the experiences of himself and his crew. A popular film based on the book was released in 1944. Written while the war was still in progress, Lawson disguised the identities of the persons in China assisting the raiders and did not publish the story until after the USAAF had released an official communique on 20 April 1943 detailing most aspects of the mission, including the identities of the raiders and their fates.\n* ''Doolittle's Tokyo Raiders'', by C. V. Glines (1964) \u2013 tells the complete story of the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. He followed this with a second account, ''The Doolittle Raid: America's daring first strike against Japan'' (1988), incorporating information from first-hand accounts of the Raiders and from Japanese sources.<ref>Glines 1988, p. 226.</ref>\n* ''Target Tokyo: Jimmy Doolittle and the Raid That Avenged Pearl Harbor'', by James M. Scott (2015) \u2013 based on scores of never-before-published records drawn from archives across four continents as well as new interviews with survivors.\n\n=== Films ===\nThe raid inspired several films. The 1943 [[RKO]] film ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' starred [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. The climax of this movie is an attack on Japan by a group of B-17s.\n\nA highly fictionalized film in 1943, ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' starring [[Cary Grant]], tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the fictional submarine {{USS|Copperfin}}. The submarine's mission is to enter [[Tokyo Bay]] undetected and place a landing party ashore to obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data were received. All the after-action reports indicated the raid launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter with the picket ship.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nA 1944 film, ''[[The Purple Heart]]'' was a highly fictionalized account of the torture and execution of Doolittle Raid prisoners.\n\nThe Doolittle Raid was the subject of another 1944 feature film, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', based on the book of the same title by Ted Lawson, who was seriously injured in a crash landing off the coast of China. [[Spencer Tracy]] played Doolittle and [[Van Johnson]] portrayed Lawson. Footage from the film was later used for the opening scenes of ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' and in the TV miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.\n\nThe 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] playing Doolittle) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid. The film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}} in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], to stand in for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, standing in for ''Hornet'' from which the Doolittle Raid was launched. The film's portrayal of the planning of the raid, the air raid itself, and the raid's aftermath, is not historically accurate.<ref>Gutthman, Edward.

It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], later General of the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Army |date=1926 |pages=165}}</ref><!--Doolittle did not receive his General Rank until 1985 actually when he was in the Air Force Reserves. See [[Jimmy Doolittle]].-->\n\nSixteen [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25B Mitchell]] medium bombers were launched without fighter escort from the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|6}} deep in the Western Pacific Ocean, each with a crew of five men. The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan and to continue westward to land in China. The bombing raid killed about 50 people, including civilians, and injured 400. Fifteen aircraft reached China but all crashed, while the 16th landed at [[Vladivostok]] in the Soviet Union. Of the 80 crew members, 77 survived the mission. Eight airmen were captured by Japanese Army troops in China; three were later executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year before being allowed to \"escape\" via [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Soviet-occupied]] [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]] with the help of the [[NKVD]]. Fourteen complete crews of five returned to the United States or to American forces, except for one crewman who was killed in action.<ref name=\"bravemen\" /><ref name=\"Glines 1998, pp. 166\u2013168\">Glines 1998, pp. 166\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe raid caused negligible material damage to Japan, but it had major psychological effects. In the United States, it raised morale. In Japan, it raised doubt about the ability of military leaders to defend the home islands, but the bombing and strafing of civilians also steeled Japanese resolve to gain retribution, and this was exploited for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"hist reex\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historynet.com/aftermath-doolittle-raid-reexamined.htm |title = Aftermath: How the Doolittle Raid Shook Japan|date = 27 July 2015}}</ref> It also pushed forward Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plans to attack [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]] in the Central Pacific, an attack that turned into a decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]]. The consequences were most severely felt in China, where [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign|Japanese reprisals]] caused the deaths of 250,000 civilians and 70,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"hist reex\" />\n\nDoolittle initially believed that the loss of all his aircraft would lead to his court-martial, but he instead received the [[Medal of Honor]] and was promoted two ranks to brigadier general.\n\n== Background ==\nPresident [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] spoke to the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in a meeting at the [[White House]] on 21 December 1941 and said that Japan should be bombed as soon as possible to boost public morale after Pearl Harbor.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 10.</ref> Doolittle recounted in his autobiography that the raid was intended to bolster American morale and to cause the Japanese to begin doubting their leadership. \"An attack on the Japanese homeland would cause confusion in the minds of the Japanese people and sow doubt about the reliability of their leaders.\u2026 Americans badly needed a morale boost.\"<ref>Doolittle and Glines 1991, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dolittle Raider, Plane 1.jpg|thumb|Crew No. 1 in front of B-25#40-2344 on the deck of {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, 18 April 1942.

Leonard, flight engineer/gunner.]]\nThe concept for the attack came from Navy Captain [[Francis S. Low]], Assistant Chief of Staff for antisubmarine warfare. He reported to Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] on 10 January 1942 that he thought that twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at [[Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 13.</ref> \n\nDoolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war, was assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the raid. The aircraft to be used would need a cruising range of {{convert|2400|nmi|km}} with a {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load, so Doolittle selected the B-25B Mitchell to carry out the mission. The range of the Mitchell was about 1,300 miles, so the bombers had to be modified to hold nearly twice the normal fuel reserves. Doolittle also considered the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]], [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], and [[Douglas B-23 Dragon]],<ref>Glines 1998, p. 19.</ref> but the B-26 had questionable takeoff characteristics from a carrier deck and the B-23's wingspan was nearly 50-percent greater than the B-25's, reducing the number that could be taken aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship's superstructure. The B-18 was one of the final two types that Doolittle considered, and he rejected it for the same reason.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> The B-25 had yet to see combat,{{refn|The first bombing mission by B-25s preceded the Doolittle Raid by only 12 days. On 6 April 1942, six Mitchells bombed [[Gasmata]], [[New Britain]]. This was followed on 12 and 13 April by two days of attacks against [[Cebu City]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] in the Philippines.

The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]].<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.</ref>\n\nThe 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from [[Pendleton, Oregon]], was immediately moved cross-country to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] at [[West Columbia, South Carolina]], ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \"extremely hazardous\", but unspecified mission. On 19 February, the group was detached from the Eighth Air Force and officially assigned to [[III Bomber Command]].<ref>Craven and Cate 1948, p. 614.</ref>\n\nInitial planning called for 20 aircraft to fly the mission,<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 440.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 440.</ref> and 24 of the group's B-25B Mitchell bombers were diverted to the [[Mid-Continent Airlines]] modification center in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota. With support provided by two senior airline managers, [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Wold-Chamberlain Field's]] maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. From nearby [[Fort Snelling]], the 710th Military Police Battalion provided tight security around this hangar. B-25B aircraft modifications included the following:\n* Removal of the lower gun turret.\n* Installation of [[de-ice]]rs and [[Antifreeze|anti-icers]].\n* Mounting of steel blast plates on the fuselage around the upper turret.\n* Removal of the liaison radio set to save weight.\n* Installation of a 160-gallon collapsible neoprene auxiliary fuel tank, fixed to the top of the bomb bay, and installation of support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, crawlway, and lower turret area, to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 [[U.S. gallon]]s (538 to 950 [[Gallon#Imperial gallon|imperial gallons]], or 2,445 to 4,319 L).\n* Installation of mock gun barrels in the tail cone.\n* Replacement of the [[Norden bombsight]] with a makeshift aiming sight devised by pilot Capt. [[Charles Ross Greening|C. Ross Greening]] dubbed the \"Mark Twain\". The materials for this bombsight cost only 20 cents.<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\" />\n\nTwo bombers also had cameras mounted to record the results of the bombing.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nThe 24 crews were selected and picked up the modified bombers in Minneapolis and flew them to [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]], Florida, beginning 1 March 1942. There, the crews received concentrated training for three weeks in simulated carrier deck takeoffs, low-level and night flying, low-altitude bombing, and over-water navigation, operating primarily out of [[Wagner Field|Eglin Auxiliary Field #1]], a more secluded site. [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Henry L. Miller, a [[U.S. Navy]] flight instructor from nearby [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], supervised their takeoff training and accompanied the crews to the launch.

Fifteen made up the mission force and the 16th, by last-minute agreement with the Navy, was loaded so that it could be launched shortly after departure from San Francisco to demonstrate to the Army pilots that there was sufficient deck space for a safe takeoff. Instead, that bomber was made part of the mission force.{{refn|1st Lt. Richard Joyce was to have flown this aircraft back to the mainland with Navy Lieut. Miller as his copilot.

Meanwhile, Soviet forces had gained the strategic initiative in Europe. Even if the Americans' \"escape\" managed to gain significant attention in Tokyo, it was by then thought extremely unlikely that Japan would respond with any sort of military retaliation.\n\nDoolittle and his crew, after parachuting into China, received assistance from Chinese soldiers and civilians, as well as [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], an American [[missionary]] in China.

Two of the missing crewmen, bombardier [[staff sergeant|S/Sgt.]] [[William John Dieter|William J. Dieter]] and flight engineer Sgt. Donald E.

The [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Second Fleet]], its main striking force, was near [[Formosa]], returning from the [[Indian Ocean Raid]] to refit and replace its air losses. Spearheaded by five aircraft carriers and its best naval aircraft and aircrews, the Second Fleet was immediately ordered to locate and destroy the U.S. carrier force, but failed to do so.<ref>Glines 1988, pp. 75\u201376.</ref><ref>Craven and Cate 1948, p. 441.</ref> Nagumo and his staff on ''Akagi'' heard that an American force was near Japan but expected an attack on the next day.

Lawson]] \u2013 a pilot who participated in the raid, focuses on the experiences of himself and his crew. A popular film based on the book was released in 1944. Written while the war was still in progress, Lawson disguised the identities of the persons in China assisting the raiders and did not publish the story until after the USAAF had released an official communique on 20 April 1943 detailing most aspects of the mission, including the identities of the raiders and their fates.\n* ''Doolittle's Tokyo Raiders'', by C. V. Glines (1964) \u2013 tells the complete story of the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. He followed this with a second account, ''The Doolittle Raid: America's daring first strike against Japan'' (1988), incorporating information from first-hand accounts of the Raiders and from Japanese sources.<ref>Glines 1988, p. 226.</ref>\n* ''Target Tokyo: Jimmy Doolittle and the Raid That Avenged Pearl Harbor'', by James M. Scott (2015) \u2013 based on scores of never-before-published records drawn from archives across four continents as well as new interviews with survivors.\n\n=== Films ===\nThe raid inspired several films. The 1943 [[RKO]] film ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' starred [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. The climax of this movie is an attack on Japan by a group of B-17s.\n\nA highly fictionalized film in 1943, ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' starring [[Cary Grant]], tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the fictional submarine {{USS|Copperfin}}. The submarine's mission is to enter [[Tokyo Bay]] undetected and place a landing party ashore to obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data were received. All the after-action reports indicated the raid launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter with the picket ship.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nA 1944 film, ''[[The Purple Heart]]'' was a highly fictionalized account of the torture and execution of Doolittle Raid prisoners.\n\nThe Doolittle Raid was the subject of another 1944 feature film, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', based on the book of the same title by Ted Lawson, who was seriously injured in a crash landing off the coast of China. [[Spencer Tracy]] played Doolittle and [[Van Johnson]] portrayed Lawson. Footage from the film was later used for the opening scenes of ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' and in the TV miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.\n\nThe 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] playing Doolittle) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid. The film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}} in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], to stand in for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, standing in for ''Hornet'' from which the Doolittle Raid was launched. The film's portrayal of the planning of the raid, the air raid itself, and the raid's aftermath, is not historically accurate.<ref>Gutthman, Edward.

The Oyo Empire grew to become the largest Yoruba state. It rose through the outstanding organizational and administrative skills of the Yoruba people, wealth gained from trade and its powerful [[cavalry]]. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the entirety of Africa from the mid-7th to the late 18th century,<ref>Forde,1967,p 36</ref> holding sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in [[Yorubaland]], but also over nearby African states, notably the [[Fon people|Fon]] [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in the modern [[Republic of Benin]] to the west.\n\n==Mythical origins==\n{{Yoruba people}}\nThe origins of the Oyo Empire lie with [[Oranyan]] (also known as Oranmiyan), the last prince of the Yoruba Kingdom of Ile-Ife ([[Ife]]). Oranyan made an agreement with his brother to launch a punitive raid on their northern neighbors for insulting their father [[Oduduwa]], the first [[Ooni of Ife]]. On the way to the battle, the brothers quarreled and the army split up.<ref name=\"Stride290\">{{Cite news|url=https://litcaf.com/oranyan/|title=Oranyan|date=2016-01-12|work=Litcaf|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Oranyan's force was too small to make a successful attack, so he wandered the southern shore until reaching Bussa. There the local chief entertained him and provided a large snake with a magic charm attached to its throat.\n\nThe chief instructed Oranyan to follow the snake until it stopped somewhere for seven days and disappeared into the ground. Oranyan followed the advice and founded Oyo where the serpent stopped. The site is remembered as [[Ajaka]]. Oranyan made Oyo his new kingdom and became the first \"oba\" (meaning 'king' or 'ruler' in the [[Yoruba language]]) with the title of \"Alaafin of Oyo\" (Alaafin means 'owner of the palace' in Yoruba).  He left all his treasures in Ife and allowed another king to rule there.<ref name=\"Stride291\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;291</ref>\n\nAt one time, Oyo-ile was at war with the Bariba of Borgu, who wanted to subjugate the new city still under construction. Orangun Ajagunla of Ila, Oranmiyan's elder brother, stormed in with his men to assist. Not long after the war was won, Oranmiyan had a son, Ajuwon Ajaka; much later Arabambi was born by the woman from Tapa ([[Nupe people|Nupe]]). It is believed that the name \"Sango\" was given by his maternal grandfather or he adopted it from the local name for the God of Thunder. Either way the royal family was devoted to The Spirits of Thunder (Jakuta) and War (Ogun).\n\n==Early period (12th century\u20131535)==\n[[File:OyoIle plan bw.gif|thumb|right|150px|A Survey of Old Oyo Palace Compound]]\nOranyan, the first oba (king) of Oyo, was succeeded by Oba Ajaka, Alaafin of Oyo. Ajaka was deposed, because he lacked Yoruba military virtue and allowed his sub-chiefs too much independence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://litcaf.com/ajaka/|title=Ajaka|date=2016-01-12|work=Litcaf|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Leadership was then conferred upon Ajaka's brother, [[Shango]], who was later deified as the deity of thunder and lightning. Ajaka was restored after Sango's death. Ajaka returned to the throne thoroughly more warlike and oppressive. His successor, Kori, managed to conquer the rest of what later historians would refer to as metropolitan Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride291\"/>\n\n===Ibadan===\nThe heart of metropolitan Oyo was its capital at Oyo-Ile (also known as ''Oyo Katunga'' or ''Old Oyo'' or Oyo-oro).<ref name=\"Goddard\">Goddard 1971, pp.&nbsp;207\u2013211.</ref>  The two most important structures in Oyo-Ile were the 'Afin,' or palace of the Oba, and his market. The palace was at the center of the city close to the Oba's market called 'Oja-Oba'. Around the capital was a tall earthen wall for defense with 17 gates. The importance of the two large structures (the palace and the Oja Oba) signified the importance of the king in Oyo.\n\n===The Nupe occupation===\nOyo had grown into a formidable inland power by the end of the 14th century. For over a century, the Yoruba state had expanded at the expense of its neighbors. During the reign of Onigbogi, Oyo suffered military defeats at the hands of the Nupe led by Tsoede.<ref name=\"Stride292\">Stride & Ifeka p.&nbsp;292</ref> Sometime around 1535, the [[Nupe people|Nupe]] occupied Oyo and forced its ruling dynasty to take refuge in the kingdom of [[Borgu]].<ref name=\"Oliver89\">Oliver & Atmore 2001, p.&nbsp;89.</ref>  The Nupe sacked the capital, destroying Oyo as a regional power until the early 17th century.<ref name=\"Thornton77\">Thornton 1999, p.&nbsp;77.</ref>\n\n==Imperial period (1608\u20131800)==\n{{royal house|\n|surname = House of Oranyan\n|type = [[Nigerian]] [[royal dynasty]]\n[[File:African Bush Elephant.jpg|thumb|The [[Elephant]], [[totem]] of the [[Alaafin|kings and emperors]] of Oyo prior to [[Abiodun (Oyo ruler)|Abiodun]]]]\n[[File:VeveOgoun.svg|thumb|The [[veve]] of [[Ogun]], [[war god]] of the Yoruba and totem of both the emperors and kings that have followed Abiodun and the various members of the Bashorun chieftaincy family that have served the state throughout its history]]\n|parent house = [[Oduduwa|Oodua]]\n|founded = c.13th century\n|founder =  [[Oranyan]]\n|region = [[Yorubaland]]\n|current head = [[Lamidi Adeyemi|Adeyemi III]]\n|titles = * [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] [[Alaafin]] of Oyo <br> \n* Iba Bashorun of Oyo\n* Iba Aare Ona Kakanfo of Oyo\n* Iba of Oyo\n* [[Oloye]] of Oyo \n* Omoba of Oyo\n* Oloori of Oyo \n|members = * [[Abiodun (Oyo ruler)|Abiodun]] <br> \n* [[Oluyole]]\n*[[Candido da Fonseca Galvao]]\n|styles =  ''Kabiyesi'' <br>[[Majesty]] <br> [[Imperial Highness]] \n|other_families = [[Ife#The King (The Ooni of Ife)|Ife royal family]] <br> [[Oba of Benin|Bini royal family]]\n|cadet branches = * Alowolodu (Oyo) <br>\n* Agunloye (Oyo)\n* Oluyole ([[Ibadan]])\n* Afonja ([[Ilorin]])\n|religion =  [[Yoruba religion]] <br> [[Christianity]] <br> [[Islam]]\n|motto = ''A ki ro'ba fi la le de Oyo, o ya e je a lo ree Alaafin'' ([[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] for \"Oyo, Descendants of the Alaafin\")  \n}}\n\n\nThe Yoruba of Oyo went through an interregnum of 80 years as an exiled dynasty after its defeat by the Nupe. They re-established Oyo as more centralized and expansive than ever. The people created a government that established its power over a vast empire.<ref name=\"Oliver89\"/>  During the 17th century, Oyo began a long stretch of growth, becoming a major empire.<ref name=\"Thornton77\"/> Oyo never encompassed all Yoruba-speaking people, but it was the most populous kingdom in Yoruba history.<ref name=\"Alpern37\">Alpern 1998, p.&nbsp;37.</ref>\n\n===Reconquest and expansion===\n[[File:WestAfrica1625.png|right|thumb|300px|Oyo Empire and surrounding states, c. 1625.]]\nThe key to Yoruba rebuilding of Oyo was a stronger military and a more centralized government. Taking a cue from their [[Nupe people|Nupe]] enemies (whom they called \"Tapa\"), the Yoruba rearmed with armor and cavalry.<ref name=\"Oliver89\"/>  [[Oba Ofinran]], Alaafin of Oyo, succeeded in regaining Oyo's original territory from the Nupe.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> A new capital, Oyo-Igboho, was constructed, and the original became known as Old Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride292\" /> The next oba, [[Eguguojo]], conquered nearly all of Yorubaland.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> After this, Oba [[Orompoto]] led attacks to obliterate the Nupe to ensure Oyo was never threatened by them again.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> During the reign of Oba, [[Ajiboyede]], he held the first Bere festival, an event to celebrate peace in the kingdom.  Celebrated regularly, it would retain much significance among the Yoruba long after the fall of Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/>\n\nUnder his successor, [[Abipa]], the Yoruba repopulated Oyo-Ile and rebuilt the original capital.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> Despite a failed attempt to conquer the [[Benin Empire]] sometime between 1578 and 1608,<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> Oyo continued to expand. The Yoruba allowed autonomy to the southeast of metropolitan Oyo, where the non-Yoruba areas could act as a buffer between Oyo and Imperial Benin.<ref name=\"Stride296\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;296.</ref> By the end of the 16th century, the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] and [[Aja people|Aja]] states of modern Benin were paying tribute to Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride293\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;293.</ref>\n\n* '''Dahomey Wars'''\nThe reinvigorated Oyo Empire began raiding southward as early as 1682.<ref name=\"Thornton79\">Thornton 1999, p. 79.</ref>  By the end of its military expansion, Oyo's borders would reach to the coast some {{convert|320|km}} southwest of its capital.<ref name=\"Smith122\">Smith 1989, p. 122.</ref> It met little serious opposition until the early 18th century.

Their gunshots scared the Oyo cavalry horses and prevented their charging.<ref name=\"Thornton82\">Thornton 1999, p.&nbsp;82.</ref>  Dahomey's army also built fortifications such as trenches, which forced the Oyo army to fight as infantry.<ref name=\"Thornton86\">Thornton 1999, p.&nbsp;86.</ref> The battle lasted four days, but the Yoruba were eventually victorious after reinforcements arrived.<ref name=\"Thornton86\"/>  Dahomey was forced to pay tribute to Oyo. The Yoruba invaded Dahomey seven times before finally subjugating the small kingdom in 1748.<ref>Alpern 1998, p.&nbsp;165.</ref>\n\n* '''Later conquest'''\nWith its cavalry, Oyo campaigned successfully in conquest and suppression over great distances. The Oyo army was able to attack defensive fortifications, but it was harder to supply an army, and they withdrew when supplies ran out.<ref name=\"Thornton97\">Thornton 1999, p. 97.</ref> The Oyo did not use guns in its major conquests.

With imperial expansion, Oyo reorganized to better manage its vast holdings within and outside of Yorubaland. It was divided into four layers defined by relation to the core of the empire.<ref name=\"Oliver95\">Oliver & Atmore 2001, p.&nbsp;95.</ref> These layers were Metropolitan Oyo, southern Yorubaland, the Egbado Corridor and Ajaland.\n\n*'''Metropolitan Oyo'''\nMetropolitan Oyo corresponded, more or less, to the Oyo state prior to the Nupe invasion.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>  This was the hub of the empire, where the Yoruba spoke the Oyo dialect.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> Metropolitan Oyo was divided into six provinces, with three on the west side of the [[Ogun River]] and three to the river's east.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> Each province was supervised by a governor appointed directly by the Alaafin of Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride297\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;297.</ref>\n\n*'''Yorubaland'''\nThe second layer of the empire was composed of the towns closest to Oyo-Ile, which were recognized as brothers.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>   This area was south of metropolitan Oyo, and its Yoruba inhabitants spoke different dialects from that of Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> These tributary states were led by their own rulers, titled Obas,<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> who were confirmed by the Alaafin of Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/>\n\n*'''Egbado Corridor'''\nThe empire's third layer was the Egbado Corridor southwest of Yorubaland. This area was inhabited by the [[Egba people|Egba]] and [[Egbado]], and guaranteed Oyo's trade with the coast. The Egba and [[Egbado]] tributaries were allowed, like their Yoruba counterparts, to rule themselves. They were, however, supervised by Ajele.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>  These were agents appointed by the Alaafin of Oyo to oversee his interest and monitor commerce. The lead representative of Oyo in the corridor was the Olu, ruler of the town of Ilaro.<ref name=\"Smith122\"/>\n\n*'''Ajaland'''\nAjaland was the last layer added to the empire.  It was the most restive and distant, and kept in line with threats of expeditions against it.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>  This territory extended from the non-Yoruba areas west of the Egbado Corridor far into Ewe controlled territory in modern [[Togo]].<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> This area, like all tributary states, was allowed a fair degree of autonomy as long as taxes were paid, the orders from Oyo were strictly followed, and access to local markets was provided to Oyo merchants.<ref name=\"Stride293\"/> The Oyo often demanded tribute in slaves. The tributary chiefs sometimes made war on other peoples to capture slaves for this purpose.<ref name=\"Alpern34\">Alpern 1998, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> Oyo was known to punish disobedience by wholesale slaughter of the erring community, as it accomplished in [[Allada]] in 1698.<ref name=\"Stride293\"/>\n\n===Political structure===\nThe Oyo Empire developed a highly sophisticated political structure to govern its territorial domains. Scholars have not determined how much of this structure existed prior to the Nupe invasion.After reemerging from exile in the early 17th century, Oyo took on a noticeably more militant character. The influence of an aggressive Yoruba culture is exemplified in the standards placed on the oba (king) and the roles of his council.\n\n===The Alaafin of Oyo===\nThe oba (meaning 'king' in the Yoruba language) at Oyo, who was referred to as the [[Alaafin]] of Oyo (Alaafin means 'owner of the palace' in Yoruba), was the head of the empire and supreme overlord of the people.<ref name=\"Stride298\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;298.</ref> He was responsible for keeping tributaries safe from attack, settling internal quarrels between sub-rulers, and mediating between those sub-rulers and their people.<ref name=\"Stride298\"/>  The Alaafin of Oyo was also expected to give his subordinates honours and presents.<ref name=\"Stride298\"/>  In return, all sub-rulers had to pay homage to the Oba and renew their allegiance at annual ceremonies.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> The most important of these was the Bere festival, marking the acclamation of successful rule by the Alaafin.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> After the Bere festival, peace in Yorubaland was supposed to last for three years.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> The king could not be disposed of but could be compelled to commit suicide if he was no longer wanted. This was done by sending Bashorun (The prime minister) to present either an empty [[calabash]] or a dish of [[parrot]]'s eggs to him and pass a sentence of rejection, known as ''Awon Eniyan Koo'' (i.e. the people reject you, the world rejects you and the gods reject you also). According to tradition, the Alaafin was expected to commit [[ritual suicide]] thereafter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/africa/2004/database/fasanya.html|title=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/africa/2004/database/fasanya.html|last=Fasanya|first=Akin|date=2004|website=The University of Texas at Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914094301/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/africa/2004/database/fasanya.html|archive-date=2017-09-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=====Selection of the Alaafin=====\nThe Oyo Empire was not a purely hereditary monarchy, nor was it an absolute one.<ref name=\"Stride298\"/> The Oyo Mesi selected the Alaafin.  He was not always closely related to his predecessor, although he did have to be descended from [[Oranmiyan]], a son of [[Oduduwa]], and to hail from the Ona Isokun ward (which is one of the three royal wards).<ref name=\"Stride298\"/>  At the beginning of the Oyo Empire, the Alaafin's eldest son usually succeeded his father upon the throne. This sometimes led the [[crown prince]], known as the Aremo, to hasten the death of his father. Inorder to prevent this occurrence, it became traditional for the crown prince to be made to commit ritual suicide upon his father's death. Independent of the succession, the Aremo was quite powerful in his own right. For instance, by custom the Alaafin abstained from leaving the palace, except during the important festivals, which in practice curtailed his power. By contrast, the Aremo often left the palace. This led the noted historian [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|S. Johnson]] to observe: \"The father is the king of the palace, and the son the king for the general public\".<ref>Church Missionary Society, G.31 A.2/1888-9, Letter of S. Johnson to the Rev. J.B. Wood, 8 November 1887, as cited by Law R., ''The Oyo Empire c. 1600-c. 1836'', p. 71 (1977)</ref> The two councils which checked the Alaafin had a tendency to select a weak Alaafin after the reign of a strong one to keep the office from becoming too powerful.<ref name=\"Stride300\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;300.</ref>\n\n=====The Ilari=====\nThe Alaafin of Oyo appointed certain religious and government officials, who were usually [[eunuchs]].<ref name=\"Stride_299\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;299.</ref> These officials were known as the ''ilari'' or half-heads, because of the custom of shaving half of their heads and applying what was believed to be a magical substance into them.<ref name=\"Smith12\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;12.</ref> The hundreds of Ilari were divided evenly between the sexes.<ref name=\"Smith12\"/>  Junior members of the Ilari did menial tasks, while seniors acted as guards or sometimes messengers to the other world via sacrifice.<ref name=\"Smith12\"/>  Their titles related to the king, such as ''oba l'olu'' (\"the king is supreme\") or ''madarikan'' (\"do not oppose him\").<ref name=\"Smith12\"/>  They carried red and green fans as credentials of their status.<ref name=\"Smith12\"/>\n\nAll sub-courts of Oyo had Ilari who acted as both spies and taxmen.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> Oyo appointed these to visit and sometimes reside in Dahomey and the Egbado Corridor to collect taxes and spy on Dahomey's military successes, so that the Alaafin of Oyo could get his cut.<ref name=\"Smith10\">Smith 1989, p. 10.</ref><ref name=\"Smith10\"/>\n\n====The Councils====\nWhile the Alaafin of Oyo was supreme overlord of the people, he was not without checks on his power. The [[Oyo Mesi]] and the Yoruba Earth cult known as [[Ogboni]] kept the [[Oba (king)|Oba]]'s power in check.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/>  The Oyo Mesi spoke for the politicians while the Ogboni spoke for the people and were backed by the power of religion.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/>  The power of the Alaafin of Oyo in relation to the Oyo Mesi and Ogboni depended on his personal character and political shrewdness.\n\n=====Oyo Mesi=====\n{{more footnotes|date=April 2012}}\nThe Oyo Mesi were seven principal councillors of the state. They constituted the Electoral Council and possessed legislative powers. Led by the Bashorun, acting as prime minister, and consisting of the Agbaakin, the Samu, the Alapini, the Laguna, the Akiniku and the Ashipa, they represented the voice of the nation and had the chief responsibility of protecting the interests of the empire. The Alaafin was required to take counsel from them whenever any important matter affecting the state occurred.<ref name=\"WAfrica\">Afolayan, Funso. (2000) \"Kingdoms of West Africa\", ''Africa Vol. 1'' ed. by Tony Falola, p. 173.</ref> Each chief had a state duty to perform at court every morning and afternoon.  Each also had a deputy whom they would send to the Alaafin if their absence was unavoidable. The Oyo Mesi developed as a check on the Alaafin's power, preventing the Alaafin from being an [[autocracy|autocrat]]; they compelled many Alaafins to commit suicide during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name=\"WAfrica\" />\n\nThe head of the council of Oyo Mesi, the Bashorun, consulted the [[Ifa]] oracle prior to the royal succession for approval from the gods. New alaafins of Oyo were therefore seen as being appointed by the gods. They were regarded as ''Ekeji Orisa,'' meaning \"deputy of the gods.\" The Bashorun had final say on the nomination of the new Alaafin, his power rivaling that of the king himself. For example, the Bashorun orchestrated many religious festivals; he did this in addition to being commander-in-chief of the army, which gave him considerable independent religious authority.\n\nChief among the responsibilities of the Bashorun was the all important festival of Orun. This religious divination, held every year, was to determine if the members of the Mesi still held favour with the Alaafin. If the council decided on the disapproval of the Alaafin, the Bashorun presented the Alaafin with an empty calabash, or parrot's eggs, as a sign that he must commit suicide. This was the only way to remove the Alaafin because he could not legally be deposed. Once given the calabash or the parrot's eggs, the Alaafin, his eldest son the Aremo, and his personal counselor within the Oyo Mesi, the Asamu,<ref name=\"WAfrica\" /> all had to commit suicide in order to renew the government. The suicide ceremony took place during the Orun festival.\n\n=====The Ogboni=====\nThe Oyo Mesi did not enjoy an absolute power either. While the Oyo Mesi wielded political influence, the Ogboni represented the popular opinion backed by the authority of religion, and therefore the views of the Oyo Mesi could be moderated by the Ogboni. There were checks and balances on the power of the Alafin and the Oyo Mesi and thus no one was arrogated absolute power. The Ogboni was a very powerful secret society composed of aristocratic freemen noted for their age, wisdom and importance in religious and political affairs.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/> Its members enjoyed immense power over the common people due to their religious station. A testament to how widespread the institution was is the fact that there were (and still are) Ogboni councils at nearly all sub-courts within Yorubaland.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/>  Aside from their duties in respect to the worship of the earth, they were responsible for judging any case dealing with the spilling of blood.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/> The leader of the Ogboni, the Oluwo, had the unqualified right of direct access to the Alaafin of Oyo on any matter.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/>\n\n===Military===\nThere was a high degree of professionalism in the army of the Oyo Empire.<ref name=\"Stride301\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;301.</ref> Its military success was due in large part to its cavalry as well as the leadership and courage of Oyo officers and warriors.<ref name=\"Stride301\"/> Because its main geographic focus was north of the forest, Oyo enjoyed easier farming and thus a steady growth in population.<ref name=\"Stride301\"/> This contributed to Oyo's ability to consistently field a large force. There was also an entrenched military culture in Oyo where victory was obligatory and defeat carried the duty of committing suicide.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/> This do-or-die policy no doubt contributed to the military aggressiveness of Oyo's generals.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/>\n\n====Cavalry====\nThe Oyo Empire was the only Yoruba state to adopt [[cavalry]]; it did so because most of its territory was in the northern [[savannah]].<ref name=\"Smith48\"/>  The origin of the cavalry is disputed; however, the [[Nupe people|Nupe]], [[Borgu]] and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] in neighbouring territories also used cavalry and may have had the same historical source.<ref name=\"Law\">Law 1975, pp.&nbsp;1\u201315.</ref> Oyo was able to purchase horses from the north and maintain them in metropolitan Oyo because of partial freedom from the [[tsetse fly]].<ref name=\"Stride302\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;302.</ref> Cavalry was the long arm of the Oyo Empire. Late 16th and 17th century expeditions were composed entirely of cavalry.<ref name=\"Smith48\"/>  There were drawbacks to this. Oyo could not maintain its cavalry army in the south but could raid at will.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/><ref>''[[Why Nations Fail]]: The origins of power, prosperity and poverty.'' p. 254.  Acemoglu, Daron; Robinson, James A. 2012. {{ISBN|9780307719218}}</ref>\n\nCavalry in highly developed societies such as Oyo was divided into light and heavy.<ref name=\"Smith48\"/> Heavy cavalry on larger imported horses was armed with heavy thrusting [[lance]]s or spears and also with [[sword]]s.<ref name=\"Smith48\"/> Light cavalry on smaller indigenous ponies was armed with throwing spears or bows.<ref name=\"Smith50\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;50.</ref>\n\n====Infantry====\nInfantry in the region around the Oyo Empire was uniform in both armour and armament. All infantry in the region carried shields, swords and lances of one type or another.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/> Shields were four feet tall and two feet wide and made of elephant or ox hide.<ref name=\"Thornton80\">Thornton 1999, p.&nbsp;80.</ref> A {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} heavy sword was the main armament for close combat.<ref name=\"Thornton80\"/> The Yoruba and their neighbours used triple barbed javelins which could be thrown accurately from about 30 paces.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/>\n\n====Structure====\nThe Oyo Empire, like many empires before it, used both local and tributary forces to expand its domains. The structure of the Oyo military prior to its imperial period was simple and closer aligned to the central government in metropolitan Oyo. This may have been adequate in the 15th century when Oyo controlled only its heartland, but to make and maintain conquest farther away, the structure underwent several changes.\n\n=====The Eso=====\nOyo maintained a semi-standing army of specialist cavalry soldiers called the ''Eso'', the ''Esho'' or, formally, the [[Eso Ikoyi|Eso of Ikoyi]].<ref name=\"Smith56\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;56.</ref> These were 70 junior war chiefs who were nominated by the Oyo Mesi and confirmed by the Alaafin of Oyo.<ref name=\"Smith56\"/> The Eso were appointed for their military skill without regard to heritage, although de facto dynasties of Eso were also known to exist. The Eso were led by the Are-Ona-Kakanfo,<ref name=\"Stride300\"/> and were famous for living by a [[Emi Omo Eso|warrior code]] that was comparable to the Latin dictum [[Infra dig|infra dignitatem]].\n======Are Ona Kakanfo======\t\nAfter Oyo's return from exile, the post of Are-Ona-Kakanfo was established as the supreme military commander.<ref name=\"Smith53\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;53.</ref> He was required to live in a frontier province of great importance to keep an eye on the enemy and to keep him from usurping the throne.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/> During Oyo's imperial period, the Are-Ona-Kakanfo personally commanded the army in the field on all campaigns.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/>\n\n=====Metropolitan Army=====\nSince the Are-Ona-Kakanfo could not reside near the capital, arrangements had to be made for the latter's protection in case of emergency. Forces inside metropolitan Oyo were commanded by the Bashorun, leading member of the Oyo Mesi.<ref name=\"Smith53\"/> As stated earlier, Metropolitan Oyo was divided into six provinces divided evenly by a river. Provincial forces were thus grouped into two armies, under the ''Onikoyi'' and the ''Okere'' for the east and west side of the river respectively.<ref name=\"Smith53\"/> Lesser war chiefs were known as Balogun, a title carried on by the soldiers of Oyo's successor state, [[Ibadan]].<ref name=\"Smith57\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;57.</ref>\n\n=====Tributary Army=====\nTributary leaders and provincial governors were responsible for collecting tribute and contributing troops under local generalship to the imperial army in times of emergency.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> Occasionally, tributary leaders would be ordered to attack neighbors even without the backing of the main imperial army.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> These forces were often utilized in Oyo's distant campaigns on the coast or against other states.\n\n===Commerce===\nOyo became the southern emporium of the Trans-Saharan trade. Exchanges were made in salt, leather, horses, kola nuts, ivory, cloth and slaves.<ref name=\"Stride302\"/> The Yoruba of metropolitan Oyo were also highly skilled in craft making and iron work.<ref name=\"Stride302\"/> Aside from taxes on trade products coming in and out of the empire, Oyo also became wealthy off the taxes imposed on its tributaries. Taxes on the kingdom of Dahomey alone brought in an amount estimated at 638 thousand U.S. dollars a year.<ref name=\"Stride301\"/>\n\n==Zenith==\n[[File:Oyoxviii.jpeg|right|thumb|220px|Oyo Empire and surrounding states c. 1700.]]\nBy 1680, the Oyo Empire spanned over 150,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\"Thornton104\">Thornton 1998, p.&nbsp;104.</ref> It reached the height of its power in the 18th century.<ref name=\"Stride293\"/> Despite its violent creation, it was held together by mutual self-interest.<ref name=\"Stride298\"/> The government was able to provide unity for a vast area through a combination of local autonomy and imperial authority.<ref name=\"Stride301\"/>\n\nUnlike the great savannah empires, of which Oyo may not be called a successor since it was a successor of Ife, there was little if any Islamic influence in the empire.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>  It is known that at least some Muslim officials were kept in Metropolitan Oyo,<ref name=\"Smith20\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;20.</ref> and men capable of writing and calculating in [[Arabic]] were reported by French traders in 1787.<ref name=\"Smith20\"/>\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:Araldiz Manno 259.svg|thumb|[[Solomon's knot]], a quasi-[[heraldic]] symbol of Yoruba royalty]]\nMany believe the decline of the Oyo empire had started as early as 1754 with the dynastic intrigues and palace coups sponsored by the Oyo [[Prime Minister]] [[Gaha]]. Gaha, in his quest for absolute power, conspired with the Oyo Mesi and probably to some extent the Ogboni to force four successive Alaafins to commit ritual suicide after they had been presented with the symbolic parrot's eggs. Between June and October 1754 alone, two Alaafins had been forced to commit suicide by Gaha.<ref>(PRO:T.70/1523).\"Extract of letter of W. Devaynes, Governor of the English fort at Whydah, 22\nOct. 1754, quoted in letter of T. Melvil, Cape Coast Castle, 30 Nov. 1754\". Public Records Office, London</ref> Because of this, Alaafin Awonbioju spent 130 days on the throne, while Alaafin Labisi only spent 17 days on the throne. Gaha's treachery was not ended until 1774 during the reign of Alaafin Abiodun, the fifth Alaafin he served. Gaha was subsequently executed by Abiodun but the instability that had been brought about by these intrigues had further weakened Oyo.\n\nAlaafin Abiodun during his reign had also conducted failed campaigns against Borgu in 1783<ref>(PRO: T.70/1545). \"Letter of Lionel Abson, Governor of the English fort at Whydah, 26 Sept. 1783\" Public Records Office, London</ref> and Nupe in 1789,<ref>Dalzel, Archibald. \"The History of Dahomy, An Inland Kingdom of Africa\" London,1793,p.229</ref> losing the equivalent of 11 and 13 generals and their men respectively. Abiodun was subsequently murdered by his own son Awole, who subsequently ascended his father's throne.\n\nThe events that led to the secession of Ilorin began in 1793. Ilorin was a war camp headed by the Are-Ona Kakanfo Afonja. Afonja took cause with Awole when the latter commanded him to attack Alaafin Abiodun's maternal home, Iwere-Ile. Afonja, being bound by an oath and also desirous not to fall under a curse from a previous Alaafin made to the effect that any Aare Ona Kakanfo who attacked Iwere-Ile (his paternal home) was to die miserably, refused to comply. A further cause was given in 1795, when Awole ordered Afonja to attack the market town of Apomu, a part of Ile-Ife. All Alaafins, due to the Yoruba belief that Ife was the spiritual home of the Yorubas, were previously made to swear an oath never to attack Ife.<ref name=Akinjogbin>{{Cite book\n|title =War and Peace in Yorubaland 1793-1893\n|first =  Adeagbo \n|last =  Akinjogbin\n|year = 1998\n|isbn = 9781294973\n}}</ref>  Afonja carried out Awole's order and sacked Apomu, but on the return of the army from the campaign he marched on the capital Oyo-Ile (which was itself a taboo), and demanded that Awole abdicate.<ref name=Bowdich>{{Cite book\n|title =Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee (1819)\n|first =  Edward\n|last =  Bowdich\n|year = 1966\n|isbn = 0714617946\n}}</ref> Awole eventually committed ritual suicide.<ref name=\"Akinjogbin\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Awole,  there was a scramble for the throne by numerous contenders; some were reported to have spent less than six months on the throne; there was also a period of interregnum of almost twenty years where the various factions could not agree on a candidate.<ref name=\"Akinjogbin\"/> This power vacuum led to the ascendancy of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and Solagberu, the Otun Are-Ona Kakanfo. \n===Loss of the Egbado Corridor===\nAs Oyo tore itself apart via political intrigue, its vassals began taking advantage of the situation to press for independence. The Egba, under the leadership of a war chief called Lishabi, massacred the Ilari stationed in their area and drove off an Oyo punitive force.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/>\n\n===The Dahomey Revolt===\nIn 1823 Dahomey was reported to have raided  villages that were under the protection of Oyo for slaves due to the high demand for them. Oyo immediately demanded a huge tribute from King [[Gezo]] for the unauthorized incursion, to which Gezo dispatched his Brazilian viceroy, Chacha [[Francisco F\u00e9lix de Sousa]], to the Alaafin at Oyo to make peace. The peace talks eventually broke down, and Oyo subsequently attacked Dahomey.<ref>.\"Royal Gold Coast Gazette and Commercial Intelligencer\" Cape coast, 1822-3</ref> The Oyo army was decisively defeated, ending Oyo's hegemony over Dahomey.<ref name=\"Alpern166\">Alpern 1998, p.&nbsp;166.</ref> After gaining its independence, Dahomey began raiding the corridor.<ref name=\"Smith122\"/>\n\n===Ago d'Oyo===\nAfter the destruction of Oyo-Ile, the capital was moved further south, to Ago d'Oyo. Oba Atiba sought to preserve what remained of Oyo by placing on Ibadan the duty of protecting the capital from the Ilorin in the north and northeast.<ref name=\"Smith123\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;123.</ref> He also attempted to get the Ijaye to protect Oyo from the west against the Dahomeans.<ref name=\"Smith123\"/>  The center of Yoruba power moved further south to [[Ibadan]], a Yoruba war camp settled by Oyo commanders in 1830.<ref name=\"Smith48\"/>\n\n===Final demise===\n[[File:Aladin Oyo (when Arsmo).png|thumb|right|Alaafin Oyo c. 1910]]\n\nMain article: [[List of rulers of the Yoruba state of Oyo]]\n\nAtiba's gambit failed, and Oyo never regained its prominence in the region. The Oba, otherwise called Atiba Atobatele, died in 1859; His son Adeyemi I, the third Alaafin to rule in the present Oyo, died in 1905. During the colonial period, the Yorubas were one of the most urbanized groups in Africa. About 22% of the population lived in large areas with populations exceeding 100,000, and over 50% lived in cities made up of 25,000 or more people. The index of urbanization in 1950 was close to that of the United States, excluding Ilorin. The Yoruba continue to be the most urbanized African ethnic group today. Prominent contemporary cities include [[Ibadan]], [[Osogbo]], and [[Ogbomoso]], which are some of the major cities that flourished after old Oyo's collapse.<ref name=\"Bascom\">Bascom 1962, pp.&nbsp;699-709.</ref>\n\nA remnant of the monarchy continues to exist as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of contemporary Nigeria.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Oyotunji|Oyotunji African Village]]\n*[[Rulers of the Yoruba state of Oyo]]\n*[[History of Nigeria]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Afolayan\n  | first = Funso\n  | title = Kingdoms of West Africa: Benin, Oyo and Asante\n  | series = Africa\n  | volume = 2\n  | editor-last = Falola\n  | editor-first = Toyin\n  | publisher = Carolina Academic Press\n  | date = 2000\n  | page = 173\n  | isbn = 0-89089-768-9}}\n\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Alpern\n  | first = Stanley B.\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Amazons of Black Sparta: The Women Warriors of Dahomey\n  | publisher = New York University Press\n  | year = 1998\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | isbn = 0-8147-0678-9\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/amazonsofblacksp0000alpe\n  }}\n\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Bowdich\n  | first = Thomas Edward\n  | authorlink = Thomas Edward Bowdich\n  | title = Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee, with a statistical account of that kingdom, and geographical notices of other parts of the interior of Africa\n  | publisher =  J.

The Oyo Empire grew to become the largest Yoruba state. It rose through the outstanding organizational and administrative skills of the Yoruba people, wealth gained from trade and its powerful [[cavalry]]. The Oyo Empire was the most politically important state in the entirety of Africa from the mid-7th to the late 18th century,<ref>Forde,1967,p 36</ref> holding sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in [[Yorubaland]], but also over nearby African states, notably the [[Fon people|Fon]] [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in the modern [[Republic of Benin]] to the west.\n\n==Mythical origins==\n{{Yoruba people}}\nThe origins of the Oyo Empire lie with [[Oranyan]] (also known as Oranmiyan), the last prince of the Yoruba Kingdom of Ile-Ife ([[Ife]]). Oranyan made an agreement with his brother to launch a punitive raid on their northern neighbors for insulting their father [[Oduduwa]], the first [[Ooni of Ife]]. On the way to the battle, the brothers quarreled and the army split up.<ref name=\"Stride290\">{{Cite news|url=https://litcaf.com/oranyan/|title=Oranyan|date=2016-01-12|work=Litcaf|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Oranyan's force was too small to make a successful attack, so he wandered the southern shore until reaching Bussa. There the local chief entertained him and provided a large snake with a magic charm attached to its throat.\n\nThe chief instructed Oranyan to follow the snake until it stopped somewhere for seven days and disappeared into the ground. Oranyan followed the advice and founded Oyo where the serpent stopped. The site is remembered as [[Ajaka]]. Oranyan made Oyo his new kingdom and became the first \"oba\" (meaning 'king' or 'ruler' in the [[Yoruba language]]) with the title of \"Alaafin of Oyo\" (Alaafin means 'owner of the palace' in Yoruba).  He left all his treasures in Ife and allowed another king to rule there.<ref name=\"Stride291\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;291</ref>\n\nAt one time, Oyo-ile was at war with the Bariba of Borgu, who wanted to subjugate the new city still under construction. Orangun Ajagunla of Ila, Oranmiyan's elder brother, stormed in with his men to assist. Not long after the war was won, Oranmiyan had a son, Ajuwon Ajaka; much later Arabambi was born by the woman from Tapa ([[Nupe people|Nupe]]). It is believed that the name \"Sango\" was given by his maternal grandfather or he adopted it from the local name for the God of Thunder. Either way the royal family was devoted to The Spirits of Thunder (Jakuta) and War (Ogun).\n\n==Early period (12th century\u20131535)==\n[[File:OyoIle plan bw.gif|thumb|right|150px|A Survey of Old Oyo Palace Compound]]\nOranyan, the first oba (king) of Oyo, was succeeded by Oba Ajaka, Alaafin of Oyo. Ajaka was deposed, because he lacked Yoruba military virtue and allowed his sub-chiefs too much independence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://litcaf.com/ajaka/|title=Ajaka|date=2016-01-12|work=Litcaf|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Leadership was then conferred upon Ajaka's brother, [[Shango]], who was later deified as the deity of thunder and lightning. Ajaka was restored after Sango's death. Ajaka returned to the throne thoroughly more warlike and oppressive. His successor, Kori, managed to conquer the rest of what later historians would refer to as metropolitan Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride291\"/>\n\n===Ibadan===\nThe heart of metropolitan Oyo was its capital at Oyo-Ile (also known as ''Oyo Katunga'' or ''Old Oyo'' or Oyo-oro).<ref name=\"Goddard\">Goddard 1971, pp.&nbsp;207\u2013211.</ref>  The two most important structures in Oyo-Ile were the 'Afin,' or palace of the Oba, and his market. The palace was at the center of the city close to the Oba's market called 'Oja-Oba'. Around the capital was a tall earthen wall for defense with 17 gates. The importance of the two large structures (the palace and the Oja Oba) signified the importance of the king in Oyo.\n\n===The Nupe occupation===\nOyo had grown into a formidable inland power by the end of the 14th century. For over a century, the Yoruba state had expanded at the expense of its neighbors. During the reign of Onigbogi, Oyo suffered military defeats at the hands of the Nupe led by Tsoede.<ref name=\"Stride292\">Stride & Ifeka p.&nbsp;292</ref> Sometime around 1535, the [[Nupe people|Nupe]] occupied Oyo and forced its ruling dynasty to take refuge in the kingdom of [[Borgu]].<ref name=\"Oliver89\">Oliver & Atmore 2001, p.&nbsp;89.</ref>  The Nupe sacked the capital, destroying Oyo as a regional power until the early 17th century.<ref name=\"Thornton77\">Thornton 1999, p.&nbsp;77.</ref>\n\n==Imperial period (1608\u20131800)==\n{{royal house|\n|surname = House of Oranyan\n|type = [[Nigerian]] [[royal dynasty]]\n[[File:African Bush Elephant.jpg|thumb|The [[Elephant]], [[totem]] of the [[Alaafin|kings and emperors]] of Oyo prior to [[Abiodun (Oyo ruler)|Abiodun]]]]\n[[File:VeveOgoun.svg|thumb|The [[veve]] of [[Ogun]], [[war god]] of the Yoruba and totem of both the emperors and kings that have followed Abiodun and the various members of the Bashorun chieftaincy family that have served the state throughout its history]]\n|parent house = [[Oduduwa|Oodua]]\n|founded = c.13th century\n|founder =  [[Oranyan]]\n|region = [[Yorubaland]]\n|current head = [[Lamidi Adeyemi|Adeyemi III]]\n|titles = * [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] [[Alaafin]] of Oyo <br> \n* Iba Bashorun of Oyo\n* Iba Aare Ona Kakanfo of Oyo\n* Iba of Oyo\n* [[Oloye]] of Oyo \n* Omoba of Oyo\n* Oloori of Oyo \n|members = * [[Abiodun (Oyo ruler)|Abiodun]] <br> \n* [[Oluyole]]\n*[[Candido da Fonseca Galvao]]\n|styles =  ''Kabiyesi'' <br>[[Majesty]] <br> [[Imperial Highness]] \n|other_families = [[Ife#The King (The Ooni of Ife)|Ife royal family]] <br> [[Oba of Benin|Bini royal family]]\n|cadet branches = * Alowolodu (Oyo) <br>\n* Agunloye (Oyo)\n* Oluyole ([[Ibadan]])\n* Afonja ([[Ilorin]])\n|religion =  [[Yoruba religion]] <br> [[Christianity]] <br> [[Islam]]\n|motto = ''A ki ro'ba fi la le de Oyo, o ya e je a lo ree Alaafin'' ([[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] for \"Oyo, Descendants of the Alaafin\")  \n}}\n\n\nThe Yoruba of Oyo went through an interregnum of 80 years as an exiled dynasty after its defeat by the Nupe. They re-established Oyo as more centralized and expansive than ever. The people created a government that established its power over a vast empire.<ref name=\"Oliver89\"/>  During the 17th century, Oyo began a long stretch of growth, becoming a major empire.<ref name=\"Thornton77\"/> Oyo never encompassed all Yoruba-speaking people, but it was the most populous kingdom in Yoruba history.<ref name=\"Alpern37\">Alpern 1998, p.&nbsp;37.</ref>\n\n===Reconquest and expansion===\n[[File:WestAfrica1625.png|right|thumb|300px|Oyo Empire and surrounding states, c. 1625.]]\nThe key to Yoruba rebuilding of Oyo was a stronger military and a more centralized government. Taking a cue from their [[Nupe people|Nupe]] enemies (whom they called \"Tapa\"), the Yoruba rearmed with armor and cavalry.<ref name=\"Oliver89\"/>  [[Oba Ofinran]], Alaafin of Oyo, succeeded in regaining Oyo's original territory from the Nupe.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> A new capital, Oyo-Igboho, was constructed, and the original became known as Old Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride292\" /> The next oba, [[Eguguojo]], conquered nearly all of Yorubaland.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> After this, Oba [[Orompoto]] led attacks to obliterate the Nupe to ensure Oyo was never threatened by them again.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> During the reign of Oba, [[Ajiboyede]], he held the first Bere festival, an event to celebrate peace in the kingdom.  Celebrated regularly, it would retain much significance among the Yoruba long after the fall of Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/>\n\nUnder his successor, [[Abipa]], the Yoruba repopulated Oyo-Ile and rebuilt the original capital.<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> Despite a failed attempt to conquer the [[Benin Empire]] sometime between 1578 and 1608,<ref name=\"Stride292\"/> Oyo continued to expand. The Yoruba allowed autonomy to the southeast of metropolitan Oyo, where the non-Yoruba areas could act as a buffer between Oyo and Imperial Benin.<ref name=\"Stride296\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;296.</ref> By the end of the 16th century, the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] and [[Aja people|Aja]] states of modern Benin were paying tribute to Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride293\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;293.</ref>\n\n* '''Dahomey Wars'''\nThe reinvigorated Oyo Empire began raiding southward as early as 1682.<ref name=\"Thornton79\">Thornton 1999, p. 79.</ref>  By the end of its military expansion, Oyo's borders would reach to the coast some {{convert|320|km}} southwest of its capital.<ref name=\"Smith122\">Smith 1989, p. 122.</ref> It met little serious opposition until the early 18th century. In 1728, the Oyo Empire invaded the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in a major campaign of its cavalry.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/><ref name=\"Smith48\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;48.</ref>  Dahomey warriors, on the other hand, had no cavalry but many firearms. Their gunshots scared the Oyo cavalry horses and prevented their charging.<ref name=\"Thornton82\">Thornton 1999, p.&nbsp;82.</ref>  Dahomey's army also built fortifications such as trenches, which forced the Oyo army to fight as infantry.<ref name=\"Thornton86\">Thornton 1999, p.&nbsp;86.</ref> The battle lasted four days, but the Yoruba were eventually victorious after reinforcements arrived.<ref name=\"Thornton86\"/>  Dahomey was forced to pay tribute to Oyo. The Yoruba invaded Dahomey seven times before finally subjugating the small kingdom in 1748.<ref>Alpern 1998, p.&nbsp;165.</ref>\n\n* '''Later conquest'''\nWith its cavalry, Oyo campaigned successfully in conquest and suppression over great distances. The Oyo army was able to attack defensive fortifications, but it was harder to supply an army, and they withdrew when supplies ran out.<ref name=\"Thornton97\">Thornton 1999, p. 97.</ref> The Oyo did not use guns in its major conquests. The military waited until the 19th century to adopt them.<ref name=\"Thornton97\"/> In 1764, a joint Akan (Akyem)-Dahomey-Oyo<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Institue%20of%20African%20Studies%20Research%20Review/1973v9n1/asrv009001004.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220084556/http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/Institue%20of%20African%20Studies%20Research%20Review/1973v9n1/asrv009001004.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-20 }}</ref> force defeated an [[Empire of Ashanti|Asante]] army.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/>  The alliance victory defined borders between the neighboring states.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/>  Oyo led a successful campaign into [[Mahi people|Mahi]] territory north of Dahomey in the late 18th century.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/> The Yoruba also used the forces of their tributaries; for instance, they accomplished a 1784 naval blockade of Badagri with an Oyo-Dahomey-Lagos force.<ref>Thornton 1999, p.&nbsp;88.</ref>\n\n===Organization===\nAt the beginning, the people were concentrated in metropolitan Oyo.  With imperial expansion, Oyo reorganized to better manage its vast holdings within and outside of Yorubaland. It was divided into four layers defined by relation to the core of the empire.<ref name=\"Oliver95\">Oliver & Atmore 2001, p.&nbsp;95.</ref> These layers were Metropolitan Oyo, southern Yorubaland, the Egbado Corridor and Ajaland.\n\n*'''Metropolitan Oyo'''\nMetropolitan Oyo corresponded, more or less, to the Oyo state prior to the Nupe invasion.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>  This was the hub of the empire, where the Yoruba spoke the Oyo dialect.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> Metropolitan Oyo was divided into six provinces, with three on the west side of the [[Ogun River]] and three to the river's east.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> Each province was supervised by a governor appointed directly by the Alaafin of Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride297\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;297.</ref>\n\n*'''Yorubaland'''\nThe second layer of the empire was composed of the towns closest to Oyo-Ile, which were recognized as brothers.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>   This area was south of metropolitan Oyo, and its Yoruba inhabitants spoke different dialects from that of Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> These tributary states were led by their own rulers, titled Obas,<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> who were confirmed by the Alaafin of Oyo.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/>\n\n*'''Egbado Corridor'''\nThe empire's third layer was the Egbado Corridor southwest of Yorubaland. This area was inhabited by the [[Egba people|Egba]] and [[Egbado]], and guaranteed Oyo's trade with the coast. The Egba and [[Egbado]] tributaries were allowed, like their Yoruba counterparts, to rule themselves. They were, however, supervised by Ajele.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>  These were agents appointed by the Alaafin of Oyo to oversee his interest and monitor commerce. The lead representative of Oyo in the corridor was the Olu, ruler of the town of Ilaro.<ref name=\"Smith122\"/>\n\n*'''Ajaland'''\nAjaland was the last layer added to the empire.  It was the most restive and distant, and kept in line with threats of expeditions against it.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>  This territory extended from the non-Yoruba areas west of the Egbado Corridor far into Ewe controlled territory in modern [[Togo]].<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> This area, like all tributary states, was allowed a fair degree of autonomy as long as taxes were paid, the orders from Oyo were strictly followed, and access to local markets was provided to Oyo merchants.<ref name=\"Stride293\"/> The Oyo often demanded tribute in slaves. The tributary chiefs sometimes made war on other peoples to capture slaves for this purpose.<ref name=\"Alpern34\">Alpern 1998, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> Oyo was known to punish disobedience by wholesale slaughter of the erring community, as it accomplished in [[Allada]] in 1698.<ref name=\"Stride293\"/>\n\n===Political structure===\nThe Oyo Empire developed a highly sophisticated political structure to govern its territorial domains. Scholars have not determined how much of this structure existed prior to the Nupe invasion.After reemerging from exile in the early 17th century, Oyo took on a noticeably more militant character. The influence of an aggressive Yoruba culture is exemplified in the standards placed on the oba (king) and the roles of his council.\n\n===The Alaafin of Oyo===\nThe oba (meaning 'king' in the Yoruba language) at Oyo, who was referred to as the [[Alaafin]] of Oyo (Alaafin means 'owner of the palace' in Yoruba), was the head of the empire and supreme overlord of the people.<ref name=\"Stride298\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;298.</ref> He was responsible for keeping tributaries safe from attack, settling internal quarrels between sub-rulers, and mediating between those sub-rulers and their people.<ref name=\"Stride298\"/>  The Alaafin of Oyo was also expected to give his subordinates honours and presents.<ref name=\"Stride298\"/>  In return, all sub-rulers had to pay homage to the Oba and renew their allegiance at annual ceremonies.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> The most important of these was the Bere festival, marking the acclamation of successful rule by the Alaafin.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> After the Bere festival, peace in Yorubaland was supposed to last for three years.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> The king could not be disposed of but could be compelled to commit suicide if he was no longer wanted. This was done by sending Bashorun (The prime minister) to present either an empty [[calabash]] or a dish of [[parrot]]'s eggs to him and pass a sentence of rejection, known as ''Awon Eniyan Koo'' (i.e. the people reject you, the world rejects you and the gods reject you also). According to tradition, the Alaafin was expected to commit [[ritual suicide]] thereafter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/africa/2004/database/fasanya.html|title=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/africa/2004/database/fasanya.html|last=Fasanya|first=Akin|date=2004|website=The University of Texas at Austin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914094301/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/africa/2004/database/fasanya.html|archive-date=2017-09-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=====Selection of the Alaafin=====\nThe Oyo Empire was not a purely hereditary monarchy, nor was it an absolute one.<ref name=\"Stride298\"/> The Oyo Mesi selected the Alaafin.  He was not always closely related to his predecessor, although he did have to be descended from [[Oranmiyan]], a son of [[Oduduwa]], and to hail from the Ona Isokun ward (which is one of the three royal wards).<ref name=\"Stride298\"/>  At the beginning of the Oyo Empire, the Alaafin's eldest son usually succeeded his father upon the throne. This sometimes led the [[crown prince]], known as the Aremo, to hasten the death of his father. Inorder to prevent this occurrence, it became traditional for the crown prince to be made to commit ritual suicide upon his father's death. Independent of the succession, the Aremo was quite powerful in his own right. For instance, by custom the Alaafin abstained from leaving the palace, except during the important festivals, which in practice curtailed his power. By contrast, the Aremo often left the palace. This led the noted historian [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|S. Johnson]] to observe: \"The father is the king of the palace, and the son the king for the general public\".<ref>Church Missionary Society, G.31 A.2/1888-9, Letter of S. Johnson to the Rev. J.B. Wood, 8 November 1887, as cited by Law R., ''The Oyo Empire c. 1600-c. 1836'', p. 71 (1977)</ref> The two councils which checked the Alaafin had a tendency to select a weak Alaafin after the reign of a strong one to keep the office from becoming too powerful.<ref name=\"Stride300\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;300.</ref>\n\n=====The Ilari=====\nThe Alaafin of Oyo appointed certain religious and government officials, who were usually [[eunuchs]].<ref name=\"Stride_299\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;299.</ref> These officials were known as the ''ilari'' or half-heads, because of the custom of shaving half of their heads and applying what was believed to be a magical substance into them.<ref name=\"Smith12\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;12.</ref> The hundreds of Ilari were divided evenly between the sexes.<ref name=\"Smith12\"/>  Junior members of the Ilari did menial tasks, while seniors acted as guards or sometimes messengers to the other world via sacrifice.<ref name=\"Smith12\"/>  Their titles related to the king, such as ''oba l'olu'' (\"the king is supreme\") or ''madarikan'' (\"do not oppose him\").<ref name=\"Smith12\"/>  They carried red and green fans as credentials of their status.<ref name=\"Smith12\"/>\n\nAll sub-courts of Oyo had Ilari who acted as both spies and taxmen.<ref name=\"Stride297\"/> Oyo appointed these to visit and sometimes reside in Dahomey and the Egbado Corridor to collect taxes and spy on Dahomey's military successes, so that the Alaafin of Oyo could get his cut.<ref name=\"Smith10\">Smith 1989, p. 10.</ref><ref name=\"Smith10\"/>\n\n====The Councils====\nWhile the Alaafin of Oyo was supreme overlord of the people, he was not without checks on his power. The [[Oyo Mesi]] and the Yoruba Earth cult known as [[Ogboni]] kept the [[Oba (king)|Oba]]'s power in check.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/>  The Oyo Mesi spoke for the politicians while the Ogboni spoke for the people and were backed by the power of religion.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/>  The power of the Alaafin of Oyo in relation to the Oyo Mesi and Ogboni depended on his personal character and political shrewdness.\n\n=====Oyo Mesi=====\n{{more footnotes|date=April 2012}}\nThe Oyo Mesi were seven principal councillors of the state. They constituted the Electoral Council and possessed legislative powers. Led by the Bashorun, acting as prime minister, and consisting of the Agbaakin, the Samu, the Alapini, the Laguna, the Akiniku and the Ashipa, they represented the voice of the nation and had the chief responsibility of protecting the interests of the empire. The Alaafin was required to take counsel from them whenever any important matter affecting the state occurred.<ref name=\"WAfrica\">Afolayan, Funso. (2000) \"Kingdoms of West Africa\", ''Africa Vol. 1'' ed. by Tony Falola, p. 173.</ref> Each chief had a state duty to perform at court every morning and afternoon.  Each also had a deputy whom they would send to the Alaafin if their absence was unavoidable. The Oyo Mesi developed as a check on the Alaafin's power, preventing the Alaafin from being an [[autocracy|autocrat]]; they compelled many Alaafins to commit suicide during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name=\"WAfrica\" />\n\nThe head of the council of Oyo Mesi, the Bashorun, consulted the [[Ifa]] oracle prior to the royal succession for approval from the gods. New alaafins of Oyo were therefore seen as being appointed by the gods. They were regarded as ''Ekeji Orisa,'' meaning \"deputy of the gods.\" The Bashorun had final say on the nomination of the new Alaafin, his power rivaling that of the king himself. For example, the Bashorun orchestrated many religious festivals; he did this in addition to being commander-in-chief of the army, which gave him considerable independent religious authority.\n\nChief among the responsibilities of the Bashorun was the all important festival of Orun. This religious divination, held every year, was to determine if the members of the Mesi still held favour with the Alaafin. If the council decided on the disapproval of the Alaafin, the Bashorun presented the Alaafin with an empty calabash, or parrot's eggs, as a sign that he must commit suicide. This was the only way to remove the Alaafin because he could not legally be deposed. Once given the calabash or the parrot's eggs, the Alaafin, his eldest son the Aremo, and his personal counselor within the Oyo Mesi, the Asamu,<ref name=\"WAfrica\" /> all had to commit suicide in order to renew the government. The suicide ceremony took place during the Orun festival.\n\n=====The Ogboni=====\nThe Oyo Mesi did not enjoy an absolute power either. While the Oyo Mesi wielded political influence, the Ogboni represented the popular opinion backed by the authority of religion, and therefore the views of the Oyo Mesi could be moderated by the Ogboni. There were checks and balances on the power of the Alafin and the Oyo Mesi and thus no one was arrogated absolute power. The Ogboni was a very powerful secret society composed of aristocratic freemen noted for their age, wisdom and importance in religious and political affairs.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/> Its members enjoyed immense power over the common people due to their religious station. A testament to how widespread the institution was is the fact that there were (and still are) Ogboni councils at nearly all sub-courts within Yorubaland.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/>  Aside from their duties in respect to the worship of the earth, they were responsible for judging any case dealing with the spilling of blood.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/> The leader of the Ogboni, the Oluwo, had the unqualified right of direct access to the Alaafin of Oyo on any matter.<ref name=\"Stride_299\"/>\n\n===Military===\nThere was a high degree of professionalism in the army of the Oyo Empire.<ref name=\"Stride301\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;301.</ref> Its military success was due in large part to its cavalry as well as the leadership and courage of Oyo officers and warriors.<ref name=\"Stride301\"/> Because its main geographic focus was north of the forest, Oyo enjoyed easier farming and thus a steady growth in population.<ref name=\"Stride301\"/> This contributed to Oyo's ability to consistently field a large force. There was also an entrenched military culture in Oyo where victory was obligatory and defeat carried the duty of committing suicide.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/> This do-or-die policy no doubt contributed to the military aggressiveness of Oyo's generals.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/>\n\n====Cavalry====\nThe Oyo Empire was the only Yoruba state to adopt [[cavalry]]; it did so because most of its territory was in the northern [[savannah]].<ref name=\"Smith48\"/>  The origin of the cavalry is disputed; however, the [[Nupe people|Nupe]], [[Borgu]] and [[Hausa people|Hausa]] in neighbouring territories also used cavalry and may have had the same historical source.<ref name=\"Law\">Law 1975, pp.&nbsp;1\u201315.</ref> Oyo was able to purchase horses from the north and maintain them in metropolitan Oyo because of partial freedom from the [[tsetse fly]].<ref name=\"Stride302\">Stride & Ifeka 1971, p.&nbsp;302.</ref> Cavalry was the long arm of the Oyo Empire. Late 16th and 17th century expeditions were composed entirely of cavalry.<ref name=\"Smith48\"/>  There were drawbacks to this. Oyo could not maintain its cavalry army in the south but could raid at will.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/><ref>''[[Why Nations Fail]]: The origins of power, prosperity and poverty.'' p. 254.  Acemoglu, Daron; Robinson, James A. 2012. {{ISBN|9780307719218}}</ref>\n\nCavalry in highly developed societies such as Oyo was divided into light and heavy.<ref name=\"Smith48\"/> Heavy cavalry on larger imported horses was armed with heavy thrusting [[lance]]s or spears and also with [[sword]]s.<ref name=\"Smith48\"/> Light cavalry on smaller indigenous ponies was armed with throwing spears or bows.<ref name=\"Smith50\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;50.</ref>\n\n====Infantry====\nInfantry in the region around the Oyo Empire was uniform in both armour and armament. All infantry in the region carried shields, swords and lances of one type or another.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/> Shields were four feet tall and two feet wide and made of elephant or ox hide.<ref name=\"Thornton80\">Thornton 1999, p.&nbsp;80.</ref> A {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} heavy sword was the main armament for close combat.<ref name=\"Thornton80\"/> The Yoruba and their neighbours used triple barbed javelins which could be thrown accurately from about 30 paces.<ref name=\"Thornton79\"/>\n\n====Structure====\nThe Oyo Empire, like many empires before it, used both local and tributary forces to expand its domains. The structure of the Oyo military prior to its imperial period was simple and closer aligned to the central government in metropolitan Oyo. This may have been adequate in the 15th century when Oyo controlled only its heartland, but to make and maintain conquest farther away, the structure underwent several changes.\n\n=====The Eso=====\nOyo maintained a semi-standing army of specialist cavalry soldiers called the ''Eso'', the ''Esho'' or, formally, the [[Eso Ikoyi|Eso of Ikoyi]].<ref name=\"Smith56\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;56.</ref> These were 70 junior war chiefs who were nominated by the Oyo Mesi and confirmed by the Alaafin of Oyo.<ref name=\"Smith56\"/> The Eso were appointed for their military skill without regard to heritage, although de facto dynasties of Eso were also known to exist. The Eso were led by the Are-Ona-Kakanfo,<ref name=\"Stride300\"/> and were famous for living by a [[Emi Omo Eso|warrior code]] that was comparable to the Latin dictum [[Infra dig|infra dignitatem]].\n======Are Ona Kakanfo======\t\nAfter Oyo's return from exile, the post of Are-Ona-Kakanfo was established as the supreme military commander.<ref name=\"Smith53\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;53.</ref> He was required to live in a frontier province of great importance to keep an eye on the enemy and to keep him from usurping the throne.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/> During Oyo's imperial period, the Are-Ona-Kakanfo personally commanded the army in the field on all campaigns.<ref name=\"Stride300\"/>\n\n=====Metropolitan Army=====\nSince the Are-Ona-Kakanfo could not reside near the capital, arrangements had to be made for the latter's protection in case of emergency. Forces inside metropolitan Oyo were commanded by the Bashorun, leading member of the Oyo Mesi.<ref name=\"Smith53\"/> As stated earlier, Metropolitan Oyo was divided into six provinces divided evenly by a river. Provincial forces were thus grouped into two armies, under the ''Onikoyi'' and the ''Okere'' for the east and west side of the river respectively.<ref name=\"Smith53\"/> Lesser war chiefs were known as Balogun, a title carried on by the soldiers of Oyo's successor state, [[Ibadan]].<ref name=\"Smith57\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;57.</ref>\n\n=====Tributary Army=====\nTributary leaders and provincial governors were responsible for collecting tribute and contributing troops under local generalship to the imperial army in times of emergency.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> Occasionally, tributary leaders would be ordered to attack neighbors even without the backing of the main imperial army.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/> These forces were often utilized in Oyo's distant campaigns on the coast or against other states.\n\n===Commerce===\nOyo became the southern emporium of the Trans-Saharan trade. Exchanges were made in salt, leather, horses, kola nuts, ivory, cloth and slaves.<ref name=\"Stride302\"/> The Yoruba of metropolitan Oyo were also highly skilled in craft making and iron work.<ref name=\"Stride302\"/> Aside from taxes on trade products coming in and out of the empire, Oyo also became wealthy off the taxes imposed on its tributaries. Taxes on the kingdom of Dahomey alone brought in an amount estimated at 638 thousand U.S. dollars a year.<ref name=\"Stride301\"/>\n\n==Zenith==\n[[File:Oyoxviii.jpeg|right|thumb|220px|Oyo Empire and surrounding states c. 1700.]]\nBy 1680, the Oyo Empire spanned over 150,000 square kilometers.<ref name=\"Thornton104\">Thornton 1998, p.&nbsp;104.</ref> It reached the height of its power in the 18th century.<ref name=\"Stride293\"/> Despite its violent creation, it was held together by mutual self-interest.<ref name=\"Stride298\"/> The government was able to provide unity for a vast area through a combination of local autonomy and imperial authority.<ref name=\"Stride301\"/>\n\nUnlike the great savannah empires, of which Oyo may not be called a successor since it was a successor of Ife, there was little if any Islamic influence in the empire.<ref name=\"Oliver95\"/>  It is known that at least some Muslim officials were kept in Metropolitan Oyo,<ref name=\"Smith20\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;20.</ref> and men capable of writing and calculating in [[Arabic]] were reported by French traders in 1787.<ref name=\"Smith20\"/>\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:Araldiz Manno 259.svg|thumb|[[Solomon's knot]], a quasi-[[heraldic]] symbol of Yoruba royalty]]\nMany believe the decline of the Oyo empire had started as early as 1754 with the dynastic intrigues and palace coups sponsored by the Oyo [[Prime Minister]] [[Gaha]]. Gaha, in his quest for absolute power, conspired with the Oyo Mesi and probably to some extent the Ogboni to force four successive Alaafins to commit ritual suicide after they had been presented with the symbolic parrot's eggs. Between June and October 1754 alone, two Alaafins had been forced to commit suicide by Gaha.<ref>(PRO:T.70/1523).\"Extract of letter of W. Devaynes, Governor of the English fort at Whydah, 22\nOct. 1754, quoted in letter of T. Melvil, Cape Coast Castle, 30 Nov. 1754\". Public Records Office, London</ref> Because of this, Alaafin Awonbioju spent 130 days on the throne, while Alaafin Labisi only spent 17 days on the throne. Gaha's treachery was not ended until 1774 during the reign of Alaafin Abiodun, the fifth Alaafin he served. Gaha was subsequently executed by Abiodun but the instability that had been brought about by these intrigues had further weakened Oyo.\n\nAlaafin Abiodun during his reign had also conducted failed campaigns against Borgu in 1783<ref>(PRO: T.70/1545). \"Letter of Lionel Abson, Governor of the English fort at Whydah, 26 Sept. 1783\" Public Records Office, London</ref> and Nupe in 1789,<ref>Dalzel, Archibald. \"The History of Dahomy, An Inland Kingdom of Africa\" London,1793,p.229</ref> losing the equivalent of 11 and 13 generals and their men respectively. Abiodun was subsequently murdered by his own son Awole, who subsequently ascended his father's throne.\n\nThe events that led to the secession of Ilorin began in 1793. Ilorin was a war camp headed by the Are-Ona Kakanfo Afonja. Afonja took cause with Awole when the latter commanded him to attack Alaafin Abiodun's maternal home, Iwere-Ile. Afonja, being bound by an oath and also desirous not to fall under a curse from a previous Alaafin made to the effect that any Aare Ona Kakanfo who attacked Iwere-Ile (his paternal home) was to die miserably, refused to comply. A further cause was given in 1795, when Awole ordered Afonja to attack the market town of Apomu, a part of Ile-Ife. All Alaafins, due to the Yoruba belief that Ife was the spiritual home of the Yorubas, were previously made to swear an oath never to attack Ife.<ref name=Akinjogbin>{{Cite book\n|title =War and Peace in Yorubaland 1793-1893\n|first =  Adeagbo \n|last =  Akinjogbin\n|year = 1998\n|isbn = 9781294973\n}}</ref>  Afonja carried out Awole's order and sacked Apomu, but on the return of the army from the campaign he marched on the capital Oyo-Ile (which was itself a taboo), and demanded that Awole abdicate.<ref name=Bowdich>{{Cite book\n|title =Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee (1819)\n|first =  Edward\n|last =  Bowdich\n|year = 1966\n|isbn = 0714617946\n}}</ref> Awole eventually committed ritual suicide.<ref name=\"Akinjogbin\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Awole,  there was a scramble for the throne by numerous contenders; some were reported to have spent less than six months on the throne; there was also a period of interregnum of almost twenty years where the various factions could not agree on a candidate.<ref name=\"Akinjogbin\"/> This power vacuum led to the ascendancy of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and Solagberu, the Otun Are-Ona Kakanfo. Shehu Alimi, a [[Fulani]] chief who was the leader of the growing Muslim population in Oyo, also rose to power at this time. These new elements had lost regard for the office of the Alaafin due to the various political wranglings and the lack of a central authority at the time; this situation eventually led to Afonja seceding Ilorin from Oyo in 1817 with the help of Oyo Muslims. In 1823, after Afonja had been killed by his erstwhile allies Shehu Alimi and Solagberu (who was himself later killed by Alimi's son), Ilorin became part of the Sokoto Caliphate.<ref name=Clapperton>{{Cite book\n|title =Journal of a second expedition into the interior of Africa: from the bight of Benin to Soccatoo\n|first =  Hugh \n|last =  Clapperton\n|year = 1829\n|isbn = \n}}</ref> By the time Captain Hugh Clapperton visited Oyo-Ile in 1825 during the reign of Alaafin Majotu, the empire was already in a state of decline. Clapperton's party recorded passing numerous Oyo villages burned by the Fulani of Ilorin while Majotu had also sought the help of the English king and the Oba of Benin in putting down the Ilorin rebellion. Clapperton also noticed a shortage of horses, even though the Oyo were renowned as a great cavalry force; this might have something to do with the fact that most of the empire's soldiers and hence cavalry were stationed at Ilorin under the command of Afonja (and later Alimi's successors).<ref name=\"Clapperton\"/>\n\nIlorin then besieged Offa and started raiding, burning and pillaging villages in Oyo, eventually destroying the capital Oyo-Ile in 1835.<ref name=\"Akinjogbin\"/>\n\n===Loss of the Egbado Corridor===\nAs Oyo tore itself apart via political intrigue, its vassals began taking advantage of the situation to press for independence. The Egba, under the leadership of a war chief called Lishabi, massacred the Ilari stationed in their area and drove off an Oyo punitive force.<ref name=\"Stride296\"/>\n\n===The Dahomey Revolt===\nIn 1823 Dahomey was reported to have raided  villages that were under the protection of Oyo for slaves due to the high demand for them. Oyo immediately demanded a huge tribute from King [[Gezo]] for the unauthorized incursion, to which Gezo dispatched his Brazilian viceroy, Chacha [[Francisco F\u00e9lix de Sousa]], to the Alaafin at Oyo to make peace. The peace talks eventually broke down, and Oyo subsequently attacked Dahomey.<ref>.\"Royal Gold Coast Gazette and Commercial Intelligencer\" Cape coast, 1822-3</ref> The Oyo army was decisively defeated, ending Oyo's hegemony over Dahomey.<ref name=\"Alpern166\">Alpern 1998, p.&nbsp;166.</ref> After gaining its independence, Dahomey began raiding the corridor.<ref name=\"Smith122\"/>\n\n===Ago d'Oyo===\nAfter the destruction of Oyo-Ile, the capital was moved further south, to Ago d'Oyo. Oba Atiba sought to preserve what remained of Oyo by placing on Ibadan the duty of protecting the capital from the Ilorin in the north and northeast.<ref name=\"Smith123\">Smith 1989, p.&nbsp;123.</ref> He also attempted to get the Ijaye to protect Oyo from the west against the Dahomeans.<ref name=\"Smith123\"/>  The center of Yoruba power moved further south to [[Ibadan]], a Yoruba war camp settled by Oyo commanders in 1830.<ref name=\"Smith48\"/>\n\n===Final demise===\n[[File:Aladin Oyo (when Arsmo).png|thumb|right|Alaafin Oyo c. 1910]]\n\nMain article: [[List of rulers of the Yoruba state of Oyo]]\n\nAtiba's gambit failed, and Oyo never regained its prominence in the region. The Oba, otherwise called Atiba Atobatele, died in 1859; His son Adeyemi I, the third Alaafin to rule in the present Oyo, died in 1905. During the colonial period, the Yorubas were one of the most urbanized groups in Africa. About 22% of the population lived in large areas with populations exceeding 100,000, and over 50% lived in cities made up of 25,000 or more people. The index of urbanization in 1950 was close to that of the United States, excluding Ilorin. The Yoruba continue to be the most urbanized African ethnic group today. Prominent contemporary cities include [[Ibadan]], [[Osogbo]], and [[Ogbomoso]], which are some of the major cities that flourished after old Oyo's collapse.<ref name=\"Bascom\">Bascom 1962, pp.&nbsp;699-709.</ref>\n\nA remnant of the monarchy continues to exist as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of contemporary Nigeria.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Oyotunji|Oyotunji African Village]]\n*[[Rulers of the Yoruba state of Oyo]]\n*[[History of Nigeria]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Afolayan\n  | first = Funso\n  | title = Kingdoms of West Africa: Benin, Oyo and Asante\n  | series = Africa\n  | volume = 2\n  | editor-last = Falola\n  | editor-first = Toyin\n  | publisher = Carolina Academic Press\n  | date = 2000\n  | page = 173\n  | isbn = 0-89089-768-9}}\n\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Alpern\n  | first = Stanley B.\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Amazons of Black Sparta: The Women Warriors of Dahomey\n  | publisher = New York University Press\n  | year = 1998\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | isbn = 0-8147-0678-9\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/amazonsofblacksp0000alpe\n  }}\n\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Bowdich\n  | first = Thomas Edward\n  | authorlink = Thomas Edward Bowdich\n  | title = Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee, with a statistical account of that kingdom, and geographical notices of other parts of the interior of Africa\n  | publisher =  J.
