Finkel debuted as a ring announcer at [[Madison Square Garden]] on January 17, 1977. By 1979, he had become the organization's lead ring announcer for their biggest events. Finkel became the first employee of the WWE on April 1, 1980 and had been the longest lasting employee until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.wwe.com/superstars/howardfinkel|accessdate=2019-01-27|title=Howard Finkel|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> Throughout his career, Finkel's distinctive voice was sometimes used in the [[title sequence]] for the company's various television programs. Finkel's signature call was his announcement of a new champion following a title change, in which he would place extra emphasis on the word \"new\", in order to draw the greatest reaction from the crowd.<ref name=\"WWE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/howardfinkel/|title=Howard Finkel's Hall of Fame Profile|accessdate=2011-03-29|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> Finkel came up with the event name \"[[WrestleMania]]\", as well as [[Ricky Steamboat]]'s \"Dragon\" nickname. In 1984, Finkel became WWF's lead ring announcer for television tapings, replacing the retired Joe McHugh. During a 2011 interview, Finkel said he had also played a part in the talent relations and creative departments during the early days of the WWF.<ref name=\"radio.thescore.com\">{{cite web |url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/howard-finkel-raw-03282011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729100940/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/howard-finkel-raw-03282011 |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 1987, Finkel was presented a plaque by [[Gene Okerlund]], commemorating ten years of announcing at Madison Square Garden.<ref name=\"award\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/howardfinkel/videos/classicvideos/|title=Howard Finkel presented with plaque |accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=[[WWE]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328105719/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/howardfinkel/videos/classicvideos/|archivedate=March 28, 2009}}</ref> In 1993, at the \"Roman\"-themed [[WrestleMania IX]], Finkel was introduced in a [[toga]] as '''Finkus Maximus'''.\n\nIn 1995, Finkel took a seven-month hiatus from ring announcing on pay-per-views and television broadcasts (but not at house shows) and was replaced by Manny Garcia. Finkel returned to full-time ring announcing at [[Royal Rumble 1996]].\n\n===Storylines===\nAs an announcer, Finkel was generally separate from the scripted [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]], but occasionally he became part of the company's storylines. In November 1990, Finkel played a tangential role in [[Curt Hennig]] defeating [[Kerry Von Erich]] to win the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]] after he accepted a bribe from [[Ted DiBiase]] (whom Von Erich had recently attacked on ''The [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] Show'') to let him take over as guest ring announcer for the match. DiBiase would eventually help Hennig to win the title by hitting Von Erich with the championship belt and afterwards taunted Von Erich over his defeat.\n\n1992 saw the beginning of a feud with manager [[Bruno Lauer|Dr. Harvey Wippleman]], who would regularly complain about Finkel's announcing. In 1992, Finkel was attacked by Wippleman's wrestler [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]]. At [[WrestleMania X]], Wippleman berated Finkel and tore off part of the announcer's tuxedo, who finally retaliated by pushing the manager to the ground. This led to Finkel's first match on January 9, 1995; on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', he won a [[Professional wrestling match types|tuxedo match]] over Wippleman, by stripping him to his underwear.\n\nFinkel became involved in a feud between [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] and [[Jeff Jarrett]], when Jarrett [[head shaving|shaved]] the already near-bald Finkel's head. This feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair versus Hair Match]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam 1998]], with Finkel in the corner of X-Pac. X-Pac won the match and Finkel assisted him in cutting Jarrett's hair.\n\nIn August 1999, Finkel became a lackey of the recently debuted [[Chris Jericho]]. On August 26, during the pilot episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown]],'' Jericho encouraged Finkel to attack SmackDown announcer [[Tony Chimel]] and take back his place as lead announcer. Finkel ran down the aisle, shoving Chimel and ordering him to step aside. As Finkel started to announce, Chimel threw Finkel from the ring. While Jericho helped Finkel to the back, they crossed paths with [[Ken Shamrock]], who jostled with Jericho. Jericho convinced Finkel to distract Shamrock during his match. After Finkel berated Shamrock, Shamrock began twisting Finkel's finger, permitting Jericho to hit Shamrock from behind with a steel chair. Several weeks later, Finkel adopted the role of '''El Dopo''', a masked referee who unfairly officiated a Shamrock match, awarding the win to [[Curtis Hughes]].<ref name=\"Obsessed with wrestling\">{{cite web|first=|last=|url=http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/h/howard-finkel.php|title=Howard's Obsessed with wrestling profile and El Dopo|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Obsessedwithwrestling.com}}</ref> On the October 14 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Jericho defeated Hughes with help from Finkel, but [[slavery|gave]] Finkel to Curtis Hughes after the match.<ref name=\"Resutls smackdown 1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/_1999/ |title=Smackdown Results:1999 |accessdate=2009-04-07 |date=April 7, 2009 |publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012210933/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/_1999/ |archivedate=October 12, 2008 }}</ref> Four days later on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', Hughes bet and lost Finkel in a game of poker, to [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]].<ref name=\"Results RAW 1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |title=Raw:1999 |accessdate=2009-04-07 |date=April 7, 2009 |publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173232/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn an August 2002 episode of ''Raw'', Finkel turned heel and began a brief feud with ''Raw'' ring announcer [[Lilian Garcia]] over the lead spot, before both were attacked by [[3-Minute Warning]].<ref name=\"lillian 1\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020805.html|title=Howard Finkel wants his job back|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref> The following week, Garcia defeated Finkel in an evening gown/tuxedo match with help from [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Stacy Keibler]], who were insulted by a remark made by Finkel.<ref name=\"lillian 2\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020826.html|title=Howard Finkel vs Lillian|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132020===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2018}}\nBy 2000, Howard Finkel had taken a lighter schedule with the additions of [[Lilian Garcia]] and [[Tony Chimel]] to Raw and SmackDown, respectively, but he still announced for some of the WWF/E's pay-per-view events.\n\nBy 2006, Finkel was rarely heard from even at pay-per-view wrestling events. However, he regularly announced at house shows and would introduce the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] inductees at WrestleMania. Finkel himself was inducted on April 4, 2009 by \"Mean\" [[Gene Okerlund]]. Because Finkel was one of that year's inductees, SmackDown announcer [[Justin Roberts]] replaced him in introducing the group at [[WrestleMania XXV]]. Finkel's television appearances were sporadic, at major pay-per-views and occasional episodes of Raw and SmackDown. Finkel appeared at every [[WrestleMania]] from 1985 to 2016.\n\n[[File:Howard Finkel 2009.jpg|right|thumb|Finkel in the [[Wrestling ring|ring]] in 2009]]\nFinkel did the voiceover in the intro for the WWE.com video show, ''[[John Morrison and The Miz|The Dirt Sheet]]'', and also conducted interviews for various WWE.com programs. He was WWE's chief [[statistician]]. On September 7, 2009, he announced in special guest host [[Bob Barker]]'s ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]''-inspired segments. He was in the background of the ''[[WWE SmackDown#Special episodes|Decade of SmackDown]]'' celebrations on the October 2 episode.\n\nFinkel returned to ring announcing (for one night only) on the November 15, 2010 [[WWE Raw#Special episodes|\"Old School\" episode]] of Raw. He appeared on an episode of [[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]], in an \"Outthink the Fink\" challenge. In a March 28, 2011 interview, Finkel stated his favorite (and career-defining) accomplishment was announcing at [[WrestleMania III]], in front of over 93,000 fans.<ref name=\"radio.thescore.com\"/>\n\nOn November 20, 2011, at [[Survivor Series (2011)|Survivor Series]] in Madison Square Garden, Finkel was the special ring announcer for [[CM Punk]], in his [[WWE Championship]] match against [[Alberto Del Rio]].\n\nOn April 10, 2012, Finkel appeared on the \"Blast from the Past\" episode of SmackDown.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, Finkel was a special ring announcer on the 1,000th episode of Raw.\n\nIn 2014, Finkel was a cast member on the [[WWE Network]] original reality show, [[WWE Legends' House|Legends' House]]. He also served as the off-screen announcer for the network's comedy series, [[The Edge and Christian Show That Totally Reeks of Awesomeness|The Edge and Christian Show]].\n\nHis role in announcing the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] inductees at WrestleMania passed to other ring announcers in the WWE beginning in 2017.\n\nOn January 22, 2018, at the 25th anniversary of Monday Night Raw, Finkel was the announcer to introduce [[The Undertaker]], although it was a recording due to him being unable to attend the event.<ref>{{cite

Blassie.jpg|thumb|right|Finkel (center) built his reputation announcing matches at Madison Square Garden]]\nFinkel, a native of [[Newark, New Jersey]], was the WWE's first employee after having been first hired in 1975 by Vince McMahon Sr. for what was then known as the WWWF. Finkel debuted as a ring announcer at [[Madison Square Garden]] on January 17, 1977. By 1979, he had become the organization's lead ring announcer for their biggest events. Finkel became the first employee of the WWE on April 1, 1980 and had been the longest lasting employee until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.wwe.com/superstars/howardfinkel|accessdate=2019-01-27|title=Howard Finkel|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> Throughout his career, Finkel's distinctive voice was sometimes used in the [[title sequence]] for the company's various television programs. Finkel's signature call was his announcement of a new champion following a title change, in which he would place extra emphasis on the word \"new\", in order to draw the greatest reaction from the crowd.<ref name=\"WWE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/howardfinkel/|title=Howard Finkel's Hall of Fame Profile|accessdate=2011-03-29|publisher=[[WWE]]}}</ref> Finkel came up with the event name \"[[WrestleMania]]\", as well as [[Ricky Steamboat]]'s \"Dragon\" nickname. In 1984, Finkel became WWF's lead ring announcer for television tapings, replacing the retired Joe McHugh. During a 2011 interview, Finkel said he had also played a part in the talent relations and creative departments during the early days of the WWF.<ref name=\"radio.thescore.com\">{{cite web |url=http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/howard-finkel-raw-03282011 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729100940/http://radio.thescore.com/episodes/howard-finkel-raw-03282011 |archivedate=2012-07-29 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 1987, Finkel was presented a plaque by [[Gene Okerlund]], commemorating ten years of announcing at Madison Square Garden.<ref name=\"award\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/howardfinkel/videos/classicvideos/|title=Howard Finkel presented with plaque |accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=[[WWE]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328105719/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/howardfinkel/videos/classicvideos/|archivedate=March 28, 2009}}</ref> In 1993, at the \"Roman\"-themed [[WrestleMania IX]], Finkel was introduced in a [[toga]] as '''Finkus Maximus'''.\n\nIn 1995, Finkel took a seven-month hiatus from ring announcing on pay-per-views and television broadcasts (but not at house shows) and was replaced by Manny Garcia. Finkel returned to full-time ring announcing at [[Royal Rumble 1996]].\n\n===Storylines===\nAs an announcer, Finkel was generally separate from the scripted [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]], but occasionally he became part of the company's storylines. In November 1990, Finkel played a tangential role in [[Curt Hennig]] defeating [[Kerry Von Erich]] to win the [[WWF Intercontinental Championship]] after he accepted a bribe from [[Ted DiBiase]] (whom Von Erich had recently attacked on ''The [[Bruce Prichard|Brother Love]] Show'') to let him take over as guest ring announcer for the match. DiBiase would eventually help Hennig to win the title by hitting Von Erich with the championship belt and afterwards taunted Von Erich over his defeat.\n\n1992 saw the beginning of a feud with manager [[Bruno Lauer|Dr. Harvey Wippleman]], who would regularly complain about Finkel's announcing. In 1992, Finkel was attacked by Wippleman's wrestler [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]]. At [[WrestleMania X]], Wippleman berated Finkel and tore off part of the announcer's tuxedo, who finally retaliated by pushing the manager to the ground. This led to Finkel's first match on January 9, 1995; on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', he won a [[Professional wrestling match types|tuxedo match]] over Wippleman, by stripping him to his underwear.\n\nFinkel became involved in a feud between [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] and [[Jeff Jarrett]], when Jarrett [[head shaving|shaved]] the already near-bald Finkel's head. This feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair versus Hair Match]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam 1998]], with Finkel in the corner of X-Pac. X-Pac won the match and Finkel assisted him in cutting Jarrett's hair.\n\nIn August 1999, Finkel became a lackey of the recently debuted [[Chris Jericho]]. On August 26, during the pilot episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|WWF SmackDown]],'' Jericho encouraged Finkel to attack SmackDown announcer [[Tony Chimel]] and take back his place as lead announcer. Finkel ran down the aisle, shoving Chimel and ordering him to step aside. As Finkel started to announce, Chimel threw Finkel from the ring. While Jericho helped Finkel to the back, they crossed paths with [[Ken Shamrock]], who jostled with Jericho. Jericho convinced Finkel to distract Shamrock during his match. After Finkel berated Shamrock, Shamrock began twisting Finkel's finger, permitting Jericho to hit Shamrock from behind with a steel chair. Several weeks later, Finkel adopted the role of '''El Dopo''', a masked referee who unfairly officiated a Shamrock match, awarding the win to [[Curtis Hughes]].<ref name=\"Obsessed with wrestling\">{{cite web|first=|last=|url=http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/profiles/h/howard-finkel.php|title=Howard's Obsessed with wrestling profile and El Dopo|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Obsessedwithwrestling.com}}</ref> On the October 14 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Jericho defeated Hughes with help from Finkel, but [[slavery|gave]] Finkel to Curtis Hughes after the match.<ref name=\"Resutls smackdown 1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/_1999/ |title=Smackdown Results:1999 |accessdate=2009-04-07 |date=April 7, 2009 |publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012210933/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/smackdown/_1999/ |archivedate=October 12, 2008 }}</ref> Four days later on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', Hughes bet and lost Finkel in a game of poker, to [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]].<ref name=\"Results RAW 1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |title=Raw:1999 |accessdate=2009-04-07 |date=April 7, 2009 |publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173232/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |archivedate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn an August 2002 episode of ''Raw'', Finkel turned heel and began a brief feud with ''Raw'' ring announcer [[Lilian Garcia]] over the lead spot, before both were attacked by [[3-Minute Warning]].<ref name=\"lillian 1\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020805.html|title=Howard Finkel wants his job back|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref> The following week, Garcia defeated Finkel in an evening gown/tuxedo match with help from [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Stacy Keibler]], who were insulted by a remark made by Finkel.<ref name=\"lillian 2\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/020826.html|title=Howard Finkel vs Lillian|accessdate=2009-04-07|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=Onlineworldofwrestling.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132020===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2018}}\nBy 2000, Howard Finkel had taken a lighter schedule with the additions of [[Lilian Garcia]] and [[Tony Chimel]] to Raw and SmackDown, respectively, but he still announced for some of the WWF/E's pay-per-view events.\n\nBy 2006, Finkel was rarely heard from even at pay-per-view wrestling events. However, he regularly announced at house shows and would introduce the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] inductees at WrestleMania. Finkel himself was inducted on April 4, 2009 by \"Mean\" [[Gene Okerlund]]. Because Finkel was one of that year's inductees, SmackDown announcer [[Justin Roberts]] replaced him in introducing the group at [[WrestleMania XXV]].

He appeared on an episode of [[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]], in an \"Outthink the Fink\" challenge. In a March 28, 2011 interview, Finkel stated his favorite (and career-defining) accomplishment was announcing at [[WrestleMania III]], in front of over 93,000 fans.<ref name=\"radio.thescore.com\"/>\n\nOn November 20, 2011, at [[Survivor Series (2011)|Survivor Series]] in Madison Square Garden, Finkel was the special ring announcer for [[CM Punk]], in his [[WWE Championship]] match against [[Alberto Del Rio]].\n\nOn April 10, 2012, Finkel appeared on the \"Blast from the Past\" episode of SmackDown.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, Finkel was a special ring announcer on the 1,000th episode of Raw.\n\nIn 2014, Finkel was a cast member on the [[WWE Network]] original reality show, [[WWE Legends' House|Legends' House]].

It was produced by [[Dinesh Vijan]] and [[Bhushan Kumar]] under their respective banners [[Maddock Films]] and [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]]. The film features [[Irrfan Khan]] and [[Saba Qamar]] in the lead roles, with [[Deepak Dobriyal]] and Dishita Sehgal in supporting roles. Set in Delhi, the plot centres on a couple's struggle to get their daughter admitted to a prestigious [[English-medium education|English-medium]] school in order to rise in society.\n\nThe idea for the film was created by Chaudhary and his co-writer Zeenat Lakhani during the development of his previous film ''[[Shaadi Ke Side Effects]]'' (2014). The film was shot in [[Chandni Chowk]], [[Anand Lok, Jaipur|Anand Lok]], [[Karol Bagh]], and Sangam Vihar. The film's [[soundtrack album]] was composed by the duo [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], with lyrics by [[Priya Saraiya]] and [[Kumaar]]. The [[Film score|score]] was composed by [[Amar Mohile]].

The film grossed {{INRConvert|322.4|c}} at the worldwide box office, becoming one of the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]] of all time. At the [[63rd Filmfare Awards]], it won [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]], and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Khan. Due to the success of the film, a sequel ''[[Angrezi Medium]]'' went into development, and was released theatrically on 13 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nRaj Batra ([[Irrfan Khan]]) is a boutique owner who lives in Delhi with his wife Mita ([[Saba Qamar]]). They have a 5-year-old daughter, Pia (Dishita Sehgal). The couple want Pia to be admitted to a prestigious English-medium school in Delhi as they feel that this will enable her to become a part of the elite of society. Raj and Mita are introduced to a consultant called Shikha ([[Tillotama Shome]]), who helps them to prepare for the interview required for admission to various top schools. However, Raj and Mita fail to deliver their tutored answers in the interview, and their application gets rejected due to their limited knowledge of English. \n\nThe Batra family moves to Vasant Vihar in order to apply for Delhi Grammar School, a top school, that has a condition that all applicants have to live within three kilometres of the school. Raj and Mita learn from an employee that his daughter has been admitted through the [[Right to education]] (RTE) quota, a scheme that helps children from poor families to be admitted to prestigious schools. Raj and Mita decide to apply for Pia's admission through that scheme. They move to a poorer area of the city, and pretend to be impoverished. They form a friendship with Shyam ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) and Tulsi (Swati Das), who also apply for their son Mohan (Angshuman Nandi) to study in Delhi Grammar School through the RTE quota.\n\nPia eventually gets admission, but Mohan's application is rejected. The Batra family return to Vasant Vihar. Raj and Mita make a donation to the Bharat Nagar Government School, where Mohan studies, to renovate it and get new books. After watching their son become fluent in English, Shyam, and Tulsi search for the identity of the anonymous donor to thank them. Shyam obtains the address of the donor and visits Raj's house in Vasant Vihar, and finds out the truth about Raj pretending to be poor to enable Pia's admission. Shyam leaves to tell Delhi Grammar School's principal ([[Amrita Singh]]) of Raj's deceit.\n\nBefore he can meet the principal, Raj and Mita go to meet her. Raj asks for Pia's admission to be revoked and tells the truth. The principal rejects doing so. He gives a speech about education rights in the school's auditorium, and leaves the school. Later, both Raj and Mita send Pia to the government-run Hindi-medium school where Mohan studies.\n\n==Cast==\nCredits adapted from [[Bollywood Hungama]]:<ref name=\"Hindi Medium Cast & Crew\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/hindi-medium/cast/|title=Hindi Medium Cast & Crew|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=15 July 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715091657/https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/hindi-medium/cast/?movieid=3526|archivedate=15 July 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Irrfan Khan]] as Raj Batra\n** Delzad Hiwale as young Raj\n* [[Saba Qamar]] as Mita Batra\n** Sanjana Sanghi as young Mita\n* Kiran Khoje as Sushila\n* Dishita Sehgal as Pia Batra\n* [[Amrita Singh]] as Principal Lodha\n* [[Deepak Dobriyal]] as Shyam Prakash\n* [[Neelu Kohli]] as Mita's mother\n* Rajeev Gupta as Masterji, Raj's father\n* [[Sumit Gulati]] as Chotu\n* [[Mallika Dua]] as Dolly\n* Kulbir Kaur as Dolly's mother\n* Charu Shankar as Maya\n* [[Tillotama Shome]] as consultant\n* [[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as MLA\n* [[Taran Bajaj]] as tout\n* [[Ankur Jain]] as news reader\n* Swati Das as Tulsi\n* [[Neha Dhupia]] as Aarti (special appearance)\n* [[Sanjay Suri]] as Kabir (special appearance)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nMade on a production budget of {{\u20b9|14}} crore, ''Hindi Medium'' was produced by Vijan of Maddock Films and Bhushan Kumar of T-Series.

It was produced by [[Dinesh Vijan]] and [[Bhushan Kumar]] under their respective banners [[Maddock Films]] and [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]]. The film features [[Irrfan Khan]] and [[Saba Qamar]] in the lead roles, with [[Deepak Dobriyal]] and Dishita Sehgal in supporting roles. Set in Delhi, the plot centres on a couple's struggle to get their daughter admitted to a prestigious [[English-medium education|English-medium]] school in order to rise in society.\n\nThe idea for the film was created by Chaudhary and his co-writer Zeenat Lakhani during the development of his previous film ''[[Shaadi Ke Side Effects]]'' (2014). The film was shot in [[Chandni Chowk]], [[Anand Lok, Jaipur|Anand Lok]], [[Karol Bagh]], and Sangam Vihar.

The film grossed {{INRConvert|322.4|c}} at the worldwide box office, becoming one of the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]] of all time. At the [[63rd Filmfare Awards]], it won [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]], and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Khan. Due to the success of the film, a sequel ''[[Angrezi Medium]]'' went into development, and was released theatrically on 13 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nRaj Batra ([[Irrfan Khan]]) is a boutique owner who lives in Delhi with his wife Mita ([[Saba Qamar]]). They have a 5-year-old daughter, Pia (Dishita Sehgal). The couple want Pia to be admitted to a prestigious English-medium school in Delhi as they feel that this will enable her to become a part of the elite of society. Raj and Mita are introduced to a consultant called Shikha ([[Tillotama Shome]]), who helps them to prepare for the interview required for admission to various top schools. However, Raj and Mita fail to deliver their tutored answers in the interview, and their application gets rejected due to their limited knowledge of English. \n\nThe Batra family moves to Vasant Vihar in order to apply for Delhi Grammar School, a top school, that has a condition that all applicants have to live within three kilometres of the school. Raj and Mita learn from an employee that his daughter has been admitted through the [[Right to education]] (RTE) quota, a scheme that helps children from poor families to be admitted to prestigious schools. Raj and Mita decide to apply for Pia's admission through that scheme. They move to a poorer area of the city, and pretend to be impoverished. They form a friendship with Shyam ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) and Tulsi (Swati Das), who also apply for their son Mohan (Angshuman Nandi) to study in Delhi Grammar School through the RTE quota.\n\nPia eventually gets admission, but Mohan's application is rejected. The Batra family return to Vasant Vihar. Raj and Mita make a donation to the Bharat Nagar Government School, where Mohan studies, to renovate it and get new books. After watching their son become fluent in English, Shyam, and Tulsi search for the identity of the anonymous donor to thank them. Shyam obtains the address of the donor and visits Raj's house in Vasant Vihar, and finds out the truth about Raj pretending to be poor to enable Pia's admission. Shyam leaves to tell Delhi Grammar School's principal ([[Amrita Singh]]) of Raj's deceit.\n\nBefore he can meet the principal, Raj and Mita go to meet her. Raj asks for Pia's admission to be revoked and tells the truth. The principal rejects doing so. He gives a speech about education rights in the school's auditorium, and leaves the school. Later, both Raj and Mita send Pia to the government-run Hindi-medium school where Mohan studies.\n\n==Cast==\nCredits adapted from [[Bollywood Hungama]]:<ref name=\"Hindi Medium Cast & Crew\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/hindi-medium/cast/|title=Hindi Medium Cast & Crew|publisher=Bollywood Hungama|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=15 July 2019|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715091657/https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movie/hindi-medium/cast/?movieid=3526|archivedate=15 July 2019|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Irrfan Khan]] as Raj Batra\n** Delzad Hiwale as young Raj\n* [[Saba Qamar]] as Mita Batra\n** Sanjana Sanghi as young Mita\n* Kiran Khoje as Sushila\n* Dishita Sehgal as Pia Batra\n* [[Amrita Singh]] as Principal Lodha\n* [[Deepak Dobriyal]] as Shyam Prakash\n* [[Neelu Kohli]] as Mita's mother\n* Rajeev Gupta as Masterji, Raj's father\n* [[Sumit Gulati]] as Chotu\n* [[Mallika Dua]] as Dolly\n* Kulbir Kaur as Dolly's mother\n* Charu Shankar as Maya\n* [[Tillotama Shome]] as consultant\n* [[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]] as MLA\n* [[Taran Bajaj]] as tout\n* [[Ankur Jain]] as news reader\n* Swati Das as Tulsi\n* [[Neha Dhupia]] as Aarti (special appearance)\n* [[Sanjay Suri]] as Kabir (special appearance)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nMade on a production budget of {{\u20b9|14}} crore, ''Hindi Medium'' was produced by Vijan of Maddock Films and Bhushan Kumar of T-Series.

Ringer, believing that their refuge in the hotel will not last, goes out searching for a cave system mentioned on a brochure. Teacup, whom she had grown close to, sneaks up on Ringer who shoots her, having mistaken Teacup for a Silencer. A helicopter flies in and they are both captured by The Others. While Cassie and the others anxiously await Ringer, they realize that Teacup has gone missing, and Dumbo and Poundcake set out to find her but return empty-handed.\n\nEvan Walker is revealed to have survived Camp Haven's destruction and is wounded and hurt. He is rescued by Grace, a fellow Silencer, and head to her makeshift home. They spot Cassie at the hotel from interstate on their way there. After one of Grace's hunts, she tries to seduce Evan, but he attacks her. While escaping her house, Grace shoots at him but lets him go, knowing that he will lead her to Cassie. While he rests, Grace finds and confronts him. They are attacked by child soldiers from Camp Haven and Grace is shot at, giving Evan the opportunity to escape.\n\nEvan finds the hotel they stay at, and disarms Ben in a misunderstanding, though Ben stabs his leg. Evan finds Sammy and, seeing the gun in his hands, dives at him. Cassie shoots him once and he is rendered unconscious. Ben angrily waits for him to awaken. Cassie defends him while Ben throws constant insults toward him. In the midst of this, they hear a helicopter approach; however, it quickly flies off. Then, they see a small girl walking down the hallway, whom Sammy identifies as \"Megan\". Megan says that her throat hurts before passing out.\n\nThe group cares for her, though when Evan awakes, he warns them not to, explaining that The Others planted a bomb in her throat rigged to detonate on high concentrations of carbon dioxide. The group moves outside, a distance from the hotel, while Cassie and Evan stay behind to remove the bomb from her throat. With a struggle, Cassie manages to safely remove the bomb and she contains it in a plastic baggie. Ben and Poundcake have been collecting CO2 canisters so that the bomb can be detonated at a safe distance away.\n\nGrace appears as Cassie and Evan finish the operation. She forcefully kisses Evan in front of Cassie. The squad arrives and chaos ensues: Poundcake is shot, and the helicopter flies in during struggle, and Grace appears to destroy the helicopter and kill the pilot. While this is happening, Evan tells Cassie of a pod sent down from the mothership to extract Grace that will be her temporary home. He shows her how to find it and shows her the bomb they removed from Megan's throat. Sammy takes the bomb as he rushes by on his way out. Evan makes Cassie promise \"to end it\" and insists that he be left behind. As she knows she has no other choice, Cassie kisses him and leaves.\n\nA short distance from the hotel Sammy turns and starts running back, Cassie catches him and he says that he dropped the baggie, the hotel explodes, Cassie thinks Evan sacrificed himself. Unable to carry him, the group leaves a mortally wounded Poundcake and continues to move away from the hotel. Poundcake crawls back to the hotel, finds the lost explosive device, and blows it up to an arm's length away from Grace.\n\nRinger is taken to another \"training\" camp, much like Camp Haven, with Colonel Vosch having taken over command of the camp. Ringer semi-befriends a recruit named Razor, who knows of the conspiracy and that the officials at camp are actually The Others. Ringer asks Vosch about the whereabouts of Teacup and Vosch tells her that she is alive. Vosch, Razor, and a woman named Claire enhance her with the 12th system (neural chip and nanobots), a piece of Other technology designed to strengthen human anatomy.\n\nRinger and Razor conspire to escape. The plan is carried out successfully, Ringer kills Claire and disables Jumbo, knocks out Teacup, and forces a pilot to fly them in a helicopter. Before it crashes, the pilot, Razor, and Teacup bailout. Ringer jumps without a parachute and lands in an ice-covered lake. After meeting at the crash site, Ringer soon discovers that Razor was secretly working with Vosch. She had sensed something through the 12th system when she kissed him prior to the jump from the helicopter. She knocks him out and heads to the warehouse, which had been converted to a hospital at the time of the 3rd Wave. She finds Vosch in it, who openly invites her to a fight. Vosch wins easily and reveals that Silencers are not actually \"Others\". They are just humans enhanced by the 12th system neural chip that contains a constructing program to make them believe they are \"Others\", never controlled or linked to the \"Others\". It is unclear if Vosch is human. Razor is charged with guarding and helping to heal her; eventually, they reconcile.\n\nWhen they return to base, Vosch questions Ringer about what the \"solution\" is. She states that the \"Others\" don't mean to exterminate all humans. Vosch states that the \"Others\" could have simply eliminated all humans by dropping a big rock on them and hints there is a specific goal to be gained through the wave attacks. Vosch tells Ringer he has enhanced her to hunt down and kill Walker, and that he needs someone like her because the destroyed drones were meant to track the enhanced humans, not normal humans.

The novel is the second in ''[[The 5th Wave (series)|The 5th Wave]]'' trilogy, preceded by ''[[The 5th Wave (novel)|The 5th Wave]]'' and followed by ''[[The Last Star (novel)|The Last Star]]''.

Ringer, believing that their refuge in the hotel will not last, goes out searching for a cave system mentioned on a brochure. Teacup, whom she had grown close to, sneaks up on Ringer who shoots her, having mistaken Teacup for a Silencer. A helicopter flies in and they are both captured by The Others. While Cassie and the others anxiously await Ringer, they realize that Teacup has gone missing, and Dumbo and Poundcake set out to find her but return empty-handed.\n\nEvan Walker is revealed to have survived Camp Haven's destruction and is wounded and hurt. He is rescued by Grace, a fellow Silencer, and head to her makeshift home. They spot Cassie at the hotel from interstate on their way there. After one of Grace's hunts, she tries to seduce Evan, but he attacks her. While escaping her house, Grace shoots at him but lets him go, knowing that he will lead her to Cassie. While he rests, Grace finds and confronts him. They are attacked by child soldiers from Camp Haven and Grace is shot at, giving Evan the opportunity to escape.\n\nEvan finds the hotel they stay at, and disarms Ben in a misunderstanding, though Ben stabs his leg. Evan finds Sammy and, seeing the gun in his hands, dives at him. Cassie shoots him once and he is rendered unconscious. Ben angrily waits for him to awaken. Cassie defends him while Ben throws constant insults toward him. In the midst of this, they hear a helicopter approach; however, it quickly flies off. Then, they see a small girl walking down the hallway, whom Sammy identifies as \"Megan\". Megan says that her throat hurts before passing out.\n\nThe group cares for her, though when Evan awakes, he warns them not to, explaining that The Others planted a bomb in her throat rigged to detonate on high concentrations of carbon dioxide. The group moves outside, a distance from the hotel, while Cassie and Evan stay behind to remove the bomb from her throat. With a struggle, Cassie manages to safely remove the bomb and she contains it in a plastic baggie. Ben and Poundcake have been collecting CO2 canisters so that the bomb can be detonated at a safe distance away.\n\nGrace appears as Cassie and Evan finish the operation. She forcefully kisses Evan in front of Cassie. The squad arrives and chaos ensues: Poundcake is shot, and the helicopter flies in during struggle, and Grace appears to destroy the helicopter and kill the pilot. While this is happening, Evan tells Cassie of a pod sent down from the mothership to extract Grace that will be her temporary home. He shows her how to find it and shows her the bomb they removed from Megan's throat. Sammy takes the bomb as he rushes by on his way out. Evan makes Cassie promise \"to end it\" and insists that he be left behind. As she knows she has no other choice, Cassie kisses him and leaves.\n\nA short distance from the hotel Sammy turns and starts running back, Cassie catches him and he says that he dropped the baggie, the hotel explodes, Cassie thinks Evan sacrificed himself. Unable to carry him, the group leaves a mortally wounded Poundcake and continues to move away from the hotel. Poundcake crawls back to the hotel, finds the lost explosive device, and blows it up to an arm's length away from Grace.\n\nRinger is taken to another \"training\" camp, much like Camp Haven, with Colonel Vosch having taken over command of the camp. Ringer semi-befriends a recruit named Razor, who knows of the conspiracy and that the officials at camp are actually The Others. Ringer asks Vosch about the whereabouts of Teacup and Vosch tells her that she is alive. Vosch, Razor, and a woman named Claire enhance her with the 12th system (neural chip and nanobots), a piece of Other technology designed to strengthen human anatomy.\n\nRinger and Razor conspire to escape. The plan is carried out successfully, Ringer kills Claire and disables Jumbo, knocks out Teacup, and forces a pilot to fly them in a helicopter. Before it crashes, the pilot, Razor, and Teacup bailout. Ringer jumps without a parachute and lands in an ice-covered lake. After meeting at the crash site, Ringer soon discovers that Razor was secretly working with Vosch. She had sensed something through the 12th system when she kissed him prior to the jump from the helicopter. She knocks him out and heads to the warehouse, which had been converted to a hospital at the time of the 3rd Wave. She finds Vosch in it, who openly invites her to a fight. Vosch wins easily and reveals that Silencers are not actually \"Others\". They are just humans enhanced by the 12th system neural chip that contains a constructing program to make them believe they are \"Others\", never controlled or linked to the \"Others\". It is unclear if Vosch is human. Razor is charged with guarding and helping to heal her; eventually, they reconcile.\n\nWhen they return to base, Vosch questions Ringer about what the \"solution\" is. She states that the \"Others\" don't mean to exterminate all humans. Vosch states that the \"Others\" could have simply eliminated all humans by dropping a big rock on them and hints there is a specific goal to be gained through the wave attacks. Vosch tells Ringer he has enhanced her to hunt down and kill Walker, and that he needs someone like her because the destroyed drones were meant to track the enhanced humans, not normal humans. Razor whispers to Ringer about the leverage Vosch has on her because of Teacup and proceeds to shoot and kill Teacup. In return, Razor is shot and dies. The chaos gives Ringer a chance to escape by diving out a window.\n\nIn the end, Cassie and squad 53 are recovering from the explosion. From the woods, Evan emerges and Cassie goes to meet him.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Infinite Sea}}\n[[Category:2014 science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:2014 American novels]]\n[[Category:Alien invasions in novels]]\n[[Category:American science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:American young adult novels]]\n[[Category:Children's science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:The 5th Wave]]\n", "name_user": "PaoH02", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Sea"}

It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content. [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] has been replaced with Haptic Touch.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera similar to the iPhone 8 and to the wide camera of iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processors of the SE add support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps and stereo recording. The SE also adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Official website: specifications\" />\n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Smart HDR, Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting.<ref name=\"Official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly due to being based on the [[iPhone XR]] single-camera system.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|iPhone SE (2020)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the 2nd generation iPhone SE|its predecessor|iPhone SE (1st generation)|the general use of the term ''iPhone SE''|iPhone SE (disambiguation)}}\n<noinclude>{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=iPhone SE (2020)|2=Talk:IPhone SE (2nd generation)#Requested move 16 April 2020 }}\n{{Under construction}}\n</noinclude>\n{{pp-move|small=yes}}\n{{short description|thirteenth-generation smartphone designed and sold by Apple Inc}}\n{{lowercase title}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox mobile phone\n| name         = iPhone SE\n| codename     = \n| logo         = IPhone SE (2nd generation) wordmark.svg\n| logosize     = <!-- include \"px\" - Uses users default image size if omitted -->\n| image        = IPhone SE (2nd generation) white vector.svg\n| imagesize    = \n| alt          = \n| caption      = iPhone SE in white, with black bezels\n| brand        = [[Apple Inc.]]\n| manufacturer = \n| slogan       = ''Lots to love.

[[Force Touch|3D Touch]] has been replaced with Haptic Touch.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera similar to the iPhone 8 and to the wide camera of iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processors of the SE add support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps and stereo recording. The SE also adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Smart HDR, Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting.<ref name=\"Official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly due to being based on the [[iPhone XR]] single-camera system.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|iPhone SE (2020)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "name_user": "Ghostofakina", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCamera", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(2nd_generation)"}

In a piece in which the original material or melody is referred to as the \"A\" section, the bridge may be the third eight-[[bar (music)|bar]] [[phrase (music)|phrase]] in a [[thirty-two-bar form]] (the B in AABA), or may be used more loosely in [[verse-chorus form]], or, in a [[compound AABA form]], used as a contrast to a full AABA section.\n\nThe term comes from a German word for bridge, ''Steg'', used by the [[Meistersinger]]s of the 15th to the 18th century to describe a [[transition (music)|transitional]] section in medieval [[bar form]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Horst|first=Brunner|title=Bar Form|journal=New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref> The German term became widely known in 1920s Germany through musicologist [[Alfred Lorenz]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Lorenz|first=Alfred|title=Das Geheimnis der Form bei Richard Wagner|year=1924|location=Berlin}}</ref> and his exhaustive studies of [[Richard Wagner]]'s adaptations of bar form in his popular 19th-century neo-medieval operas. The term entered the English lexicon in the 1930s\u2014translated as ''bridge''\u2014via composers fleeing Nazi Germany who, working in Hollywood and on Broadway, used the term to describe similar transitional sections in the American popular music they were writing.\n\nThe bridge is often used to contrast with and prepare for the return of the [[Song structure (popular music)#Verse|verse]] and the [[refrain|chorus]]. \"The b section of the popular song chorus is often called the ''bridge'' or ''release''.\"<ref>Benward & Saker (2003).
