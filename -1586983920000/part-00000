The city is overrun with crime and drug use, in the wake of \"The Great Crash\": an economic catastrophe triggered by the greed of previous generations. The film includes ominous events, including: news reports of riots in Washington D.C. (due to the Armed Forces going on strike); a newspaper headline that proclaims \"GERMANY BUYS POLAND\"; and references to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] hiring the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] to \"clean up\" [[Northern Ireland]]. \n\nA heavily-armed [[white supremacist]] conglomerate known as the Rollerboys fight for control of the decaying city. Their director is charismatic narcotics-kingpin Gary Lee: a childhood neighbor of Griffin's, who's also rumored to be the great-grandson of [[Adolf Hitler]]. The Rollerboys carry out their mission of restoring [[Anglo-America]]'s former greatness, through violent battles with other gangs...and through the distribution of \"Heaven Mist\", a [[designer drug]]. Griffin's younger brother Miltie, who idolizes the Rollerboys, takes a job with them pushing mist on the streets; eventually, Miltie starts using it himself. Then Casey, an undercover cop, recruits Griffin to join the Rollerboys as a mole...in exchange for a better life. \n\nGriffin is initiated but his loyalty to the Rollerboys is soon called into question. In order to prove himself, he unknowingly pummels Speedbagger, his and Miltie's Afro-American landlord, nearly to death. Shortly thereafter, Griffin discovers the chilling truth behind the Rollerboys' mantra \"The Day of the Rope is coming\". Rope turns out to be a toxic mist-additive, developed by the Rollerboys, which gradually renders its users sterile; the purpose of this is to \"eliminate the weak\", removing future generations of the \"junkie\" population, thus giving the Rollerboys free reign over their concepts of a thriving American society.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Corey Haim]] as Griffin\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Casey\n* [[Christopher Collet]] as Gary Lee\n* [[Julius Harris]] as Speedbagger\n* Devin Clark as Miltie\n* [[Mark Pellegrino]] as Bango\n* [[Morgan Weisser]] as Bullwinkle\n* [[J.C.
