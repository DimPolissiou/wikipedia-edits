It stars [[Song Kang-ho]], [[Lee Sun-kyun]], [[Cho Yeo-jeong]], [[Choi Woo-shik]], [[Park So-dam]], [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]], and [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] and follows the members of a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.\n\n''Parasite'' premiered at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival]] on 21 May 2019, where it became the first South Korean film to win the [[Palme d'Or]]. It was then released in South Korea by [[CJ Entertainment]] on 30 May 2019.\n\nThe film received universal critical acclaim, with praise directed towards its screenplay, Bong's direction, acting, social commentary, dark humor, cinematography, editing and production values, and has featured in multiple listings of the best films of the 2010s and is considered one of the [[List of films considered the best|best South Korean films of all time]].

Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo take over his job as an English [[tutor]] for the wealthy Park family, though Ki-woo is initially hesitant. Ki-jung forges a diploma from [[Yonsei University]] for Ki-woo to help him get hired; upon arrival, Mrs Park decides they will call him \"Kevin\".\n\nThe Kim family infiltrates the lives of the Parks by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated and highly qualified workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with the Parks' daughter, Da-hye. Ki-jung poses as \"Jessica\", an [[Art therapy|art therapist]] to the Parks' hyperactive young son, Da-song. Ki-jung frames Mr Park's chauffeur as having had [[sex]] in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach [[allergy]] of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[bakery]] failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but Moon-gwang discovers the truth about the Kim family and gains the upper hand.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. Mrs Park asks Chung-sook to prepare an instant ramen dish with expensive [[hanwoo]] for Da-song. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a [[seizure]]-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] years ago when he saw a \"ghost\" \u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr Park comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to Ki-jung, Mr Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe romanisation of the names of characters are as appeared in the official English subtitles, translated by [[Darcy Paquet]].\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Park<!-- Not Kim, as Korean women don't follow their husbands' names after marriage. --> Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

Bong said \"Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that ''Parasite'' refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor.

The first floor and the garden were constructed on an empty outdoor lot, while the basement and second floor were constructed on set.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/> Bong, as part of the scripting, had also designed the basic layout of this home. \"It's like its own universe inside this film. Each character and each team has spaces that they take over that they can infiltrate, and also secret spaces that they don't know.\"<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" /> A fictional architect Namgoong Hyeonja had been introduced as the home's designer and the previous owner before the Parks, and production designer Lee Ha-jun considered the function and form of the house based on how Namgoong would have designed it.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/>\n\nLee said, \"Since Mr Park's house is built by an architect in the story, it wasn't easy finding the right approach to designing the house...I'm not an architect, and I think there's a difference in how an architect envisions a space and how a production designer does. We prioritize blocking and camera angles while architects build spaces for people to actually live in and thus design around people. So I think the approach is very different.\"<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" /> For example, Ha-jun established that Namgoong would have used the first floor's living room to appreciate the garden, so it was built with a single wide window and only spartan seating options for this function.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/> Some of the interior artwork in the house sets were by South Korea artist Seung-mo Park, including existing artwork of hers and some explicitly created for the film.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/> Further, design of the home and of its interiors were aimed to make the set amenable for filming at the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, favoring wide and deeper rooms rather than height.<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" />\n\nLee said the sun was an important factor when building the outdoor set. \"The sun's direction was a crucial point of consideration while we were searching for outdoor lots,\" explained Lee. \"We had to remember the sun's position during our desired time frame and determine the positions and sizes of the windows accordingly. In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color. He wanted sophisticated indirect lighting and the warmth from [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten light sources]]. Before building the set, the DP and I visited the lot several times to check the sun's movement at each time, and we decided on the set's location together.\"<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\">{{cite web |title=How Bong Joon Ho Designed the House in ''Parasite'' |website=[[IndieWire]] |date=29 October 2019 |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/parasite-house-set-design-bong-joon-ho-1202185829/ |access-date=6 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104232715/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/parasite-house-set-design-bong-joon-ho-1202185829/ |archive-date=4 November 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Set design ===\nThe Kim's semi-basement apartment and its street was also built on set, partially out of necessity for filming the flooding scenes.<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" /> Lee Ha-jun visited and photographed several abandoned villages and towns in South Korea scheduled to be torn down to help inform the set design.

Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo take over his job as an English [[tutor]] for the wealthy Park family, though Ki-woo is initially hesitant. Ki-jung forges a diploma from [[Yonsei University]] for Ki-woo to help him get hired; upon arrival, Mrs Park decides they will call him \"Kevin\".\n\nThe Kim family infiltrates the lives of the Parks by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated and highly qualified workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with the Parks' daughter, Da-hye. Ki-jung poses as \"Jessica\", an [[Art therapy|art therapist]] to the Parks' hyperactive young son, Da-song. Ki-jung frames Mr Park's chauffeur as having had [[sex]] in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach [[allergy]] of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[bakery]] failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but Moon-gwang discovers the truth about the Kim family and gains the upper hand.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. Mrs Park asks Chung-sook to prepare an instant ramen dish with expensive [[hanwoo]] for Da-song. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a [[seizure]]-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] years ago when he saw a \"ghost\" \u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr Park comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to Ki-jung, Mr Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history, and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe romanisation of the names of characters are as appeared in the official English subtitles, translated by [[Darcy Paquet]].\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Park<!-- Not Kim, as Korean women don't follow their husbands' names after marriage. --> Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

Bong said \"Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that ''Parasite'' refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant.

The first floor and the garden were constructed on an empty outdoor lot, while the basement and second floor were constructed on set.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/> Bong, as part of the scripting, had also designed the basic layout of this home. \"It's like its own universe inside this film. Each character and each team has spaces that they take over that they can infiltrate, and also secret spaces that they don't know.\"<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" /> A fictional architect Namgoong Hyeonja had been introduced as the home's designer and the previous owner before the Parks, and production designer Lee Ha-jun considered the function and form of the house based on how Namgoong would have designed it.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/>\n\nLee said, \"Since Mr Park's house is built by an architect in the story, it wasn't easy finding the right approach to designing the house...I'm not an architect, and I think there's a difference in how an architect envisions a space and how a production designer does.

So I think the approach is very different.\"<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" /> For example, Ha-jun established that Namgoong would have used the first floor's living room to appreciate the garden, so it was built with a single wide window and only spartan seating options for this function.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/> Some of the interior artwork in the house sets were by South Korea artist Seung-mo Park, including existing artwork of hers and some explicitly created for the film.<ref name=\"archdigest\"/> Further, design of the home and of its interiors were aimed to make the set amenable for filming at the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, favoring wide and deeper rooms rather than height.<ref name=\"IndieWire 2019\" />\n\nLee said the sun was an important factor when building the outdoor set. \"The sun's direction was a crucial point of consideration while we were searching for outdoor lots,\" explained Lee. \"We had to remember the sun's position during our desired time frame and determine the positions and sizes of the windows accordingly. In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color.

See [[Exotic derivatives]].\n\n==Derivative==\nTypically, [[interest rate swap|real rate swaps]] also come under this bracket, such as [[asset swap]]s of [[inflation-indexed bond]]s (government-issued inflation-indexed bonds, such as the [[Treasury Inflation Protected Securities]], UK inflation-linked [[gilt-edged securities]] (ILGs), French OATeis, Italian BTPeis, German Bundeis and Japanese [[JGBi]]s are prominent examples).  [[Inflation swap]]s are the linear form of these derivatives.  They can take a similar form to fixed versus floating [[interest rate swaps]] (which are the derivative form for fixed rate bonds), but use a [[real rate coupon]] versus [[Public float|floating]], but also pay a [[redemption pickup]] at [[maturity (finance)|maturity]] (i.e., the derivative form of [[inflation-indexed bond]]s).\n\n[[Inflation swap]]s are typically priced on a [[Zero-coupon bond|zero-coupon]] basis (ZC) (like [[ZCIIS]] for example), with payment exchanged at the end of the term. One party pays the [[compounded fixed]] rate and the other the actual [[inflation]] rate for the term. Inflation swaps can also be paid on a [[wikt:year-on-year|year-on-year]] basis (YOY) (like [[YYIIS]] for example) where the year-on-year rate of change of the price index is paid, typically yearly as in the case of most European YOY swaps, but also monthly for many swapped notes in the US market.  Even though the [[coupons]] are paid monthly, the [[inflation rate]] used is still the year-on-year rate.\n\n[[Option (finance)|Options]] on inflation including [[Interest rate cap and floor|interest rate caps]], [[Interest rate cap and floor|interest rate floors]] and [[straddle]]s can also be [[traded]]. These are typically priced against YOY swaps, whilst the [[swaption]] is priced on the [[ZC curve]].\n\n[[Asset swaps]] also exist where the [[coupon payment]] of the linker (inflation bond) as well as the [[redemption pickup]] at [[maturity (finance)|maturity]] is exchanged for [[interest rate]] payments expressed as a [[Risk premium|premium]] or [[discounting|discount]] to [[LIBOR]] for the relevant [[bond coupon]] period, all dates are [[co-terminus]].  The [[redemption pickup]] is the above [[Par value|par]] redemption value in the case of par/par [[asset swaps]], or the redemption above the proceeds [[notional]] in the case of the proceeds [[asset swap]].
