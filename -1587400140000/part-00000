It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] eight-round [[M1 Garand]] starting in 1936. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during [[World War II]], since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a [[sniper rifle]] during World War II, the [[Korean War]], and even in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]]. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, a competitive shooting rifle, and as a military drill rifle.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nDuring the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War|war with Spain]], the [[Mauser#Spanish M93|M1893 Mauser]] used by the Spanish Army gained a deadly reputation, particularly from the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] where 750 Spanish regulars significantly delayed the advance of 15,000 U.S. troops armed with outclassed [[Springfield Model 1892\u201399 | Springfield Model 1892\u201399 Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen]] bolt-action rifles and older single-shot Springfield rifles. The Spanish soldiers inflicted 1,400 U.S. casualties in a matter of minutes. Likewise, earlier in the day, a Spanish force of 540 regulars armed with the same Mauser rifle under Spanish General Vara Del Rey held off General [[Henry Ware Lawton]]'s Second Division of 6,653 American soldiers and an Independent Brigade of 1,800 men for ten hours in the nearby town of [[Battle of El Caney|El Caney]], keeping that division from assisting in the attack on the San Juan Heights.  A U.S. Army board of investigation was commissioned as a direct result of both battles. They recommended replacement of the Krag.\n\nThe 1903 adoption of the M1903 was preceded by nearly 30 years of struggle and politics, using lessons learned from the recently adopted Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen and contemporary German [[Gewehr 98|Mauser G98]] bolt-action rifles. The M1903 not only replaced the various versions of the U.S. Army's Krag, but also the [[M1895 Lee Navy|Lee Model 1895]] and [[M1885 Remington\u2013Lee]] used by the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as all remaining single-shot trap-door [[Springfield Model 1873]]s. While the [[Springfield Model 1892-99|Krag]] had been issued in both a [[long rifle]] and [[carbine]], the Springfield was issued only as a short 24-inch barrel rifle in keeping with current trends in Switzerland and Great Britain to eliminate the need for both long rifles and carbines.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Chisholm|editor1-first=Hugh|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volumes 23\u201324|date=1911|publisher=University Press|page=328|edition=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGk6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PR8}}</ref>\n\nThe two main problems usually cited with the Krag were its slow-to-load magazine and its inability to handle higher chamber pressures for high-velocity rounds. The United States Army attempted to introduce a higher-velocity cartridge in 1899 for the existing Krags, but its single locking lug on the bolt could not withstand the extra chamber pressure. Though a [[stripper clip|stripper-clip]] or charger loading modification to the Krag was designed, it was clear to Army authorities that a new rifle was required. After the U.S. military's experience with the Mauser rifle in the [[Spanish\u2013American War|1898 Spanish\u2013American War]], authorities decided to adopt a stronger Mauser-derived design equipped with a charger- or stripper clip-loaded box magazine.\n\n===Advances in small arms technology===\nIn 1882, the bolt action [[M1885 Remington\u2013Lee|.45 Remington Lee rifle]] design of 1879, with its newly invented detachable box magazine, was purchased in limited numbers by the U.S. Navy. Several hundred 1882 Lee Navy Models (M1882 Remington-Lee) were also subjected to trials by the U.S. Army during the 1880s, though the rifle was not formally adopted. The Navy adopted the Model 1885, and later different style Lee Model 1895 (a 6mm straight pull bolt), which saw service in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In Army service, both the 1885 and 1895 6mm Lee were used in the Spanish\u2013American War, along with the .30 Krag and the .45-70 Model 1873 Springfield. The Lee rifle's detachable box magazine was invented by [[James Paris Lee]], and would be very influential on later rifle designs. Other advancements had made it clear that the Army needed a replacement. In 1892, the U.S. military held a series of rifle trials, resulting in the adoption of the .30  [[Springfield Model 1892-99|Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen]] rifle. The Krag officially entered U.S. service in 1894, only to be replaced nine years later by the Springfield M1903.\n\n===Development===\nThousands of [[Mauser Model 1893|Spanish Mauser Model 93]] rifles, surrendered by Spanish troops in Cuba, were returned to the U.S. and extensively studied at Springfield Armory, where it was decided that the Mauser was the superior design.\n\n====U.S. Rifle Model 1900 .30 prototype====\nA prototype rifle was produced in 1900; it was very similar to Rifle No. 5, the final Mauser M92 prototype in the U.S. Army rifle trials of 1892. This design was rejected, and a new design combining features of the 1898 Krag rifle and the 1893 Spanish Mauser was developed.\n\n====U.S. Rifle Model 1901 .30 prototype====\nSpringfield began work on creating a rifle that could handle higher loads around the turn of the 20th century. The Springfield Model 1901 prototype combined the cock-on-opening bolt, 30\" barrel, magazine cutoff, stock and sights of the [[Springfield Model 1892\u201399|Krag-J\u00f8rgensen]] with the dual locking lugs, external claw extractor, and staggered-column magazine of the 1893 Mauser. Taking a cue from the 1898 Mauser [[Gewehr 98]], a large safety lug was added to the side of the bolt behind the extractor, which would engage the receiver bridge and prevent the bolt moving rearwards. The bolt handle was also bent downwards, to make operation of the bolt faster. The Springfield Model 1901 almost entered production. Springfield was sure enough that the Springfield Model 1901 prototype would be accepted that they began making some parts, but it was not accepted and further changes were asked for.\n\n===Adoption===\nFollowing then-current trends in service rifles, the barrel was shortened to 24\" after it was discovered that a longer barrel offered no appreciable ballistic advantage, and the shorter barrel was lighter and easier to handle. This \"short rifle\" also eliminated the need of a shorter carbine for mounted troops or cavalry.<ref name=y03s/> A spike-type bayonet with storage in the fore end of the stock was added to the design. This new design was accepted, type classified and officially adopted as the United States Rifle, Caliber .30, Model 1903 and entered production in 1903. The M1903 became commonly known among its users as the \"ought-three\" in reference to the year '03 of first production.\n\nThe War Department had exhaustively studied and dissected several examples of the Spanish Mauser Model 1893 rifle captured during the Spanish\u2013American War, and applied some features of the U.S. Krag rifle to a bolt and magazine system derived from the Mauser Model 93, to produce the new U.S. Springfield Rifle, the Model 1903. Despite Springfield Armory's use of a two-piece firing pin and other slight design alterations, the 1903 was, in fact, a Mauser design, and after that company brought suit, the U.S. government was judged to pay $250,000 in royalties to [[Mauser]] Werke.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sheehan|first1=John|title=Battlefield tack driver: the model 1903 Springfield in WWI|journal=Guns Magazine|date=1 October 2006|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Battlefield+tack+driver%3a+the+model+1903+Springfield+in+WWI.-a0150451303|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy January 1905 over 80,000 of these rifles had been produced at the federally owned [[Springfield Armory]]. However, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] objected to the design of the sliding rod-type bayonet used as being too flimsy for combat.  In a letter to the Secretary of War, he said:\n\n<blockquote>I must say that I think that ramrod bayonet is about as poor an invention as I ever saw.

It was to incorporate improvements discovered during experimentation in the interim, most notably the use of pointed ammunition, first adopted by the French in the 1890s and later other countries. The round itself was based on the .30-03, but rather than a 220-grain (14&nbsp;g) round-tip bullet fired at {{convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, it had a 150-grain (9.7&nbsp;g) pointed bullet fired at {{convert|2800|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; the case neck was a fraction of an inch shorter as well. The new American cartridge was designated \"Cartridge, Ball, Caliber .30, Model of 1906\". The M1906 cartridge is better known as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] round used in many rifles and machine guns, and is still a popular civilian cartridge to the present day. The rifle's sights were again re-tooled to compensate for the speed and trajectory of the new cartridge.\n\nBy the time of the 1916 Pancho Villa Expedition the 1903 Springfield Rifle was the standard issue service rifle of US forces. Some rifles were fitted with both the Warner & Swasey Model 1913 and 1908 \"Musket Sights\" during the campaign. \"Musket Sights\" being the vernacular at the time for telescopic sights. Annecdotal evidence at the time indicates that some of the rifles were fitted with Maxim silencers, which would make them the first U.S. Military Suppressed Rifles. The Warner & Swasey Model 1913 Musket Sight would continue to see service after the Pancho Villa Expedition and during World War I but would be deemed inadequate and was removed from the US Army's inventory by the 1920s. <ref>{{cite magazine |last=Canfield |first=Bruce |date=October 2016 |title= 1916: Guns On The Border |magazine=American Rifleman |publisher=National Rifle Association}}</ref>\n\n===World War I and interwar use===\n[[File:The US Army on the Western Front 1914-1918 Q70181.jpg|thumb|right|US Marines with M1903 rifles and bayonets in France (1918)]]\n[[File:US WWI rifle periscope attachment.jpeg|thumb|An Elder-type [[Periscope rifle|periscope stock]] fitted to an M1903 (1918).

Pre-war production utilized questionable metallurgy. Some receivers constructed of single-heat-treated case-hardened steel were improperly subjected to excessive temperatures during the forging process. The carbon could be \"burnt\" out of the steel producing a brittle receiver.<ref>''Canfield, February 2008, p. 13</ref> Despite documented evidence indicating some early rifles were improperly forged, actual cases of failure were very rare. Although several cases of serious injury from receiver failure were documented, the U.S. Army never reported any fatalities. Many failures were attributed to use of incorrect cartridges, such as the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]].<ref name=l&h>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2004 |title=U.S. M1903A1 Rifles |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=152 |issue=January |pages=20 }}</ref> Evidence also seems to suggest that improperly forged brass cartridge cases could have exacerbated receiver failure.<ref>''Lyon, Joseph: Some Observations On The Failure Of U.S. Model 1903 Rifle Receivers (http://m1903.com/03rcvrfail/)</ref>\n\n[[Pyrometer]]s were installed in December 1917 to accurately measure temperatures during the forging process. The change was made at approximately serial number 800,000 for rifles made at Springfield Armory and at serial number 285,507 at Rock Island Arsenal. Lower serial numbers are known as \"low-number\" M1903 rifles. Higher serial numbers are said to be \"double-heat-treated.\"<ref name=l&h/>\n\nToward the end of the war, Springfield turned out the Model 1903 Mark I. The Mark I has a cut on the left hand side of the receiver meant to act as an ejection port for the [[Pedersen Device]], a modified sear and cutoff to operate the Pedersen Device; a specialized insert that replaced the bolt and allowed the user to fire .30 caliber pistol cartridges semi-automatically from a 40-round detachable magazine. The stock was also slightly cut down on the left side to clear the ejection port. In all other respects, the Mark I is identical to the 1903. Temperature control during forging was improved prior to Mark I production. The receiver alloy was toughened by addition of nickel after Mark I production.\n\nIn 1926, after experiencing the effect of long-range German [[7.92\u00d757mm]] Mauser and machine gun fire during the war, the U.S. Army adopted the heavy 174-grain boat-tail bullet for its .30-06 cartridge, standardized as 'Cartridge, Ball, caliber 30, M1'.<ref name=\"Barnes, Frank C. 1989 p. 59\">Barnes, Frank C., ''Cartridges of the World'', 6th ed., DBI Books Inc. (1989), p. 59</ref> M1 ammunition, intended primarily for long-range machine gun use, soon became known by Army rifle competition teams and expert riflemen for its considerably greater accuracy over that of the M1906-round; the new M1 ammunition was issued to infantrymen with the Springfield rifle as well as to machine gun teams.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dunlap|first1=Roy|title=Rifles|journal=Ordnance Went up Front: Some Observations and Experiences of a Sergeant of Ordnance, Who Served Throughout World War II with the United States Army in Egypt, the Philippines and Japan, Including Way Stations|date=1948|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ordnance_Went_Up_Front.html?id=vp8QAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2015|oclc=777744849}}</ref> However, during the late 1930s, it became apparent that, with the development of mortars, high-angle artillery, and the .50 caliber [[M2 Browning]] machine gun, the need for extreme long-range, rifle-caliber machine-gun fire was decreasing. In 1938, the U.S. army reverted to a .30-06 cartridge with a 152-grain flat-base bullet, now termed [[M2 Ball]], for all rifles and machine guns.<ref name=\"Barnes, Frank C. 1989 p. 59\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s and the 1930s, M1903s were delivered to US allies in [[Central America]], such as [[Cuba]], [[Costa Rica]] or [[Nicaragua]].

The precision rear aperture sight was located too far from the eye for efficient use, and the narrow, unprotected front sight was both difficult to see in poor light and easily damaged. The U.S. Marine Corps issued the Springfield with a sight hood to protect the front sight, along with a thicker front blade. The two-piece firing pin/striker also proved to be no improvement over the original one-piece Mauser design, and was a cause of numerous Ordnance repairs, along with occasional reports of jammed magazine followers.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/>\n[[File:American First World War Official Exchange Collection Q103350.jpg|thumb|right|Camouflaged M1903 Springfield sniper's rifle with Warner & Swasey [[telescopic sight]], in France, May 1918.]]\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] saw new production of the Springfield at private manufacturers such as the [[Remington Arms]] and [[Smith-Corona]] Typewriter companies. Remington began production of the M1903 in September 1941, at serial number 3,000,000, using old tooling from the [[Rock Island Arsenal]] which had been in storage since 1919. The very early rifles are almost indistinguishable from 1919-made Rock Island rifles. As the already worn tooling began to wear beyond use Remington began seeking Army approval for a continuously increasing number of changes and simplifications to both speed up manufacture and improve performance. The milled parts on the Remington M1903 were gradually replaced with stamped parts until, at about serial number 3,330,000, the Army and Remington recognized that a new model name was appropriate. Other features of the M1903, such as high-grade walnut stocks with finger grooves, were replaced with less expensive but serviceable substitutes. Most milled parts made by Remington were marked with an \"R\".<ref name=bnc2>{{cite journal |last=Canfield |first=Bruce N. |year=2015 |title=Wartime Remington M1903s? |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=163 |issue=March |pages=44 }}</ref>\n \nM1903 production was discontinued in favor of the M1903A3. The most noticeable visual difference in the M1903A3 was the replacement of the barrel-mounted rear sight with a smaller, simpler aperture rear sight mounted on the rear of the receiver; it was primarily adopted in order to speed familiarization by soldiers already trained on the M1 Garand, which had a similar sighting system. However, the leaf spring providing tension to the elevation adjustment on the new aperture sight tended to weaken with continued use over time, causing the rifle to lose its preset range elevation setting.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\">Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 302</ref> Other modifications included a new stamped cartridge follower; ironically, the rounded edges of the new design largely alleviated the 'fourth-round jam' complaints of the earlier machined part.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/> All stock furniture was also redesigned in stamped metal.\n\nIn late 1942, Smith-Corona Typewriter Company also began production of the M1903A3 at its plant in Syracuse, NY.<ref name=\"Brophy, William 1985 p. 187\">Brophy, William, ''The Springfield 1903 Rifles'', Stackpole Books (1985), p. 187</ref> Smith/Corona parts are mostly identified by the absence of markings. Except for occasions when time permitting during manufacture, on early to mid production rifles, and also only on certain parts.\n\n{{citation needed span|text=Smith/Corona bolts are sometimes marked with an \"X\" on top of the bolt handle root, which appears as a simple two-line \"X\". The underside of the bolt handle root, will also be marked with a inspectors inspection number, and a punch marking from the hardness testing. This \"X\" markings is often misidentified as the \"H\" marking, that is found on field replacement bolts produced by Hadley Tool co. The \"H\" marking is easily identified by its use of a cursive bubble script. Which appears to be a X at a glance, but is easily distinguishable from the Smith Corona \"X\", when compared to one another. Due to the Smith Corona \"X\" being a simple two-line X, often referred to as the \"crossed twigs\" Front sight bases are also found to be occasionally marked with a \"G\" on the side between the two pin holes used for mounting the base to the barrel, and to affix the sight blade. This \"G\" mark may also be found on the bolt/safety shroud, but hidden on an assembled bolt. This is due to it being stamped on the inner face of the shroud facing the striker/firing pin assembly, as to be hidden on an assembled bolt. The shroud is also identified by a scalloped cut on top, but this does not absolutely identify the shroud as a Smith Corona part. One must remember the machines and plans were obtained by other manufacturers after Smith Corona and ended WW2 production. This was to be done to manufacture replacement parts at the end of and post WW2. As such, these manufacturers used the designs as completed by Smith Corona. As expected shrouds and other parts will look nearly identical to Smith Corona original parts, but bear other markings. Such as, \"BP\" marked shrouds, \"CC\" marked bolt bodies, and other parts manufactured using the Smith Corona designs. The only \"S\" marking, that might be found, is found on the extractor. This marking is located on the down-facing side, when mounted on the bolt, in the same area as the dovetailed mounting point underneath the extractor when mounted. Smith Corona buttplates, are only marked by the design of the stamped checkering, which will be 9 to 10 lines per inch. As opposed to a WW2 Remington or replacement stamped 1903a3 buttplate, which consist of 16 or more lines per inch. The stamped trigger guard, is found both with the \"small early\" and \"large mid to late\" trigger bow. A Smith Corona part, however, is identified by the reinforcement stamping line directly behind the forward most action screws (sometimes referred to as the king screw). The stamped reinforcement line behind the forward screw, is shaped in a U or semicircle surrounding the rear portion of the screw. As opposed to a Remington manufactured parts straight line stamping in the same location. Rear adjustable sights appear to be of near-identical design, except for finish and the lack of identifying marks on the base or the sight itself. The rear sight has been observed being removed from original sealed WW2 packaging, and in time period photos, as to having two external finish types. Photos show very early production rear sights being completely finished in a hot caustic bluing. All other confirmed original rear sights, have been noted to have a grey phosphate finished base, and the sight itself being blued. Smith Corona rifle stocks in as new original non-rearsenaled condition, lacking a Depot or arsenal stamp with only a single circle P proof, have all been noted to have certain original as manufactured markings or proofs. The left side of the stock, on the wrist area, are marked with a boxed-in FJA inspector stamp followed by the crossed cannon arsenal stamp. The order of the stamps are reversed from Remington production stocks, and lack the RA marking (Remington Arms) preceding the other markings. Just forward of the trigger guard on the underside of the stock, are 4 inspection numbers encased in differing shapes. There may be more present, if the stock or rifle has been reworked in the past, but originally there was to be 4 inspection processes marked here. Numbers differing by inspector, the shapes they are enclosed in have been observed to the same on each original example in the same position. Left to right, top to bottom, they are as follows. Top left, number in a triangle, top right, number in a circle, bottom left, number in a square, and unique to Smith Corona stocks, bottom right, number in a diamond. Just behind the bow of the trigger guard is the P proof, that is usually present on US arms of this period and before on the bottom of the stock wrist grip. Unique to the Smith Corona, is the larger size of this proof of 7/16, when compared to a noticeably smaller Remington proof. The inlet cut for the Smith Corona stocks band spring, just forward of the rear stock band, is also of a unique rounded corners design as opposed to Remington's squared corners appearance. |reason=User:Brandon Gvt seems to have forgotten to provide a source for this new information they added|date=August 2019}} \n\nTo speed production output, two-groove rifled barrels were adopted, and steel alloy specifications were relaxed under 'War Emergency Steel' criteria for both rifle actions and barrels.<ref>Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 362</ref> M1903A3 rifles with two-groove 'war emergency' barrels were shipped with a printed notation stating that the reduction in rifling grooves did not affect accuracy.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 301\">Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 301</ref>  As the war progressed, various machining and finishing operations were eliminated on the M1903A3 in order to increase production levels.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 301\"/>\n\nOriginal production rifles at Remington and Smith-Corona had a dark gray/black finish similar to the bluing of late World War I. Beginning in late 1943 a lighter gray/green parkerizing finish was used. This later finish was also used on arsenal repaired weapons.\nIt is somewhat unusual to find a World War I or early World War II M1903 with its original dated barrel. Much, if not all, World War II .30-06 ammunition used a corrosive primer which left corrosive salts in the barrel. If not removed by frequent and proper barrel cleaning these residues could cause pitting and excessive wear. In the jungle fighting on various Pacific islands cleaning was sometimes lax and the excessive moisture compounded the corrosive action of the residue.<ref>{{Citation | last = Bishop | first = Chris| title = The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II | place = New York | publisher = Orbis Publishing Ltd | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-7607-1022-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe M1903 and the M1903A3 rifle were used in combat alongside the M1 Garand by the U.S. military during World War II and saw extensive use and action in the hands of U.S. troops in Europe, North Africa, and the Pacific. The [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were initially armed with M1903 rifles in early battles in the Pacific, such as the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]], but the jungle battle environment generally favored self-loading rifles;<ref>George, John (Lt Col), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 391: \"Nearly every one [Marine] I talked to [on Guadalcanal] who used the Springfield in combat-without a scope-would have much rather been using a Garand.\"</ref> later Army units arriving to the island were armed with the M1 Garand.<ref>George, John (Lt Col), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 391</ref> The [[U.S. Army Rangers]] were also a major user of the M1903 and the M1903A3 during World War II with the Springfield being preferred over the M1 Garand for certain commando missions.\n\nAccording to Bruce Canfield's encyclopedic ''U.S. Infantry Weapons of WW II'', final variants of the M1903 (the A3 and A4) were delivered in February 1944.<ref name=bnc2/> By then, most American combat troops had been re-equipped with the M1 Garand. However, some front-line infantry units in both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps retained M1903s as infantry rifles beyond that date and continued to use them alongside the M1 Garand until the end of the Second World War in 1945. The Springfield remained in service for [[sniper]]s (using the '''M1903A4'''), [[grenadier]]s (using a spigot type rifle [[22 mm grenade|22 mm]] [[grenade launcher]]), and Marine [[Scout Sniper]] units.\n\n==== Sniper rifle====\nThe M1903A4 was the U.S. Army's sniper rifle of choice during the Second World War. The M1903A4 was a variation of the M1903A3. The only difference between receivers was that the model and serial number on the receiver were split on 1903A4 to make room for the Redfield scope mount. The Redfield scope mount removed the rear peep sight that was standard on the M1903A3. The scope used on the M1903A4 was a Weaver Model 330 or 330C, which was a 2.75x telescopic sight. The receivers were tested by Remington Arms and those that were deemed best, meaning those closest to design specifications were selected to become M1903A4's. The barrels were also selected specifically to be added to the M1903A4 rifle only if they were within almost exact specifications for the design. The front sight on the barrel was never installed on the A4 barrels, however, the notch for it was still in place. .<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/>  Barrel specifications were, in general, unchanged between the M1903A3 and M1903A4, however, the War Department did start installing barrels with 2 groove rifling instead of 4 groove, despite the lack of clear changes from the 4 groove rifling that was the standard up until 1942.<ref>George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 392</ref>\n\nBy some accounts, the M1903A4 was inadequate as a sniper rifle. The M1903A4 was a relatively accurate rifle with an effective range of about 600 yards (550m). These limitations on long-range targeting were due to the limited field of view present in both the M73 and M73B1 scopes. From its adoption in 1943 until the end of the war it was used extensively in every theater of operation by both the US Army and the USMC.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 392-393\">George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 392\u2013393</ref> The Weaver scopes (later standardized as the M73 and M73B1) were not only low-powered in magnification, they were not waterproofed, and frequently fogged over or became waterlogged during humidity changes. In addition, the M81/82 optional scopes also had significant flaws. They most notably had less power (2.2x vs. 2.75x) and, like the other scopes on the M1903A4, had serious issues with the field of view.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/><ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 392-393\"/><ref>George, John (Lt.

Various U.S. allies and friendly irregular forces were also equipped with the weapon. The [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] (FEB), operating in the 5th Army in Italy was equipped with Springfield M1903 rifles. In August 1943, the [[Free French Forces]] of General [[Charles de Gaulle]] were re-equipped by the United States primarily with M1903A3 Springfield and [[M1917 Enfield Rifle]]s.

JROTC units use M1903s for regular and inter-school competition drills, including elaborate exhibition spinning routines. Exhibition teams often use fiberglass stocks in place of wooden stocks, which are heavier and more prone to breakage when dropped. JROTC Color Guards still favor wooden stocks over fiberglass because of their weight characteristics and appearance. The M1903 is also the standard parade rifle of the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]], which has over six hundred M1903s, a very small percentage of which are still fireable. The Summerall Guards of The Citadel South Carolina Corps of Cadets in Charleston, S.C. also use the Springfield 1903 model for their silent drill performances, which include annual trips to [[Mardi Gras]], as well as many other notable performances.\n\nContemporary hunters and shooting enthusiasts value the rifle for its beauty, dependability, and adaptability for almost all U.S. game animals.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} With proper gunsmithing, the M1903 makes a reasonably priced sporting rifle, comparing favorably with many modern firearms.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps]] color guard rifles bear many similarities to the Springfield.\n\n\nIn 1977, the Army located a rather large cache of unissued M1903A3 rifles which were demilitarized and then issued to JROTC units as a replacement for their previously issued [[M1 Garand]] and [[M14 rifle|M14]] rifles, which were then returned to Army custody due to concerns about potential break-ins at high school JROTC armories.\n\nFor safety reasons, the JROTC M1903s are made permanently unable to fire by plugging the barrel with a steel rod, or having it filled with lead, soldering the bolt and welding the magazine cutoff switch in the ON position.  To plug the barrel, a very cold steel rod was inserted; after it warmed up it was too tight to remove.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Caliber 30 Springfield Rifle.JPG|thumb|Diagram of the .30 Springfield Rifle]]\nThe U.S. rifle, Model of 1903 was 44\u215e&nbsp;inches (1.098&nbsp;m) long and weighed 8&nbsp;[[Avoirdupois|lb]] 11&nbsp;oz (3.95&nbsp;kg).

From 1906, the rifle was chambered to fire the .30-[[caliber]] M1906 [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] (.30-06 cartridge), later the M1 (1926) and [[M2 Ball]] (1938) rounds. There were four standard types of cartridge:\n\n* '''Ball''': consisted of a brass case or shell, primer, a charge of smokeless powder, and the bullet. The bullet had a sharp point called a [[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullet]], and was composed of a lead core and a jacket of [[cupro-nickel]] (later gilding metal), and in the M1906 design, weighed 150&nbsp;[[Grain (measure)|grains]] (9.7&nbsp;g). The bullet of the M1906 cartridge, when fired from the rifle, had an initial velocity of {{convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Blank''': contained a paper cup instead of a bullet. It is dangerous up to {{convert|33|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Guard''': had a smaller charge of powder than the ball cartridge, and five [[cannelure]]s encircle the body of the shell at about the middle to distinguish it from ball cartridges. It was intended for use on guard or in riot duty, and it gave good results up to {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The range of {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} required a sight elevation of {{convert|450|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and the range of {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} required an elevation of {{convert|645|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Dummy''': this was tin-plated and the shell was provided with six longitudinal corrugations and three circular holes. The primer contains no percussion composition. It was intended for drill purposes to accustom the soldier to the operation of loading the rifle.\n\nThe rifle was sighted for {{convert|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} and had a point-blank range of {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The maximum range of the ball cartridge, when elevated at an angle of 45\u00b0, was {{convert|4890|yd|km mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe rifle was a magazine-fed clip-loader and could fire at a rate of 20 shots per minute. Each [[stripper clip]] contained five cartridges, and standard issue consisted of 12 clips carried in a cloth bandoleer. When full the [[bandoleer]] weighed about {{convert|3|lb|14|oz|kg|abbr=on}}. Bandoleers were packed 20 in a box, for a total of 1,200 rounds. The full box weighed {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe bore of the rifle is 0.30&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;mm) in diameter. It was then rifled 0.004&nbsp;in (0.1&nbsp;mm) deep, making the diameter from the bottom of one groove to the bottom of the opposite groove 0.30787 in (7.82&nbsp;mm) of the barrel.\n\nThe 1903 rifle included a rear sight leaf that could be used to adjust for elevation. When the leaf was flat, the battle sight appeared on top. This sight was set for {{convert|547|yd|abbr=on}}, and was not adjustable. When the leaf was raised it could be adjusted to a maximum extreme range of {{convert|2850|yd|abbr=on}}. The rear sight could also be adjusted for windage.\n\nThe 1903A3 rear sight was an aperture sight adjustable both for elevation and windage.\n\nA feature inherent to the M1903 and not found on the [[Gewehr 98|Mauser 98]] is the cocking piece, a conspicuous knob at the rear of the bolt, allowing the rifle's striker to be released without dry firing, or to cock the rifle if necessary, for example to attempt a second strike on a round that failed to fire.\n\n==Variants==\nThere were four main variants given official nomenclature, though there are a number of important sub-variants:\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903A3]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903 with 'scant' [[Stock (firearm)|stock]]]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A4 with M84 sight.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903A4 with Type C stock and M84 sight]]\n*'''M1903 (1903)''': developed for the [[.30-03]] (also known as the .30-45) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].

Production barrels were measured with star-gauges, and those meeting specified tolerances were stamped with an asterisk shaped star on the muzzle crown. These barrels were fitted to selected receivers with hand-fitted and polished parts. The bolt was left unblued while the receiver and barrel were finished with a black Parkerizing process. Some bolts have the safety direction reversed to prevent it from striking the nose of a right-handed shooter, and those made from 1924 to 1929 have the knurled cocking piece removed to decrease lock time. Early rifles used the type S stock until the type C stock became standard in 1929. Rifles made for sale to NRA members (priced at $40.44) were drilled and tapped for a Lyman 48 receiver sight and had either a type B (or NB) stock with no grasping grooves and a noticeable drop at the heel for a long pistol grip, or a special National Match stock with a high comb and pistol grip. Total production was 28,907. Most were issued to service teams and 25,377 were reconditioned at Springfield armory after one year of match use. Reconditioned rifles have a large gas-escape port drilled into the left side of the receiver.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Norell |first1=James O.E. |year=2003 |title=U.S. M1903A1 Rifles |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=151 |issue=July |pages=38\u201341 }}</ref>\n**'''M1903 Bushmaster carbine (1940s)''': the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] and stock were cut down {{convert|18|in|mm}} for easier use in [[Panama]]; 4,725 such rifles were made. It was a training rifle and saw no action. After World War II most were dumped into the ocean and surviving pieces are rare.\n**'''M1903 with 'scant' stock (1942)''': in late 1941, before the 1903A3 was standardized, Army Ordnance wanted to standardize on a pistol-grip stock for all M1903 rifles. There were thousands of stock blanks that had been sized for the old straight stock. They weren't deep enough for the full pistol grip of the Type C stock, so they were modified to allow a \"scant\" grip that was the largest grip they could form. These \"scant\" stocks would only fit on a 1903, and would not fit an 03A3. Springfield only rebuilt existing M1903 rifles using this stock in 1942 and marked the cut-off seat with a small \"s\".\n[[File:1930 Springfield 1903A1.JPG|thumb|Springfield 1903A1 rifle]]\n*'''M1903A1 (1929\u20131939)''': changed from a straight stock to a pistol grip type stock (Type C stock). The pistol grip stock was conducive to improved marksmanship and was fitted to National Match rifles until World War II. Pistol grip stocks became standard for later M1903 production and were subsequently fitted to older rifles. The Army considered any rifle with a pistol grip stock an M1903A1, but M1903 receiver markings were unchanged.<ref name=bnc>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2007 |title=U.S. M1903A1 Rifles |journal=[[American Rifleman]]|issue=January |pages=38 }}</ref>\n*'''M1903A2 (1930s\u20131940s)''': basically a stripped A1 or A3 used as a subcaliber rifle with artillery pieces.\n*'''M1903A3 (1942\u20131944)''': sights were changed to an aperture (peep) system mounted on the receiver, and the rifle was modified for easier production with stamped metal parts and somewhat different grip and stock (late model Type S stock; no finger grooves).\n**'''M1903 (Modified) (1941\u20131942)''': Transition production of M1903 rifles by Remington Arms until the M1903A3 design was implemented involved modification of various parts creating a hybrid between the M1903 and M1903A3.<ref name=bnc2/>\n*'''M1903A4 (1942)''': an M1903A3 modified to be a sniper rifle using an M73 or M73B1 2.5\u00d7 Weaver [[telescopic sight]] and different stock, and omitting the iron sights. USMC versions instead used the 8x Unertl scope.\n\nThere are two main other types, various training types, and competition versions such as the [[National Match]] types. Aside from these there are some other civilian versions, experimental versions, and other miscellaneous types. Due to the duration of its service, there is also a range of smaller differences among ones from different periods and manufacturers.\n\nIn military use it was outnumbered by the [[M1917 Enfield]] for much of the war. Also, during World War II many remained in use early on, especially in the Pacific (generally replaced as M1s became available), in addition to service (along with other weapons) as a sniper rifle and to launch [[rifle grenade]]s.\n\n*'''Bannerman Springfields''': At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Scottish-born [[military surplus]] magnate, [[Pollepel Island#Francis Bannerman VI|Francis Bannerman VI (1851\u20131918)]], assembled 1,000 M1903 rifles from surplus parts which were rebored to accept [[.303 British|British .303]] ammunition.  These he presented to the [[British Army]] together with the associated bayonets, pouches and webbing, as a patriotic gesture. Unfortunately, the conversion was not a success and it was found that the rimmed .303 cartridge would not feed properly from the magazine.<ref>Ian D.

It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] eight-round [[M1 Garand]] starting in 1936. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during [[World War II]], since the U.S. entered the war without sufficient M1 rifles to arm all troops. It also remained in service as a [[sniper rifle]] during World War II, the [[Korean War]], and even in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]]. It remains popular as a civilian firearm, historical collector's piece, a competitive shooting rifle, and as a military drill rifle.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nDuring the 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War|war with Spain]], the [[Mauser#Spanish M93|M1893 Mauser]] used by the Spanish Army gained a deadly reputation, particularly from the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] where 750 Spanish regulars significantly delayed the advance of 15,000 U.S. troops armed with outclassed [[Springfield Model 1892\u201399 | Springfield Model 1892\u201399 Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen]] bolt-action rifles and older single-shot Springfield rifles. The Spanish soldiers inflicted 1,400 U.S. casualties in a matter of minutes. Likewise, earlier in the day, a Spanish force of 540 regulars armed with the same Mauser rifle under Spanish General Vara Del Rey held off General [[Henry Ware Lawton]]'s Second Division of 6,653 American soldiers and an Independent Brigade of 1,800 men for ten hours in the nearby town of [[Battle of El Caney|El Caney]], keeping that division from assisting in the attack on the San Juan Heights.  A U.S. Army board of investigation was commissioned as a direct result of both battles. They recommended replacement of the Krag.\n\nThe 1903 adoption of the M1903 was preceded by nearly 30 years of struggle and politics, using lessons learned from the recently adopted Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen and contemporary German [[Gewehr 98|Mauser G98]] bolt-action rifles. The M1903 not only replaced the various versions of the U.S. Army's Krag, but also the [[M1895 Lee Navy|Lee Model 1895]] and [[M1885 Remington\u2013Lee]] used by the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as all remaining single-shot trap-door [[Springfield Model 1873]]s. While the [[Springfield Model 1892-99|Krag]] had been issued in both a [[long rifle]] and [[carbine]], the Springfield was issued only as a short 24-inch barrel rifle in keeping with current trends in Switzerland and Great Britain to eliminate the need for both long rifles and carbines.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Chisholm|editor1-first=Hugh|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information, Volumes 23\u201324|date=1911|publisher=University Press|page=328|edition=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGk6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PR8}}</ref>\n\nThe two main problems usually cited with the Krag were its slow-to-load magazine and its inability to handle higher chamber pressures for high-velocity rounds. The United States Army attempted to introduce a higher-velocity cartridge in 1899 for the existing Krags, but its single locking lug on the bolt could not withstand the extra chamber pressure. Though a [[stripper clip|stripper-clip]] or charger loading modification to the Krag was designed, it was clear to Army authorities that a new rifle was required. After the U.S. military's experience with the Mauser rifle in the [[Spanish\u2013American War|1898 Spanish\u2013American War]], authorities decided to adopt a stronger Mauser-derived design equipped with a charger- or stripper clip-loaded box magazine.\n\n===Advances in small arms technology===\nIn 1882, the bolt action [[M1885 Remington\u2013Lee|.45 Remington Lee rifle]] design of 1879, with its newly invented detachable box magazine, was purchased in limited numbers by the U.S. Navy. Several hundred 1882 Lee Navy Models (M1882 Remington-Lee) were also subjected to trials by the U.S. Army during the 1880s, though the rifle was not formally adopted. The Navy adopted the Model 1885, and later different style Lee Model 1895 (a 6mm straight pull bolt), which saw service in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In Army service, both the 1885 and 1895 6mm Lee were used in the Spanish\u2013American War, along with the .30 Krag and the .45-70 Model 1873 Springfield. The Lee rifle's detachable box magazine was invented by [[James Paris Lee]], and would be very influential on later rifle designs. Other advancements had made it clear that the Army needed a replacement. In 1892, the U.S. military held a series of rifle trials, resulting in the adoption of the .30  [[Springfield Model 1892-99|Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen]] rifle. The Krag officially entered U.S. service in 1894, only to be replaced nine years later by the Springfield M1903.\n\n===Development===\nThousands of [[Mauser Model 1893|Spanish Mauser Model 93]] rifles, surrendered by Spanish troops in Cuba, were returned to the U.S. and extensively studied at Springfield Armory, where it was decided that the Mauser was the superior design.\n\n====U.S. Rifle Model 1900 .30 prototype====\nA prototype rifle was produced in 1900; it was very similar to Rifle No. 5, the final Mauser M92 prototype in the U.S. Army rifle trials of 1892. This design was rejected, and a new design combining features of the 1898 Krag rifle and the 1893 Spanish Mauser was developed.\n\n====U.S. Rifle Model 1901 .30 prototype====\nSpringfield began work on creating a rifle that could handle higher loads around the turn of the 20th century. The Springfield Model 1901 prototype combined the cock-on-opening bolt, 30\" barrel, magazine cutoff, stock and sights of the [[Springfield Model 1892\u201399|Krag-J\u00f8rgensen]] with the dual locking lugs, external claw extractor, and staggered-column magazine of the 1893 Mauser. Taking a cue from the 1898 Mauser [[Gewehr 98]], a large safety lug was added to the side of the bolt behind the extractor, which would engage the receiver bridge and prevent the bolt moving rearwards. The bolt handle was also bent downwards, to make operation of the bolt faster. The Springfield Model 1901 almost entered production. Springfield was sure enough that the Springfield Model 1901 prototype would be accepted that they began making some parts, but it was not accepted and further changes were asked for.\n\n===Adoption===\nFollowing then-current trends in service rifles, the barrel was shortened to 24\" after it was discovered that a longer barrel offered no appreciable ballistic advantage, and the shorter barrel was lighter and easier to handle. This \"short rifle\" also eliminated the need of a shorter carbine for mounted troops or cavalry.<ref name=y03s/> A spike-type bayonet with storage in the fore end of the stock was added to the design. This new design was accepted, type classified and officially adopted as the United States Rifle, Caliber .30, Model 1903 and entered production in 1903. The M1903 became commonly known among its users as the \"ought-three\" in reference to the year '03 of first production.\n\nThe War Department had exhaustively studied and dissected several examples of the Spanish Mauser Model 1893 rifle captured during the Spanish\u2013American War, and applied some features of the U.S. Krag rifle to a bolt and magazine system derived from the Mauser Model 93, to produce the new U.S. Springfield Rifle, the Model 1903. Despite Springfield Armory's use of a two-piece firing pin and other slight design alterations, the 1903 was, in fact, a Mauser design, and after that company brought suit, the U.S. government was judged to pay $250,000 in royalties to [[Mauser]] Werke.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sheehan|first1=John|title=Battlefield tack driver: the model 1903 Springfield in WWI|journal=Guns Magazine|date=1 October 2006|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Battlefield+tack+driver%3a+the+model+1903+Springfield+in+WWI.-a0150451303|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy January 1905 over 80,000 of these rifles had been produced at the federally owned [[Springfield Armory]]. However, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] objected to the design of the sliding rod-type bayonet used as being too flimsy for combat.  In a letter to the Secretary of War, he said:\n\n<blockquote>I must say that I think that ramrod bayonet is about as poor an invention as I ever saw.  As you observed, it broke short off as soon as hit with even moderate violence.  It would have no moral effect and mighty little physical effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kontis|first1=George|title=Are We Forever Stuck with the Bayonet?|journal=Small Arms Defense Journal|date=24 August 2011|url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=531|accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAll the rifles to that point consequently had to be re-tooled for a blade-type [[bayonet]], called the [[M1905 bayonet|M1905]]. The sights were also an area of concern, so the new improved Model 1904 sight was also added.<ref name=y03s>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2003 |title=100 Years Of The '03 Springfield |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=151 |issue=March |pages=42\u201345&78 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2006 |title=From Poor Invention To America's Best |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=154 |issue=September |pages=59\u201361, 91\u201392&94 }}</ref>\n\nThe retooling was almost complete when it was decided another change would be made. It was to incorporate improvements discovered during experimentation in the interim, most notably the use of pointed ammunition, first adopted by the French in the 1890s and later other countries. The round itself was based on the .30-03, but rather than a 220-grain (14&nbsp;g) round-tip bullet fired at {{convert|2300|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, it had a 150-grain (9.7&nbsp;g) pointed bullet fired at {{convert|2800|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; the case neck was a fraction of an inch shorter as well. The new American cartridge was designated \"Cartridge, Ball, Caliber .30, Model of 1906\". The M1906 cartridge is better known as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] round used in many rifles and machine guns, and is still a popular civilian cartridge to the present day. The rifle's sights were again re-tooled to compensate for the speed and trajectory of the new cartridge.\n\nBy the time of the 1916 Pancho Villa Expedition the 1903 Springfield Rifle was the standard issue service rifle of US forces. Some rifles were fitted with both the Warner & Swasey Model 1913 and 1908 \"Musket Sights\" during the campaign. \"Musket Sights\" being the vernacular at the time for telescopic sights. Annecdotal evidence at the time indicates that some of the rifles were fitted with Maxim silencers, which would make them the first U.S. Military Suppressed Rifles. The Warner & Swasey Model 1913 Musket Sight would continue to see service after the Pancho Villa Expedition and during World War I but would be deemed inadequate and was removed from the US Army's inventory by the 1920s. <ref>{{cite magazine |last=Canfield |first=Bruce |date=October 2016 |title= 1916: Guns On The Border |magazine=American Rifleman |publisher=National Rifle Association}}</ref>\n\n===World War I and interwar use===\n[[File:The US Army on the Western Front 1914-1918 Q70181.jpg|thumb|right|US Marines with M1903 rifles and bayonets in France (1918)]]\n[[File:US WWI rifle periscope attachment.jpeg|thumb|An Elder-type [[Periscope rifle|periscope stock]] fitted to an M1903 (1918).

Pre-war production utilized questionable metallurgy. Some receivers constructed of single-heat-treated case-hardened steel were improperly subjected to excessive temperatures during the forging process. The carbon could be \"burnt\" out of the steel producing a brittle receiver.<ref>''Canfield, February 2008, p. 13</ref> Despite documented evidence indicating some early rifles were improperly forged, actual cases of failure were very rare. Although several cases of serious injury from receiver failure were documented, the U.S. Army never reported any fatalities. Many failures were attributed to use of incorrect cartridges, such as the [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]].<ref name=l&h>{{cite journal |last1=Canfield |first1=Bruce N. |year=2004 |title=U.S. M1903A1 Rifles |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=152 |issue=January |pages=20 }}</ref> Evidence also seems to suggest that improperly forged brass cartridge cases could have exacerbated receiver failure.<ref>''Lyon, Joseph: Some Observations On The Failure Of U.S. Model 1903 Rifle Receivers (http://m1903.com/03rcvrfail/)</ref>\n\n[[Pyrometer]]s were installed in December 1917 to accurately measure temperatures during the forging process. The change was made at approximately serial number 800,000 for rifles made at Springfield Armory and at serial number 285,507 at Rock Island Arsenal. Lower serial numbers are known as \"low-number\" M1903 rifles. Higher serial numbers are said to be \"double-heat-treated.\"<ref name=l&h/>\n\nToward the end of the war, Springfield turned out the Model 1903 Mark I. The Mark I has a cut on the left hand side of the receiver meant to act as an ejection port for the [[Pedersen Device]], a modified sear and cutoff to operate the Pedersen Device; a specialized insert that replaced the bolt and allowed the user to fire .30 caliber pistol cartridges semi-automatically from a 40-round detachable magazine. The stock was also slightly cut down on the left side to clear the ejection port. In all other respects, the Mark I is identical to the 1903. Temperature control during forging was improved prior to Mark I production. The receiver alloy was toughened by addition of nickel after Mark I production.\n\nIn 1926, after experiencing the effect of long-range German [[7.92\u00d757mm]] Mauser and machine gun fire during the war, the U.S. Army adopted the heavy 174-grain boat-tail bullet for its .30-06 cartridge, standardized as 'Cartridge, Ball, caliber 30, M1'.<ref name=\"Barnes, Frank C. 1989 p. 59\">Barnes, Frank C., ''Cartridges of the World'', 6th ed., DBI Books Inc. (1989), p. 59</ref> M1 ammunition, intended primarily for long-range machine gun use, soon became known by Army rifle competition teams and expert riflemen for its considerably greater accuracy over that of the M1906-round; the new M1 ammunition was issued to infantrymen with the Springfield rifle as well as to machine gun teams.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dunlap|first1=Roy|title=Rifles|journal=Ordnance Went up Front: Some Observations and Experiences of a Sergeant of Ordnance, Who Served Throughout World War II with the United States Army in Egypt, the Philippines and Japan, Including Way Stations|date=1948|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Ordnance_Went_Up_Front.html?id=vp8QAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2015|oclc=777744849}}</ref> However, during the late 1930s, it became apparent that, with the development of mortars, high-angle artillery, and the .50 caliber [[M2 Browning]] machine gun, the need for extreme long-range, rifle-caliber machine-gun fire was decreasing. In 1938, the U.S. army reverted to a .30-06 cartridge with a 152-grain flat-base bullet, now termed [[M2 Ball]], for all rifles and machine guns.<ref name=\"Barnes, Frank C. 1989 p. 59\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s and the 1930s, M1903s were delivered to US allies in [[Central America]], such as [[Cuba]], [[Costa Rica]] or [[Nicaragua]].

The precision rear aperture sight was located too far from the eye for efficient use, and the narrow, unprotected front sight was both difficult to see in poor light and easily damaged. The U.S. Marine Corps issued the Springfield with a sight hood to protect the front sight, along with a thicker front blade. The two-piece firing pin/striker also proved to be no improvement over the original one-piece Mauser design, and was a cause of numerous Ordnance repairs, along with occasional reports of jammed magazine followers.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/>\n[[File:American First World War Official Exchange Collection Q103350.jpg|thumb|right|Camouflaged M1903 Springfield sniper's rifle with Warner & Swasey [[telescopic sight]], in France, May 1918.]]\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] saw new production of the Springfield at private manufacturers such as the [[Remington Arms]] and [[Smith-Corona]] Typewriter companies. Remington began production of the M1903 in September 1941, at serial number 3,000,000, using old tooling from the [[Rock Island Arsenal]] which had been in storage since 1919. The very early rifles are almost indistinguishable from 1919-made Rock Island rifles. As the already worn tooling began to wear beyond use Remington began seeking Army approval for a continuously increasing number of changes and simplifications to both speed up manufacture and improve performance. The milled parts on the Remington M1903 were gradually replaced with stamped parts until, at about serial number 3,330,000, the Army and Remington recognized that a new model name was appropriate. Other features of the M1903, such as high-grade walnut stocks with finger grooves, were replaced with less expensive but serviceable substitutes. Most milled parts made by Remington were marked with an \"R\".<ref name=bnc2>{{cite journal |last=Canfield |first=Bruce N. |year=2015 |title=Wartime Remington M1903s? |journal=[[American Rifleman]] |volume=163 |issue=March |pages=44 }}</ref>\n \nM1903 production was discontinued in favor of the M1903A3. The most noticeable visual difference in the M1903A3 was the replacement of the barrel-mounted rear sight with a smaller, simpler aperture rear sight mounted on the rear of the receiver; it was primarily adopted in order to speed familiarization by soldiers already trained on the M1 Garand, which had a similar sighting system. However, the leaf spring providing tension to the elevation adjustment on the new aperture sight tended to weaken with continued use over time, causing the rifle to lose its preset range elevation setting.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\">Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 302</ref> Other modifications included a new stamped cartridge follower; ironically, the rounded edges of the new design largely alleviated the 'fourth-round jam' complaints of the earlier machined part.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/> All stock furniture was also redesigned in stamped metal.\n\nIn late 1942, Smith-Corona Typewriter Company also began production of the M1903A3 at its plant in Syracuse, NY.<ref name=\"Brophy, William 1985 p. 187\">Brophy, William, ''The Springfield 1903 Rifles'', Stackpole Books (1985), p. 187</ref> Smith/Corona parts are mostly identified by the absence of markings.

The underside of the bolt handle root, will also be marked with a inspectors inspection number, and a punch marking from the hardness testing. This \"X\" markings is often misidentified as the \"H\" marking, that is found on field replacement bolts produced by Hadley Tool co. The \"H\" marking is easily identified by its use of a cursive bubble script. Which appears to be a X at a glance, but is easily distinguishable from the Smith Corona \"X\", when compared to one another. Due to the Smith Corona \"X\" being a simple two-line X, often referred to as the \"crossed twigs\" Front sight bases are also found to be occasionally marked with a \"G\" on the side between the two pin holes used for mounting the base to the barrel, and to affix the sight blade. This \"G\" mark may also be found on the bolt/safety shroud, but hidden on an assembled bolt. This is due to it being stamped on the inner face of the shroud facing the striker/firing pin assembly, as to be hidden on an assembled bolt. The shroud is also identified by a scalloped cut on top, but this does not absolutely identify the shroud as a Smith Corona part. One must remember the machines and plans were obtained by other manufacturers after Smith Corona and ended WW2 production. This was to be done to manufacture replacement parts at the end of and post WW2. As such, these manufacturers used the designs as completed by Smith Corona. As expected shrouds and other parts will look nearly identical to Smith Corona original parts, but bear other markings. Such as, \"BP\" marked shrouds, \"CC\" marked bolt bodies, and other parts manufactured using the Smith Corona designs. The only \"S\" marking, that might be found, is found on the extractor. This marking is located on the down-facing side, when mounted on the bolt, in the same area as the dovetailed mounting point underneath the extractor when mounted. Smith Corona buttplates, are only marked by the design of the stamped checkering, which will be 9 to 10 lines per inch. As opposed to a WW2 Remington or replacement stamped 1903a3 buttplate, which consist of 16 or more lines per inch. The stamped trigger guard, is found both with the \"small early\" and \"large mid to late\" trigger bow. A Smith Corona part, however, is identified by the reinforcement stamping line directly behind the forward most action screws (sometimes referred to as the king screw). The stamped reinforcement line behind the forward screw, is shaped in a U or semicircle surrounding the rear portion of the screw. As opposed to a Remington manufactured parts straight line stamping in the same location. Rear adjustable sights appear to be of near-identical design, except for finish and the lack of identifying marks on the base or the sight itself. The rear sight has been observed being removed from original sealed WW2 packaging, and in time period photos, as to having two external finish types. Photos show very early production rear sights being completely finished in a hot caustic bluing. All other confirmed original rear sights, have been noted to have a grey phosphate finished base, and the sight itself being blued. Smith Corona rifle stocks in as new original non-rearsenaled condition, lacking a Depot or arsenal stamp with only a single circle P proof, have all been noted to have certain original as manufactured markings or proofs. The left side of the stock, on the wrist area, are marked with a boxed-in FJA inspector stamp followed by the crossed cannon arsenal stamp. The order of the stamps are reversed from Remington production stocks, and lack the RA marking (Remington Arms) preceding the other markings. Just forward of the trigger guard on the underside of the stock, are 4 inspection numbers encased in differing shapes. There may be more present, if the stock or rifle has been reworked in the past, but originally there was to be 4 inspection processes marked here. Numbers differing by inspector, the shapes they are enclosed in have been observed to the same on each original example in the same position. Left to right, top to bottom, they are as follows. Top left, number in a triangle, top right, number in a circle, bottom left, number in a square, and unique to Smith Corona stocks, bottom right, number in a diamond. Just behind the bow of the trigger guard is the P proof, that is usually present on US arms of this period and before on the bottom of the stock wrist grip. Unique to the Smith Corona, is the larger size of this proof of 7/16, when compared to a noticeably smaller Remington proof. The inlet cut for the Smith Corona stocks band spring, just forward of the rear stock band, is also of a unique rounded corners design as opposed to Remington's squared corners appearance. |reason=User:Brandon Gvt seems to have forgotten to provide a source for this new information they added|date=August 2019}} \n\nTo speed production output, two-groove rifled barrels were adopted, and steel alloy specifications were relaxed under 'War Emergency Steel' criteria for both rifle actions and barrels.<ref>Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 362</ref> M1903A3 rifles with two-groove 'war emergency' barrels were shipped with a printed notation stating that the reduction in rifling grooves did not affect accuracy.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 301\">Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 301</ref>  As the war progressed, various machining and finishing operations were eliminated on the M1903A3 in order to increase production levels.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 301\"/>\n\nOriginal production rifles at Remington and Smith-Corona had a dark gray/black finish similar to the bluing of late World War I. Beginning in late 1943 a lighter gray/green parkerizing finish was used. This later finish was also used on arsenal repaired weapons.\nIt is somewhat unusual to find a World War I or early World War II M1903 with its original dated barrel. Much, if not all, World War II .30-06 ammunition used a corrosive primer which left corrosive salts in the barrel. If not removed by frequent and proper barrel cleaning these residues could cause pitting and excessive wear. In the jungle fighting on various Pacific islands cleaning was sometimes lax and the excessive moisture compounded the corrosive action of the residue.<ref>{{Citation | last = Bishop | first = Chris| title = The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II | place = New York | publisher = Orbis Publishing Ltd | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-0-7607-1022-7}}.</ref>\n\nThe M1903 and the M1903A3 rifle were used in combat alongside the M1 Garand by the U.S. military during World War II and saw extensive use and action in the hands of U.S. troops in Europe, North Africa, and the Pacific. The [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were initially armed with M1903 rifles in early battles in the Pacific, such as the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]], but the jungle battle environment generally favored self-loading rifles;<ref>George, John (Lt Col), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 391: \"Nearly every one [Marine] I talked to [on Guadalcanal] who used the Springfield in combat-without a scope-would have much rather been using a Garand.\"</ref> later Army units arriving to the island were armed with the M1 Garand.<ref>George, John (Lt Col), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 391</ref> The [[U.S. Army Rangers]] were also a major user of the M1903 and the M1903A3 during World War II with the Springfield being preferred over the M1 Garand for certain commando missions.\n\nAccording to Bruce Canfield's encyclopedic ''U.S. Infantry Weapons of WW II'', final variants of the M1903 (the A3 and A4) were delivered in February 1944.<ref name=bnc2/> By then, most American combat troops had been re-equipped with the M1 Garand. However, some front-line infantry units in both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps retained M1903s as infantry rifles beyond that date and continued to use them alongside the M1 Garand until the end of the Second World War in 1945. The Springfield remained in service for [[sniper]]s (using the '''M1903A4'''), [[grenadier]]s (using a spigot type rifle [[22 mm grenade|22 mm]] [[grenade launcher]]), and Marine [[Scout Sniper]] units.\n\n==== Sniper rifle====\nThe M1903A4 was the U.S. Army's sniper rifle of choice during the Second World War. The M1903A4 was a variation of the M1903A3. The only difference between receivers was that the model and serial number on the receiver were split on 1903A4 to make room for the Redfield scope mount. The Redfield scope mount removed the rear peep sight that was standard on the M1903A3. The scope used on the M1903A4 was a Weaver Model 330 or 330C, which was a 2.75x telescopic sight. The receivers were tested by Remington Arms and those that were deemed best, meaning those closest to design specifications were selected to become M1903A4's. The barrels were also selected specifically to be added to the M1903A4 rifle only if they were within almost exact specifications for the design. The front sight on the barrel was never installed on the A4 barrels, however, the notch for it was still in place. .<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/>  Barrel specifications were, in general, unchanged between the M1903A3 and M1903A4, however, the War Department did start installing barrels with 2 groove rifling instead of 4 groove, despite the lack of clear changes from the 4 groove rifling that was the standard up until 1942.<ref>George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 392</ref>\n\nBy some accounts, the M1903A4 was inadequate as a sniper rifle. The M1903A4 was a relatively accurate rifle with an effective range of about 600 yards (550m). These limitations on long-range targeting were due to the limited field of view present in both the M73 and M73B1 scopes. From its adoption in 1943 until the end of the war it was used extensively in every theater of operation by both the US Army and the USMC.<ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 392-393\">George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 392\u2013393</ref> The Weaver scopes (later standardized as the M73 and M73B1) were not only low-powered in magnification, they were not waterproofed, and frequently fogged over or became waterlogged during humidity changes. In addition, the M81/82 optional scopes also had significant flaws. They most notably had less power (2.2x vs. 2.75x) and, like the other scopes on the M1903A4, had serious issues with the field of view.<ref name=\"Dunlap, Roy 1948 p. 302\"/><ref name=\"George, John 1981 p. 392-393\"/><ref>George, John (Lt. Col.), ''Shots Fired In Anger'', NRA Press (1981), p. 296\u2013299</ref> The USMC would eventually switch to a large 8x scope that spanned the length of the rifle designed by John Unertl.\n\n==== Foreign users==== \nThe U.S. Army Military Police (MP) and the U.S. Navy Shore Patrol also used M1903s and M1903A3s throughout the war. Various U.S. allies and friendly irregular forces were also equipped with the weapon. The [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] (FEB), operating in the 5th Army in Italy was equipped with Springfield M1903 rifles. In August 1943, the [[Free French Forces]] of General [[Charles de Gaulle]] were re-equipped by the United States primarily with M1903A3 Springfield and [[M1917 Enfield Rifle]]s. The M1903A3 became one of the primary rifles used by French forces until the end of the war, and was afterwards used  in [[Indochina]]<ref name=\"Viet Minh\">{{cite book|title=French Foreign L\u00e9gionnaire vs Viet Minh Insurgent: North Vietnam 1948\u201352|series=Combat 36|first=Martin |last=Windrow|date=20 Sep 2018|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=9781472828910|page=22}}</ref> and by local militia and security forces in French [[Algeria]].<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-14-15-texte-integral}}</ref> Large numbers of M1903 Springfields were sent to China.<ref name =\"Chinese Army\">{{cite book|title=The Chinese Army 1937\u201349: World War II and Civil War|series=Men-at-Arms 424|first=Philip |last=Jowett|date=10 Jul 2005|isbn=9781841769042|publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]]|page=19}}</ref>\nDuring the Korean War,South Korean Marines used M1903A3<ref>{{cite book|last=\ubd80|first=\ucc3d\uc625|title=\ud55c\uad6d \uc804\uc7c1 \uc218\ucca9:\u00a0\uc5b4\ub290 \ud559\ub3c4\ubcd1 \uc758 \ucc38\uc804 \uc77c\uae30\n|year=2012|location=\uacbd\uae30 \uace0\uc591\uc2dc|publisher= \ud55c\uadf8\ub8e8 \ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4|isbn=9791195158027 |page= 6}}</ref>[[File:South Koreans Marines m1903a3.png|thumb|South Korean marine armed with M1903 rifle, September 20, 1950.]]\nSpringfield M1903 rifles captured by the Germans were designated '''Gewehr 249(a).'''<ref>{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Robert W.

Still, some M1903A4s remained in sniper use as late as the Vietnam War; and technical manuals for them were printed as late as 1970.<ref name=y03s/> The U.S. Navy also continued to carry some stocks of M1903A3s on board ships, for use as anti-mine rifles.\n\n===Today===\n[[File:USMC-120801-M-VG714-002.jpg|thumb|M1903 Springfield used during a vintage sniper rifle match in 2012]]\n\nDue to its balance, it is still popular with various military drill teams and color guards, most notably the U.S. Army Drill Team.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} M1903 rifles (along with the M1 Garand, M1917 Enfield and M14 rifles) are also common at [[high school]] [[Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (JROTC) units to teach weapons handling and military drill procedures to the cadets. JROTC units use M1903s for regular and inter-school competition drills, including elaborate exhibition spinning routines. Exhibition teams often use fiberglass stocks in place of wooden stocks, which are heavier and more prone to breakage when dropped. JROTC Color Guards still favor wooden stocks over fiberglass because of their weight characteristics and appearance. The M1903 is also the standard parade rifle of the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]], which has over six hundred M1903s, a very small percentage of which are still fireable. The Summerall Guards of The Citadel South Carolina Corps of Cadets in Charleston, S.C. also use the Springfield 1903 model for their silent drill performances, which include annual trips to [[Mardi Gras]], as well as many other notable performances.\n\nContemporary hunters and shooting enthusiasts value the rifle for its beauty, dependability, and adaptability for almost all U.S. game animals.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} With proper gunsmithing, the M1903 makes a reasonably priced sporting rifle, comparing favorably with many modern firearms.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps]] color guard rifles bear many similarities to the Springfield.\n\n\nIn 1977, the Army located a rather large cache of unissued M1903A3 rifles which were demilitarized and then issued to JROTC units as a replacement for their previously issued [[M1 Garand]] and [[M14 rifle|M14]] rifles, which were then returned to Army custody due to concerns about potential break-ins at high school JROTC armories.\n\nFor safety reasons, the JROTC M1903s are made permanently unable to fire by plugging the barrel with a steel rod, or having it filled with lead, soldering the bolt and welding the magazine cutoff switch in the ON position.  To plug the barrel, a very cold steel rod was inserted; after it warmed up it was too tight to remove.\n\n==Specifications==\n[[File:Caliber 30 Springfield Rifle.JPG|thumb|Diagram of the .30 Springfield Rifle]]\nThe U.S. rifle, Model of 1903 was 44\u215e&nbsp;inches (1.098&nbsp;m) long and weighed 8&nbsp;[[Avoirdupois|lb]] 11&nbsp;oz (3.95&nbsp;kg). A bayonet could be attached; the [[M1905 bayonet]] blade was 16&nbsp;in (406&nbsp;mm) long and weighed 1&nbsp;lb (0.45&nbsp;kg). From 1906, the rifle was chambered to fire the .30-[[caliber]] M1906 [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] (.30-06 cartridge), later the M1 (1926) and [[M2 Ball]] (1938) rounds. There were four standard types of cartridge:\n\n* '''Ball''': consisted of a brass case or shell, primer, a charge of smokeless powder, and the bullet. The bullet had a sharp point called a [[Spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullet]], and was composed of a lead core and a jacket of [[cupro-nickel]] (later gilding metal), and in the M1906 design, weighed 150&nbsp;[[Grain (measure)|grains]] (9.7&nbsp;g). The bullet of the M1906 cartridge, when fired from the rifle, had an initial velocity of {{convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Blank''': contained a paper cup instead of a bullet. It is dangerous up to {{convert|33|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Guard''': had a smaller charge of powder than the ball cartridge, and five [[cannelure]]s encircle the body of the shell at about the middle to distinguish it from ball cartridges. It was intended for use on guard or in riot duty, and it gave good results up to {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The range of {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} required a sight elevation of {{convert|450|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and the range of {{convert|200|yd|m|abbr=on}} required an elevation of {{convert|645|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n* '''Dummy''': this was tin-plated and the shell was provided with six longitudinal corrugations and three circular holes. The primer contains no percussion composition. It was intended for drill purposes to accustom the soldier to the operation of loading the rifle.\n\nThe rifle was sighted for {{convert|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} and had a point-blank range of {{convert|500|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The maximum range of the ball cartridge, when elevated at an angle of 45\u00b0, was {{convert|4890|yd|km mi|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe rifle was a magazine-fed clip-loader and could fire at a rate of 20 shots per minute. Each [[stripper clip]] contained five cartridges, and standard issue consisted of 12 clips carried in a cloth bandoleer. When full the [[bandoleer]] weighed about {{convert|3|lb|14|oz|kg|abbr=on}}. Bandoleers were packed 20 in a box, for a total of 1,200 rounds. The full box weighed {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe bore of the rifle is 0.30&nbsp;inches (7.62&nbsp;mm) in diameter. It was then rifled 0.004&nbsp;in (0.1&nbsp;mm) deep, making the diameter from the bottom of one groove to the bottom of the opposite groove 0.30787 in (7.82&nbsp;mm) of the barrel.\n\nThe 1903 rifle included a rear sight leaf that could be used to adjust for elevation. When the leaf was flat, the battle sight appeared on top. This sight was set for {{convert|547|yd|abbr=on}}, and was not adjustable. When the leaf was raised it could be adjusted to a maximum extreme range of {{convert|2850|yd|abbr=on}}. The rear sight could also be adjusted for windage.\n\nThe 1903A3 rear sight was an aperture sight adjustable both for elevation and windage.\n\nA feature inherent to the M1903 and not found on the [[Gewehr 98|Mauser 98]] is the cocking piece, a conspicuous knob at the rear of the bolt, allowing the rifle's striker to be released without dry firing, or to cock the rifle if necessary, for example to attempt a second strike on a round that failed to fire.\n\n==Variants==\nThere were four main variants given official nomenclature, though there are a number of important sub-variants:\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903A3]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903 with 'scant' [[Stock (firearm)|stock]]]]\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903A4 with M84 sight.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|M1903A4 with Type C stock and M84 sight]]\n*'''M1903 (1903)''': developed for the [[.30-03]] (also known as the .30-45) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].

These barrels were fitted to selected receivers with hand-fitted and polished parts. The bolt was left unblued while the receiver and barrel were finished with a black Parkerizing process. Some bolts have the safety direction reversed to prevent it from striking the nose of a right-handed shooter, and those made from 1924 to 1929 have the knurled cocking piece removed to decrease lock time. Early rifles used the type S stock until the type C stock became standard in 1929. Rifles made for sale to NRA members (priced at $40.44) were drilled and tapped for a Lyman 48 receiver sight and had either a type B (or NB) stock with no grasping grooves and a noticeable drop at the heel for a long pistol grip, or a special National Match stock with a high comb and pistol grip. Total production was 28,907. Most were issued to service teams and 25,377 were reconditioned at Springfield armory after one year of match use.

There were thousands of stock blanks that had been sized for the old straight stock. They weren't deep enough for the full pistol grip of the Type C stock, so they were modified to allow a \"scant\" grip that was the largest grip they could form. These \"scant\" stocks would only fit on a 1903, and would not fit an 03A3. Springfield only rebuilt existing M1903 rifles using this stock in 1942 and marked the cut-off seat with a small \"s\".\n[[File:1930 Springfield 1903A1.JPG|thumb|Springfield 1903A1 rifle]]\n*'''M1903A1 (1929\u20131939)''': changed from a straight stock to a pistol grip type stock (Type C stock).

{"title_page": "Sources of Hamlet", "text_new": "[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|[[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo Grammaticus']] ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' ([[Angers Fragment]]), page 1, front]]\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Sources of ''Hamlet''}}\nThe sources of ''[[Hamlet, Prince of Denmark]]'', a [[tragedy]] by [[William Shakespeare]] believed to have been written between 1599 and 1601, trace back as far as pre-13th century. The generic \"hero-as-fool\" story is so old and is expressed in the literature of so many cultures that scholars have hypothesized that it may be [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] in origin. A [[Amleth|Scandinavian version]] of the story of Hamlet (called Amleth or Aml\u00f3\u00f0i, which means \"mad\" or \"not sane\" in [[Old Norse]]) was put into writing around 1200 [[AD]] by Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (the first full history of Denmark). It is this work Shakespeare borrowed from to create ''[[Hamlet]]''. Similar accounts are found in the Icelandic ''[[Hr\u00f3lfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrolf Kraki]]'' and the Roman legend of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], both of which feature heroes who pretend to be insane in order to get revenge. A reasonably accurate version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest]] in his ''Histoires Tragiques''. Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's [[melancholia|melancholy]].\n\nAfter this point, the ancestry of Shakespeare's version of ''Hamlet'' becomes more difficult to trace. Many literary scholars believe that Shakespeare's main source was an earlier play\u2014now lost\u2014known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''. Possibly written by [[Thomas Kyd]], the ''Ur-Hamlet'' would have been in performance by 1589 and was seemingly the first to include a ghost in the story. Using the few comments available from theatre-enthusiasts at the time, scholars have attempted to trace exactly where the ''Ur-Hamlet'' might have ended and the play popular today begins. A few scholars have suggested that the ''Ur-Hamlet'' is an early draft of Shakespeare's, rather than the work of Kyd. Regardless of the mysteries surrounding the ''Ur-Hamlet'', though, several elements of the story changed. Unlike earlier versions, Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' does not feature an omniscient narrator of events and [[Prince Hamlet]] does not appear to have a complete plan of action. The play's setting in Elsinore also differs from legendary versions.\n\n==Scandinavian legend==\n{{Main article|Amleth}}\nThe story of the prince who plots revenge on his uncle (the current king) for killing his father (the former king) is an old one. Many of the story elements\u2014the prince feigning madness and his testing by a young woman, the prince talking to his mother and her hasty marriage to the usurper, the prince killing a hidden spy and substituting the execution of two retainers for his own\u2014are found in a medieval tale by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] called ''Vita Amlethi'' (part of his larger Latin work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''), which was written around 1200 AD.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=1\u20135}} Older written and oral traditions from various cultures may have influenced Saxo's work. Amleth (as Hamlet is called in Saxo's version) probably derived from an oral tale told throughout [[Scandinavia]]. Parallels can be found with [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] legend, though no written version of the original Icelandic tale survives from before the 16th century. [[Torfaeus]], a scholar in 17th-century Iceland, made the connection between Saxo's Amleth and local oral tradition about a Prince Ambales (''[[Aml\u00f3\u00f0i]]'').{{efn|The etymology of the name is unknown, and there are various suggestions. In 1948, Ferdinand Holthausen suggested it is based on the \"fool, simpleton\" interpretation of the name, composing the name from Old Norse ''ama'' \"to vex, annoy, molest\" and ''[[\u00f3\u00f0r]]'' \"fierceness, madness\" (also in the theonym ''[[Odin]]'').{{sfn|Holthausen|1948}} A more recent suggestion, by L. A. Collinson in ''[[The Review of English Studies]]'', is based on the kenning associating ''Aml\u00f3\u00f0i'' with the mythological mill ''grotti'', and derives it from the Old Irish name ''Admlithi'' \"great-grinding\", attested in  ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]''.{{sfn|Collinson|2011}}}}\nTorfaeus dismissed the local tradition as \"an old wive's tale\" due to its incorporation of fairy-tale elements and quasi-historical legend and Torfaeus' own confusion about the hero's country of origin (not recognizing [[Cimbrian Peninsula|Cimbria]] as a name for Denmark).{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|p=7}}{{sfn|Gollancz|1898|pp=3\u201313}}\n\nSimilarities include the prince's feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king's counsellor in his mother's bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=5\u201315}}\n\nThe original ''[[Aml\u00f3\u00f0i]]'' story has been surmised to be derived from a \"10th-century\"{{sfn|Harrison|Harrison|1912|p=184}} Old Icelandic poem, but no such poem is known.\n\nThe \"hero as fool\" story has many parallels (Roman, Spanish, Scandinavian and Arabic) and can be classified as a universal, or at least common [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], narrative topos.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=36\u201337}}\n\n[[File:Kyd, Spanish Tragedy.jpg|thumb|''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', by Thomas Kyd. This popular [[Revenge play|revenge tragedy]] may have influenced ''Hamlet''. Its author may have also written the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''.]]\n\n==Influences on Saxo Grammaticus==\nThe two most popular candidates for written works that may have influenced Saxo, however, are the anonymous Scandinavian ''[[Hr\u00f3lfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrolf Kraki]]'' and the Roman legend of Brutus, which is recorded in two separate Latin works. In ''Saga of Hrolf Kraki'', the murdered king has two sons\u2014[[Hro\u00f0gar|Hroar]] and [[Halga|Helgi]]\u2014who assume the names of Ham and Hr\u00e1ni for concealment. They spend most of the story in disguise, rather than feigning madness, though Ham does act childishly at one point to deflect suspicion. The sequence of events differs from Shakespeare's as well.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=16\u201325}}\n\nIn contrast, the Roman story of Brutus focuses on feigned madness. Its hero, Lucius ('shining, light'), changes his name and persona to Brutus ('dull, stupid'), playing the role to avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family's killer, King Tarquinius. In addition to writing in the Latin language of the Romans, Saxo adjusted the story to reflect classical Roman concepts of virtue and heroism.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=25\u201337}} A reasonably accurate version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest]] in his ''Histoires Tragiques''.{{sfn|Edwards|1985|pp=1\u20132}} Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's [[melancholia|melancholy]].{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n==The ''Ur-Hamlet''==\n{{Main article|Ur-Hamlet}}\nShakespeare's main source is believed to be an earlier play\u2014now lost\u2014known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''. Possibly written by [[Thomas Kyd]], the ''Ur-Hamlet'' would have been in performance by 1589, and was seemingly the first to include a ghost in the story.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=82\u201385}} Shakespeare's company, [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|the Chamberlain's Men]], may have purchased that play and performed a version, which Shakespeare reworked, for some time.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|p=67}} Since no copy of the ''Ur-Hamlet'' has survived, it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any candidate for its authorship. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of ''Hamlet'' by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea\u2014placing ''Hamlet'' far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development\u2014has attracted some support, though others dismiss it as speculation.{{efn|In his 1936 book ''The Problem of Hamlet: A Solution'' Andrew Cairncross asserted that the ''Hamlet'' referred to in 1589 was written by Shakespeare;{{sfn|Cairncross|1975}} Peter Alexander,{{sfn|Alexander|1964}} [[Eric Sams]]{{sfn|Jackson|1991|p=267}} and, more recently, [[Harold Bloom]]{{sfn|Bloom|2001|pp=xiii, 383}}{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=154}} have agreed. However Harold Jenkins, the editor of the second series Arden edition of the play, considers that there are not grounds for thinking that the Ur-Hamlet is an early work by Shakespeare, which he then rewrote.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|p=84 n4}}}} [[Francis Meres]]'s ''Palladis Tamia'' (published in 1598, probably October) provides a list of twelve named Shakespeare plays, but ''Hamlet'' is not among them. This is not conclusive, however, as other then-extant Shakespeare plays were not on Meres' list either.\n\nThe upshot is that scholars cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the ''Ur-Hamlet'' (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, and how much from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version (although its Latin text was widely available at the time). However, elements of Belleforest's version do appear in Shakespeare's play but are not in Saxo's story, so whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the ''Ur-Hamlet'' remains unclear.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=66\u201368}}\n\nIt is clear, though, that several elements did change somewhere between Belleforest's and Shakespeare's versions. For one, unlike Saxo and Belleforest, Shakespeare's play has no all-knowing narrator, thus inviting the audience to draw their own conclusions about the motives of its characters. And the traditional story takes place across several years, while Shakespeare's covers a few weeks. Belleforest's version details Hamlet's plan for revenge, while in Shakespeare's play Hamlet has no apparent plan.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=69\u201372}} Shakespeare also adds some elements that locate the action in 15th-century Christian Denmark instead of a medieval pagan setting. [[Elsinore]], for example, would have been familiar to [[Elizabethan]] England, as a new castle had been built recently there, and [[University of Wittenberg#History|Wittenberg]], Hamlet's university, was widely known for its [[Protestant]] teachings.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=83\u201385}} Other elements of Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' absent in medieval versions include the secrecy that surrounds the old king's murder, the inclusion of [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] and [[Fortinbras]] (who offer parallels to Hamlet<!-- clarify parallel -->), the testing of the king via a play, and Hamlet's death at the moment he gains his revenge.{{sfn|Edwards|1985|p=2}}{{efn|Harold Jenkins, in the [[Arden Shakespeare]] second series edition of ''Hamlet'', includes a detailed discussion of many possible influences that may have found their way into the play.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=82\u2013122}}}}\n\n==Elizabethan court==\nFor more than a century, Shakespearean scholars have identified several of the play's major characters with specific members of the Elizabethan court. In 1869, [[George Russell French]] theorized that ''Hamlet''{{'}}s [[Polonius]] might have been inspired by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] (Lord Burghley)\u2014Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&nbsp;I]].{{sfn|French|1975|p=301}} French also speculated that the characters of Polonius's children, [[Ophelia]] and [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]], represented two of Burghley's children, Anne and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]].{{sfn|French|1975|pp=299\u2013310}} In 1930, [[E. K. Chambers]] suggested that Polonius's advice to Laertes may have echoed Burghley's to his son Robert,{{sfn|Chambers|1930|p=418}} and in 1932, [[John Dover Wilson]] commented \"the figure of Polonius is almost without doubt intended as a caricature of Burleigh, who died on 4 August 1598\".{{sfn|Wilson|1932|p=104}} In 1963, [[A. L. Rowse]] said that Polonius's tedious verbosity might have resembled Burghley's,{{sfn|Rowse|1995|p=323}} and in 1964, Hurstfield wrote that \"[t]he governing classes were both paternalistic and patronizing; and nowhere is this attitude better displayed than in the advice which that archetype of elder statesmen William Cecil, Lord Burghley\u2014Shakespeare's Polonius\u2014prepared for his son\".{{sfn|Hurstfield|1964|pp=27\u201347}}\n\nLilian Winstanley thought the name Corambis (Polonius' name in the 1st Quarto) suggested Burghley,{{sfn|Winstanley|1921|p=114}} though Krystyna Kujawinska Courtney has pointed out that the name \"Corambis\" translates to \"reheated cabbage\" in Latin, i.e. \"a boring old man\".{{sfn|Courtney|2003|p=2}}\n\nIn 1921, Winstanley claimed \"absolute\" certainty that \"the historical analogues exist; that they are important, numerous, detailed and undeniable\" and that \"Shakespeare is using a large element of contemporary history in ''Hamlet''.\"{{sfn|Winstanley|1921|pp=165\u2013166}} She compared Hamlet with both the Earl of Essex and James I. She also identified Polonius with Burghley parallels, and noted a \"curious parallel\" in the relationship between Ophelia and Hamlet with that of Burghley's daughter, Anne Cecil, and her husband, [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]]. Winstanley noted similar parallels in the relationship of Elizabeth Vernon and [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]].{{sfn|Winstanley|1921|pp=122\u2013124, 131\u2013135}}\n\n[[Harold Jenkins (Shakespeare scholar)|Harold Jenkins]] criticised the idea of any direct personal satire as \"unlikely\" and \"uncharacteristic of Shakespeare\",{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|p=142}} while [[George Richard Hibbard|G. R. Hibbard]] hypothesized that differences in names (Corambis/Polonius; Montano/Raynoldo) between the [[Hamlet Q1|first quarto]] and subsequent editions might reflect a desire not to offend scholars at Oxford University, since Polonius was close to the Latin name for [[Robert Pullen]], founder of Oxford University, and Reynaldo too close for safety to [[John Rainolds]], the President of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]].{{sfn|Hibbard|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n==Shakespeare's son==\nMost scholars, including Harold Bloom,{{sfn|Bloom|2001|pp=389ff}} dismiss the idea that ''Hamlet'' is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, [[Hamnet Shakespeare]], who died at age eleven.

The generic \"hero-as-fool\" story is so old and is expressed in the literature of so many cultures that scholars have hypothesized that it may be [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] in origin. A [[Amleth|Scandinavian version]] of the story of Hamlet (called Amleth or Aml\u00f3\u00f0i, which means \"mad\" or \"not sane\" in [[Old Norse]]) was put into writing around 1200 [[AD]] by Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in his work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (the first full history of Denmark). It is this work Shakespeare borrowed from to create ''[[Hamlet]]''. Similar accounts are found in the Icelandic ''[[Hr\u00f3lfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrolf Kraki]]'' and the Roman legend of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], both of which feature heroes who pretend to be insane in order to get revenge. A reasonably accurate version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest]] in his ''Histoires Tragiques''. Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's [[melancholia|melancholy]].\n\nAfter this point, the ancestry of Shakespeare's version of ''Hamlet'' becomes more difficult to trace. Many literary scholars believe that Shakespeare's main source was an earlier play\u2014now lost\u2014known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''. Possibly written by [[Thomas Kyd]], the ''Ur-Hamlet'' would have been in performance by 1589 and was seemingly the first to include a ghost in the story. Using the few comments available from theatre-enthusiasts at the time, scholars have attempted to trace exactly where the ''Ur-Hamlet'' might have ended and the play popular today begins. A few scholars have suggested that the ''Ur-Hamlet'' is an early draft of Shakespeare's, rather than the work of Kyd. Regardless of the mysteries surrounding the ''Ur-Hamlet'', though, several elements of the story changed. Unlike earlier versions, Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' does not feature an omniscient narrator of events and [[Prince Hamlet]] does not appear to have a complete plan of action. The play's setting in Elsinore also differs from legendary versions.\n\n==Scandinavian legend==\n{{Main article|Amleth}}\nThe story of the prince who plots revenge on his uncle (the current king) for killing his father (the former king) is an old one. Many of the story elements\u2014the prince feigning madness and his testing by a young woman, the prince talking to his mother and her hasty marriage to the usurper, the prince killing a hidden spy and substituting the execution of two retainers for his own\u2014are found in a medieval tale by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] called ''Vita Amlethi'' (part of his larger Latin work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''), which was written around 1200 AD.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=1\u20135}} Older written and oral traditions from various cultures may have influenced Saxo's work. Amleth (as Hamlet is called in Saxo's version) probably derived from an oral tale told throughout [[Scandinavia]]. Parallels can be found with [[Icelanders|Icelandic]] legend, though no written version of the original Icelandic tale survives from before the 16th century. [[Torfaeus]], a scholar in 17th-century Iceland, made the connection between Saxo's Amleth and local oral tradition about a Prince Ambales (''[[Aml\u00f3\u00f0i]]'').{{efn|The etymology of the name is unknown, and there are various suggestions. In 1948, Ferdinand Holthausen suggested it is based on the \"fool, simpleton\" interpretation of the name, composing the name from Old Norse ''ama'' \"to vex, annoy, molest\" and ''[[\u00f3\u00f0r]]'' \"fierceness, madness\" (also in the theonym ''[[Odin]]'').{{sfn|Holthausen|1948}} A more recent suggestion, by L. A. Collinson in ''[[The Review of English Studies]]'', is based on the kenning associating ''Aml\u00f3\u00f0i'' with the mythological mill ''grotti'', and derives it from the Old Irish name ''Admlithi'' \"great-grinding\", attested in  ''[[Togail Bruidne D\u00e1 Derga]]''.{{sfn|Collinson|2011}}}}\nTorfaeus dismissed the local tradition as \"an old wive's tale\" due to its incorporation of fairy-tale elements and quasi-historical legend and Torfaeus' own confusion about the hero's country of origin (not recognizing [[Cimbrian Peninsula|Cimbria]] as a name for Denmark).{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|p=7}}{{sfn|Gollancz|1898|pp=3\u201313}}\n\nSimilarities include the prince's feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king's counsellor in his mother's bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=5\u201315}}\n\nThe original ''[[Aml\u00f3\u00f0i]]'' story has been surmised to be derived from a \"10th-century\"{{sfn|Harrison|Harrison|1912|p=184}} Old Icelandic poem, but no such poem is known.\n\nThe \"hero as fool\" story has many parallels (Roman, Spanish, Scandinavian and Arabic) and can be classified as a universal, or at least common [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]], narrative topos.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=36\u201337}}\n\n[[File:Kyd, Spanish Tragedy.jpg|thumb|''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', by Thomas Kyd. This popular [[Revenge play|revenge tragedy]] may have influenced ''Hamlet''. Its author may have also written the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''.]]\n\n==Influences on Saxo Grammaticus==\nThe two most popular candidates for written works that may have influenced Saxo, however, are the anonymous Scandinavian ''[[Hr\u00f3lfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrolf Kraki]]'' and the Roman legend of Brutus, which is recorded in two separate Latin works. In ''Saga of Hrolf Kraki'', the murdered king has two sons\u2014[[Hro\u00f0gar|Hroar]] and [[Halga|Helgi]]\u2014who assume the names of Ham and Hr\u00e1ni for concealment. They spend most of the story in disguise, rather than feigning madness, though Ham does act childishly at one point to deflect suspicion. The sequence of events differs from Shakespeare's as well.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=16\u201325}}\n\nIn contrast, the Roman story of Brutus focuses on feigned madness. Its hero, Lucius ('shining, light'), changes his name and persona to Brutus ('dull, stupid'), playing the role to avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family's killer, King Tarquinius. In addition to writing in the Latin language of the Romans, Saxo adjusted the story to reflect classical Roman concepts of virtue and heroism.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=25\u201337}} A reasonably accurate version of Saxo's story was translated into French in 1570 by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest]] in his ''Histoires Tragiques''.{{sfn|Edwards|1985|pp=1\u20132}} Belleforest embellished Saxo's text substantially, almost doubling its length, and introduced the hero's [[melancholia|melancholy]].{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=66\u201367}}\n\n==The ''Ur-Hamlet''==\n{{Main article|Ur-Hamlet}}\nShakespeare's main source is believed to be an earlier play\u2014now lost\u2014known today as the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]''. Possibly written by [[Thomas Kyd]], the ''Ur-Hamlet'' would have been in performance by 1589, and was seemingly the first to include a ghost in the story.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=82\u201385}} Shakespeare's company, [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|the Chamberlain's Men]], may have purchased that play and performed a version, which Shakespeare reworked, for some time.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|p=67}} Since no copy of the ''Ur-Hamlet'' has survived, it is impossible to compare its language and style with the known works of any candidate for its authorship. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of ''Hamlet'' by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea\u2014placing ''Hamlet'' far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development\u2014has attracted some support, though others dismiss it as speculation.{{efn|In his 1936 book ''The Problem of Hamlet: A Solution'' Andrew Cairncross asserted that the ''Hamlet'' referred to in 1589 was written by Shakespeare;{{sfn|Cairncross|1975}} Peter Alexander,{{sfn|Alexander|1964}} [[Eric Sams]]{{sfn|Jackson|1991|p=267}} and, more recently, [[Harold Bloom]]{{sfn|Bloom|2001|pp=xiii, 383}}{{sfn|Bloom|2003|p=154}} have agreed. However Harold Jenkins, the editor of the second series Arden edition of the play, considers that there are not grounds for thinking that the Ur-Hamlet is an early work by Shakespeare, which he then rewrote.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|p=84 n4}}}} [[Francis Meres]]'s ''Palladis Tamia'' (published in 1598, probably October) provides a list of twelve named Shakespeare plays, but ''Hamlet'' is not among them. This is not conclusive, however, as other then-extant Shakespeare plays were not on Meres' list either.\n\nThe upshot is that scholars cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the ''Ur-Hamlet'' (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, and how much from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version (although its Latin text was widely available at the time). However, elements of Belleforest's version do appear in Shakespeare's play but are not in Saxo's story, so whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly or through the ''Ur-Hamlet'' remains unclear.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=66\u201368}}\n\nIt is clear, though, that several elements did change somewhere between Belleforest's and Shakespeare's versions. For one, unlike Saxo and Belleforest, Shakespeare's play has no all-knowing narrator, thus inviting the audience to draw their own conclusions about the motives of its characters. And the traditional story takes place across several years, while Shakespeare's covers a few weeks. Belleforest's version details Hamlet's plan for revenge, while in Shakespeare's play Hamlet has no apparent plan.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=69\u201372}} Shakespeare also adds some elements that locate the action in 15th-century Christian Denmark instead of a medieval pagan setting. [[Elsinore]], for example, would have been familiar to [[Elizabethan]] England, as a new castle had been built recently there, and [[University of Wittenberg#History|Wittenberg]], Hamlet's university, was widely known for its [[Protestant]] teachings.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|pp=83\u201385}} Other elements of Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'' absent in medieval versions include the secrecy that surrounds the old king's murder, the inclusion of [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]] and [[Fortinbras]] (who offer parallels to Hamlet<!-- clarify parallel -->), the testing of the king via a play, and Hamlet's death at the moment he gains his revenge.{{sfn|Edwards|1985|p=2}}{{efn|Harold Jenkins, in the [[Arden Shakespeare]] second series edition of ''Hamlet'', includes a detailed discussion of many possible influences that may have found their way into the play.{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|pp=82\u2013122}}}}\n\n==Elizabethan court==\nFor more than a century, Shakespearean scholars have identified several of the play's major characters with specific members of the Elizabethan court. In 1869, [[George Russell French]] theorized that ''Hamlet''{{'}}s [[Polonius]] might have been inspired by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]] (Lord Burghley)\u2014Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&nbsp;I]].{{sfn|French|1975|p=301}} French also speculated that the characters of Polonius's children, [[Ophelia]] and [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]], represented two of Burghley's children, Anne and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]].{{sfn|French|1975|pp=299\u2013310}} In 1930, [[E. K. Chambers]] suggested that Polonius's advice to Laertes may have echoed Burghley's to his son Robert,{{sfn|Chambers|1930|p=418}} and in 1932, [[John Dover Wilson]] commented \"the figure of Polonius is almost without doubt intended as a caricature of Burleigh, who died on 4 August 1598\".{{sfn|Wilson|1932|p=104}} In 1963, [[A. L. Rowse]] said that Polonius's tedious verbosity might have resembled Burghley's,{{sfn|Rowse|1995|p=323}} and in 1964, Hurstfield wrote that \"[t]he governing classes were both paternalistic and patronizing; and nowhere is this attitude better displayed than in the advice which that archetype of elder statesmen William Cecil, Lord Burghley\u2014Shakespeare's Polonius\u2014prepared for his son\".{{sfn|Hurstfield|1964|pp=27\u201347}}\n\nLilian Winstanley thought the name Corambis (Polonius' name in the 1st Quarto) suggested Burghley,{{sfn|Winstanley|1921|p=114}} though Krystyna Kujawinska Courtney has pointed out that the name \"Corambis\" translates to \"reheated cabbage\" in Latin, i.e. \"a boring old man\".{{sfn|Courtney|2003|p=2}}\n\nIn 1921, Winstanley claimed \"absolute\" certainty that \"the historical analogues exist; that they are important, numerous, detailed and undeniable\" and that \"Shakespeare is using a large element of contemporary history in ''Hamlet''.\"{{sfn|Winstanley|1921|pp=165\u2013166}} She compared Hamlet with both the Earl of Essex and James I. She also identified Polonius with Burghley parallels, and noted a \"curious parallel\" in the relationship between Ophelia and Hamlet with that of Burghley's daughter, Anne Cecil, and her husband, [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]]. Winstanley noted similar parallels in the relationship of Elizabeth Vernon and [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]].{{sfn|Winstanley|1921|pp=122\u2013124, 131\u2013135}}\n\n[[Harold Jenkins (Shakespeare scholar)|Harold Jenkins]] criticised the idea of any direct personal satire as \"unlikely\" and \"uncharacteristic of Shakespeare\",{{sfn|Jenkins|1982|p=142}} while G. R. Hibbard hypothesized that differences in names (Corambis/Polonius; Montano/Raynoldo) between the [[Hamlet Q1|first quarto]] and subsequent editions might reflect a desire not to offend scholars at Oxford University, since Polonius was close to the Latin name for [[Robert Pullen]], founder of Oxford University, and Reynaldo too close for safety to [[John Rainolds]], the President of [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]].{{sfn|Hibbard|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n==Shakespeare's son==\nMost scholars, including Harold Bloom,{{sfn|Bloom|2001|pp=389ff}} dismiss the idea that ''Hamlet'' is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, [[Hamnet Shakespeare]], who died at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that ''Hamlet'' is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time.{{sfn|Saxo|Hansen|1983|p=6}} However, [[Stephen Greenblatt]] has argued that the coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart of the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbor after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2004a|p=311}}{{sfn|Greenblatt|2004b}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Editions of ''Hamlet''===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book\n  |title = Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\n  |editor1-last = Edwards\n  |editor1-first = Phillip\n  |last = Shakespeare\n  |first = William\n  |authorlink = William Shakespeare\n  |series = [[New Cambridge Shakespeare]]\n  |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n  |location = Cambridge\n  |year = 1985\n  |isbn = 0-19-283416-9\n  |ref = {{harvid|Edwards|1985}}\n  |display-authors = 0\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/hamletsh00shak\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |title = Hamlet\n  |editor1-last = Hibbard\n  |editor1-first = G.

VLJs are considered the lightest [[business jet]]s and are approved for single-pilot operation.\n\n==History==\nThe first jet-powered civil aircraft, the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], has been retroactively suggested as being the first VLJ, as it seats four with a single pilot and is smaller than modern VLJs. However, the production MS.760 differs from modern business jets in having a sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] for cabin access rather than a door; a six-seat version with an enclosed cabin and a conventional door\u2014closer in configuration to modern VLJs\u2014was canceled after a single prototype was built.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=International Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=AOPA2006>{{cite web |url=https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2006/may/pilot/turbine-pilot-(4) |title=Turbine Pilot: VLJ Deja Vu |last=Olcott |first=John W. |date=5 May 2006 |website=aopa.org |publisher=[[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nTwo [[Cessna]] aircraft of the 1950s and 1960s would have met the definition of a VLJ if built. The first was the 407, a four-seat civil version of the [[Cessna T-37 Tweet|T-37]] [[jet trainer]] proposed in 1959; however, the 407 never progressed past the mock-up stage due to insufficient customer interest. The second was the Fanjet 500, which had an MTOW of {{convert|9500|lb|kg|-1}} and a single pilot as originally envisioned in 1968; however, as the aircraft evolved into the [[Cessna Citation I]], the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] demanded a second pilot and various design changes resulting in an MTOW of {{convert|10350|lb|kg|-1}}.<ref name=AOPA2006/>\n\nOther attempts to create small jet aircraft in this class in the 1970s and 1980s were the [[Gulfstream Peregrine|Gulfstream Aerospace FanJet 1500]]<ref name=AOPA2006/> and the [[CMC Leopard]].\n\nAfter a flurry of interest in the [[Small Aircraft Transportation System|Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS)]] and [[air taxi]] markets in the early 2000s, the VLJ sector underwent significant expansion. Several new designs were produced, such as the [[Embraer Phenom 100]], the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]], and the [[Eclipse 500]]. However, following the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]] the air taxi market underperformed expectations, and both [[Eclipse Aviation]] and air taxi firm [[DayJet]] collapsed. In December 2010, AvWeb's Paul Bertorelli explained that the term ''very light jet'' has lost favor in the aviation industry. \"Personal jet is the description du jour. You don't hear the term VLJ\u2014very light jet\u2014much anymore and some people in the industry tell me they think it's because that term was too tightly coupled to Eclipse, a failure that the remaining players want to, understandably, distance themselves from.\"<ref name=\"AvWeb10Dec10\" />\n\nSingle-engine designs were popular in the mid-2000s, before the [[global financial crisis]] diminished the market appeal of the category. Most of those programs, which included the [[Piper Altaire]], [[Diamond D-Jet]], [[Eclipse 400]] and [[VisionAire Vantage]], were all shelved and the only maintained aircraft are the [[Cirrus Vision SF50]], which is now [[type certification|type certified]] and in production, and the [[Stratos 714]], which expects certification in 2019.

VLJs are considered the lightest [[business jet]]s and are approved for single-pilot operation.\n\n==History==\nThe first jet-powered civil aircraft, the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], has been retroactively suggested as being the first VLJ, as it seats four with a single pilot and is smaller than modern VLJs. However, the production MS.760 differs from modern business jets in having a sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] for cabin access rather than a door; a six-seat version with an enclosed cabin and a conventional door\u2014closer in configuration to modern VLJs\u2014was canceled after a single prototype was built.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=International Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref><ref name=AOPA2006>{{cite web |url=https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2006/may/pilot/turbine-pilot-(4) |title=Turbine Pilot: VLJ Deja Vu |last=Olcott |first=John W. |date=5 May 2006 |website=aopa.org |publisher=[[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] |access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nTwo [[Cessna]] aircraft the 1950s and 1960s would have met the definition of the VLJ if built. The first was the 407, a four-seat civil version of the [[Cessna T-37 Tweet|T-37]] [[jet trainer]] proposed in 1959; however, the 407 never progressed past the mock-up stage due to insufficient customer interest. The second was the Fanjet 500, which had an MTOW of {{convert|9500|lb|kg|-1}} and a single pilot as originally envisioned in 1968; however, as the aircraft evolved into the [[Cessna Citation I]], the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] demanded a second pilot and various design changes resulting in an MTOW of {{convert|10350|lb|kg|-1}}.<ref name=AOPA2006/>\n\nOther attempts to create small jet aircraft in this class in the 1970s and 1980s were the [[Gulfstream Peregrine|Gulfstream Aerospace FanJet 1500]]<ref name=AOPA2006/> and the [[CMC Leopard]].\n\nAfter a flurry of interest in the [[Small Aircraft Transportation System|Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS)]] and [[air taxi]] markets in the early 2000s, the VLJ sector underwent significant expansion. Several new designs were produced, such as the [[Embraer Phenom 100]], the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]], and the [[Eclipse 500]]. However, following the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]] the air taxi market underperformed expectations, and both [[Eclipse Aviation]] and air taxi firm [[DayJet]] collapsed. In December 2010, AvWeb's Paul Bertorelli explained that the term ''very light jet'' has lost favor in the aviation industry. \"Personal jet is the description du jour. You don't hear the term VLJ\u2014very light jet\u2014much anymore and some people in the industry tell me they think it's because that term was too tightly coupled to Eclipse, a failure that the remaining players want to, understandably, distance themselves from.\"<ref name=\"AvWeb10Dec10\" />\n\nSingle-engine designs were popular in the mid-2000s, before the [[global financial crisis]] diminished the market appeal of the category. Most of those programs, which included the [[Piper Altaire]], [[Diamond D-Jet]], [[Eclipse 400]] and [[VisionAire Vantage]], were all shelved and the only maintained aircraft are the [[Cirrus Vision SF50]], which is now [[type certification|type certified]] and in production, and the [[Stratos 714]], which expects certification in 2019. They are expected to compete with single [[turboprop]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-getting-personal-with-single-engined-jets-427139/ |title= Getting personal with single-engined jets |work= Flight Global |date= 21 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nTwo VLJs in history have won the [[Collier Trophy]], known as the most prestigious aerospace engineering award in the United States \u2014 the Eclipse 500 (in 2006) and the Cirrus Vision Jet (in 2018).<ref>{{cite news | url=https://naa.aero/awards/awards-and-trophies/collier-trophy |title= Collier Trophy |work= National Aeronautic Association |accessdate= 11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Target market==\nVLJs are intended to have lower operating costs than conventional jets, and to be able to operate from runways as short as {{convert|3000|ft|m}}, either for personal use or in point-to-point [[air taxi]] service.<ref>{{cite news | publisher=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] | work=Aerospace America | url=http://www.aiaa.org/aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_May06_CRO.pdf | first=John | last=Croft | title=Very Light Jets: Boom or Blip | date=May 2006 | accessdate=2007-02-27 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202143531/https://www.aiaa.org/aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_May06_CRO.pdf | archive-date=2006-12-02 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Aboulafia | url=http://www.richardaboulafia.com/shownote.asp?id=211 | title=March 2006 Newsletter | date=2006-03-13 | accessdate=2007-02-27}}</ref> In the [[United States]], the [[Small Aircraft Transportation System]] is aimed at providing air service to areas ignored by [[airline]]s.\n\n[[Florida]]-based air taxi provider [[DayJet]], which on October 3, 2007 began its Eclipse 500 service, planned to operate more than 1,000 of the VLJs within five years,<ref name=hgj20071102/> and had stated in mid-2007 that it planned to operate 300 Eclipse 500s serving 40 regional airports in the [[Southeastern United States]] by the end of 2008.<ref name=pm200706/>  DayJet ceased operations on September 19, 2008.<ref name=hgj20071102>{{cite news | title=Very Light Jets Enter Fractional Market | publisher=[[Halogen Guides Jets]] | date=2007-11-02 | accessdate=2007-11-13 | url=http://jets.halogenguides.com/articles/885-very-light-jets-enter-fractional-markets }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Cirrus Vision SF50 Jet, EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, July 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cirrus Vision SF50]] is the only single-engine VLJ currently certified with the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]]]\n\nMany models are under development or awaiting certification, while others have failed.<ref>Cox, Bill. \"[http://www.planeandpilotmag.com/aircraft/best-buys/the-day-of-the-personal-jet.html?tmpl=component&print=1 The Day Of The Personal Jet]\" ''Plane & Pilot Magazine'', 1 May 2008.

Since at least [[John L. Sullivan]], in the late 19th century, there have been world champions in [[professional boxing]]. The first modern organization to award a world title was the [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA), then known as the National Boxing Association (NBA), when it sanctioned its first title fight in 1921 between [[Jack Dempsey]] and [[Georges Carpentier]] for the world heavyweight championship.\n\nThere are now four major sanctioning bodies in professional boxing. The official rules and regulations of the World Boxing Association (WBA),<ref name=\"WBA Rules\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wbanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WBA-Rules-adopted-in-Bulgaria-6-11-15.pdf\n|title=Rules of World Boxing Association\n|publisher=World Boxing Association\n|format=PDF\n|accessdate=June 22, 2016\n}}</ref> [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wbcboxing.com/downloads/NEW_RULES_AND_REGULATIONS_WEB_FINAL_2009.pdf\n|title=World Boxing Council Rules and Regulations\n|publisher=World Boxing Council\n|format=PDF\n|accessdate=January 6, 2011\n}}</ref> [[International Boxing Federation]] (IBF),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ibf-usba-boxing.com/userfiles/File/RulesGoverningChampionshipContestsEffectiveSeptember1_2006with10_21_10amendments.pdf\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414170152/http://www.ibf-usba-boxing.com/userfiles/File/RulesGoverningChampionshipContestsEffectiveSeptember1_2006with10_21_10amendments.pdf\n|archivedate=April 14, 2015\n|title=IBF/USBA Rules Governing Championship Contests\n|publisher=International Boxing Federation\n|format=PDF\n|accessdate=January 18, 2011\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> and [[World Boxing Organization]] (WBO)<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wboboxing.com/regulations/\n|title=World Boxing Organization Regulations of World Championship Contests\n|publisher=World Boxing Organization\n|accessdate=March 2, 2009\n}}</ref> all recognize each other in their rankings and title unification rules. Each of these organizations sanction and regulate championship bouts and award world titles. American boxing magazine ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' began awarding world titles in 1922.\n\nThere are seventeen [[weight class (boxing)|weight divisions]]. To compete in a division, a boxer's weight must not exceed the upper limit. [[Manny Pacquiao]] has won [[octuple champion|world championships in eight different weight divisions]], more than any other boxer. The Klitschko brothers, [[Vitali Klitschko|Vitali]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko|Wladimir]], held all four major titles in the heavyweight division from 2011 to 2013; they were the first brothers to hold versions of the heavyweight championship at the same time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vitali Klitschko impressive in comeback victory |first=Ron |last=Lewis |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/boxing/article4931508.ece |newspaper=The Times|date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref>  [[Joe Louis]] holds the record of being the longest reigning world champion in boxing.<ref>[https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/reign-longest-(boxing)/ Longest reigning boxing world champion]</ref>\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Championships==\nWhen a champion, for reasons beyond his control such as an illness or injury, is unable to defend his title within the normal mandatory time, the sanctioning bodies may order an interim title bout and award the winner an [[interim championship]]. The WBA and WBC have also changed the status of their inactive champions to a \"Champion in Recess\" or \"Champion Emeritus\" status, on occasion.\n\n===World Boxing Association===\nThe [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA) was founded in 1921 as the National Boxing Association (NBA), a national regulating body of the United States. On August 23, 1962, the NBA became the WBA, which today has its head office in [[Panama]].<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://www.wbaboxing.com/wba-history/world-boxing-association-history#.V2qaz8tCTJA\n|title=World Boxing Association History\n|publisher=[[World Boxing Association]]\n|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}</ref> According to WBA championship rules, when a champion also holds a title of one of the other three major sanctioning bodies in an equivalent weight division, that boxer is granted a special recognition of \"[[WBA (Unified)|Unified Champion]]\", and is given more time between mandatory title defences. The WBA Championships Committee and President may also designate a champion as a \"[[WBA (Super)|Super Champion]]\" or \"[[WBA (Undisputed)|Undisputed Champion]]\" in exceptional circumstances;<ref name=\"WBA Rules\"/> the standard WBA title is then vacated and contested between WBA-ranked contenders. When a WBA \"[[WBA (Regular)|Regular Champion]]\" makes between five and ten successful defences, he may be granted the WBA \"Super\" title upon discretion of a vote of the WBA's board of governors.\n\n===World Boxing Council===\nThe [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) was founded in Mexico City, Mexico on February 14, 1963 in order to establish an international regulating body.<ref name=\"Permanent Medical Research Program\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=125&docTipo=4\n|title=World Boxing Council\n|publisher=[[World Boxing Council]]\n|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003523/http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=125&docTipo=4\n|archivedate=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=September 30, 2013\n}}</ref> The WBC established many of today's safety measures in boxing, such as the [[standing eight count]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=123&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925051631/http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm\n |archivedate=September 25, 2007\n |title=Rules that have changed the History of Boxing\n |publisher=[[World Boxing Council]]\n |url-status=dead\n |accessdate=September 30, 2013\n |df=\n}}</ref> a limit of 12 rounds instead of 15, and additional weight divisions.

In its early years the WBO's titles were not widely recognized. By 2012 when the Japan Boxing Commission officially recognized the governing body, it had gained similar status to the other three major sanctioning bodies. Its [[motto]] is \"dignity, democracy, honesty.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wboboxing.com/\n|title=WBO logo\n|publisher=[[World Boxing Organization]]\n|accessdate=November 6, 2011\n}}</ref> When a WBO champion has reached \"preeminent status\", the WBO's Executive Committee may designate him as a \"[[WBO Super|Super Champion]]\".<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wboboxing.com/regulations/\n|title=WBO Regulations of World Championship Contests\n|at=Section 14\n|publisher=[[World Boxing Organization]]\n|format=PDF\n}}</ref> However, this is only an honorary title and not the same as the WBA's policy of having separate \"Super\" and \"Regular\" champions. A WBO \"Super Champion\" cannot win or lose that recognition in the ring; it is merely awarded by the WBO.\n\n===''The Ring''===\nThe boxing magazine ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' awards its own belts. The original title sequence began from the magazine's first publication in the 1920s until its titles were placed on hiatus in 1989, continuing as late as 1992 in some divisions. When ''The Ring'' started awarding titles again in 2001, it did not calculate retrospective lineages to fill in the gap years, instead nominating a new champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxboxing.com/Kim/kim092602.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015134801/http://www.maxboxing.com/Kim/kim092602.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 15, 2004|title=Boxing News : The Disputed Light Heavyweight Champion of the World|date=October 15, 2004|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}</ref> Cyber Boxing Zone, a website dedicated to tracking [[lineal championship|lineal champions]], commented in 2004 that \"''The Ring'' has forfeited its credibility by pulling names out of its ass to name fighters as champions\".<ref name=\"w0804\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/w0804-lineal.html|title=What the CBZ Means When it Refers to \"Lineal Championships\"|last=DeLisa|first=Mike|date=August 2004|work=The CBZ Journal|publisher=cyberboxingzone|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, ''The Ring'' was acquired by the owners of fight promoter [[Golden Boy Promotions]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenboypromotions.com/media/2007/sept/9.12.07_mag.htm |title=Golden Boy Enterprises' Subsidiary, Sports and Entertainment Publications, LLC, Acquires The Ring Magazine, KO, World Boxing and Pro Wrestling Illustrated |date=September 12, 2007 |publisher=[[Golden Boy Promotions]] |accessdate=November 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119150246/http://www.goldenboypromotions.com/media/2007/sept/9.12.07_mag.htm |archivedate=November 19, 2008 |df= }}</ref> which has publicized ''The Ring'''s world championships when they are at stake in fights it promotes (such as [[Joe Calzaghe vs. Roy Jones Jr.]] in 2008).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-178384366.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022090855/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-178384366.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 22, 2012|title=Calzaghe claim far from undisputed|last=Kimball|first=George|date= April 27, 2008|newspaper=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=November 14, 2008}}</ref> Since 2012, to reduce the number of vacant titles, ''The Ring'' allows fights between a number one or two contender; or alternatively a number three, four, or five contender to fill a vacant title.

champions'''. Since at least [[John L. Sullivan]], in the late 19th century, there have been world champions in [[professional boxing]]. The first modern organization to award a world title was the [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA), then known as the National Boxing Association (NBA), when it sanctioned its first title fight in 1921 between [[Jack Dempsey]] and [[Georges Carpentier]] for the world heavyweight championship.\n\nThere are now four major sanctioning bodies in professional boxing.

Each of these organizations sanction and regulate championship bouts and award world titles. American boxing magazine ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' began awarding world titles in 1922.\n\nThere are seventeen [[weight class (boxing)|weight divisions]]. To compete in a division, a boxer's weight must not exceed the upper limit. [[Manny Pacquiao]] has won [[octuple champion|world championships in eight different weight divisions]], more than any other boxer. The Klitschko brothers, [[Vitali Klitschko|Vitali]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko|Wladimir]], held all four major titles in the heavyweight division from 2011 to 2013; they were the first brothers to hold versions of the heavyweight championship at the same time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vitali Klitschko impressive in comeback victory |first=Ron |last=Lewis |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/boxing/article4931508.ece |newspaper=The Times|date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref>  [[Joe Louis]] holds the record of being the longest reigning world champion in boxing.<ref>[https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/reign-longest-(boxing)/ Longest reigning boxing world champion]</ref>\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Championships==\nWhen a champion, for reasons beyond his control such as an illness or injury, is unable to defend his title within the normal mandatory time, the sanctioning bodies may order an interim title bout and award the winner an [[interim championship]]. The WBA and WBC have also changed the status of their inactive champions to a \"Champion in Recess\" or \"Champion Emeritus\" status, on occasion.\n\n===World Boxing Association===\nThe [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA) was founded in 1921 as the National Boxing Association (NBA), a national regulating body of the United States. On August 23, 1962, the NBA became the WBA, which today has its head office in [[Panama]].<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://www.wbaboxing.com/wba-history/world-boxing-association-history#.V2qaz8tCTJA\n|title=World Boxing Association History\n|publisher=[[World Boxing Association]]\n|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}</ref> According to WBA championship rules, when a champion also holds a title of one of the other three major sanctioning bodies in an equivalent weight division, that boxer is granted a special recognition of \"[[WBA (Unified)|Unified Champion]]\", and is given more time between mandatory title defences. The WBA Championships Committee and President may also designate a champion as a \"[[WBA (Super)|Super Champion]]\" or \"[[WBA (Undisputed)|Undisputed Champion]]\" in exceptional circumstances;<ref name=\"WBA Rules\"/> the standard WBA title is then vacated and contested between WBA-ranked contenders. When a WBA \"[[WBA (Regular)|Regular Champion]]\" makes between five and ten successful defences, he may be granted the WBA \"Super\" title upon discretion of a vote of the WBA's board of governors.\n\n===World Boxing Council===\nThe [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) was founded in Mexico City, Mexico on February 14, 1963 in order to establish an international regulating body.<ref name=\"Permanent Medical Research Program\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=125&docTipo=4\n|title=World Boxing Council\n|publisher=[[World Boxing Council]]\n|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003523/http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=125&docTipo=4\n|archivedate=September 27, 2007 |accessdate=September 30, 2013\n}}</ref> The WBC established many of today's safety measures in boxing, such as the [[standing eight count]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=123&docTipo=4&orderby=docid&sortby=ASC\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925051631/http://www.wbcboxing.com/WBCboxing/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm\n |archivedate=September 25, 2007\n |title=Rules that have changed the History of Boxing\n |publisher=[[World Boxing Council]]\n |url-status=dead\n |accessdate=September 30, 2013\n |df=\n}}</ref> a limit of 12 rounds instead of 15, and additional weight divisions. More information about the WBC's sub-world titles including \"Silver\", \"Diamond\", \"Emeritus\", \"Franchise\", \"Honorary\", and \"Supreme Champion\" can be read at the WBC article.\n\n===International Boxing Federation===\nThe [[International Boxing Federation]] (IBF) originated in September 1976 as the United States Boxing Association (USBA) when American members of the WBA withdrew in order to legitimize boxing in the United States with \"unbiased\" ratings.<ref name=\"ibf\">{{cite web\n |url=http://ibf-usba-boxing.com/history.html\n |title=History of the IBF\n |date=December 4, 2000\n |publisher=[[International Boxing Federation]]\n |accessdate=June 6, 2006\n |archivedate=December 4, 2000\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001204194900/http://ibf-usba-boxing.com/history.html\n |url-status=dead\n |df=\n}}</ref> In April 1983, the organization established an international division that was known as the United States Boxing Association-International (USBA-I).<ref name=\"ibf\" /> In May 1984, the [[New Jersey]]-based USBA-I was renamed and became the IBF.<ref name=\"ibf\" />\n\n===World Boxing Organization===\nThe [[World Boxing Organization]] (WBO) was founded in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] (which is a self-governing commonwealth of the United States) in 1988. In its early years the WBO's titles were not widely recognized. By 2012 when the Japan Boxing Commission officially recognized the governing body, it had gained similar status to the other three major sanctioning bodies. Its [[motto]] is \"dignity, democracy, honesty.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wboboxing.com/\n|title=WBO logo\n|publisher=[[World Boxing Organization]]\n|accessdate=November 6, 2011\n}}</ref> When a WBO champion has reached \"preeminent status\", the WBO's Executive Committee may designate him as a \"[[WBO Super|Super Champion]]\".<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wboboxing.com/regulations/\n|title=WBO Regulations of World Championship Contests\n|at=Section 14\n|publisher=[[World Boxing Organization]]\n|format=PDF\n}}</ref> However, this is only an honorary title and not the same as the WBA's policy of having separate \"Super\" and \"Regular\" champions. A WBO \"Super Champion\" cannot win or lose that recognition in the ring; it is merely awarded by the WBO.\n\n===''The Ring''===\nThe boxing magazine ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' awards its own belts. The original title sequence began from the magazine's first publication in the 1920s until its titles were placed on hiatus in 1989, continuing as late as 1992 in some divisions. When ''The Ring'' started awarding titles again in 2001, it did not calculate retrospective lineages to fill in the gap years, instead nominating a new champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maxboxing.com/Kim/kim092602.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015134801/http://www.maxboxing.com/Kim/kim092602.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 15, 2004|title=Boxing News : The Disputed Light Heavyweight Champion of the World|date=October 15, 2004|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}</ref> Cyber Boxing Zone, a website dedicated to tracking [[lineal championship|lineal champions]], commented in 2004 that \"''The Ring'' has forfeited its credibility by pulling names out of its ass to name fighters as champions\".<ref name=\"w0804\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/w0804-lineal.html|title=What the CBZ Means When it Refers to \"Lineal Championships\"|last=DeLisa|first=Mike|date=August 2004|work=The CBZ Journal|publisher=cyberboxingzone|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, ''The Ring'' was acquired by the owners of fight promoter [[Golden Boy Promotions]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenboypromotions.com/media/2007/sept/9.12.07_mag.htm |title=Golden Boy Enterprises' Subsidiary, Sports and Entertainment Publications, LLC, Acquires The Ring Magazine, KO, World Boxing and Pro Wrestling Illustrated |date=September 12, 2007 |publisher=[[Golden Boy Promotions]] |accessdate=November 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119150246/http://www.goldenboypromotions.com/media/2007/sept/9.12.07_mag.htm |archivedate=November 19, 2008 |df= }}</ref> which has publicized ''The Ring'''s world championships when they are at stake in fights it promotes (such as [[Joe Calzaghe vs. Roy Jones Jr.]] in 2008).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-178384366.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022090855/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-178384366.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 22, 2012|title=Calzaghe claim far from undisputed|last=Kimball|first=George|date= April 27, 2008|newspaper=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=November 14, 2008}}</ref> Since 2012, to reduce the number of vacant titles, ''The Ring'' allows fights between a number one or two contender; or alternatively a number three, four, or five contender to fill a vacant title.
