{"title_page": "Temple Drake", "text_new": "'''Temple Drake''' is a fictional character created by [[William Faulkner]].

The play ''[[Requiem for a Nun (play)|Requiem for a Nun]]'' and the films ''[[The Story of Temple Drake]]'' and ''[[Sanctuary (1961 film)|Sanctuary]]'' also feature the character.

Corrupted by her experience in a house of prostitution, she lies in a court, resulting in an innocent man being lynched for a murder. In the second novel, she plans on leaving her family and going back to a criminal lifestyle until her maid kills her child to return her mind to clarity.

His seemingly fragile appearance earned him many epithets, including 'the Bionic Bantam' and 'the Merthyr Matchstick'. He began boxing at the age of eight and undertook a long amateur career, competing in more than 120 fights and representing Wales. He turned professional in September 1976 at the age of 20, winning his debut bout against George Sutton. Owen would beat Sutton again in his sixth professional fight to win his first title, the vacant Welsh bantamweight championship.\n \nThree further victories led Owen to challenge for the British bantamweight championship in only his tenth professional fight. He defeated champion [[Paddy Maguire (boxer)|Paddy Maguire]] in the eleventh round to win the title, becoming the first Welshman in more than 60 years to hold the belt. Owen recorded five further victories, including a defence of his British title against Wayne Evans, before meeting [[Paul Ferreri]] for the Commonwealth bantamweight championship. He defeated the experienced Australian on points to claim the Commonwealth title and challenged [[Juan Francisco Rodr\u00edguez]] for the European title four months later. The fight in [[Almer\u00eda]] was shrouded in controversy and Owen suffered his first defeat in a highly contentious decision.\n\nOwen went on to win seven consecutive bouts in the space of a year to rechallenge Rodriguez again in February 1980 in Wales. He avenged his earlier defeat by defeating Rodriguez on points to win the European title. He challenged [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion [[Lupe Pintor]] for his version of the world bantamweight title on 19 September 1980, losing a torturously difficult contest by way of twelfth round [[knockout]]. Owen never regained consciousness, fell into a coma and died seven weeks later. A statue commemorating his life and career was unveiled in [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in 2002.\n\n==Early life==\nJohnny Owen was born John Richard Owens at [[St Tydfil's Hospital|Gwaunfarren hospital]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil]] on 7 January 1956, the fourth of a family of eight children to working-class parents Dick and Edith Owens (n\u00e9e Hale).<ref name=\"dwb\">{{cite web |url=https://biography.wales/article/s11-OWEN-RIC-1956 |title=Owens, Johnny Richard (Johnny Owen) (1956\u20131980) |publisher=Dictionary of Welsh Biography |last=Williams |first=M. |year=2016 |accessdate=14 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/945c85e9-9269-30ee-8aee-54fbba022f8e |title=Death of the Merthyr Matchstick |publisher=BBC Wales |last=Carradice |first=Phil |date=4 November 2014 |accessdate=14 November 2019}}</ref> He had four brothers, Phillip, Vivian, Kelvin and Dilwyn, and three sisters, Marilyn, Susan and Shereen.<ref name=\"bb2325\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=23\u201325}}</ref> The Owens' family hailed from [[Llanidloes]] but had moved south, settling in the village of Penwaunfawr, on the outskirts of Merthyr Tydfil.

Both sets of Owen's ancestors had moved to the [[South Wales Valleys]] in search of work with increased steel, iron and coal production attracting workers from all over Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=44}}</ref> Owen's parents settled in a rented council house, 12 Heol Bryn Selu on Gellideg housing estate in Merthyr.<ref name=\"dwb\"/><ref name=\"bb2325\"/>\n\nIn his 2006 biography of Owen, Rick Broadbent described an adolescent Owen as \"a sensitive, quiet soul, he was deeply in tune with the moods and needs of those close to him.\"<ref name=\"bb2325\"/> Owen attended the local school, Gellideg Juniors. A mild-mannered child, he was described by his teachers as a \"quiet, hardworking, and very good-natured and well-behaved pupil\".<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=69}}</ref> By the age of seven, he was doing the family's weekly shop and his father later recalled that, when the family was struck down by a flu virus, Owen \"fed us soup and made sure we all had our medicine. He looked after us\"<ref name=\"bb2325\"/> Owen's father had worked as a miner for 13 years but eventually secured a job as a moulder at a boot making factory owned by [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. However, his wife had suffered complications during the birth of the couple's seventh child and her health deteriorated so much that she was hospitalised for an extended period. In his desperation, Owen's father nearly placed his children into care in order to be able to continue working but eventually reversed his decision after receiving assurances over his job safety.<ref name=\"bb2627\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=26\u201327}}</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nOwen began to box at the age of eight, coming to idolise fellow Merthyr born boxer [[Jimmy Wilde]]. Along with his siblings Vivian and Kelvin, in the spring of 1962, he joined the Merthyr Amateur Boxing Club housed in a small hut on nearby Plymouth Street.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=32}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=46}}</ref> Broadbent describes how, by age ten, Owen had developed \"some rudimentary ring raft and already had the boundless energy that would be his signature [...] His punches were light but his effort huge.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=35}}</ref> Owen and the other members of his club travelled the country, competing against other youth clubs from Wales and England. Each year culminated in the Welsh amateur championships, an event which stipulated that a fighter must have gained seven pounds each year they entered. Martyn Galleozzie, who trained alongside Owens, noted how Owen struggled to make the weight increase each year and recalled how Owen was fed cakes and biscuits on the journey to try and make weight. Galleozzie also stated how his mother once sewed lead into the lining of Owen's shorts to make weight.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=58}}</ref>\n\nOwen joined Hoover Amateur Boxing Club soon after, where he began to hone his ring craft with one of his coaches Idris Sutton modelling his fighting style on [[Eddie Thomas (boxer)|Eddie Thomas]]. Owen was a quiet, reserved, friendly character outside the ring and often needed to be coaxed into fighting full force.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=62}}</ref> In his youth, he suffered a loss to [[Charlie Magri]] in a bout in [[Gurnos]].<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=64}}</ref> Owen attended Georgetown Secondary Modern School until the age of 16 when he left to take up a role as a machine operator in a local nuts and bolts manufacturing factory owned by Suko.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=65}}</ref> His exertions in the factory, coupled with his frequent runs in the hills of the South Wales Valleys with his brother Kelvin, led Owen to develop renowned levels of speed and stamina.<ref name=\"bb6869\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=68\u201369}}</ref> His job would however cause him health issues as the [[swarf]] from the factory led to Owen developing infections on occasion. A septic finger injury led to a disappointing defeat to George Sutton in the 1975 Welsh ABA Championships after Owen refused to pull out of the fight.<ref name=\"bb7983\"/>\n\nIn November 1973, Owen was invited to fight Welsh amateur champion Bryn Griffiths after his opponent had fallen ill and pulled out of a bout. Despite the short notice, Owen was confident of his ability to make the step up against Griffiths and was proved right when he recorded a points victory over the champion. Griffiths though would later win a rematch between the pair.<ref name=\"m7172\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=71\u201372}}</ref> \nAt the age of 18, Owen met [[Maurice O'Sullivan (boxer)|Maurice O'Sullivan]] for the 1974 Welsh Amateur Boxing Association youth title in O'Sullivan's hometown of [[Cardiff]] after reaching the final of the competition on 4 April. Despite Owen and his father being convinced of his victory, the judges awarded the fight to O'Sullivan who himself offered the trophy to Owen who refused to accept.<ref name=\"bb6869\"/><ref name=\"m7172\"/> Owen's father Dick later stated that an official from the Welsh ABA approached him after the fight and confessed how the organisation had been under pressure to ensure O'Sullivan's victory in order for him to be selected for the [[1974 British Commonwealth Games]] in New Zealand.<ref name=\"bb6869\"/> Owen's father was becoming an increasing influence on his son's training especially when the two trainers at Owen's gym began suffering ill-health. When Dick himself was unable to take training, Owen would run the sessions at the gym for local fighters.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=75}}</ref>\n\nOwen represented Wales at amateur level several times; his performance in a 1974 tournament between Wales and Scotland saw him draw praise in the local press. After defeating his opponent, John Raeside, in the second round during their bought in [[Pontypool]], he was described as reducing his opponent \"to helplessness with a non-stop two-fisted assault\" and was chosen as the most impressive fighter in the two teams on the night.<ref name=\"m7172\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=77}}</ref> Owen became well known for his seemingly small, thin frame as he grew older; he was chosen to represent Wales against Sweden in February 1975 and was greeted with jeers and laughter when he removed his robe. The nickname \"Matchstick Man\" was coined at the event as Owen comfortably stopped his opponent in the second round.<ref name=\"m7475\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=74\u201375}}</ref> Owen began fighting as a [[bantamweight]] soon after, winning his first bout at the weight against Englishman Allan Smith of the Metropolitan Police Amateur Boxing Club. His physique attracted further attention in November 1975, while representing Wales against an army team, a doctor initially refused to pass him fit to fight believing him to be too frail to box. After his father intervened, the fight went ahead with Owen winning on points.<ref name=\"m7475\"/><ref name=\"bb7983\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=79\u201383}}</ref>\n\nHe enjoyed a lengthy [[amateur boxing]] career taking in some 124 fights. His record was strong but not without blemish, he suffered 18 defeats in his amateur career and won the remaining 106. He represented Wales at amateur level 19 times, suffering defeat on only two occasions.<ref name=\"bb7983\"/> One of his most notable amateur victories came over 1974 Commonwealth Games broze medallist John Bambrick. His amateur career ended on a disappointing note; he suffered defeat in his Welsh senior amateur title fight against Jimmy Evans before losing his last amateur fight against Paul Chance.<ref name=\"bb7983\"/>\n\n==Professional career==\nOwen turned professional on 1 September 1976, signing with [[New Tredegar]] based manager Dai Gardiner along with another fighter, Billy Vivian. The decision to turn professional also prompted a change of name; Owen had been fighting under his given name as an amateur but was advised by his new management that a ring name would benefit his career. Owen's initial suggestion was Sion Rhisart Owain, the Welsh translation of his given name, although this was dissuaded as being too political. His brother Kelvin instead suggested adopting the name Johnny Owen.<ref name=\"m8082\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=80\u201382}}</ref> Owen's initial hopes were low, his brother Kelvin stated how Owen had turned professional with the ultimate aim of claiming a British title or a [[Lonsdale belt]]. Owen was driven to turn professional by a desire to support his family and escape his relatively poor upbringing. One of his former youth coaches stated his belief that Owen understood he could \"fight and make money for his family. He wanted to buy them a house but, really, [...] the reason he boxed was because he had to.\"<ref name=\"bb7983\"/>\n\nHis debut match ended with a one-point victory over fellow Welshman George Sutton, at [[Pontypool]] Leisure Centre, on 30 September; at the time, Sutton was ranked as the number three contender for the British title and had needed a challenger on short notice.<ref name=\"Jones 2012 75\u201376\">{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=75\u201376}}</ref> His victory earned him his first professional prize fund of \u00a3125.<ref name=\"bb120123\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=120\u2013123}}</ref> The decision to fight an already established opponent proved an astute one as victory immediately saw Owen's stock rise in the boxing community.<ref name=\"m8082\"/> It was after his debut bout that Owen and his team agreed that he would not date during his professional career, with Owen believing that the dedication required to his career would be unfair on both him and his partner.<ref name=\"m8385\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=83\u201385}}</ref> His second fight was against Irishman [[Neil McLaughlin]] in his opponent's home nation during the height of [[The Troubles]]. The [[card (sports)|card]] suffered several interruptions; there were angry outbursts when British soldiers entered the arena, a bomb threat was phoned in threatening the site and, during Owen's bout, the lights failed for several minutes. The fight ended in a controversial draw.<ref name=\"bb125126\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> He finished his first year as a professional by comfortably defeating Englishman Ian Murray in [[Tonypandy]]. Owen knocked Murray down twice before the referee stopped the fight in the seventh round.<ref name=\"m8385\"/>\n\nAt the start of the following year, Owen met McLaughlin in a rematch in [[West Bromwich]]. Away from his opponent's home nation, the fight proved a more one-sided affair as Owen secured an 80\u201376 points victory. Promoter Heddwyn Taylor raised the idea of Owen challenging George Sutton for the Welsh bantamweight title after his victory. Despite Owen having already beaten Sutton as a professional, the request was denied by the Welsh Area Boxing Council who deemed that he was too inexperienced. With their hopes knocked back, Owen's promoters found themselves short of an opponent and could only secure another rematch with McLaughlin. Owen and his trainers voiced their displeasure over the bout and he went on to defeat McLaughlin for a second time in February. The Welsh Area Boxing Council reconsidered its decision soon after and subsequently allowed a title fight between Owen and Sutton to go ahead on 29 March,<ref name=\"m8688\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=86\u201388}}</ref> with the bout being regarded as an eliminator for the British title.

It was widely believed that the winner would be booked as Maguire's next opponent. During the fight, Owen became infuriated with Kellie's tactics, as his opponent relied on holding when Owen was gaining the advantage, and his belief that the referee was not penalising Kellie for it. Further issues were raised when Owen lost his gumshield and the referee forced him to continue without it. Owen was spurred on by these irritations and knocked Kellie down twice in quick succession before the referee stopped the fight in the sixth round.<ref name=\"m99101\"/> The offer of a British title fight with Maguire initially never materialised and Owen's next fight was a fourth-round knockout of debutant fighter Terry Hanna at Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre in June 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/39711/66120 |title=Johnny Owen V Terry Hanna |publisher=BoxRec |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> Further disappointment followed as Maguire took a fight against [[Franco Zurlo]] in September of the same year,<ref name=\"Maguirebr\">{{cite web |url=https://boxrec.com/en/proboxer/31469 |title=Paddy Maguire |publisher=BoxRec |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> leaving Owen with an offer of a second rematch against George Sutton on only three days notice. The fight took place at Midland Social Club in [[Solihull]] and Sutton proved a sterner test than most had anticipated in the early rounds, landing a \nstrong punch to Owen's jaw that wobbled him. Owen was able to recover and won the fight on points.<ref name=\"m102103\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=102\u2013103}}</ref>\n\nDespite Owen's victories, it still seemed likely that he would be forced to wait for a match with Maguire.

Less than 90 seconds into the eleventh round, the referee stopped the fight as blood poured from Maguire's eye. In only his tenth professional bout, Owen was crowned the British bantamweight champion, becoming the first Welsh fighter to hold the belt since [[Bill Beynon]] in 1913. He was awarded the belt by [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] while Maguire subsequently announced his retirement from boxing.<ref name=\"m104107\"/>\n\nOwen's victory brought him a new found level of fame that the young fighter was unaccustomed to. On his return to Merthyr the day after the fight, he met with the town's mayor and two parties were held in his honour in local clubs. He was named Welsh Boxer of the Year for 1977 and finished fourth in voting for the 1977 [[BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year]].<ref name=\"m110111\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=110\u2013111}}</ref> Owen returned to the ring in January 1978 in a non-title fight against Scottish boxer Alan Oag, stopping his opponent in the eight round. A month later, Owen fought Antonio Medina at Marton Country Club near [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and was surprised early on when his opponent emerged as a [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]], the first time he had faced the stance in his career. Owen's team had neglected to research their opponent ahead of the bout and the initial surprise caught Owen off guard. Even so, he was able to emerge victorious on points.<ref name=\"m110111\"/>\n\nOwen's first defence of his British title was booked for 6 April 1978 at Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre. His opponent was fellow Welshman Wayne Hughes with the two fighters possessing near identical records; both entered the fight 11\u20130 with Owen also recording a draw.

It was Owen's eighteenth contest and his first overseas, taking place in the champion's home-town of [[Almeria]]. The fight was preceded by a series of allegations of foul play by the challenger's camp. Owen was promised the use of the same training facilities as the champion in the afternoons, once Rodriguez had finished his sessions. In practice, however, Owen and his team often found themselves sat waiting at the gym for Rodriguez to finish his training that took up hours of time of Owen's sessions. At the weigh-in, Owen was marginally overweight, prompting a last minute training session involving running up and down the hotel stairs until he hit the 118lb limit. Rodriguez also exceeded the weight limit by a larger margin, more than could be lost in the allowed time. Owen and his team returned to the hotel with the intent of returning to Britain, believing the fight would be called off. However, Owen's manager Dai Gardiner returned to announce that the Spanish officials had passed Rodriguez fit to fight despite having weighed in 3 ounces overweight.<ref name=\"jones77\"/><ref name=\"m136137\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=136\u2013137}}</ref> Owen decided to go ahead with the bout, eager not to return to Britain empty-handed.<ref name=\"m136137\"/>\n\nThe fight was held in the town's [[bullring]] in front of a capacity crowd and Owen entered the arena to loud jeers. The first round was relatively uneventful as both fighters settled. When Owen returned to his corner, his father was infuriated after smelling [[Methyl salicylate|wintergreen oil]] on Owen. Believing the substance came from Rodriguez's gloves, he approached the referee who ignored Dick Owen's complaints. The [[British Boxing Board of Control]]'s (BBBofC) representative at the fight, Harry Vines, attempted to approach Owen' s team to find out what was causing commotion and found himself being pushed and shoved by members of the crowd before Spanish police ordered him to return to his seat. Rodriguez used several underhand manoeuvres against Owen, including illegal use of the head and elbows and attempted to screw his thumb into Owen's eye,<ref name=\"m139141\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=139\u2013141}}</ref> eventually receiving an official warning from the referee in the 12th round after being reprimanded on several occasions.<ref name=\"jones78\">{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=78}}</ref> At the start of the tenth round, Owen returned to the middle of the ring but was forced to wait as Rodriguez took several extra minutes to leave his corner before standing to taunt his opponent in front of the home crowd.<ref name=\"m139141\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/boxing/johnny-owen-champion-half-word-2339890 |title=Johnny Owen: Champion of half the word |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=20 May 2006 |accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> Rodriguez was awarded the victory on points in a decision that [[Steve Bunce]] later declared \"In what has been regarded as a \"home-town decision travesty\", Rodriguez was awarded a fight he had so obviously lost.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/boxing/johnny-owen-welsh-matchstick-man-15340770 |title=Johnny Owen: The Welsh 'Matchstick Man' who changed the face of boxing forever |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |last=Lewis |first=Anna |date=8 November 2018 |accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref> The [[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]] went further and describes the decision as \"an insult to the good name of boxing.\"<ref name=\"dwb\"/>\n\nOwen and his team returned to Wales despondent and infuriated.

Caudron lasted 12 rounds but was defeated 99\u201397 on points.

Both Owen and Pintor would go for early morning runs in the local area and would sometimes pass in a nearby park without acknowledging each other.<ref name=\"m172\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=172}}</ref> Both fighters trained at the gym facilities in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]. Owen found the press intrusion from the Mexican reporters difficult to deal with; he was hounded everywhere during the day and his motel room phone rang so often that Dai Gardiner requested the motel block any incoming calls. Eventually, Owen snapped and threatened to disrupt the fight schedule unless action was taken and the fight promoter promptly intervened as the press backed off.<ref name=\"m174\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=174}}</ref>\n\nThey came together at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]], Los Angeles on 19 September 1980. The arena had a capacity of 10,000 but estimates have put the crowd at well beyond that. The crowd was predominantly Mexican, with Pintor receiving a fervent support, while some Welsh fans had travelled to support Owen although they were said to be \"outnumbered 100 to 1 at least\".<ref name=\"m181\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=181}}</ref> Despite Owen being the underdog, odds on his victory were offered at 6\u20131 before the fight,<ref name=\"Johnes\"/> he surprised many in the opening round by actively pursuing Pintor around the ring, seeking to engage with the champion. His pressure told in the third and fourth rounds, winning both on most observers' scorecards, although Pintor responded with some strong right hands. Pintor began to realise that Owen was a considerable threat, perhaps more than he had realised, and responded in the fourth and landed a strong shot to Owen, although the Welshman quickly shook it off. In the fifth round, Owen suffered a large cut to the inside of his bottom lip that began to bleed profusely, leaving him swallowing blood for the remainder of the fight. The ringside doctor and the referee inspected the cut but deemed Owen was fit to continue.<ref name=\"m185\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=185}}</ref>\n\nPintor looked to take control of the fight and was the stronger through rounds six to eight,<ref name=\"m186187\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref> although he did receive cuts to both eyes.

Owen got to his feet quickly and assured the referee that he was fine but the momentum of the whole fight moved in the champion's direction and from the tenth round Pintor was in the ascendency. An exhausted Owen battled on through the eleventh round and referee Marty Denkin approached Owen's corner to end the fight but was told he was fine to continue. Owen returned for the twelfth and was knocked down a second time but again got to his feet. With 25 seconds remaining of the round, Pintor caught Owen with a strong right-hand to the head and Owen crumpled to the floor.<ref name=\"m186187\"/> The referee immediately called an end to the fight rather than count Owen out, stating he had seen Owen's pupils go up into his head, indicating he was unconscious before he fell to the floor. Owen suffered convulsions in the ring as doctors treated him and blood poured from his mouth. The crowd showed little sympathy for Owen's condition, beer and other missiles were thrown into the ring and Owen's corner men were shoved and pushed as they attempted to aid their fighter. Ken Bryant, a member of Owen's team, had his wallet pickpocted from his coat as he attended to the stricken fighter.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=254}}</ref><ref name=\"Johnes\">{{cite journal|last1=Johnes|first1=Martin|title=Stories of a Post-industrial Hero: The Death of Johnny Owen|journal=Sport in History|date=2011|volume=31|issue=4|pages=443\u2013463|doi=10.1080/17460263.2011.646832|url=https://www.academia.edu/1800300/Stories_of_a_Post-industrial_Hero_The_Death_of_Johnny_Owen}}</ref> He was loaded onto a stretcher and carried out of the arena before being taken to [[California Hospital Medical Center]].<ref name=\"m193194\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=193\u2013194}}</ref> He was taken into surgery where doctors removed a blood clot from his brain after a three-hour operation.<ref name=\"m193194\"/> The BBC regarded the knockout as so disturbing that it cancelled its replay broadcast of the fight in the UK and instead aired an edited highlights segment.<ref name=\"Johnes\"/>\n\n==Death==\n{{ quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 30%\n| quote = They came in their thousands.

January 1956 \u2013 4 November 1980) was a Welsh professional [[boxing|boxer]] who fought under the name '''Johnny Owen'''. His seemingly fragile appearance earned him many epithets, including 'the Bionic Bantam' and 'the Merthyr Matchstick'. He began boxing at the age of eight and undertook a long amateur career, competing in more than 120 fights and representing Wales. He turned professional in September 1976 at the age of 20, winning his debut bout against George Sutton. Owen would beat Sutton again in his sixth professional fight to win his first title, the vacant Welsh bantamweight championship.\n \nThree further victories led Owen to challenge for the British bantamweight championship in only his tenth professional fight. He defeated champion [[Paddy Maguire (boxer)|Paddy Maguire]] in the eleventh round to win the title, becoming the first Welshman in more than 60 years to hold the belt. Owen recorded five further victories, including a defence of his British title against Wayne Evans, before meeting [[Paul Ferreri]] for the Commonwealth bantamweight championship. He defeated the experienced Australian on points to claim the Commonwealth title and challenged [[Juan Francisco Rodriguez]] for the European title four months later. The fight in [[Almer\u00eda]] was shrouded in controversy and Owen suffered his first defeat in a highly contentious decision.\n\nOwen went on to win seven consecutive bouts in the space of a year to rechallenge Rodriguez again in February 1980 in Wales. He avenged his earlier defeat by defeating Rodriguez on points to win the European title. He challenged [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion [[Lupe Pintor]] for his version of the world bantamweight title on 19 September 1980, losing a torturously difficult contest by way of twelfth round [[knockout]]. Owen never regained consciousness, fell into a coma and died seven weeks later. A statue commemorating his life and career was unveiled in [[Merthyr Tydfil]] in 2002.\n\n==Early life==\nJohnny Owen was born John Richard Owens at [[St Tydfil's Hospital|Gwaunfarren hospital]] in [[Merthyr Tydfil]] on 7 January 1956, the fourth of a family of eight children to working-class parents Dick and Edith Owens (n\u00e9e Hale).<ref name=\"dwb\">{{cite web |url=https://biography.wales/article/s11-OWEN-RIC-1956 |title=Owens, Johnny Richard (Johnny Owen) (1956\u20131980) |publisher=Dictionary of Welsh Biography |last=Williams |first=M. |year=2016 |accessdate=14 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/945c85e9-9269-30ee-8aee-54fbba022f8e |title=Death of the Merthyr Matchstick |publisher=BBC Wales |last=Carradice |first=Phil |date=4 November 2014 |accessdate=14 November 2019}}</ref> He had four brothers, Phillip, Vivian, Kelvin and Dilwyn, and three sisters, Marilyn, Susan and Shereen.<ref name=\"bb2325\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=23\u201325}}</ref> The Owens' family hailed from [[Llanidloes]] but had moved south, settling in the village of Penwaunfawr, on the outskirts of Merthyr Tydfil. His paternal grandmother worked in the local mines while his grandfather Will worked in an ironworks and was also an amateur boxer.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=15\u201318}}</ref> His mother had also been born in Merthyr, although her family hailed from [[Lydney]] in [[Gloucestershire]], where her father had worked as a farmer, and had Irish ancestry. Both sets of Owen's ancestors had moved to the [[South Wales Valleys]] in search of work with increased steel, iron and coal production attracting workers from all over Britain.<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=44}}</ref> Owen's parents settled in a rented council house, 12 Heol Bryn Selu on Gellideg housing estate in Merthyr.<ref name=\"dwb\"/><ref name=\"bb2325\"/>\n\nIn his 2006 biography of Owen, Rick Broadbent described an adolescent Owen as \"a sensitive, quiet soul, he was deeply in tune with the moods and needs of those close to him.\"<ref name=\"bb2325\"/> Owen attended the local school, Gellideg Juniors. A mild-mannered child, he was described by his teachers as a \"quiet, hardworking, and very good-natured and well-behaved pupil\".<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=69}}</ref> By the age of seven, he was doing the family's weekly shop and his father later recalled that, when the family was struck down by a flu virus, Owen \"fed us soup and made sure we all had our medicine. He looked after us\"<ref name=\"bb2325\"/> Owen's father had worked as a miner for 13 years but eventually secured a job as a moulder at a boot making factory owned by [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]]. However, his wife had suffered complications during the birth of the couple's seventh child and her health deteriorated so much that she was hospitalised for an extended period. In his desperation, Owen's father nearly placed his children into care in order to be able to continue working but eventually reversed his decision after receiving assurances over his job safety.<ref name=\"bb2627\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=26\u201327}}</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nOwen began to box at the age of eight, coming to idolise fellow Merthyr born boxer [[Jimmy Wilde]]. Along with his siblings Vivian and Kelvin, in the spring of 1962, he joined the Merthyr Amateur Boxing Club housed in a small hut on nearby Plymouth Street.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=32}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=46}}</ref> Broadbent describes how, by age ten, Owen had developed \"some rudimentary ring raft and already had the boundless energy that would be his signature [...] His punches were light but his effort huge.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=35}}</ref> Owen and the other members of his club travelled the country, competing against other youth clubs from Wales and England. Each year culminated in the Welsh amateur championships, an event which stipulated that a fighter must have gained seven pounds each year they entered. Martyn Galleozzie, who trained alongside Owens, noted how Owen struggled to make the weight increase each year and recalled how Owen was fed cakes and biscuits on the journey to try and make weight. Galleozzie also stated how his mother once sewed lead into the lining of Owen's shorts to make weight.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=58}}</ref>\n\nOwen joined Hoover Amateur Boxing Club soon after, where he began to hone his ring craft with one of his coaches Idris Sutton modelling his fighting style on [[Eddie Thomas (boxer)|Eddie Thomas]]. Owen was a quiet, reserved, friendly character outside the ring and often needed to be coaxed into fighting full force.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=62}}</ref> In his youth, he suffered a loss to [[Charlie Magri]] in a bout in [[Gurnos]].<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=64}}</ref> Owen attended Georgetown Secondary Modern School until the age of 16 when he left to take up a role as a machine operator in a local nuts and bolts manufacturing factory owned by Suko.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=65}}</ref> His exertions in the factory, coupled with his frequent runs in the hills of the South Wales Valleys with his brother Kelvin, led Owen to develop renowned levels of speed and stamina.<ref name=\"bb6869\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=68\u201369}}</ref> His job would however cause him health issues as the [[swarf]] from the factory led to Owen developing infections on occasion. A septic finger injury led to a disappointing defeat to George Sutton in the 1975 Welsh ABA Championships after Owen refused to pull out of the fight.<ref name=\"bb7983\"/>\n\nIn November 1973, Owen was invited to fight Welsh amateur champion Bryn Griffiths after his opponent had fallen ill and pulled out of a bout. Despite the short notice, Owen was confident of his ability to make the step up against Griffiths and was proved right when he recorded a points victory over the champion. Griffiths though would later win a rematch between the pair.<ref name=\"m7172\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=71\u201372}}</ref> \nAt the age of 18, Owen met [[Maurice O'Sullivan (boxer)|Maurice O'Sullivan]] for the 1974 Welsh Amateur Boxing Association youth title in O'Sullivan's hometown of [[Cardiff]] after reaching the final of the competition on 4 April. Despite Owen and his father being convinced of his victory, the judges awarded the fight to O'Sullivan who himself offered the trophy to Owen who refused to accept.<ref name=\"bb6869\"/><ref name=\"m7172\"/> Owen's father Dick later stated that an official from the Welsh ABA approached him after the fight and confessed how the organisation had been under pressure to ensure O'Sullivan's victory in order for him to be selected for the [[1974 British Commonwealth Games]] in New Zealand.<ref name=\"bb6869\"/> Owen's father was becoming an increasing influence on his son's training especially when the two trainers at Owen's gym began suffering ill-health. When Dick himself was unable to take training, Owen would run the sessions at the gym for local fighters.<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=75}}</ref>\n\nOwen represented Wales at amateur level several times; his performance in a 1974 tournament between Wales and Scotland saw him draw praise in the local press. After defeating his opponent, John Raeside, in the second round during their bought in [[Pontypool]], he was described as reducing his opponent \"to helplessness with a non-stop two-fisted assault\" and was chosen as the most impressive fighter in the two teams on the night.<ref name=\"m7172\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=77}}</ref> Owen became well known for his seemingly small, thin frame as he grew older; he was chosen to represent Wales against Sweden in February 1975 and was greeted with jeers and laughter when he removed his robe. The nickname \"Matchstick Man\" was coined at the event as Owen comfortably stopped his opponent in the second round.<ref name=\"m7475\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=74\u201375}}</ref> Owen began fighting as a [[bantamweight]] soon after, winning his first bout at the weight against Englishman Allan Smith of the Metropolitan Police Amateur Boxing Club. His physique attracted further attention in November 1975, while representing Wales against an army team, a doctor initially refused to pass him fit to fight believing him to be too frail to box. After his father intervened, the fight went ahead with Owen winning on points.<ref name=\"m7475\"/><ref name=\"bb7983\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=79\u201383}}</ref>\n\nHe enjoyed a lengthy [[amateur boxing]] career taking in some 124 fights. His record was strong but not without blemish, he suffered 18 defeats in his amateur career and won the remaining 106. He represented Wales at amateur level 19 times, suffering defeat on only two occasions.<ref name=\"bb7983\"/> One of his most notable amateur victories came over 1974 Commonwealth Games broze medallist John Bambrick. His amateur career ended on a disappointing note; he suffered defeat in his Welsh senior amateur title fight against Jimmy Evans before losing his last amateur fight against Paul Chance.<ref name=\"bb7983\"/>\n\n==Professional career==\nOwen turned professional on 1 September 1976, signing with [[New Tredegar]] based manager Dai Gardiner along with another fighter, Billy Vivian. The decision to turn professional also prompted a change of name; Owen had been fighting under his given name as an amateur but was advised by his new management that a ring name would benefit his career. Owen's initial suggestion was Sion Rhisart Owain, the Welsh translation of his given name, although this was dissuaded as being too political. His brother Kelvin instead suggested adopting the name Johnny Owen.<ref name=\"m8082\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=80\u201382}}</ref> Owen's initial hopes were low, his brother Kelvin stated how Owen had turned professional with the ultimate aim of claiming a British title or a [[Lonsdale belt]]. Owen was driven to turn professional by a desire to support his family and escape his relatively poor upbringing. One of his former youth coaches stated his belief that Owen understood he could \"fight and make money for his family. He wanted to buy them a house but, really, [...] the reason he boxed was because he had to.\"<ref name=\"bb7983\"/>\n\nHis debut match ended with a one-point victory over fellow Welshman George Sutton, at [[Pontypool]] Leisure Centre, on 30 September; at the time, Sutton was ranked as the number three contender for the British title and had needed a challenger on short notice.<ref name=\"Jones 2012 75\u201376\">{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=75\u201376}}</ref> His victory earned him his first professional prize fund of \u00a3125.<ref name=\"bb120123\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=120\u2013123}}</ref> The decision to fight an already established opponent proved an astute one as victory immediately saw Owen's stock rise in the boxing community.<ref name=\"m8082\"/> It was after his debut bout that Owen and his team agreed that he would not date during his professional career, with Owen believing that the dedication required to his career would be unfair on both him and his partner.<ref name=\"m8385\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=83\u201385}}</ref> His second fight was against Irishman [[Neil McLaughlin]] in his opponent's home nation during the height of [[The Troubles]]. The [[card (sports)|card]] suffered several interruptions; there were angry outbursts when British soldiers entered the arena, a bomb threat was phoned in threatening the site and, during Owen's bout, the lights failed for several minutes. The fight ended in a controversial draw.<ref name=\"bb125126\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> He finished his first year as a professional by comfortably defeating Englishman Ian Murray in [[Tonypandy]]. Owen knocked Murray down twice before the referee stopped the fight in the seventh round.<ref name=\"m8385\"/>\n\nAt the start of the following year, Owen met McLaughlin in a rematch in [[West Bromwich]]. Away from his opponent's home nation, the fight proved a more one-sided affair as Owen secured an 80\u201376 points victory. Promoter Heddwyn Taylor raised the idea of Owen challenging George Sutton for the Welsh bantamweight title after his victory. Despite Owen having already beaten Sutton as a professional, the request was denied by the Welsh Area Boxing Council who deemed that he was too inexperienced. With their hopes knocked back, Owen's promoters found themselves short of an opponent and could only secure another rematch with McLaughlin. Owen and his trainers voiced their displeasure over the bout and he went on to defeat McLaughlin for a second time in February. The Welsh Area Boxing Council reconsidered its decision soon after and subsequently allowed a title fight between Owen and Sutton to go ahead on 29 March,<ref name=\"m8688\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=86\u201388}}</ref> with the bout being regarded as an eliminator for the British title. The fight was an even contest in the early rounds before Owen rocked Sutton in the fifth with a right hook.<ref name=\"bb129130\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=129\u2013130}}</ref> Owen's stamina gave him a distinct advantage as the fight wore on and he emerged victorious with a 99\u201397 points victory to become Welsh bantamweight champion.<ref name=\"m8688\"/> It was from his Welsh title win that Owen gained another of his nicknames, the \"bionic bantam\", after a reporter for the [[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] likened him to [[The Six Million Dollar Man]].<ref name=\"bb131132\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=131\u2013132}}</ref>\n\n===British bantamweight title===\n\nOwen's championship win immediately resulted in him becoming a possible challenger for the British bantamweight champion [[Paddy Maguire (boxer)|Paddy Maguire]].<ref name=\"m99101\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=99\u2013101}}</ref> To move into contention, Owen was booked to fight Scottish bantamweight champion Johnny Kellie at the Albany Hotel in [[Glasgow]]. It was widely believed that the winner would be booked as Maguire's next opponent. During the fight, Owen became infuriated with Kellie's tactics, as his opponent relied on holding when Owen was gaining the advantage, and his belief that the referee was not penalising Kellie for it. Further issues were raised when Owen lost his gumshield and the referee forced him to continue without it. Owen was spurred on by these irritations and knocked Kellie down twice in quick succession before the referee stopped the fight in the sixth round.<ref name=\"m99101\"/> The offer of a British title fight with Maguire initially never materialised and Owen's next fight was a fourth-round knockout of debutant fighter Terry Hanna at Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre in June 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxrec.com/en/event/39711/66120 |title=Johnny Owen V Terry Hanna |publisher=BoxRec |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> Further disappointment followed as Maguire took a fight against [[Franco Zurlo]] in September of the same year,<ref name=\"Maguirebr\">{{cite web |url=https://boxrec.com/en/proboxer/31469 |title=Paddy Maguire |publisher=BoxRec |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> leaving Owen with an offer of a second rematch against George Sutton on only three days notice. The fight took place at Midland Social Club in [[Solihull]] and Sutton proved a sterner test than most had anticipated in the early rounds, landing a \nstrong punch to Owen's jaw that wobbled him. Owen was able to recover and won the fight on points.<ref name=\"m102103\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=102\u2013103}}</ref>\n\nDespite Owen's victories, it still seemed likely that he would be forced to wait for a match with Maguire. However, when the official challenger Wayne Evans declined the opportunity to fight Maguire, stating that he needed more experience,<ref name=\"bb144145\">{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|pp=144\u2013145}}</ref> Owen stepped in and the fight was scheduled for November 1977 at the [[National Sporting Club]] in London.<ref name=\"m102103\"/> Maguire was entering the fight on a three fight losing streak, having suffered defeats to Heleno Ferreira and [[Alberto Sandoval]] before unsuccessfully challenging Zurlo for the European bantamweight championship,<ref name=\"Maguirebr\"/> and Owen was expected to be a serious threat to the Irishman's two-year reign.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tinyurl.gale.com/tinyurl/CPbJE0 |url-access=subscription |title=Owen may pose problems |newspaper=The Times |date=29 November 1977 |p=12 |accessdate=1 December 2019 |via=The Times Digital Archive}}</ref> Owen edged the early rounds of the fight as his longer reach caused Maguire problems and the champion was warned on more than one occasion for use of the head and [[Groin attack|low blows]].<ref name=\"m104107\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=104\u2013107}}</ref> Already ahead on points, Owen dominated the eighth round and nearly floored Maguire. Such was Owen's dominance that Maguire's promoter [[Mickey Duff]] threatened to end the fight.<ref name=\"Jones 2012 75\u201376\"/> In response, the champion rallied in the ninth round in response but, when Owen opened up a large cut above his eye in the following round, Maguire's fight was over. Less than 90 seconds into the eleventh round, the referee stopped the fight as blood poured from Maguire's eye. In only his tenth professional bout, Owen was crowned the British bantamweight champion, becoming the first Welsh fighter to hold the belt since [[Bill Beynon]] in 1913. He was awarded the belt by [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] while Maguire subsequently announced his retirement from boxing.<ref name=\"m104107\"/>\n\nOwen's victory brought him a new found level of fame that the young fighter was unaccustomed to. On his return to Merthyr the day after the fight, he met with the town's mayor and two parties were held in his honour in local clubs. He was named Welsh Boxer of the Year for 1977 and finished fourth in voting for the 1977 [[BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year]].<ref name=\"m110111\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=110\u2013111}}</ref> Owen returned to the ring in January 1978 in a non-title fight against Scottish boxer Alan Oag, stopping his opponent in the eight round. A month later, Owen fought Antonio Medina at Marton Country Club near [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and was surprised early on when his opponent emerged as a [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]], the first time he had faced the stance in his career. Owen's team had neglected to research their opponent ahead of the bout and the initial surprise caught Owen off guard. Even so, he was able to emerge victorious on points.<ref name=\"m110111\"/>\n\nOwen's first defence of his British title was booked for 6 April 1978 at Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre. His opponent was fellow Welshman Wayne Hughes with the two fighters possessing near identical records; both entered the fight 11\u20130 with Owen also recording a draw.

It was Owen's eighteenth contest and his first overseas, taking place in the champion's home-town of [[Almeria]]. The fight was preceded by a series of allegations of foul play by the challenger's camp. Owen was promised the use of the same training facilities as the champion in the afternoons, once Rodriguez had finished his sessions. In practice, however, Owen and his team often found themselves sat waiting at the gym for Rodriguez to finish his training that took up hours of time of Owen's sessions. At the weigh-in, Owen was marginally overweight, prompting a last minute training session involving running up and down the hotel stairs until he hit the 118lb limit. Rodriguez also exceeded the weight limit by a larger margin, more than could be lost in the allowed time. Owen and his team returned to the hotel with the intent of returning to Britain, believing the fight would be called off. However, Owen's manager Dai Gardiner returned to announce that the Spanish officials had passed Rodriguez fit to fight despite having weighed in 3 ounces overweight.<ref name=\"jones77\"/><ref name=\"m136137\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=136\u2013137}}</ref> Owen decided to go ahead with the bout, eager not to return to Britain empty-handed.<ref name=\"m136137\"/>\n\nThe fight was held in the town's [[bullring]] in front of a capacity crowd and Owen entered the arena to loud jeers. The first round was relatively uneventful as both fighters settled. When Owen returned to his corner, his father was infuriated after smelling [[Methyl salicylate|wintergreen oil]] on Owen. Believing the substance came from Rodriguez's gloves, he approached the referee who ignored Dick Owen's complaints. The [[British Boxing Board of Control]]'s (BBBofC) representative at the fight, Harry Vines, attempted to approach Owen' s team to find out what was causing commotion and found himself being pushed and shoved by members of the crowd before Spanish police ordered him to return to his seat.

Caudron lasted 12 rounds but was defeated 99\u201397 on points. Despite having fought in 19 professional bouts, it was only after the Caudron fight that Owen left his job at the Suko factory as his boxing schedule became too hectic to continue working.<ref name=\"m144145\"/> Owen made his first defence of his Commonwealth title and his third of his British title in June 1979 against Dave Smith, an opponent he had beaten the previous year, at the Double Diamond Club in Caerphilly.<ref name=\"m146148\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=146\u2013148}}</ref> Owen was eager to impress in the fight as victory would also see him achieve a lifelong ambition of retaining a [[Lonsdale belt]], which became the permanent property of a fighter once they had completed three successful defences.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/259861527/?terms=Johnny%2BOwen&match=1 |url-access=subscription |title=Owen's money belt |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Rodda |first=John |date=13 June 1979 |p=25 |accessdate=5 December 2019 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> From the first round he dominated Smith, whose trainer eventually [[Submission (combat sports)|threw in the towel]] during the twelfth round.

Owen found the press intrusion from the Mexican reporters difficult to deal with; he was hounded everywhere during the day and his motel room phone rang so often that Dai Gardiner requested the motel block any incoming calls.

The arena had a capacity of 10,000 but estimates have put the crowd at well beyond that. The crowd was predominantly Mexican, with Pintor receiving a fervent support, while some Welsh fans had travelled to support Owen although they were said to be \"outnumbered 100 to 1 at least\".<ref name=\"m181\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=181}}</ref> Despite Owen being the underdog, odds on his victory were offered at 6\u20131 before the fight,<ref name=\"Johnes\"/> he surprised many in the opening round by actively pursuing Pintor around the ring, seeking to engage with the champion. His pressure told in the third and fourth rounds, winning both on most observers' scorecards, although Pintor responded with some strong right hands. Pintor began to realise that Owen was a considerable threat, perhaps more than he had realised, and responded in the fourth and landed a strong shot to Owen, although the Welshman quickly shook it off. In the fifth round, Owen suffered a large cut to the inside of his bottom lip that began to bleed profusely, leaving him swallowing blood for the remainder of the fight. The ringside doctor and the referee inspected the cut but deemed Owen was fit to continue.<ref name=\"m185\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|p=185}}</ref>\n\nPintor looked to take control of the fight and was the stronger through rounds six to eight,<ref name=\"m186187\">{{harvnb|Murphy|2004|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref> although he did receive cuts to both eyes.

Owen got to his feet quickly and assured the referee that he was fine but the momentum of the whole fight moved in the champion's direction and from the tenth round Pintor was in the ascendency. An exhausted Owen battled on through the eleventh round and referee Marty Denkin approached Owen's corner to end the fight but was told he was fine to continue. Owen returned for the twelfth and was knocked down a second time but again got to his feet. With 25 seconds remaining of the round, Pintor caught Owen with a strong right-hand to the head and Owen crumpled to the floor.<ref name=\"m186187\"/> The referee immediately called an end to the fight rather than count Owen out, stating he had seen Owen's pupils go up into his head, indicating he was unconscious before he fell to the floor. Owen suffered convulsions in the ring as doctors treated him and blood poured from his mouth. The crowd showed little sympathy for Owen's condition, beer and other missiles were thrown into the ring and Owen's corner men were shoved and pushed as they attempted to aid their fighter.

In his will, Owen left \u00a345,189 to his family and had earned less than \u00a37,000 for his title fight with Pintor after expenses.<ref name=\"Johnes\"/> Owen's death, along with those of [[Kim Deuk-koo]] and [[Francisco Bejines]] in the early 1980s, ultimately led to boxing title fights being fought over 12 instead of 15 rounds in an attempt to improve the safety of fighters.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/13682467/death-johnny-owen-helped-change-boxing-forever |title=Rewind: The death that helped change boxing forever |publisher=ESPN |last=Parkinson |first=Nick |date=19 September 2015 |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Fighting style==\n\nOwen was renowned for his dedication to boxing, training relentlessly and often doing more work than his trainers asked of him. His dedication was such that he never drank alcohol and it is widely believed that he never dated a girl in his lifetime having made the decision to abstain from relationships.<ref name=\"m8385\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing/tragic-tale-johnny-owen-how-it-left-scar-over-mexican-boxing-lupe-pintor-a8040076.html |title=The tragic tale of Johnny Owen and how it left a scar over Mexican boxing |newspaper=The Independent |last=Bunce |first=Steve |date=6 November 2017 |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ghg\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/259574972/?terms=Johnny%2BOwen&match=1 |url-access=subscription |title=Greyhound in the gym |newspaper=The Guardian |last=Rafferty |first=Jean |date=2 November 1978 |p=21 |accessdate=4 December 2019 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> This led to [[Hugh McIlvanney]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' notably labelling Owen as \"The Virgin Soldier\" in 1979.<ref name=\"mi\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/257782435/?terms=Johnny%2BOwen&match=1 |url-access=subscription |title=Onward virgin soldier |newspaper=The Observer |last=McIlvanney |first=Hugh |date=25 February 1979 |p=30 |accessdate=4 December 2019 |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> Owen's training involved running considerable distances, between 9 and 12 miles on normal days,<ref name=\"mi\"/> contributing to his thin physique. Such was his leanness, Owen's manager, Dai Gardiner, was even accused of starving Owen for him to compete at bantamweight.<ref name=\"ghg\"/>\n\nHis stamina was regarded as inexhaustible; Winford Jones, a boxing writer and former referee, described Owen: \"His great skill wasn't his strength - though he never took a backwards step and could punch as hard as anyone of his weight - it was his stamina. He could fight for hours, and would wear opponents down by outlasting them.\" Jones also stated that Owen's stamina made him an ideal fighter in the professional ranks where fights often went over ten rounds compared to his amateur career, where fights typically lasted three.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11334993 |title=Johnny Owen's fatal final fight |publisher=BBC Wales |last=Prior |first=Neil |date=19 September 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref> His reliance on his ability to outlast fighters sometimes led to weak points during the early rounds of fights, Srikumar Sen of ''The Times'' noted \"Owen is a slow starter and can be caught early\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://tinyurl.gale.com/tinyurl/CRcnA9 |url-access=subscription |title=The matchstick man with fire in his fists |newspaper=The Times |last=Sen |first=Srikumar |date=28 February 1980 |p=10 |accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he did not possess devastating knockout power, Owen was noted for his \"fast accurate punching\".<ref name=\"ghg\"/> Owen's punching power was often debated, with some doubting that he possessed the power required to become a world champion. [[Michael Katz (journalist)|Michael Katz]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote after his victory over John Feeney that \"the guy (Owen) can't punch. If he could he would be illegal because he's got so much else.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=233}}</ref>\nOwen was also praised for his sportsmanship towards other fighters. Idris Sutton, who trained Owen from an early age, described him as \"a real gentleman. I never saw him throw a foul punch or do anything dirty [...] If he saw his opponent slipping, he would stand back and give him a chance to get up. He [...] would never look to take advantage of an accident. And if you beat him fair and square he'd be the first to shake your hand.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Broadbent|2006|p=82}}</ref> Lupe Pintor later described his admiration of Owen, remarking \"Owen was very honorable because he had determination, not only the determination of winning but representing a society, his people, that's the greatest thing I admired about him, his will, his hunger, that's something that made him very special.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.ringtv.com/425203-best-i-faced-lupe-pintor/ |title=Best I faced \u2013 Lupe Pintor |magazine=The Ring |last=Wainwright |first=Anson |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nA year after his death, a pub in Merthyr named The Matchstick Man opened. The following year, a plaque was unveiled at [[Prince Charles Hospital]] after some of the money donated to charity by Owen's family had been given to the establishment.<ref name=\"Johnes\"/> The Johnny Owen Courage Award and the Johnny Owen Carer's Award are also presented annually at the hospital.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/johnny-owen-awards-merthyrs-bravest-2663384.amp |title=Johnny Owen awards for Merthyr\u2019s bravest and most caring |newspaper=Daily Post |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref> A community centre, named the Johnny Owen Centre, was built on the Gurnos Estate in Merthyr shortly following his death in 1980.

Johnes's research demonstrates how Owen's story was told and retold, with its meaning and relevance shifting in the postindustrial environment of Merthyr and South Wales.<ref name=\"Johnes\"/> In his

M. R. Reis''' (born 1978) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[economist]] and the A. W. Phillips professor of economics at the [[London School of Economics]].  In a 2013 ranking of young economists by [[Glenn Ellison]], Reis was considered the top economist with a PhD between 1996 and 2004.<ref>Ellison, G. (2013) \"How Does the Market Use Citation Data? The Hirsch Index in Economics,\" AEJ: Applied Economics, 5 (3), 63\u201390, {{doi|10.1257/app.5.3.63}}</ref>, and in 2016 he won the [[Germ\u00e1n Bern\u00e1cer Prize]] for top European-born economist researching macroeconomics and finance. He writes a weekly op-ed for the Portuguese newspaper [[Jornal de Noticias]] and participates frequently in economic debates in [[Portugal]].\n\n==Academic career==\n\nReis earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc.) degree from the [[London School of Economics]] in 1999, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) from [[Harvard University]] in 2004. He taught at [[Princeton University]] from 2004 to 2008 before moving to [[Columbia University]] where he became a full professor at the age of 29, one of the youngest ever in the history of the university. He is an academic advisor and visiting scholar at central banks around the world, and sits on the board of multiple institutions.\n\n==Economic contributions==\n\n==== Sticky information and inattentiveness ====\nIn 2002, with [[Gregory Mankiw]] he proposed the sticky-information [[Phillips curve]]<ref>Mankiw, N.G. and R. Reis (2002) \"Sticky Information Versus Sticky Prices: A Proposal To Replace The New Keynesian Phillips Curve,\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117(4), 1295\u20131328, {{doi|10.1162/003355302320935034}}</ref> and followed it later with rational theories of inattention,<ref>R. Reis (2006) \"Inattentive Producers,\" Review of Economic Studies, 73(3), 793\u2013821, {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-937X.2006.00396.x}}</ref> and sticky-information models in general equilibrium.<ref>Mankiw, N.G. and R. Reis (2010) Imperfect Information and Aggregate Supply\" Handbook of Monetary Economics {{doi|10.1016/B978-0-444-53238-1.00005-3}}</ref> This model of [[nominal rigidities]] is based on the slow diffusion of information among the population of price setters and displays three related properties that are more consistent with accepted views about the effects of monetary policy. First, disinflations are always contractionary (although announced disinflations are less contractionary than surprise ones). Second, monetary policy shocks have their maximum impact on inflation with a substantial delay. Third, the change in inflation is positively correlated with the level of economic activity.\n\n==== Empirical study of disagreement in surveys ====\nIn 2004, with [[Gregory Mankiw]] and [[Justin Wolfers]], Reis started the modern empirical literature that focuses on disagreement in surveys.<ref>Mankiw, N. G., J. Wolfers and R. Reis (2004) \"Disagreement about Inflation Expectations\" NBER Macroeconomics Annual, 18, 209\u2013248 {{doi|10.3386/w9796}}</ref> A large literature that followed has documented the empirical properties of disagreement, has shown that it is very different from uncertainty, and has used it as moments to evaluate imperfect information models.   \n\n==== Pure inflation ====\nIn 2010, with [[Mark Watson]], Reis developed measures of pure inflation, which have become popular measures of [[core inflation]] used by central banks around the world.<ref>Reis, R. and M.

M. R. Reis''' (born 1978) is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[economist]] and the A. W. Phillips professor of economics at the [[London School of Economics]].  In a 2013 ranking of young economists by [[Glenn Ellison]], Reis was considered the top economist with a PhD between 1996 and 2004.<ref>Ellison, G. (2013) \"How Does the Market Use Citation Data? The Hirsch Index in Economics,\" AEJ: Applied Economics, 5 (3), 63\u201390, {{doi|10.1257/app.5.3.63}}</ref>, and in 2016 he won the [[Germ\u00e1n Bern\u00e1cer Prize]] prize for top European-born economist researching macroeconomics and finance. He writes a weekly op-ed for the Portuguese newspaper [[Jornal de Noticias]] and participates frequently in economic debates in [[Portugal]].\n\n==Academic career==\n\nReis earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc.) degree from the [[London School of Economics]] in 1999, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) from [[Harvard University]] in 2004. He taught at [[Princeton University]] from 2004 to 2008 before moving to [[Columbia University]] where he became a full professor at the age of 29, one of the youngest ever in the history of the university. He is an academic advisor and visiting scholar at central banks around the world, and sits on the board of multiple institutions.\n\n==Economic contributions==\n\n==== Sticky information and inattentiveness ====\nIn 2002, with [[Gregory Mankiw]] he proposed the sticky-information [[Phillips curve]]<ref>Mankiw, N.G. and R. Reis (2002) \"Sticky Information Versus Sticky Prices: A Proposal To Replace The New Keynesian Phillips Curve,\" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117(4), 1295\u20131328, {{doi|10.1162/003355302320935034}}</ref> and followed it later with rational theories of inattention,<ref>R. Reis (2006) \"Inattentive Producers,\" Review of Economic Studies, 73(3), 793\u2013821, {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-937X.2006.00396.x}}</ref> and sticky-information models in general equilibrium.<ref>Mankiw, N.G. and R. Reis (2010) Imperfect Information and Aggregate Supply\" Handbook of Monetary Economics {{doi|10.1016/B978-0-444-53238-1.00005-3}}</ref> This model of [[nominal rigidities]] is based on the slow diffusion of information among the population of price setters and displays three related properties that are more consistent with accepted views about the effects of monetary policy. First, disinflations are always contractionary (although announced disinflations are less contractionary than surprise ones). Second, monetary policy shocks have their maximum impact on inflation with a substantial delay. Third, the change in inflation is positively correlated with the level of economic activity.\n\n==== Empirical study of disagreement in surveys ====\nIn 2004, with [[Gregory Mankiw]] and [[Justin Wolfers]], Reis started the modern empirical literature that focuses on disagreement in surveys.<ref>Mankiw, N. G., J. Wolfers and R. Reis (2004) \"Disagreement about Inflation Expectations\" NBER Macroeconomics Annual, 18, 209\u2013248 {{doi|10.3386/w9796}}</ref> A large literature that followed has documented the empirical properties of disagreement, has shown that it is very different from uncertainty, and has used it as moments to evaluate imperfect information models.   \n\n==== Pure inflation ====\nIn 2010, with [[Mark Watson]], Reis developed measures of pure inflation, which have become popular measures of [[core inflation]] used by central banks around the world.<ref>Reis, R. and M. Watson (2010) \"Relative Goods' Prices, Pure Inflation, and the Phillips Correlation\" AEJ: Macroeconomics, 2 (3), 128\u201357 {{doi|10.1257/mac.2.3.128}}</ref>\n\n==== The diabolic loop and ESBies ====\nIn 2011, Reis with [[Markus Brunnermeier]], [[Luis Garicano]], [[Philip R.

[[Prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryotic]] ribosomes both contain a [[wiktionary:scaffold|scaffold]] of [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) on which are arrayed an extensive variety of [[ribosomal protein]]s (RP).<ref name=\"Ban2014\"/> Ribosomopathies can arise from abnormalities of either rRNA or the various RPs.\n\nThe nomenclature of rRNA subunits is derived from each component's [[Svedberg|Svedberg unit]], which is an [[ultracentrifuge]] [[sedimentation coefficient]], that is affected by mass and also shape. These S units of the rRNA subunits cannot simply be added because they represent measures of sedimentation rate rather than of mass. [[eukaryotic ribosome (80S)|Eukaryotic ribosome]]s are somewhat larger and more complex than prokaryotic ribosomes. The overall 80S eukaryotic  rRNA structure is composed of a [[eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit (60S)|large 60S subunit]] (LSU) and a [[eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S)|small 40S subunit]] (SSU).<ref name=\"Ruggero2014\"/>\n\nIn humans, a single transcription unit separated by 2 [[Internal transcribed spacer|internally transcribed spacers]] encodes a precursor, [[preribosomal RNA|45S]]. The precursor 45S rDNA is organized into 5 clusters (each has 30-40 repeats) on chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. These are transcribed in the [[nucleolus]] by [[RNA polymerase I]]. 45S is processed in the nucleus via 32S rRNA to [[28S ribosomal RNA|28S]]<ref name=\"28S\"/> and [[5.8S ribosomal RNA|5.8S]],<ref  name=\"5.8S\"/> and via 30S  to [[18S ribosomal RNA|18S]],<ref  name=\"18S\"/> as shown in the diagram. 18S is a component of the ribosomal 40S subunit. 28S, 5.8S and [[5S ribosomal RNA|5S]],<ref  name=\"5S\"/> which is transcribed independently, are components of 60S. The 5S DNA occurs in [[Tandemly arrayed genes|tandem arrays]] (~200-300 true 5S genes and many dispersed [[pseudogene]]s); the largest is on chromosome 1q41-42. 5S rRNA is transcribed by [[RNA polymerase III]].<ref name=\"Ruggero2014\"/> It is not fully clear why rRNA is processed in this way rather than being directly transcribed as mature rRNA, but the sequential steps may have a role in the proper folding of rRNA or in subsequent RP assembly.\n\nThe products of this processing within the [[cell nucleus]] are the four principal types of cytoplasmic rRNA: 28S, 5.8S, 18S, and 5S subunits.<ref name=\"Hoffbrand_2011_6\"/>{{rp|291}} and (cite)(cite) (Mammalian cells also have 2 types of mitochondrial rRNA molecules, [[12S ribosomal RNA|12S]] and [[MT-RNR2|16S]].) In humans, as in most eukaryotes, the [[18S ribosomal RNA|18S]] rRNA is a component of 40S ribosomal subunit, and the 60S large subunit contains three rRNA species (the [[5S ribosomal RNA|5S]], [[5.8S ribosomal RNA|5.8S]] and [[28S ribosomal RNA|28S]] in mammals, 25S in plants). 60S rRNA acts as a [[ribozyme]], catalyzing [[Peptidyl transferase|peptide bond formation]], while 40S monitors the [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementarity]] between [[tRNA]] [[anticodon]] and [[mRNA]].\n\n==Diseases==\nAbnormal [[ribosome biogenesis]] is linked to several human [[genetic diseases]].\n\nRibosomopathy has been linked to skeletal muscle atrophy<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 29215200| pmc = 5879973| year = 2017| last1 = Connolly| first1 = Martin| title = miR-424-5p reduces ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis in muscle wasting.| journal = Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle| volume = 9| issue = 2| pages = 400\u2013416| doi = 10.1002/jcsm.12266}}</ref>, and underpins most [[Diamond\u2013Blackfan anemia]] (DBA),<ref name=\"Narla2010\"/> the [[X-linked]] subtype of [[dyskeratosis congenita]] (DKCX),<ref name=\"OMIM305000\"/><ref name=\"Stumpf2011\"/>  [[Treacher Collins syndrome]]  (TCS),<ref name=\"Narla2010\"/><ref name=\"Dauwerse2011\"/> [[Shwachman\u2013Diamond syndrome]] (SDS)<ref name=\"Narla2011\"/> and [[Chromosome 5q deletion syndrome|5q-]] [[myelodysplastic syndrome]].(5q- MDS),(cite)(cite) [[North American Indian childhood cirrhosis]] (NAIC),<ref name=\"McCann2013\"/> [[isolated congenital asplenia]] (ICAS),<ref name=\"McCann2013\"/><ref name=\"OMIM271400\"/><ref name=\"OMIM150370\"/><ref name=\"Bolze2013\"/> and [[Bowen\u2013Conradi syndrome]] (BWCNS), [[CHARGE syndrome]]<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 25689927| year = 2015| last1 = Wong| first1 = M.

[[Oncogenes]], like [[c-Myc]], can upregulate [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] transcription in a direct and indirect fashion. Tumor suppressors like Rb and [[p53]], on the other hand, can suppress ribosome biogenesis. Additionally, the nucleolus is an important cellular sensor for stress and plays a key role in the activation of p53.\n\nRibosomopathy has been linked to the pathology of various malignancies.<ref name=\"Raiser2014\"/> Several ribosomopathies are associated with an increased rate of cancer. For example, both SDS and 5q- syndrome lead to impaired [[hematopoiesis]] and a predisposition to [[leukemia]].<ref name=\"Burwick2012\"/> Additionally, acquired defects in ribosomal proteins that have not been implicated in congenital ribosomopathies have been found in [[T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma]], [[stomach cancer]] and [[ovarian cancer]].<ref name=\"DeKeersmaecker2015\"/>\n\nNew cancer therapies might therefore target ribosome biogenesis specifically. As of 2014, two experimental agents inhibit RNA polymerase I by disrupting the rDNA promoter complex: CX-5461 activates p53 via nuclear stress and induces [[apoptosis]] of [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]] cells while leaving normal cells unharmed; BMH-21, inhibits rDNA transcription and induces nucleolar capping or nucleolar reorganization. This nucleolar stress eventually causes decreased cell proliferation and death. It also activates p-53 but p-53 activation was not required for the drug to be effective. The promise of these drugs is that they leave healthy cell DNA unharmed and specifically target the fact that cancer cells rely heavily on ribosome biogenesis. It has been said that ribosome biogenesis is the \u201cAchilles heel in cancer cells.\u201d <ref name=\"vanSluis2014\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<--KEEP: This reference list is organized alphanumerically by arbitrary ref name-->\n<!--FOR REDACTION: working template area\n\n<generally here, the ref name follows the format of <ref name=\"AuthorYYYY\">-->\n\n<ref name=\"Sondalle2014\">{{cite journal |authors=Sondalle SB, Baserga SJ |title=Human diseases of the SSU processome |journal=Biochim.

These S units of the rRNA subunits cannot simply be added because they represent measures of sedimentation rate rather than of mass. [[eukaryotic ribosome (80S)|Eukaryotic ribosome]]s are somewhat larger and more complex than prokaryotic ribosomes. The overall 80S eukaryotic  rRNA structure is composed of a [[eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit (60S)|large 60S subunit]] (LSU) and a [[eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S)|small 40S subunit]] (SSU).<ref name=\"Ruggero2014\"/>\n\nIn humans, a single transcription unit separated by 2 [[Internal transcribed spacer|internally transcribed spacers]] encodes a precursor, [[preribosomal RNA|45S]].

[[Oncogenes]], like [[c-Myc]], can upregulate [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] transcription in a direct and indirect fashion. Tumor suppressors like Rb and [[p53]], on the other hand, can suppress ribosome biogenesis. Additionally, the nucleolus is an important cellular sensor for stress and plays a key role in the activation of p53.\n\nRibosomopathy has been linked to the pathology of various malignancies.<ref name=\"Raiser2014\"/> Several ribosomopathies are associated with an increased rate of cancer.

As of 2014, two experimental agents inhibit RNA polymerase I by disrupting the rDNA promoter complex: CX-5461 activates p53 via nuclear stress and induces [[apoptosis]] of [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]] cells while leaving normal cells unharmed; BMH-21, inhibits rDNA transcription and induces nucleolar capping or nucleolar reorganization. This nucleolar stress eventually causes decreased cell proliferation and death. It also activates p-53 but p-53 activation was not required for the drug to be effective. The promise of these drugs is that they leave healthy cell DNA unharmed and specifically target the fact that cancer cells rely heavily on ribosome biogenesis. It has been said that ribosome biogenesis is the \u201cAchilles heel in cancer cells.\u201d <ref name=\"vanSluis2014\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<--KEEP: This reference list is organized alphanumerically by arbitrary ref name-->\n<!--FOR REDACTION: working template area\n\n<generally here, the ref name follows the format of <ref name=\"AuthorYYYY\">-->\n\n<ref name=\"Sondalle2014\">{{cite journal |authors=Sondalle SB, Baserga SJ |title=Human diseases of the SSU processome |journal=Biochim.

The planning area is bounded by [[Bukit Batok]] to the west, [[Choa Chu Kang]] to the northwest, [[Sungei Kadut]] to the north, the [[Central Catchment Nature Reserve|Central Water Catchment]] to the east and [[Bukit Timah]] to the south. Bukit Panjang New Town is located at the northern portion of the planning area. Bukit Panjang has an average elevation of 36m/118&nbsp;ft and a portion of this town is situated on a low-lying elongated hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elevationmap.net/bukit-panjang-new-town-singapore?latlngs=(1.381281,103.76980900000001)|title=Bukit Panjang New Town Singapore on the Elevation Map.

The brown bridge in the photo is an LRT viaduct, on which LRT trains travel]]\n\n==Etymology==\n''Bukit'' in [[Malay Language|Malay]] means \"[[hill]]\" and ''Panjang'' means \"long\". Therefore, ''Bukit Panjang'' literally means '''Long Hill''' which gets its name from the long [[Mountain range|range]] of high hills which ends in [[Bukit Timah]] to the south.\n\nAt the height of the movement to change place names in Singapore to Mandarin ones using Hanyu Pinyin romanization, the [[new town]] to be built in the area was initially known as '''Zhenghua''', after the Pinyinised version of \"Cheng Hwa\", which was derived from the old road Cheng Hwa Road. The trading of old [[dialect]] names which have gained common currency for unfamiliar, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] ones were not well received by the public, and Bukit Panjang was quickly reinstated. However, the name Zhenghua is preserved in the name of the flyover between Bukit Panjang Road and the [[Bukit Timah Expressway]] as well as the Zhenghua Park.\n\nMost of the roads in this town are named after old village tracks from the 1960s, such as Petir, Pending, Fajar and Senja, which used to ply the area.<ref>http://hm.onemap.sg/1969/1969%20(44).jpg</ref>\n\n==History==\nBefore its redevelopment as a suburban town in western Singapore, Bukit Panjang was formerly just a village that used to exist in the area. The development of the town and advanced earthworks began in 1981. Public housing flats rose up by 1985, but only Blocks 1xx and 2xx were built so far. Blocks 4xx was up and running by 1989, followed by 5xx and 6xx in 1995.\n\n===Administration===\n[[File:Bukitpanjang.JPG|thumb|right|Bukit Panjang Plaza, near the Bukit Panjang LRT Station.]]\nThe Bukit Panjang area comes under the administrative lead of the Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council, which oversees the management and maintenance of the many apartments ([[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] flats) and commercial units in Bukit Panjang.\n\n==Housing, amenities, and attractions==\nBukit Panjang is a quieter town compared to some of the older housing estates such as [[Toa Payoh]], [[Ang Mo Kio]] and other more publicly discussed towns due to its lower population, but it has seen major housing development in recent years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mynicehome.sg/cs/mnh/article/may-2016-sales-launch--a-flat-for-every-budget-and-need|title=May 2016 Sales Launch- A Flat for Every Budget and Need|website=My Nice Home|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe town consists of a mixture of old and new blocks of flats as well as condominiums. To date, there are three [[community center]]s (CC), namely Bukit Panjang Community Centre, Zhenghua Community Centre, and Senja-Cashew Community Club, which serve the entertainment, recreational, and educational needs of residents.\n\n[[Bukit Panjang Plaza]] is one of the well-known malls in Bukit Panjang. It is located at the heart of the town and is located close to the [[Bukit Panjang LRT Station|LRT]] and [[Bukit Panjang MRT Station|MRT stations]] as well as the [[Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange]]. Located on Jelebu Road, the mall has been expanded twice throughout its existence to include more shops in the building.

The brown bridge in the photo is an LRT viaduct, on which LRT trains travel]]\n\n==Etymology==\n''Bukit'' in [[Malay Language|Malay]] means \"[[hill]]\" and ''Panjang'' means \"long\". Therefore, ''Bukit Panjang'' literally means '''Long Hill''' which gets its name from the long [[Mountain range|range]] of high hills which ends in [[Bukit Timah]] to the south.\n\nAt the height of the movement to change place names in Singapore to Mandarin ones using Hanyu Pinyin romanization, the [[new town]] to be built in the area was initially known as '''Zhenghua''', after the Pinyinised version of \"Cheng Hwa\", which was derived from the old road Cheng Hwa Road. The trading of old [[dialect]] names which have gained common currency for unfamiliar, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] ones were not well received by the public, and Bukit Panjang was quickly reinstated. However, the name Zhenghua is preserved in the name of the flyover between Bukit Panjang Road and the [[Bukit Timah Expressway]] as well as the Zhenghua Park.\n\nMost of the roads in this town are named after old village tracks from the 1960s, such as Petir, Pending, Fajar and Senja, which used to ply the area.<ref>http://hm.onemap.sg/1969/1969%20(44).jpg</ref>\n\n==History==\nBefore its redevelopment as a suburban town in western Singapore, Bukit Panjang was formerly just a village that used to exist in the area. The development of the town and advanced earthworks began in 1981. Public housing flats rose up by 1985, but only Blocks 1xx and 2xx were built so far. Blocks 4xx was up and running by 1989, followed by 5xx and 6xx in 1995.\n\n===Administration===\n[[File:Bukitpanjang.JPG|thumb|right|Bukit Panjang Plaza, near the Bukit Panjang LRT Station.]]\nThe Bukit Panjang area comes under the administrative lead of the Holland-Bukit Panjang Town Council, which oversees the management and maintenance of the many apartments ([[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] flats) and commercial units in Bukit Panjang.\n\n==Housing, amenities, and attractions==\nBukit Panjang is a quieter town compared to some of the older housing estates such as [[Toa Payoh]], [[Ang Mo Kio]] and other more publicly discussed towns due to its lower population, but it has seen major housing development in recent years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mynicehome.sg/cs/mnh/article/may-2016-sales-launch--a-flat-for-every-budget-and-need|title=May 2016 Sales Launch- A Flat for Every Budget and Need|website=My Nice Home|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n\nThe town consists of a mixture of old and new blocks of flats as well as condominiums. To date, there are three [[community center]]s (CC), namely Bukit Panjang Community Centre, Zhenghua Community Centre, and Senja-Cashew Community Club, which serve the entertainment, recreational, and educational needs of residents.\n\n[[Bukit Panjang Plaza]] is one of the well-known malls in Bukit Panjang. It is located at the heart of the town and is located close to the [[Bukit Panjang LRT Station|LRT]] and [[Bukit Panjang MRT Station|MRT stations]] as well as the [[Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange]].
