Announcing a Pontiac styling trend, the Firebird's bumpers were integrated into the design of the front end, giving it a more streamlined look than the Camaro. The Firebird's rear \"slit\" taillights were inspired by the 1966\u20131967 [[Pontiac GTO]]. Both a two-door [[hardtop]] and a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] were offered through the 1969 model year. Originally, the car was a \"consolation prize\" for Pontiac, which had desired to produce a two-seat sports car based on its original [[Pontiac Banshee|Banshee]] concept car. However, GM feared this would cut into Chevrolet [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] sales, and gave Pontiac a piece of the \"[[pony car]]\" market through sharing the [[GM F platform|F-body]] platform with [[Chevrolet]].\n\nThe 1967 base model Firebird came equipped with the [[Pontiac straight-6 engine#Overhead cam|Pontiac {{cvt|230|CID|L|1}} SOHC inline-six]]. Based on the standard \n[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|Chevrolet {{cvt|230|CID|L|1}} inline-six]], it was fitted with a single-barrel [[carburetor]] and rated at {{cvt|165|hp}}.<ref name=\"Red Book\" /> The \"Sprint\" model six came with a four-barrel carburetor, developing {{cvt|215|hp}}.<ref name=Kowalke_oldCars>{{cite news|last1=Kowalke|first1=Ron|title=The Six-cylinder Firebird Sprint: Slouch or sleeper?|url=http://www.oldcarsweekly.com/features/bill-krause-1967-firebird-sprint|agency=Old Cars Weekly|publisher=F+W|date=26 May 2010}}</ref> Most buyers opted for one of three [[V8 engine|V8]]s: the {{cvt|326|CID|L|1}} with a two-barrel carburetor producing {{cvt|250|hp|0|abbr=}}; the four-barrel \"HO\" (high output) 326, producing {{cvt|285|hp}}; or the {{cvt|325|hp}} {{cvt|400|CID|L|1}} from the GTO. All 1967\u20131968 400&nbsp;CI engines had throttle restrictors that blocked the carburetors' second barrels from fully opening.<ref name=\"Red Book\" /> A \"Ram Air\" option was also available, providing functional hood scoops, higher flow heads with stronger valve springs, and a hotter [[camshaft]]. Power for the Ram Air package was the same as the conventional 400&nbsp;HO, but peaked at 5,200 rpm.\n\nThe {{cvt|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines were subsequently replaced in 1968 by the [[Chevrolet Inline 6 engine#250|Chevrolet {{cvt|250|CID|L|1}}]] stroked {{cvt|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines, the first developing an increased {{cvt|175|hp}} using a single-barrel carburetor, and the other the same 215&nbsp;hp with a four-barrel carburetor. Also for the 1968 model, the {{cvt|326|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was replaced by the [[Pontiac V8 engine#350|Pontiac {{cvt|350|CID|L|1}} V8]], which actually displaced {{cvt|355|CID|L|1}}, and produced {{cvt|265|hp}} with a two-barrel carburetor. An HO version of the {{cvt|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with a revised cam was also offered starting in that year, which developed {{cvt|320|hp|0|abbr=}}. Power output of the other engines was increased marginally.<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n\nThere was an additional [[Ram-air intake|Ram Air]] IV option for the {{cvt|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]]s during 1969, complementing the Ram Air III; these generated {{convert|345|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm and {{convert|430|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 3400 rpm;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=224763|title=Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, 1970 MY 2887|website=Carfolio.com |date=2014-05-01| accessdate= August 6, 2018}}</ref> and {{convert|335|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively. The {{Convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} HO engine was revised again with a different cam and [[cylinder head]]s resulting in {{cvt|325|hp}}. During 1969 a special {{cvt|303|CID|L|1}} engine was designed for [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] road racing applications that was not available in production cars.<ref>[http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/pontiac-firebird/pontiac-firebird-history-1.shtml Pontiac Firebird History 1st Generation 1967\u20131969 by Muscle Car Club, undated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914133900/http://musclecarclub.com/musclecars/pontiac-firebird/pontiac-firebird-history-1.shtml |date=2008-09-14 }}, retrieved on August 22, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe styling difference from the 1967 to the 1968 model was the addition of [[Automotive lighting#Lateral|federally-mandated side marker lights]]: for the front of the car, the turn signals were made larger and extended to wrap around the front edges of the car, and on the rear, the Pontiac (V-shaped) Arrowhead logo was added to each side. The front door [[Quarter glass|vent-windows]] were replaced with a single pane of glass and Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system. The 1969 model received a major [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] with a new front end design but unlike the GTO, it did not have the Endura bumper. The instrument panel and steering wheel were revised. The ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to the steering column with the introduction of GM's new locking ignition switch/steering wheel.<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n\nIn March 1969, a $1,083<ref>Hemmings motor news Terry Shea July 2013</ref> optional handling package called the \"Trans Am performance and appearance package\", UPC \"WS4\", named after the [[Trans Am Series]], was introduced. A total of 689 hardtops and eight convertibles were made.<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n\nDue to engineering problems that delayed the introduction of the all-new 1970 Firebird beyond the usual fall debut, Pontiac continued production of 1969 model Firebirds into the early months of the 1970 model year (the other 1970 Pontiac models had been introduced on September 18, 1969). By late spring of 1969, Pontiac had deleted all model-year references on Firebird literature and promotional materials, anticipating the extended production run of the then-current 1969 models.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| 1967<ref name=\"Buyer's Guide\" >{{cite book |last= Gunnell |first= John A. |title= Illustrated Buyer's Guide, Firebird \u2013 3rd.

That rating appeared in published 1973 model year Pontiac literature, which had been printed prior to the \"pre-production\" engines \"barely passing\" emissions testing, and the last minute switch to what became the production engine. The 1974 model year production literature listed the specifications of the production engine (290 SAE net horsepower).\n\nIn 1973 and 1974, a special version of the 455, called the Super Duty 455 (SD-455), was offered. The SD-455 consisted of a strengthened cylinder block that included four-bolt main bearings and added material in various locations for improved strength. Original plans called for a forged [[crankshaft]], although actual production SD455s received nodular iron crankshafts with minor enhancements. Forged rods and forged aluminum [[piston]]s were specified, as were unique high-flow cylinder heads.\n\nThe 480737 code cam (identical grind to the RAIV \"041\" cam) was originally specified for the SD455 engine and was fitted into the \"pre-production\" test cars (source: former Pontiac special projects engineer McCully), one of which was tested by both ''Hot Rod'' and ''Car and Driver'' magazines. However, actual production cars were fitted with the milder 493323 cam and 1.5:1 rocker ratios, due to the ever-tightening emissions standards of the era. This cam and rocker combination, combined with a low compression ratio of 8.4:1 advertised (7.9:1 actual) yielded 290 SAE net horsepower. Production SD455 cars did not have functional hood scoops, while the \"pre-production\" test cars did.\n\nA production line stock SD455 produced 253 rear wheel HP on a chassis dyno, as reported by ''High Performance Pontiac'' magazine (January, 2007). This is also consistent with the 290 SAE net horsepower factory rating (as measured at the crankshaft). Skip McCully verified that no production SD455s released to the public were fitted with the 480737 cam. When asked about the compromises for the production SD455 engine, McCully responded, \"Compression, camshaft, jetting, and vacuum advance.\" He followed by stating that he would have preferred a [[compression ratio]] of 10.25:1, a camshaft with 041 valve timing, slightly richer carburetor jetting, and as much vacuum advance as the engine would tolerate. However, that proved to be impossible due to the emissions regulations of the era. Overlooked however, is a June 1974 test of a newly delivered, privately owned SD-455 Trans Am. This appeared in ''Super Stock and Drag Illustrated''. With an unmodified car and a test weight of 4,010&nbsp;lbs the testers clocked 14.25 seconds at 101&nbsp;mph. The car had automatic and A/C.<ref>Super Stock and Drag Illustrated June 1974</ref> Also, the factory rating of 290&nbsp;hp was listed at 4,400 rpm while the factory tachometer has a 5,750 rpm redline.\n\nPontiac offered the 455 through the 1976 model year, but the engine could not meet tightening restrictions on vehicle emissions. A total of 7,100 were produced with the 455 engine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6- & 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" |14,096 \n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |17,249\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |10,123\n|-\n| 2-door Formula SD 455 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |43\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |4,550 \n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am SD 455 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |252\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" |46,313\n|}\n\n===1974===\n[[File:74bird.jpg|thumb|right|1974 Pontiac Firebird Formula]]\n\nCurb weights rose dramatically in the 1974 model year due to the implementation of {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} telescoping bumpers and various other crash and safety related structural enhancements; SD455 Trans Ams weighed in at {{convert|3850|lb|0|abbr=on}} in their first year of production (1974 model year; actually 1973).\n\nThe 1974 models featured a redesigned \"shovel-nose\" front end and new wide \"slotted\" taillights.

The 400, 455, and SD-455 engines were offered in the Trans Am and Formula models during 1974.\n\nA 1974 Firebird was driven by [[Jim Rockford (television character)|Jim Rockford]] in the pilot movie and the first season (1974\u20131975) of ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', and every following season, Rockford would change to the next model year. However, in the sixth season (1979\u20131980), Rockford continued to drive the 1978 Firebird from season five, as [[James Garner]] disliked the 1979 model's restyled front end. The cars in the show were badged as lower-tier Esprit models, but in reality were Formulas with the twin-scoop hood replaced with a scoopless one. Another hint was the twin exhausts and rear anti-roll bars that were not used on Esprit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" |7,603 \n|-\n| 2-door base 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" |18,769\n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |22,583\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |14,461\n|-\n| 2-door Formula SD 455 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |58\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am with 400ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 4,664\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am with 455ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |4,648\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am SD 455 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |943\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" |73,729\n|}\n\n===1975===\nThe 1975 models featured a new wraparound rear window with a revised roofline and the turn signals were moved up from the valance panel to the grills which distinguished it from the previous year model.

There is a way to tell an early 1977 built car as there was a production change in the hood scoop. Early cars were supplied with an off-center scoop. Furthermore, early W72 cars came with the standard 180&nbsp;hp air cleaner. \nPontiac offered the [[Pontiac V8 engine#400 T/A 6.6|T/A {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] with a single 4-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] [[carburetor]] [[Regular Production Option|RPO]] W72 rated at {{convert|200|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm and a maximum [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] of {{convert|325|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm, as opposed to the regular 6.6&nbsp;Litre 400 (RPO L78) rated at {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on|0}}. The T/A 6.6 equipped engines had chrome valve covers, while the base 400 engines had painted valve covers. In addition, California and high-altitude cars received the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Olds 403]] engine, which offered a slightly higher [[compression ratio]] and a more usable torque band than the Pontiac engines of 1977.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1981, the Firebird used four square headlamps, while the Camaro continued to retain the two round headlights that had been shared by both second generation designs. The 1977 Trans-Am Special Edition became famous after being featured in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''. The 1980 Turbo model was used for ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6- & 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" | 30,642\n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 6- & 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 34,548\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 21,801\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 29,313\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''W72'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 18,785\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 5,079\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 748\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''W72'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 933\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 180\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/[[T-top]]\n|align=\"right\" | 6,030\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''W72'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-top\n|align=\"right\" | 6,459\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-top\n|align=\"right\" | 1,217\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" | 155,735\n|}\n\n===1978===\n[[File:Pontiac Firebird front.jpg|thumb|right|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]\n[[File:400ci Pontiac.JPG|thumb|Pontiac 400CID V8]]\n\nChanges for 1978 were slight, with a switch from a honeycomb to a crosshatch pattern grille being the most obvious from the outside.<ref name=HBG1>{{citation | url = http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2011/08/01/hmn_buyers_guide1.html | title = 1977\u2013'78 Pontiac Firebird Formula | publisher = American City Business Journals | work = Buyer's Guide from Hemmings Muscle Machines | first = David Traver | last = Adolphus | date = August 2011 }}</ref> Beginning in 1978, the Pontiac group introduced a new special edition vehicle. The Firebird Formula LT Sport Edition which featured a revised 10% raised compression Chevy 305 V8 powertrain producing 155&nbsp;hp (same as 1977 Chevy Monza Mirage) combined with a floor center console four-speed manual T-10 BW transmission coupled to a limited-slip differential final drive. The limited touring package (LT) also included a cabin roof, door, fender and hood graphics scheme, the Trans-Am sports handling package with HD gas shocks, modular alloy wheels and the SE Trans-Am rear deck spoiler with \"Formula\" word graphic detail. T-tops in 1978 transitioned from Hurst units to Fisher (GM) in mid year. In 1978 Pontiac also made available the Red Bird package on the Firebird Esprit model. Painted in Roman Red with a matching red interior it had a Gold pinstripe treatment with Red Bird graphics on the b-pillars. It also utilized the Trans-Am style steering wheel and dash except these were finished with gold spokes and a gold dash face which was unique to the Red Bird option.\n\nThe engineers also revised the compression ratio in the 400ci through the installation of different cylinder heads with smaller combustion chambers (1977 Pontiac 400 engines also had the 350 heads bolted to the 400 blocks, these heads were known as the 6x-4 heads and were taken from the Pontiac 350). This increased power by 10% for a total of 220 during the 1978\u201379 model years. The 400/403 options remained available until 1979, when the 400&nbsp;CID engines were only available in the 4-speed transmission Trans Ams and Formulas (the engines had actually been stockpiled from 1978, when PMD had cut production of the engine).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6- & 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" | 32,671\n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 6- & 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 36,926\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 24,346\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 63,812\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''W72'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 8,251\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 8,969\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder<br/>Black Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 3,433\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder<br/>Black Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 210\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'-'' 8-cylinder<br/>Gold Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 7,796\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder<br/>Gold Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 880\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" | 187,294\n|}\n\n===1979===\n[[File:Pair of 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans AMs.jpg|thumb|1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans AM, in T-top and coupe versions]]\n\nThe front end was restyled for 1979, which also marked the 10th anniversary of the Trans Am. A limited edition anniversary package was made available: platinum silver paint with charcoal gray upper paint accents and mirrored t-tops, and a special interior featuring silver leather seats with custom-embroidered Firebird emblems and aircraft-inspired red lighting for the gauges. The 10th anniversary cars also featured a special 10th anniversary decals, including a Firebird hood decal that extended off of the hood and onto the front fenders. Pontiac produced 7,500 10th anniversary cars, of which 1,817 were equipped with the high-output Pontiac T/A 6.6 W72 400 engine, the last of the line of the Pontiac 'big-block' V8 motors (and coupled with the four-speed Borg Warner Super T-10 manual transmission). The only option on these cars was the engine (the 400 was not certified for California, nor was cruise control available with it), which dictated the transmission and the gear ratio (3.23 on the 400 cars, 2.73 on the cars with the Oldsmobile-produced 403 engine and the TH350 automatic transmission). Two 10th Anniversary Trans Ams were the actual pace cars for the 1979 Daytona 500, which has been called the race that made NASCAR. ''Car and Driver'' magazine named the Trans Am with the WS6 performance package the best handling car of 1979. During period dyno testing, the National Hot Rod Association rated the limited-availability T/A 6.6 high-output Pontiac 400 engine at 260\u2013280 net horsepower, which was significantly higher than Pontiac's conservative rating of 220&nbsp;hp. In 1979 Pontiac sold 116,535 Trans Ams, the highest sold in a year.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6- & 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" | 38,642\n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 6- & 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 30,853\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 24,850\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/301ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 8,605\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 2,485\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 48,488\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/301ci 8-cylinder w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 4,831\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci 8-cylinder w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 2,917\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci 8-cylinder w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 30,728\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/301ci 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 573\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 1,107\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 9,874\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci 8-cylinder<br/>10th Anniversary Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 1,817\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci 8-cylinder<br/>10th Anniversary Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 5,683\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" | 211,453\n|}\n\n===1980===\nIn 1980, due to ever-increasing emissions restrictions, Pontiac dropped all of its large displacement engines.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtzK7Hm77sUC&pg=PA20|title=Automotive Atrocities: Cars You Love to Hate|last=Peters|first=Eric|page=20|isbn=9780760317877|year=2004}}</ref> 1980 therefore saw the biggest engine changes for the Trans Am. The [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|301]], offered in 1979 as a credit option, was now the standard engine. Options included a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 301 or the [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|Chevrolet 305]] small block. The turbocharged 301 used a Garrett TB305 turbo forcing air through a single Rochester Quadrajet 4-barrel carburetor, which was, however, too antiquated to take full advantage of the forced air from the turbo. Also, the low-octane (87\u201390) fuels would have led to severe detonation, had it not been for the ECU, which led to the cars feeling not very powerful at all. Some owners have claimed quite reasonable performance numbers with the modern fuels though.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://oldcarmemories.com/1980-1981-pontiac-trans-turbo-4-9l-v8-better-think/ | title=1980-1981 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo 4.9L V8 - It's Better Than You Think| date=2018-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.2gta.com/1980ta.html |title = 1980 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am}}</ref>\n\nA 1980 Turbo Trans Am was featured in [[Smokey and the Bandit II]].

In the later second-generation cars, Norwood used lacquer-based paint (there is an \"L\" on the cowl tag), and Van Nuys used water-based paint (there is a \"W\" on the cowl tag), due to California's tightening pollution regulations. The water-based paint often failed and delaminated during the warranty period and subsequently, cars had to be repainted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production

with restyled nose]]\n\nThe availability and cost of gasoline (two fuel crises had occurred by this time) meant the weight and the fuel consumption of the 3rd generation had to be considered in the design. In F-body development, both the third generation Firebird and Camaro were proposed as possible front wheel drive platforms, but the idea was scrapped. Computerized engine management was in its infancy, and with fuel efficiency being the primary objective, it was not possible to have high horsepower and torque numbers. They did manage to cut enough weight from the design so that acceleration performance would be better than the 1981 models. They also succeeded in the fuel consumption department, offering a four-cylinder Firebird that would provide 34 miles per gallon.<ref>fueleconomy.gov \"Find a Car; 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 Firebird 2.5 L 5-speed fuel economy Official EPA Window Sticker MPG\" Web. July 4, 2010</ref> GM executives decided that engineering effort would best be spent on aerodynamics and chassis development. They created a modern platform, so that when engine technology advanced, they would have a well-balanced package with acceleration, braking, handling, and aerodynamics. For the time being, they would have world class aerodynamics and handling, and excellent fuel economy.\n\nThe Firebird and Camaro were completely redesigned for the 1982 model year, with the windshield slope set at 62 degrees, (about three degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated hatchback that required no metal structure to support it. Two concealed pop-up headlights, a first on the F-Body cars, were the primary characteristic that distinguished the third generation Firebird from both its Camaro sibling and its prior form (a styling characteristic carried into the fourth generation's design). In addition to being about {{convert|500|lb|kg}} lighter than the previous design, the new design was the most aerodynamic product GM had ever released. Wind tunnels were used to form the new F-Body platform's shape, and Pontiac took full advantage of it. The aerodynamic developments extended to the finned aluminum wheels with smooth hubcaps and a functional rear spoiler.\n\n===Models===\n*Firebird Base\n*Firebird S/E (1982\u20131987)\n*Firebird Formula (1987\u20131992)\n*Firebird Trans Am\n\n===Styles===\nFirebird Base (I4/V6/V8)-Series 2FS (1982\u201385)<br />\nFirebird Base (V6/V8)-Series 2FS (1986\u201392)<br />\nFirebird ASC Convertible (V6/V8)-Series 2FS (1986\u201389)<br />\nFirebird Convertible (V6/V8)-Series 2FS (1991\u201392)<br />\nFirebird Special Edition (S/E) (I4/V6/V8)-Series 2FX (1982\u201385)<br />\nFirebird Special Edition (S/E) (V6/V8)-Series 2FX (1986)<br />\nFirebird Formula (V8)-Series 2FS/W66 (1987\u201392)<br />\nFirebird Formula ASC Convertible (V8)-Series 2FS/W66 (1987\u201389)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am-Series 2FW/WS4 (V8) (1982\u201392)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am ASC Convertible (V8)-Series 2FW/WS4 (1986\u201389)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am Convertible (V8) 2FW/WS4 (1991\u201392)<br />\nFirebird [[Recaro]] Trans Am (V8)-Series 2FW/Y84 (1982\u201384)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am GTA (V8)-Series 2FW/Y84 (1987\u201392)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am GTA Convertible (V8)-Series 2FW/Y84 (1987\u201389)<br />\nFirebird 25th Anniversary Daytona 500 Limited Edition Trans Am-(V8)-Series 2FW/WS4 (1983)<br />\nFirebird 15th Anniversary Trans Am-(V8)-Series 2FW/WS4 (1984)<br />\nFirebird 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am-(V6 Turbo)-Series 5FW/WS4 (1989)<ref>{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=standard catalog of Firebird 1967\u20132002|year=2002|publisher=krause publications|location=Iola, WI|isbn=0-87349-494-6|pages=97\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n=== 1988 ===\n[[File:1988GTA1.jpg|alt=1988 Trans Am GTA|thumb|279x279px|1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA with $800 Notchback option installed]]\nIn 1988 the Trans Am GTA, which was built with the standard 350 cu in 5.7 L V8 engine, was offered with the option of removable roof \"T-Tops\". However, any buyer ordering this option could only order the 305 cu in 5.0 L V8 engine, because the roof would not have the support for all the extra torque from the engine, requiring a power trade-off for those who wanted this option. Pontiac also introduced a rare option for the Trans Am GTA in the 1988 model year. This notable option on the 1988 Trans Am GTA was the $800 \"Notchback\", which replaced the standard long large, glass-dominated hatchback to make the Firebird design look less like the Camaro design. The Notchback was a special fiberglass rear deck lid, replacing the long-sloped window with a short vertical rear window, resembling the back of a Ferrari 288 GTO.\n\nApproximately 700 of these Notchbacks were built in 1988 and offered for sale by Pontiac. Promotion was only in the form of a sheet in the back of a notebook of available options. The Notchbacks were made by Auto-Fab of Auburn Hills, MI. Problems with incorrect fitting of the Notchbacks to the GTAs at the Van Nuys plant often resulted in delays of several months for buyers who wanted this option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotrod.com/articles/hppp-0809-1988-trans-am-gta-notchback/|title=1988 Trans Am GTA Notchback \u2013 Hatch-22 \u2013 High Performance Pontiac|date=2008-09-01|website=Hot Rod Network|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Furthermore, quality control problems plagued the Notchback, many owners complained of rippling and deforming of the fiberglass rear deck, and others complained of large defects resembling acne forming in the Notchbacks. Pontiac had to repair them under warranty, sanding down the imperfections, and repainting them, only to have more flaws resurface months later. Due to poor quality and numerous expensive warranty repairs and repainting, it was subsequently canceled on the 1989 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am, although a handful of them were still produced.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n| 1982 ||'''LQ9''' [[Iron Duke engine#Tech IV|{{cvt|151|CID|L|1|order=flip}} GM]] [[Electronic fuel

While the live rear axle and floorpan aft of the front seats remained largely the same, ninety percent of the Firebird's parts were all-new.<ref>{{cite book|title=Road & Track Special Series: Guide to the All-New 1993 Pontiac Firebird|date=1992|publisher=Hachette Magazines, Inc.|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> Overall, the styling of the Firebird more strongly reflected the [[Pontiac Banshee|Banshee IV]] concept car than the 1991 \"facelift\" did. As with the Camaro, major improvements included standard dual airbags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, 16-inch wheels, rack-and-pinion power steering, short/long-arm front suspension, and several non-rusting composite body panels. Throughout its fourth generation, trim levels included V6-powered Firebird, and V8-powered Formula and Trans Am. Standard manual transmissions were the T5 five-speed manual for the V6s, Borg-Warner's T56 six-speed manual for the V8s. The 4L60 four-speed automatic was optional for both in 1993, becoming the 4L60E with built-in electronic controls in 1994.\n\n[[File:Pontiac Trans Am convertible.jpg|thumb|1994\u20131997 Trans Am convertible]]\n[[File:1996 Pontiac Firebird Formula.jpg|thumb|1996 Firebird Formula with functional \"Ram Air\" hood]]\n\n===1993\u20131997===\n[[File:Firebird 07-24-2019.jpg|alt=1993\u20131997 Pontiac Firebird|thumb|rear view (1993\u20131997)]]\nFrom 1993 until 1995 (1995 non-California cars), Firebirds received a {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on|0}} 3.4&nbsp;L V6, an enhanced version of the third-generation's 3.1&nbsp;L V6. Beginning mid-year 1995 onward, a Series II 3.8&nbsp;L V6 with {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} became the Firebird's sole engine. From 1993 to 1997, the sole engine for the Formula and Trans Am was the 5.7&nbsp;L LT1 V8, essentially identical to the LT1 in the [[Chevrolet Corvette#C4|C4 Corvette]] except for more flow-restrictive intake and exhaust systems.\nSteering wheel audio controls were included with optional uplevel cassette or compact disc stereo systems.\n\nBeginning with 1994 model year cars, \"Delco 2001\"-series stereo systems replaced the previous Delco units.<ref name=\"Flammang\">{{cite book|last1=Flammang|first1=James|last2=Kowalke|first2=Ron|title=standard catalog of American Cars 1976\u20131999|date=1999|publisher=Krause|isbn=0-87341-755-0|edition=third}}</ref>{{rp|898}} This revised series, also introduced for other Pontiac car lines, featured ergonomically-designed control panels with larger buttons and an optional seven-band graphic equalizer. Also in 1994, the fourth-generation convertible was available; every Firebird (and Camaro) convertible featured a glass rear window with a built-in electric defroster.\n\nThe 1995 models were the same as those of previous years, but traction control (ASR: acceleration slip regulation) was available for LT1 Firebirds, controlled by a switch on the console. The steering wheels in all Firebirds was also changed; their optional built-in audio controls were more closely grouped on each side. The \"Trans Am GT\" trim level was dropped from the lineup after its model year run in 1994. For 1995, all Trans Ams received 155-mph speedometers and Z-rated tires. 1995 was also the first year of the vented version of the Opti-Spark distributors on LT1 F-cars, addressing a common mechanical fault with the unit. The 'transmission perform' button was available only in the 1994 and 1995 Formula and Trans Am. This option was stopped for the 1996 and later models, but the unused connections remain available for 1996 and 1997 Formula and Trans Am. While 1995 cars still used the OBD-I (on-board diagnostic) computer system (the last year of any American car including the F-body to use OBD-I), a majority of them had OBD-II connector ports under the dash.\n\nFirebird performance levels improved for 1996, with the establishment of the stronger 200-hp 3.8 L V6 as the new base engine, and the power rating of the LT1 increased to 285 for 1996, due to its new dual catalytic-converter exhaust system. 1996 was also the first model year of the OBD-II computer system. Optional performance enhancements were available for each Firebird trim level; the Y87 performance packages for V6s added mechanical features of the V8 setups, such as four-wheel disc brakes, faster-response steering, limited-slip rear differential, and dual tailpipes.<ref name=\"Flammang\"/>{{rp|904}} For Formulas and Trans Ams, functional dual-inlet \"Ram Air\" hoods returned as part of the WS6 performance package. The optional package boosted rated horsepower from 285 to 305, and torque from 325&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft to 335. Also included were 17\" x 9\" wheels with 275/40ZR17 tires, suspension improvements, oval dual tailpipe tips, and a WS6 badge. Bilstein shocks were a further option with the package.\n\nThe 1997 model year introduced standard air conditioning, daytime running lamps (utilizing the front turnsignal lamps), digital odometers, and optional 500-watt Monsoon cassette or compact disc stereo systems to all Firebird trim levels.<ref name=\"Flammang\"/>{{rp|907}} For V6 Firebirds, a W68 sport appearance package was also introduced as a counterpart to the Camaro RS trim level. The WS6 \"Ram Air\" performance package was now also an option for the Formula and Trans Am convertibles, although these convertibles did not receive the 17-inch wheel-and-tire combination. There were 41 Formula convertibles and 463 Trans Am convertibles produced from 1996 to 1997 with the WS6 package.\n\n===1998\u20132002===\n[[File:30th Anniversary Trans Am.jpg|thumb|The 1999 30th Anniversary Trans Am]]\n[[File:Joe Aquilante SCCA Pocono Raceway 1999.jpeg|thumb|Joe Aquilante on the front stretch of Pocono Raceway 1999, to become SCCA national champ in T-1]]\n\nIn 1997, in relation to the Camaro, the Firebird received a mid-cycle refresh for 1998 model year. Major changes included a new hood and front fascia with dual intakes, retracting quad halogen headlights, circular turnsignal and fog lamps, a front license plate pocket, lower fender air vents, unified-style lower door raised lettering for each trim level, and a new \"honeycomb\" rear light panel, with circular reverse lamps. In the dashboard, \"next generation\" reduced-force dual airbags became standard. As before, the Formula and Trans Am again received a close derivative of the Corvette's 5.7 L V8, the LS1 of the [[Chevrolet Corvette C5|C5 Corvette]], as the LT1 (and LT4) V8s were discontinued.<ref name=\"Flammang\"/>{{rp|911}} The LS1 Firebirds were also equipped with an aluminum driveshaft, replacing the previous steel version, while all Firebird trim levels gained four-wheel disc brakes with dual-piston front calipers and larger rotors at each wheel, complete with a solenoid-based Bosch anti-lock system. The Formula convertible was no longer offered.\n\nBeginning in 1998 for 1999 models, a standard 16.8-gallon non-metallic fuel tank increased potential traveling range. GM's ASR traction control system was extended to the V6-powered Firebirds, and all LS1 (V8) and Y87 (V6) Firebirds also received a Zexel/Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle. An electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for improved brake performance. An enhanced sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) recorded vehicle speed, engine rpm, throttle position and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment.<ref name=\"Flammang\"/>{{rp|915}} In 1999, a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter for variants with the 6-speed manual and a power steering cooler became options for LS1 Firebirds.\n\nIn 2000, the WS6 performance package was available exclusively for 2001 model year Trans Am coupe and convertible variants.\n\nFor 2002, more convenience items such as power mirrors and power antenna became standard equipment, while cassette stereos were phased out.\n\n===Special editions===\n'''Firehawk'''\nThe special-edition extra-performance Firehawk (available in Formula trim for 1993\u20131997, and again in both Formula and Trans Am trims for 1999\u20132002) was produced by SLP Engineering, Inc., and sold through Pontiac dealerships. Featuring 17-inch wheels with namesake [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Firehawk 275/40ZR17 tires along with a functional twin-inlet hood above a specific air cleaner box, its rated power increased to {{cvt|300|hp|0|abbr=}} and 330&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (445 Nm) of torque. A total of 201 Firehawks were built for 1993. In 1994, the Firehawk package was expanded to include options for a suspension upgrade as well as a larger-diameter exhaust system that could boost power to 315&nbsp;hp. T-top Formula coupes and convertibles could also be optioned as Firehawks beginning in 1995. For 1996 and 1997, the Firehawk gained rectangular driving lights mounted inside the front scoops and (except Firehawk convertibles) the Trans Am's elevated rear wing. In 1997, an LT4 Firehawk was also available, utilizing the same 330&nbsp;hp, balanced-and-blueprinted LT4 V8 engine as found in the manual-transmission 1996 Corvette. A total of 29 LT4-powered Firehawks were produced.\n\nPower levels for the 1999 Firehawk, powered by the LS1 V8, rose to 327&nbsp;hp (330 in 2000, 335 in 2001, and 345 in late 2002 models equipped with the \"Blackwing\" intake). A 10th-anniversary Firehawk was available in 2001, distinguished as a black Trans Am coupe with gold-painted hood stripes, gold 17-inch wheels, and gold tailpipe tips.\n\n'''1994 Trans Am GT'''\nIn 1994 only, a \"Trans Am GT\" option was available. Trans Am GTs did not receive any special badging, graphics, or emblems, and looked externally identical to the base Trans Am cars. The GT package included 245/50ZR16 tires and a 155-mph speedometer. Non-GT optioned Trans Ams in 1994 received 235/55R16 tires, a 115-mph speedometer, and a much lower top-speed limiter. The \"highrise spoiler\", leather, and T-tops were not standard on the Trans Am GT cars in 1994, nor any year of LT1 Trans Am. RPO code T43 \"uplevel spoiler\" was an option on all Trans Ams, and while the mass majority of 1994 Trans Am GT cars received the T43 spoiler (along with the majority of all 1993\u2013'97 Trans Ams), it was not part of the Trans Am GT package. Both base Trans Ams and Trans am GTs could be ordered as coupe, T-top, or convertible versions and were both available with automatic or manual transmissions. While the GT package was a cost option on the 1994 Trans Am, a majority of 1994 Trans Ams were made with the GT package.\n\nAll of the 1994 Trans Am GT options became standard in 1995\u20132002 as part of the Trans Am package, and the GT name/package was dropped for 1995. Some of the early fourth-generation Trans Am and Formula Firebirds list \"GT\" on the vehicle's title or registration. The reason behind this is because the VIN does not specify a \"package\" (Formula, Trans Am, Trans Am GT, Firehawk, etc.); it only specifies the engine (5.7L V8 LT1). Because the title is based on the VIN alone, titles and registrations often list all of the packages, but it does not mean the car is equipped with any certain package.\n\n'''1994 25th-Anniversary Trans Am'''\nThe 1994 model year marked the 25th anniversary of the Trans Am, and another anniversary edition was released, painted white with a single dark blue stripe down the center of the vehicle that was reminiscent of the 1970 Trans Am. It also featured white-painted, five-spoke, 16-inch alloy wheels, and white leather seats and door trim. This edition was available in either coupe or convertible form.\n\n'''1999 30th-Anniversary Trans Am'''\nAs with the previous 25th-anniversary edition, the 30th-anniversary edition was either a white WS6 convertible or WS6 T-top coupe, with twin dark blue stripes from hood to tail, and distinct blue anodized five-spoke 17-inch alloy A-mold wheels, with white leather seats and door trim.\n[[File:2002 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am Collector's Edition Convertible (23500415186).jpg|thumb|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am Collector's Edition convertible]]\n\n2001 was the 75th anniversary of Pontiac. An available 75th Anniversary Package incorporated a power and performance package that included power door locks including retained accessory power, power windows including express down drivers side, dual power sport mirrors, power antenna. Radio, ETR AM/FM stereo w/CD player and 7 band graphic equalizer inc clock seek up/down, remote cd pre-wiring Monsoon 500 watt peak power with 10 speaker premium sound system and steering wheel leather wrapped w/driver touch radio controls.

In 2001 the dealer price for this 75th Anniversary package was $4530.00. There were a total of 472 of these packages sold in 2001, #239 on the L36 Firebird, 231 on the Formula W66 Coupe, 5 on Formula Firehawks and 2 on Trans-Ams\u2014making these editions quite rare.<ref>[http://www.transamworld.com/break-down.htm \"4th Gen Firebird Breakdown Numbers\"].

Retrieved July 23, 2017.</ref> Manufacturer original window stickers included this as a separate package listing the items and one price.\n\n'''2002 Collector's Edition Trans Am'''\nFor the Firebird's final year, a collector's edition Trans Am was released as either a yellow WS6 convertible or WS6 t-top coupe, with twin black stripes from hood to tail, black-painted five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels, and further black-trimmed body details.\n\n=== Engines ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size||95%;\"\n| 1993|| [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#3.4|{{convert|3.4|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L32 V6]]|| [[GM LT engine#LT1|5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8]] (iron block, aluminum heads)\n|-\n| 1994|| {{convert|3.4|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L32 V6|| 5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8 (iron block, aluminum heads)\n|-\n| 1995|| {{convert|3.4|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L32 V6|| [[GM 3800 engine#Series II|{{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6]] (California Only)|| 5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8 (iron block, aluminum heads)\n|-\n| 1996|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8 (iron block, aluminum heads)\n|-\n| 1997|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8 (iron block, aluminum heads) || [[GM LT engine#LT4|5.7L 350 CID LT4 V8]] (iron block, aluminum heads) in Firehawk by SLP\n|-\n| 1998|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| [[GM LS engine|5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8]] (aluminum block and heads)\n|-\n| 1999|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8 (aluminum block and heads)\n|-\n| 2000|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8 (aluminum block and heads)\n|-\n| 2001|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8 (aluminum block and heads)\n|-\n| 2002|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8 (aluminum block and heads)\n|}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Firebird Trans Am ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name=Pontiac Firebird Trans Am\n| image=File:2002 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am WS6.JPG\n| production = 1969\u20132002\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = [[Pony car]], [[Muscle car]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] 1969, 1987\u20131989 Pontiac sanctioned special edition, 1991\u20131992, 1994\u20132002<br/>2-door [[coupe]] 1969\u20132002\n| platform = [[GM F platform|F-body]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|FR layout]]\n}}\n\n[[File:'72 Pontiac Trans Am (Auto classique).JPG|thumb|right|1972 Pontiac Trans Am]]\n[[File:Pontiac Trans Am (Orange Julep).JPG|thumb|right|1974 Pontiac Trans Am]]\n[[File:Pontiac Firebird Trans Am (Orange Julep).jpg|thumb|right|1978 Pontiac Trans Am]]\n[[File:1981 Pontiac Trans Am 1.jpg|thumb|right|1981 Pontiac Turbo Trans Am]]\n[[File:'87 Pontiac Trans Am (Auto classique).JPG|thumb|right|1987 Pontiac Trans Am]]\n[[File:KITT Universal Studios.jpg|thumb|right|A modified 3rd generation Trans Am used as [[KITT]] ]]\n\nThe Trans Am was a specialty package for the Firebird, typically upgrading [[Car handling|handling]], [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and [[horsepower]], as well as minor appearance modifications such as exclusive [[Hood (vehicle)|hoods]], [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoilers]], fog lights and wheels. Four distinct generations were produced between 1969 and 2002. These cars were built on the [[GM F platform|F-body platform]], which was also shared by the [[Chevrolet Camaro]].\n\nDespite its name, the Trans Am was not initially used in the [[Trans Am Series]], as its smallest engine exceeded the SCCA's five liter displacement limit.\n\nThe second generation was available from 1970 to 1981 and was featured in the 1977 movie ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'',  the 1978 movie ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'', the 1979 movie ''[[Rocky II]]'', and the 1980 movie ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]''.  The Firebird Trans Am was also selected as the Official Pace Car for the [[1980 Indianapolis 500]].  The third generation, available from 1982 to 1992, was featured in the 1983 movie ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]'' and the 1984 movie ''[[Alphabet City (film)|Alphabet City]]''. [[KITT]], the automotive star, and its evil twin counterpart [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]], of the popular 1980s TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', was a modified third-generation Trans Am. The fourth-generation Trans Am, available from model years 1993 to 2002, offered between {{convert|275|and|325|bhp|abbr=on}}. The fictional character [[Dwight Schrute]] from NBC's show ''[[The Office (American TV series)|The Office]]'', is another famous driver of the 1987 model.\n\nThe Trans Am GTA (Gran Turismo Americano) was an options package available on the Firebird Trans Am which added gold 16-inch diamond-spoke alloy wheels, a mono-chromatic paint scheme and special cloisonn\u00e9 GTA badges. The GTA (along with the Formula model that was intended to fill the gap between the base model Firebird and mid-level Trans Am) was the brainchild of former Pontiac marketing manager Lou Wassel. It was intended to be the \"ultimate\" Trans Am and was the most expensive Firebird available. The GTA equipment package officially went on sale in 1987 and avoided a gas-guzzler tax thanks to its lightweight PW 16-inch gold cross-lace wheels. The high-performance WS6 suspension package was also re-tuned to offer a more compliant ride while still maintaining tight handling characteristics. Engine choices consisted of a L98 5.7 liter (350 ci) TPI  V8 mated to GM's corporate 700R4 automatic transmission or the 5.0 liter (305 ci) TPI V8. A five-speed manual was available but was mated to the 5.0 liter only. The GTA trim level was available from 1987 through the 1992 model year.\n\nFor 1989, the 20th anniversary turbo Trans Am project (originally conceived by Bill Owen of Pontiac) was outsourced to PAS, Inc., an engineering firm led by Jeff Beitzel. Beitzel and his team did most of the TTA development work. The 3.8 liter turbocharged V6 engines were built by PAS at their 40,000 square foot City of Industry, CA plant. From there, they went to GM's plant in Van Nuys, CA to be installed into GTAs on the F-Body assembly line. The cars were then shipped back to PAS for final assembly, testing, and quality control. Incidentally, the GTA chassis were selected at random, thus there is no correlation between the VIN and production sequence number. The initial number of cars to be produced had ranged from 500 to 2,500 until GM finally settled on 1,500. In all, a total of 1,555 Turbo Trans Ams were manufactured.  One of these served as the [[1989 Indianapolis 500]] pace car.\n\nThe 2002 model-year WS6 Trans Am produced {{cvt|325|hp|0|abbr=}} at 5,200 rpm and {{cvt|350|lbft|0|abbr=}} of torque at 4,000 rpm out of its 5.7-liter LS1 V8 engine.<ref>[http://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/2002/Pontiac/FIREBIRD-V8-6-Spd-AT/Coupe-2D-Trans-Am-WS6/Specs] 2002 Pontiac FIREBIRD-V8-6 Spd./AT\nCoupe 2D Trans Am WS6 \u2013 NADAGuides</ref>  A completely-stock WS6 completed the \u00bc\u2014mile in 13.16 seconds at 106.05&nbsp;mph on Eagle F1 street tires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.streetfire.net/video/s...ws6_178072.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527215646/http://www.streetfire.net/video/s...ws6_178072.htm |archivedate=2014-05-27 }} Stock 2002 Trans Am WS6 at the track \u2013 StreetFire</ref>\n\n=== Engines ===\n\n==== First generation ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size||95%;\"\n|1969|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air III V8]] {{convert|335|bhp|abbr=on}}|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air IV V8]] {{convert|345|bhp|abbr=on}}|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air V V8]] (rare dealer-installed option) {{convert|500|bhp|abbr=on|0}}{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n|}\n\n==== Second generation ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size||95%;\"\n| 1970|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air III 345hp V8]]|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air IV 370hp V8]]|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air V V8]] There are no known 1970 Trans Ams with the Ram Air V, no complete engines were ever sold or shipped to dealers, but the parts needed to build one could be ordered over-the-counter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallaceracing.com/RAV-story-page1.html |title=Pontiac Ram Air V Story |work=Wallace Racing |date= |accessdate=October 21, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1971|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#455|{{convert|455|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac H.O.

When the Firebird Trans Am was released, there was controversy over the model's inability to compete in the Trans-Am because the smallest available engine was too large for use in the series at 400 cubic inches (6.6 liters). The name also caused controversy because it was used without permission from the [[SCCA]], who threatened suit. GM settled the dispute by paying $5 to the SCCA for each car they sold. When the Trans-Am was last seen, model year 2002 Firebirds were in use. From 1996 to 2006, a WS6 Trans Am coupe provided the body style for the mechanically identical racing cars used in the [[International Race of Champions]] (IROC).\n\nDuring the 1995, 1996, and 1997 [[NHRA]] seasons, 14-time [[funny car]] champion [[John Force]] used a Firebird body to replace the obsolete [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] and [[Chevrolet Lumina]] bodies he had used since 1988. He used it for three seasons, winning the championship in all three years. The Firebird was also used by drivers such as Del Worsham, Tim Wilkerson, Frank Pedregon, and Jerry Toliver.

Announcing a Pontiac styling trend, the Firebird's bumpers were integrated into the design of the front end, giving it a more streamlined look than the Camaro. The Firebird's rear \"slit\" taillights were inspired by the 1966\u20131967 [[Pontiac GTO]]. Both a two-door [[hardtop]] and a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] were offered through the 1969 model year. Originally, the car was a \"consolation prize\" for Pontiac, which had desired to produce a two-seat sports car based on its original [[Pontiac Banshee|Banshee]] concept car. However, GM feared this would cut into Chevrolet [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] sales, and gave Pontiac a piece of the \"[[pony car]]\" market through sharing the [[GM F platform|F-body]] platform with [[Chevrolet]].\n\nThe 1967 base model Firebird came equipped with the [[Pontiac straight-6 engine#Overhead cam|Pontiac {{cvt|230|CID|L|1}} SOHC inline-six]]. Based on the standard \n[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|Chevrolet {{cvt|230|CID|L|1}} inline-six]], it was fitted with a single-barrel [[carburetor]] and rated at {{cvt|165|hp}}.<ref name=\"Red Book\" /> The \"Sprint\" model six came with a four-barrel carburetor, developing {{cvt|215|hp}}.<ref name=Kowalke_oldCars>{{cite news|last1=Kowalke|first1=Ron|title=The Six-cylinder Firebird Sprint: Slouch or sleeper?|url=http://www.oldcarsweekly.com/features/bill-krause-1967-firebird-sprint|agency=Old Cars Weekly|publisher=F+W|date=26 May 2010}}</ref> Most buyers opted for one of three [[V8 engine|V8]]s: the {{cvt|326|CID|L|1}} with a two-barrel carburetor producing {{cvt|250|hp|0|abbr=}}; the four-barrel \"HO\" (high output) 326, producing {{cvt|285|hp}}; or the {{cvt|325|hp}} {{cvt|400|CID|L|1}} from the GTO. All 1967\u20131968 400&nbsp;CI engines had throttle restrictors that blocked the carburetors' second barrels from fully opening.<ref name=\"Red Book\" /> A \"Ram Air\" option was also available, providing functional hood scoops, higher flow heads with stronger valve springs, and a hotter [[camshaft]]. Power for the Ram Air package was the same as the conventional 400&nbsp;HO, but peaked at 5,200 rpm.\n\nThe {{cvt|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines were subsequently replaced in 1968 by the [[Chevrolet Inline 6 engine#250|Chevrolet {{cvt|250|CID|L|1}}]] stroked {{cvt|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engines, the first developing an increased {{cvt|175|hp}} using a single-barrel carburetor, and the other the same 215&nbsp;hp with a four-barrel carburetor. Also for the 1968 model, the {{cvt|326|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine was replaced by the [[Pontiac V8 engine#350|Pontiac {{cvt|350|CID|L|1}} V8]], which actually displaced {{cvt|355|CID|L|1}}, and produced {{cvt|265|hp}} with a two-barrel carburetor. An HO version of the {{cvt|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with a revised cam was also offered starting in that year, which developed {{cvt|320|hp|0|abbr=}}. Power output of the other engines was increased marginally.<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n\nThere was an additional [[Ram-air intake|Ram Air]] IV option for the {{cvt|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]]s during 1969, complementing the Ram Air III; these generated {{convert|345|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5000 rpm and {{convert|430|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] at 3400 rpm;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=224763|title=Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, 1970 MY 2887|website=Carfolio.com |date=2014-05-01| accessdate= August 6, 2018}}</ref> and {{convert|335|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} respectively.

The front door [[Quarter glass|vent-windows]] were replaced with a single pane of glass and Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system. The 1969 model received a major [[Facelift (automotive)|facelift]] with a new front end design but unlike the GTO, it did not have the Endura bumper. The instrument panel and steering wheel were revised. The ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to the steering column with the introduction of GM's new locking ignition switch/steering wheel.<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n\nIn March 1969, a $1,083<ref>Hemmings motor news Terry Shea July 2013</ref> optional handling package called the \"Trans Am performance and appearance package\", UPC \"WS4\", named after the [[Trans Am Series]], was introduced. A total of 689 hardtops and eight convertibles were made.<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n\nDue to engineering problems that delayed the introduction of the all-new 1970 Firebird beyond the usual fall debut, Pontiac continued production of 1969 model Firebirds into the early months of the 1970 model year (the other 1970 Pontiac models had been introduced on September 18, 1969). By late spring of 1969, Pontiac had deleted all model-year references on Firebird literature and promotional materials, anticipating the extended production run of the then-current 1969 models.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| 1967<ref name=\"Buyer's Guide\" >{{cite book |last= Gunnell |first= John A. |title= Illustrated Buyer's Guide, Firebird \u2013 3rd.

That rating appeared in published 1973 model year Pontiac literature, which had been printed prior to the \"pre-production\" engines \"barely passing\" emissions testing, and the last minute switch to what became the production engine. The 1974 model year production literature listed the specifications of the production engine (290 SAE net horsepower).\n\nIn 1973 and 1974, a special version of the 455, called the Super Duty 455 (SD-455), was offered. The SD-455 consisted of a strengthened cylinder block that included four-bolt main bearings and added material in various locations for improved strength. Original plans called for a forged [[crankshaft]], although actual production SD455s received nodular iron crankshafts with minor enhancements. Forged rods and forged aluminum [[piston]]s were specified, as were unique high-flow cylinder heads.\n\nThe 480737 code cam (identical grind to the RAIV \"041\" cam) was originally specified for the SD455 engine and was fitted into the \"pre-production\" test cars (source: former Pontiac special projects engineer McCully), one of which was tested by both ''Hot Rod'' and ''Car and Driver'' magazines. However, actual production cars were fitted with the milder 493323 cam and 1.5:1 rocker ratios, due to the ever-tightening emissions standards of the era. This cam and rocker combination, combined with a low compression ratio of 8.4:1 advertised (7.9:1 actual) yielded 290 SAE net horsepower. Production SD455 cars did not have functional hood scoops, while the \"pre-production\" test cars did.\n\nA production line stock SD455 produced 253 rear wheel HP on a chassis dyno, as reported by ''High Performance Pontiac'' magazine (January, 2007). This is also consistent with the 290 SAE net horsepower factory rating (as measured at the crankshaft). Skip McCully verified that no production SD455s released to the public were fitted with the 480737 cam. When asked about the compromises for the production SD455 engine, McCully responded, \"Compression, camshaft, jetting, and vacuum advance.\" He followed by stating that he would have preferred a [[compression ratio]] of 10.25:1, a camshaft with 041 valve timing, slightly richer carburetor jetting, and as much vacuum advance as the engine would tolerate. However, that proved to be impossible due to the emissions regulations of the era. Overlooked however, is a June 1974 test of a newly delivered, privately owned SD-455 Trans Am. This appeared in ''Super Stock and Drag Illustrated''. With an unmodified car and a test weight of 4,010&nbsp;lbs the testers clocked 14.25 seconds at 101&nbsp;mph. The car had automatic and A/C.<ref>Super Stock and Drag Illustrated June 1974</ref> Also, the factory rating of 290&nbsp;hp was listed at 4,400 rpm while the factory tachometer has a 5,750 rpm redline.\n\nPontiac offered the 455 through the 1976 model year, but the engine could not meet tightening restrictions on vehicle emissions. A total of 7,100 were produced with the 455 engine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6- & 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" |14,096 \n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |17,249\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |10,123\n|-\n| 2-door Formula SD 455 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |43\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |4,550 \n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am SD 455 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |252\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" |46,313\n|}\n\n===1974===\n[[File:74bird.jpg|thumb|right|1974 Pontiac Firebird Formula]]\n\nCurb weights rose dramatically in the 1974 model year due to the implementation of {{convert|5|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} telescoping bumpers and various other crash and safety related structural enhancements; SD455 Trans Ams weighed in at {{convert|3850|lb|0|abbr=on}} in their first year of production (1974 model year; actually 1973).\n\nThe 1974 models featured a redesigned \"shovel-nose\" front end and new wide \"slotted\" taillights.

The 400, 455, and SD-455 engines were offered in the Trans Am and Formula models during 1974.\n\nA 1974 Firebird was driven by [[Jim Rockford (television character)|Jim Rockford]] in the pilot movie and the first season (1974\u20131975) of ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', and every following season, Rockford would change to the next model year. However, in the sixth season (1979\u20131980), Rockford continued to drive the 1978 Firebird from season five, as [[James Garner]] disliked the 1979 model's restyled front end. The cars in the show were badged as lower-tier Esprit models, but in reality were Formulas with the twin-scoop hood replaced with a scoopless one. Another hint was the twin exhausts and rear anti-roll bars that were not used on Esprit.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" |7,603 \n|-\n| 2-door base 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" |18,769\n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |22,583\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |14,461\n|-\n| 2-door Formula SD 455 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |58\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am with 400ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 4,664\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am with 455ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |4,648\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am SD 455 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" |943\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" |73,729\n|}\n\n===1975===\nThe 1975 models featured a new wraparound rear window with a revised roofline and the turn signals were moved up from the valance panel to the grills which distinguished it from the previous year model.

There is a way to tell an early 1977 built car as there was a production change in the hood scoop. Early cars were supplied with an off-center scoop. Furthermore, early W72 cars came with the standard 180&nbsp;hp air cleaner. \nPontiac offered the [[Pontiac V8 engine#400 T/A 6.6|T/A {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}]] with a single 4-barrel [[Rochester Products Division|Rochester]] [[Quadrajet]] [[carburetor]] [[Regular Production Option|RPO]] W72 rated at {{convert|200|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm and a maximum [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] of {{convert|325|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm, as opposed to the regular 6.6&nbsp;Litre 400 (RPO L78) rated at {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on|0}}. The T/A 6.6 equipped engines had chrome valve covers, while the base 400 engines had painted valve covers. In addition, California and high-altitude cars received the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Olds 403]] engine, which offered a slightly higher [[compression ratio]] and a more usable torque band than the Pontiac engines of 1977.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1981, the Firebird used four square headlamps, while the Camaro continued to retain the two round headlights that had been shared by both second generation designs. The 1977 Trans-Am Special Edition became famous after being featured in ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]''. The 1980 Turbo model was used for ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6- & 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" | 30,642\n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 6- & 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 34,548\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 21,801\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 29,313\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''W72'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 18,785\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 5,079\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 748\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''W72'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 933\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 180\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/[[T-top]]\n|align=\"right\" | 6,030\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''W72'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-top\n|align=\"right\" | 6,459\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-top\n|align=\"right\" | 1,217\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" | 155,735\n|}\n\n===1978===\n[[File:Pontiac Firebird front.jpg|thumb|right|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]\n[[File:400ci Pontiac.JPG|thumb|Pontiac 400CID V8]]\n\nChanges for 1978 were slight, with a switch from a honeycomb to a crosshatch pattern grille being the most obvious from the outside.<ref name=HBG1>{{citation | url = http://www.hemmings.com/mus/stories/2011/08/01/hmn_buyers_guide1.html | title = 1977\u2013'78 Pontiac Firebird Formula | publisher = American City Business Journals | work = Buyer's Guide from Hemmings Muscle Machines | first = David Traver | last = Adolphus | date = August 2011 }}</ref> Beginning in 1978, the Pontiac group introduced a new special edition vehicle. The Firebird Formula LT Sport Edition which featured a revised 10% raised compression Chevy 305 V8 powertrain producing 155&nbsp;hp (same as 1977 Chevy Monza Mirage) combined with a floor center console four-speed manual T-10 BW transmission coupled to a limited-slip differential final drive. The limited touring package (LT) also included a cabin roof, door, fender and hood graphics scheme, the Trans-Am sports handling package with HD gas shocks, modular alloy wheels and the SE Trans-Am rear deck spoiler with \"Formula\" word graphic detail. T-tops in 1978 transitioned from Hurst units to Fisher (GM) in mid year. In 1978 Pontiac also made available the Red Bird package on the Firebird Esprit model. Painted in Roman Red with a matching red interior it had a Gold pinstripe treatment with Red Bird graphics on the b-pillars. It also utilized the Trans-Am style steering wheel and dash except these were finished with gold spokes and a gold dash face which was unique to the Red Bird option.\n\nThe engineers also revised the compression ratio in the 400ci through the installation of different cylinder heads with smaller combustion chambers (1977 Pontiac 400 engines also had the 350 heads bolted to the 400 blocks, these heads were known as the 6x-4 heads and were taken from the Pontiac 350). This increased power by 10% for a total of 220 during the 1978\u201379 model years. The 400/403 options remained available until 1979, when the 400&nbsp;CID engines were only available in the 4-speed transmission Trans Ams and Formulas (the engines had actually been stockpiled from 1978, when PMD had cut production of the engine).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6- & 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" | 32,671\n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 6- & 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 36,926\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 24,346\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 63,812\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''W72'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 8,251\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 8,969\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'' 8-cylinder<br/>Black Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 3,433\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder<br/>Black Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 210\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci ''L78'-'' 8-cylinder<br/>Gold Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 7,796\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci ''L80'' 8-cylinder<br/>Gold Special Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 880\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" | 187,294\n|}\n\n===1979===\n[[File:Pair of 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans AMs.jpg|thumb|1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans AM, in T-top and coupe versions]]\n\nThe front end was restyled for 1979, which also marked the 10th anniversary of the Trans Am. A limited edition anniversary package was made available: platinum silver paint with charcoal gray upper paint accents and mirrored t-tops, and a special interior featuring silver leather seats with custom-embroidered Firebird emblems and aircraft-inspired red lighting for the gauges. The 10th anniversary cars also featured a special 10th anniversary decals, including a Firebird hood decal that extended off of the hood and onto the front fenders. Pontiac produced 7,500 10th anniversary cars, of which 1,817 were equipped with the high-output Pontiac T/A 6.6 W72 400 engine, the last of the line of the Pontiac 'big-block' V8 motors (and coupled with the four-speed Borg Warner Super T-10 manual transmission). The only option on these cars was the engine (the 400 was not certified for California, nor was cruise control available with it), which dictated the transmission and the gear ratio (3.23 on the 400 cars, 2.73 on the cars with the Oldsmobile-produced 403 engine and the TH350 automatic transmission). Two 10th Anniversary Trans Ams were the actual pace cars for the 1979 Daytona 500, which has been called the race that made NASCAR. ''Car and Driver'' magazine named the Trans Am with the WS6 performance package the best handling car of 1979. During period dyno testing, the National Hot Rod Association rated the limited-availability T/A 6.6 high-output Pontiac 400 engine at 260\u2013280 net horsepower, which was significantly higher than Pontiac's conservative rating of 220&nbsp;hp. In 1979 Pontiac sold 116,535 Trans Ams, the highest sold in a year.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production totals<ref name=\"Red Book\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px; text-align: left;\"| Model !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px; text-align: right;\"| No. \n|-\n| 2-door base 6- & 8-cylinder \n|align=\"right\" | 38,642\n|-\n| 2-door Esprit 6- & 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 30,853\n|-\n| 2-door Formula 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 24,850\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/301ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 8,605\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 2,485\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci 8-cylinder\n|align=\"right\" | 48,488\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/301ci 8-cylinder w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 4,831\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci 8-cylinder w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 2,917\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci 8-cylinder w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 30,728\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/301ci 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 573\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 1,107\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci 8-cylinder<br/>Special Edition w/T-tops\n|align=\"right\" | 9,874\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/400ci 8-cylinder<br/>10th Anniversary Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 1,817\n|-\n| 2-door Trans Am w/403ci 8-cylinder<br/>10th Anniversary Edition\n|align=\"right\" | 5,683\n|-\n| Total\n|align=\"right\" | 211,453\n|}\n\n===1980===\nIn 1980, due to ever-increasing emissions restrictions, Pontiac dropped all of its large displacement engines.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtzK7Hm77sUC&pg=PA20|title=Automotive Atrocities: Cars You Love to Hate|last=Peters|first=Eric|page=20|isbn=9780760317877|year=2004}}</ref> 1980 therefore saw the biggest engine changes for the Trans Am. The [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|301]], offered in 1979 as a credit option, was now the standard engine. Options included a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 301 or the [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|Chevrolet 305]] small block. The turbocharged 301 used a Garrett TB305 turbo forcing air through a single Rochester Quadrajet 4-barrel carburetor, which was, however, too antiquated to take full advantage of the forced air from the turbo. Also, the low-octane (87\u201390) fuels would have led to severe detonation, had it not been for the ECU, which led to the cars feeling not very powerful at all. Some owners have claimed quite reasonable performance numbers with the modern fuels though.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://oldcarmemories.com/1980-1981-pontiac-trans-turbo-4-9l-v8-better-think/ | title=1980-1981 Pontiac Trans Am Turbo 4.9L V8 - It's Better Than You Think| date=2018-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.2gta.com/1980ta.html |title = 1980 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am}}</ref>\n\nA 1980 Turbo Trans Am was featured in [[Smokey and the Bandit II]].

In the later second-generation cars, Norwood used lacquer-based paint (there is an \"L\" on the cowl tag), and Van Nuys used water-based paint (there is a \"W\" on the cowl tag), due to California's tightening pollution regulations. The water-based paint often failed and delaminated during the warranty period and subsequently, cars had to be repainted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | Production

with restyled nose]]\n\nThe availability and cost of gasoline (two fuel crises had occurred by this time) meant the weight and the fuel consumption of the 3rd generation had to be considered in the design. In F-body development, both the third generation Firebird and Camaro were proposed as possible front wheel drive platforms, but the idea was scrapped. Computerized engine management was in its infancy, and with fuel efficiency being the primary objective, it was not possible to have high horsepower and torque numbers. They did manage to cut enough weight from the design so that acceleration performance would be better than the 1981 models. They also succeeded in the fuel consumption department, offering a four-cylinder Firebird that would provide 34 miles per gallon.<ref>fueleconomy.gov \"Find a Car; 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 Firebird 2.5 L 5-speed fuel economy Official EPA Window Sticker MPG\" Web. July 4, 2010</ref> GM executives decided that engineering effort would best be spent on aerodynamics and chassis development. They created a modern platform, so that when engine technology advanced, they would have a well-balanced package with acceleration, braking, handling, and aerodynamics. For the time being, they would have world class aerodynamics and handling, and excellent fuel economy.\n\nThe Firebird and Camaro were completely redesigned for the 1982 model year, with the windshield slope set at 62 degrees, (about three degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), and for the first time, a large, glass-dominated hatchback that required no metal structure to support it. Two concealed pop-up headlights, a first on the F-Body cars, were the primary characteristic that distinguished the third generation Firebird from both its Camaro sibling and its prior form (a styling characteristic carried into the fourth generation's design). In addition to being about {{convert|500|lb|kg}} lighter than the previous design, the new design was the most aerodynamic product GM had ever released. Wind tunnels were used to form the new F-Body platform's shape, and Pontiac took full advantage of it. The aerodynamic developments extended to the finned aluminum wheels with smooth hubcaps and a functional rear spoiler.\n\n===Models===\n*Firebird Base\n*Firebird S/E (1982\u20131987)\n*Firebird Formula (1987\u20131992)\n*Firebird Trans Am\n\n===Styles===\nFirebird Base (I4/V6/V8)-Series 2FS (1982\u201385)<br />\nFirebird Base (V6/V8)-Series 2FS (1986\u201392)<br />\nFirebird ASC Convertible (V6/V8)-Series 2FS (1986\u201389)<br />\nFirebird Convertible (V6/V8)-Series 2FS (1991\u201392)<br />\nFirebird Special Edition (S/E) (I4/V6/V8)-Series 2FX (1982\u201385)<br />\nFirebird Special Edition (S/E) (V6/V8)-Series 2FX (1986)<br />\nFirebird Formula (V8)-Series 2FS/W66 (1987\u201392)<br />\nFirebird Formula ASC Convertible (V8)-Series 2FS/W66 (1987\u201389)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am-Series 2FW/WS4 (V8) (1982\u201392)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am ASC Convertible (V8)-Series 2FW/WS4 (1986\u201389)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am Convertible (V8) 2FW/WS4 (1991\u201392)<br />\nFirebird [[Recaro]] Trans Am (V8)-Series 2FW/Y84 (1982\u201384)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am GTA (V8)-Series 2FW/Y84 (1987\u201392)<br />\nFirebird Trans Am GTA Convertible (V8)-Series 2FW/Y84 (1987\u201389)<br />\nFirebird 25th Anniversary Daytona 500 Limited Edition Trans Am-(V8)-Series 2FW/WS4 (1983)<br />\nFirebird 15th Anniversary Trans Am-(V8)-Series 2FW/WS4 (1984)<br />\nFirebird 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am-(V6 Turbo)-Series 5FW/WS4 (1989)<ref>{{cite book|last=Gunnell|first=John|title=standard catalog of Firebird 1967\u20132002|year=2002|publisher=krause publications|location=Iola, WI|isbn=0-87349-494-6|pages=97\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n=== 1988 ===\n[[File:1988GTA1.jpg|alt=1988 Trans Am GTA|thumb|279x279px|1988 Pontiac Trans Am GTA with $800 Notchback option installed]]\nIn 1988 the Trans Am GTA, which was built with the standard 350 cu in 5.7 L V8 engine, was offered with the option of removable roof \"T-Tops\". However, any buyer ordering this option could only order the 305 cu in 5.0 L V8 engine, because the roof would not have the support for all the extra torque from the engine, requiring a power trade-off for those who wanted this option. Pontiac also introduced a rare option for the Trans Am GTA in the 1988 model year. This notable option on the 1988 Trans Am GTA was the $800 \"Notchback\", which replaced the standard long large, glass-dominated hatchback to make the Firebird design look less like the Camaro design. The Notchback was a special fiberglass rear deck lid, replacing the long-sloped window with a short vertical rear window, resembling the back of a Ferrari 288 GTO.\n\nApproximately 700 of these Notchbacks were built in 1988 and offered for sale by Pontiac. Promotion was only in the form of a sheet in the back of a notebook of available options. The Notchbacks were made by Auto-Fab of Auburn Hills, MI. Problems with incorrect fitting of the Notchbacks to the GTAs at the Van Nuys plant often resulted in delays of several months for buyers who wanted this option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotrod.com/articles/hppp-0809-1988-trans-am-gta-notchback/|title=1988 Trans Am GTA Notchback \u2013 Hatch-22 \u2013 High Performance Pontiac|date=2008-09-01|website=Hot Rod Network|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Furthermore, quality control problems plagued the Notchback, many owners complained of rippling and deforming of the fiberglass rear deck, and others complained of large defects resembling acne forming in the Notchbacks. Pontiac had to repair them under warranty, sanding down the imperfections, and repainting them, only to have more flaws resurface months later. Due to poor quality and numerous expensive warranty repairs and repainting, it was subsequently canceled on the 1989 20th Anniversary Turbo Trans Am, although a handful of them were still produced.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n| 1982 ||'''LQ9''' [[Iron Duke engine#Tech IV|{{cvt|151|CID|L|1|order=flip}} GM]] [[Electronic fuel

While the live rear axle and floorpan aft of the front seats remained largely the same, ninety percent of the Firebird's parts were all-new.<ref>{{cite book|title=Road & Track Special Series: Guide to the All-New 1993 Pontiac Firebird|date=1992|publisher=Hachette Magazines, Inc.|pages=2\u20133}}</ref> Overall, the styling of the Firebird more strongly reflected the [[Pontiac Banshee|Banshee IV]] concept car than the 1991 \"facelift\" did. As with the Camaro, major improvements included standard dual airbags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, 16-inch wheels, rack-and-pinion power steering, short/long-arm front suspension, and several non-rusting composite body panels. Throughout its fourth generation, trim levels included V6-powered Firebird, and V8-powered Formula and Trans Am. Standard manual transmissions were the T5 five-speed manual for the V6s, Borg-Warner's T56 six-speed manual for the V8s. The 4L60 four-speed automatic was optional for both in 1993, becoming the 4L60E with built-in electronic controls in 1994.\n\n[[File:Pontiac Trans Am convertible.jpg|thumb|1994\u20131997 Trans Am convertible]]\n[[File:1996 Pontiac Firebird Formula.jpg|thumb|1996 Firebird Formula with functional \"Ram Air\" hood]]\n\n===1993\u20131997===\n[[File:Firebird 07-24-2019.jpg|alt=1993\u20131997 Pontiac Firebird|thumb|rear view (1993\u20131997)]]\nFrom 1993 until 1995 (1995 non-California cars), Firebirds received a {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on|0}} 3.4&nbsp;L V6, an enhanced version of the third-generation's 3.1&nbsp;L V6. Beginning mid-year 1995 onward, a Series II 3.8&nbsp;L V6 with {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} became the Firebird's sole engine. From 1993 to 1997, the sole engine for the Formula and Trans Am was the 5.7&nbsp;L LT1 V8, essentially identical to the LT1 in the [[Chevrolet Corvette#C4|C4 Corvette]] except for more flow-restrictive intake and exhaust systems.\nSteering wheel audio controls were included with optional uplevel cassette or compact disc stereo systems.\n\nBeginning with 1994 model year cars, \"Delco 2001\"-series stereo systems replaced the previous Delco units.<ref name=\"Flammang\">{{cite book|last1=Flammang|first1=James|last2=Kowalke|first2=Ron|title=standard catalog of American Cars 1976\u20131999|date=1999|publisher=Krause|isbn=0-87341-755-0|edition=third}}</ref>{{rp|898}} This revised series, also introduced for other Pontiac car lines, featured ergonomically-designed control panels with larger buttons and an optional seven-band graphic equalizer. Also in 1994, the fourth-generation convertible was available; every Firebird (and Camaro) convertible featured a glass rear window with a built-in electric defroster.\n\nThe 1995 models were the same as those of previous years, but traction control (ASR: acceleration slip regulation) was available for LT1 Firebirds, controlled by a switch on the console. The steering wheels in all Firebirds was also changed; their optional built-in audio controls were more closely grouped on each side. The \"Trans Am GT\" trim level was dropped from the lineup after its model year run in 1994. For 1995, all Trans Ams received 155-mph speedometers and Z-rated tires. 1995 was also the first year of the vented version of the Opti-Spark distributors on LT1 F-cars, addressing a common mechanical fault with the unit. The 'transmission perform' button was available only in the 1994 and 1995 Formula and Trans Am. This option was stopped for the 1996 and later models, but the unused connections remain available for 1996 and 1997 Formula and Trans Am. While 1995 cars still used the OBD-I (on-board diagnostic) computer system (the last year of any American car including the F-body to use OBD-I), a majority of them had OBD-II connector ports under the dash.\n\nFirebird performance levels improved for 1996, with the establishment of the stronger 200-hp 3.8 L V6 as the new base engine, and the power rating of the LT1 increased to 285 for 1996, due to its new dual catalytic-converter exhaust system. 1996 was also the first model year of the OBD-II computer system. Optional performance enhancements were available for each Firebird trim level; the Y87 performance packages for V6s added mechanical features of the V8 setups, such as four-wheel disc brakes, faster-response steering, limited-slip rear differential, and dual tailpipes.<ref name=\"Flammang\"/>{{rp|904}} For Formulas and Trans Ams, functional dual-inlet \"Ram Air\" hoods returned as part of the WS6 performance package. The optional package boosted rated horsepower from 285 to 305, and torque from 325&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft to 335. Also included were 17\" x 9\" wheels with 275/40ZR17 tires, suspension improvements, oval dual tailpipe tips, and a WS6 badge. Bilstein shocks were a further option with the package.\n\nThe 1997 model year introduced standard air conditioning, daytime running lamps (utilizing the front turnsignal lamps), digital odometers, and optional 500-watt Monsoon cassette or compact disc stereo systems to all Firebird trim levels.<ref name=\"Flammang\"/>{{rp|907}} For V6 Firebirds, a W68 sport appearance package was also introduced as a counterpart to the Camaro RS trim level. The WS6 \"Ram Air\" performance package was now also an option for the Formula and Trans Am convertibles, although these convertibles did not receive the 17-inch wheel-and-tire combination. There were 41 Formula convertibles and 463 Trans Am convertibles produced from 1996 to 1997 with the WS6 package.\n\n===1998\u20132002===\n[[File:30th Anniversary Trans Am.jpg|thumb|The 1999 30th Anniversary Trans Am]]\n[[File:Joe Aquilante SCCA Pocono Raceway 1999.jpeg|thumb|Joe Aquilante on the front stretch of Pocono Raceway 1999, to become SCCA national champ in T-1]]\n\nIn 1997, in relation to the Camaro, the Firebird received a mid-cycle refresh for 1998 model year. Major changes included a new hood and front fascia with dual intakes, retracting quad halogen headlights, circular turnsignal and fog lamps, a front license plate pocket, lower fender air vents, unified-style lower door raised lettering for each trim level, and a new \"honeycomb\" rear light panel, with circular reverse lamps. In the dashboard, \"next generation\" reduced-force dual airbags became standard. As before, the Formula and Trans Am again received a close derivative of the Corvette's 5.7 L V8, the LS1 of the [[Chevrolet Corvette C5|C5 Corvette]], as the LT1 (and LT4) V8s were discontinued.<ref name=\"Flammang\"/>{{rp|911}} The LS1 Firebirds were also equipped with an aluminum driveshaft, replacing the previous steel version, while all Firebird trim levels gained four-wheel disc brakes with dual-piston front calipers and larger rotors at each wheel, complete with a solenoid-based Bosch anti-lock system. The Formula convertible was no longer offered.\n\nBeginning in 1998 for 1999 models, a standard 16.8-gallon non-metallic fuel tank increased potential traveling range. GM's ASR traction control system was extended to the V6-powered Firebirds, and all LS1 (V8) and Y87 (V6) Firebirds also received a Zexel/Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle. An electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for improved brake performance. An enhanced sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) recorded vehicle speed, engine rpm, throttle position and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment.<ref name=\"Flammang\"/>{{rp|915}} In 1999, a [[Hurst Performance|Hurst]] shifter for variants with the 6-speed manual and a power steering cooler became options for LS1 Firebirds.\n\nIn 2000, the WS6 performance package was available exclusively for 2001 model year Trans Am coupe and convertible variants.\n\nFor 2002, more convenience items such as power mirrors and power antenna became standard equipment, while cassette stereos were phased out.\n\n===Special editions===\n'''Firehawk'''\nThe special-edition extra-performance Firehawk (available in Formula trim for 1993\u20131997, and again in both Formula and Trans Am trims for 1999\u20132002) was produced by SLP Engineering, Inc., and sold through Pontiac dealerships. Featuring 17-inch wheels with namesake [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Firehawk 275/40ZR17 tires along with a functional twin-inlet hood above a specific air cleaner box, its rated power increased to {{cvt|300|hp|0|abbr=}} and 330&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (445 Nm) of torque. A total of 201 Firehawks were built for 1993. In 1994, the Firehawk package was expanded to include options for a suspension upgrade as well as a larger-diameter exhaust system that could boost power to 315&nbsp;hp. T-top Formula coupes and convertibles could also be optioned as Firehawks beginning in 1995. For 1996 and 1997, the Firehawk gained rectangular driving lights mounted inside the front scoops and (except Firehawk convertibles) the Trans Am's elevated rear wing. In 1997, an LT4 Firehawk was also available, utilizing the same 330&nbsp;hp, balanced-and-blueprinted LT4 V8 engine as found in the manual-transmission 1996 Corvette. A total of 29 LT4-powered Firehawks were produced.\n\nPower levels for the 1999 Firehawk, powered by the LS1 V8, rose to 327&nbsp;hp (330 in 2000, 335 in 2001, and 345 in late 2002 models equipped with the \"Blackwing\" intake). A 10th-anniversary Firehawk was available in 2001, distinguished as a black Trans Am coupe with gold-painted hood stripes, gold 17-inch wheels, and gold tailpipe tips.\n\n'''1994 Trans Am GT'''\nIn 1994 only, a \"Trans Am GT\" option was available. Trans Am GTs did not receive any special badging, graphics, or emblems, and looked externally identical to the base Trans Am cars. The GT package included 245/50ZR16 tires and a 155-mph speedometer. Non-GT optioned Trans Ams in 1994 received 235/55R16 tires, a 115-mph speedometer, and a much lower top-speed limiter. The \"highrise spoiler\", leather, and T-tops were not standard on the Trans Am GT cars in 1994, nor any year of LT1 Trans Am. RPO code T43 \"uplevel spoiler\" was an option on all Trans Ams, and while the mass majority of 1994 Trans Am GT cars received the T43 spoiler (along with the majority of all 1993\u2013'97 Trans Ams), it was not part of the Trans Am GT package. Both base Trans Ams and Trans am GTs could be ordered as coupe, T-top, or convertible versions and were both available with automatic or manual transmissions. While the GT package was a cost option on the 1994 Trans Am, a majority of 1994 Trans Ams were made with the GT package.\n\nAll of the 1994 Trans Am GT options became standard in 1995\u20132002 as part of the Trans Am package, and the GT name/package was dropped for 1995. Some of the early fourth-generation Trans Am and Formula Firebirds list \"GT\" on the vehicle's title or registration. The reason behind this is because the VIN does not specify a \"package\" (Formula, Trans Am, Trans Am GT, Firehawk, etc.); it only specifies the engine (5.7L V8 LT1). Because the title is based on the VIN alone, titles and registrations often list all of the packages, but it does not mean the car is equipped with any certain package.\n\n'''1994 25th-Anniversary Trans Am'''\nThe 1994 model year marked the 25th anniversary of the Trans Am, and another anniversary edition was released, painted white with a single dark blue stripe down the center of the vehicle that was reminiscent of the 1970 Trans Am. It also featured white-painted, five-spoke, 16-inch alloy wheels, and white leather seats and door trim. This edition was available in either coupe or convertible form.\n\n'''1999 30th-Anniversary Trans Am'''\nAs with the previous 25th-anniversary edition, the 30th-anniversary edition was either a white WS6 convertible or WS6 T-top coupe, with twin dark blue stripes from hood to tail, and distinct blue anodized five-spoke 17-inch alloy A-mold wheels, with white leather seats and door trim.\n[[File:2002 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am Collector's Edition Convertible (23500415186).jpg|thumb|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am Collector's Edition convertible]]\n\n2001 was the 75th anniversary of Pontiac. An available 75th Anniversary Package incorporated a power and performance package that included power door locks including retained accessory power, power windows including express down drivers side, dual power sport mirrors, power antenna. Radio, ETR AM/FM stereo w/CD player and 7 band graphic equalizer inc clock seek up/down, remote cd pre-wiring Monsoon 500 watt peak power with 10 speaker premium sound system and steering wheel leather wrapped w/driver touch radio controls.

In 2001 the dealer price for this 75th Anniversary package was $4530.00. There were a total of 472 of these packages sold in 2001, #239 on the L36 Firebird, 231 on the Formula W66 Coupe, 5 on Formula Firehawks and 2 on Trans-Ams\u2014making these editions quite rare.<ref>[http://www.transamworld.com/break-down.htm \"4th Gen Firebird Breakdown Numbers\"].

Retrieved July 23, 2017.</ref> Manufacturer original window stickers included this as a separate package listing the items and one price.\n\n'''2002 Collector's Edition Trans Am'''\nFor the Firebird's final year, a collector's edition Trans Am was released as either a yellow WS6 convertible or WS6 t-top coupe, with twin black stripes from hood to tail, black-painted five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels, and further black-trimmed body details.\n\n=== Engines ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size||95%;\"\n| 1993|| [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#3.4|{{convert|3.4|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L32 V6]]|| [[GM LT engine#LT1|5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8]] (iron block, aluminum heads)\n|-\n| 1994|| {{convert|3.4|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L32 V6|| 5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8 (iron block, aluminum heads)\n|-\n| 1995|| {{convert|3.4|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L32 V6|| [[GM 3800 engine#Series II|{{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6]] (California Only)|| 5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8 (iron block, aluminum heads)\n|-\n| 1996|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8 (iron block, aluminum heads)\n|-\n| 1997|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 350 CID LT1 V8 (iron block, aluminum heads) || [[GM LT engine#LT4|5.7L 350 CID LT4 V8]] (iron block, aluminum heads) in Firehawk by SLP\n|-\n| 1998|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| [[GM LS engine|5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8]] (aluminum block and heads)\n|-\n| 1999|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8 (aluminum block and heads)\n|-\n| 2000|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8 (aluminum block and heads)\n|-\n| 2001|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8 (aluminum block and heads)\n|-\n| 2002|| {{convert|3.8|L|CID|1|abbr=on}} L36 V6|| 5.7L 346 CID LS1 V8 (aluminum block and heads)\n|}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Firebird Trans Am ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name=Pontiac Firebird Trans Am\n| image=File:2002 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am WS6.JPG\n| production = 1969\u20132002\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = [[Pony car]], [[Muscle car]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]] 1969, 1987\u20131989 Pontiac sanctioned special edition, 1991\u20131992, 1994\u20132002<br/>2-door [[coupe]] 1969\u20132002\n| platform = [[GM F platform|F-body]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|FR layout]]\n}}\n\n[[File:'72 Pontiac Trans Am (Auto classique).JPG|thumb|right|1972 Pontiac Trans Am]]\n[[File:Pontiac Trans Am (Orange Julep).JPG|thumb|right|1974 Pontiac Trans Am]]\n[[File:Pontiac Firebird Trans Am (Orange Julep).jpg|thumb|right|1978 Pontiac Trans Am]]\n[[File:1981 Pontiac Trans Am 1.jpg|thumb|right|1981 Pontiac Turbo Trans Am]]\n[[File:'87 Pontiac Trans Am (Auto classique).JPG|thumb|right|1987 Pontiac Trans Am]]\n[[File:KITT Universal Studios.jpg|thumb|right|A modified 3rd generation Trans Am used as [[KITT]] ]]\n\nThe Trans Am was a specialty package for the Firebird, typically upgrading [[Car handling|handling]], [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and [[horsepower]], as well as minor appearance modifications such as exclusive [[Hood (vehicle)|hoods]], [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoilers]], fog lights and wheels. Four distinct generations were produced between 1969 and 2002. These cars were built on the [[GM F platform|F-body platform]], which was also shared by the [[Chevrolet Camaro]].\n\nDespite its name, the Trans Am was not initially used in the [[Trans Am Series]], as its smallest engine exceeded the SCCA's five liter displacement limit.\n\nThe second generation was available from 1970 to 1981 and was featured in the 1977 movie ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'',  the 1978 movie ''[[Hooper (film)|Hooper]]'', the 1979 movie ''[[Rocky II]]'', and the 1980 movie ''[[Smokey and the Bandit II]]''.  The Firebird Trans Am was also selected as the Official Pace Car for the [[1980 Indianapolis 500]].  The third generation, available from 1982 to 1992, was featured in the 1983 movie ''[[Smokey and the Bandit Part 3]]'' and the 1984 movie ''[[Alphabet City (film)|Alphabet City]]''. [[KITT]], the automotive star, and its evil twin counterpart [[KARR (Knight Rider)|KARR]], of the popular 1980s TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', was a modified third-generation Trans Am. The fourth-generation Trans Am, available from model years 1993 to 2002, offered between {{convert|275|and|325|bhp|abbr=on}}. The fictional character [[Dwight Schrute]] from NBC's show ''[[The Office (American TV series)|The Office]]'', is another famous driver of the 1987 model.\n\nThe Trans Am GTA (Gran Turismo Americano) was an options package available on the Firebird Trans Am which added gold 16-inch diamond-spoke alloy wheels, a mono-chromatic paint scheme and special cloisonn\u00e9 GTA badges. The GTA (along with the Formula model that was intended to fill the gap between the base model Firebird and mid-level Trans Am) was the brainchild of former Pontiac marketing manager Lou Wassel. It was intended to be the \"ultimate\" Trans Am and was the most expensive Firebird available. The GTA equipment package officially went on sale in 1987 and avoided a gas-guzzler tax thanks to its lightweight PW 16-inch gold cross-lace wheels. The high-performance WS6 suspension package was also re-tuned to offer a more compliant ride while still maintaining tight handling characteristics. Engine choices consisted of a L98 5.7 liter (350 ci) TPI  V8 mated to GM's corporate 700R4 automatic transmission or the 5.0 liter (305 ci) TPI V8. A five-speed manual was available but was mated to the 5.0 liter only. The GTA trim level was available from 1987 through the 1992 model year.\n\nFor 1989, the 20th anniversary turbo Trans Am project (originally conceived by Bill Owen of Pontiac) was outsourced to PAS, Inc., an engineering firm led by Jeff Beitzel. Beitzel and his team did most of the TTA development work. The 3.8 liter turbocharged V6 engines were built by PAS at their 40,000 square foot City of Industry, CA plant. From there, they went to GM's plant in Van Nuys, CA to be installed into GTAs on the F-Body assembly line. The cars were then shipped back to PAS for final assembly, testing, and quality control. Incidentally, the GTA chassis were selected at random, thus there is no correlation between the VIN and production sequence number. The initial number of cars to be produced had ranged from 500 to 2,500 until GM finally settled on 1,500. In all, a total of 1,555 Turbo Trans Ams were manufactured.  One of these served as the [[1989 Indianapolis 500]] pace car.\n\nThe 2002 model-year WS6 Trans Am produced {{cvt|325|hp|0|abbr=}} at 5,200 rpm and {{cvt|350|lbft|0|abbr=}} of torque at 4,000 rpm out of its 5.7-liter LS1 V8 engine.<ref>[http://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/2002/Pontiac/FIREBIRD-V8-6-Spd-AT/Coupe-2D-Trans-Am-WS6/Specs] 2002 Pontiac FIREBIRD-V8-6 Spd./AT\nCoupe 2D Trans Am WS6 \u2013 NADAGuides</ref>  A completely-stock WS6 completed the \u00bc\u2014mile in 13.16 seconds at 106.05&nbsp;mph on Eagle F1 street tires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.streetfire.net/video/s...ws6_178072.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527215646/http://www.streetfire.net/video/s...ws6_178072.htm |archivedate=2014-05-27 }} Stock 2002 Trans Am WS6 at the track \u2013 StreetFire</ref>\n\n=== Engines ===\n\n==== First generation ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size||95%;\"\n|1969|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air III V8]] {{convert|335|bhp|abbr=on}}|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air IV V8]] {{convert|345|bhp|abbr=on}}|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air V V8]] (rare dealer-installed option) {{convert|500|bhp|abbr=on|0}}{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n|}\n\n==== Second generation ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size||95%;\"\n| 1970|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air III 345hp V8]]|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air IV 370hp V8]]|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#Ram Air|{{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac Ram Air V V8]] There are no known 1970 Trans Ams with the Ram Air V, no complete engines were ever sold or shipped to dealers, but the parts needed to build one could be ordered over-the-counter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallaceracing.com/RAV-story-page1.html |title=Pontiac Ram Air V Story |work=Wallace Racing |date= |accessdate=October 21, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1971|| [[Pontiac V8 engine#455|{{convert|455|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} Pontiac H.O.

When the Firebird Trans Am was released, there was controversy over the model's inability to compete in the Trans-Am because the smallest available engine was too large for use in the series at 400 cubic inches (6.6 liters). The name also caused controversy because it was used without permission from the [[SCCA]], who threatened suit. GM settled the dispute by paying $5 to the SCCA for each car they sold. When the Trans-Am was last seen, model year 2002 Firebirds were in use. From 1996 to 2006, a WS6 Trans Am coupe provided the body style for the mechanically identical racing cars used in the [[International Race of Champions]] (IROC).\n\nDuring the 1995, 1996, and 1997 [[NHRA]] seasons, 14-time [[funny car]] champion [[John Force]] used a Firebird body to replace the obsolete [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] and [[Chevrolet Lumina]] bodies he had used since 1988. He used it for three seasons, winning the championship in all three years. The Firebird was also used by drivers such as Del Worsham, Tim Wilkerson, Frank Pedregon, and Jerry Toliver. The Firebird body also replaced the Oldsmobile Cutlass in the pro stock class in 1995, forcing drivers [[Warren Johnson]], Jerry Eckman, and Mark Pawuk to replace their body styles for the 1996 year.

Peter Iliff. It stars [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Lori Petty]] and [[Gary Busey]], and the film's title refers to the [[surfing]] term \"[[point break]]\", where a wave breaks as it hits a point of land jutting out from the coastline.\n\nThe film features Reeves as an undercover FBI agent tasked with investigating the identities of a group of bank robbers, who then develops a complex relationship with the group's leader.\n\nDevelopment of ''Point Break'' began in 1986, when Iliff wrote an initial treatment for the film. Bigelow soon developed the script with husband [[James Cameron]], and filming took place four years later. It was shot across the western coast of the continental United States and was officially \nbudgeted at $24 million, before being released for traditional viewing on July 12, 1991.\n\n''Point Break'' opened to generally positive critical reception, with critics praising the relationship between Reeves and Swayze. During its theatrical run, the film grossed over $83.5 million, and has since gained a [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/with-the-point-break-remake-ive-reached-a-breaking-point/article27923389/|title=With the Point Break remake, I've reached a breaking point|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-point-break-new-movie-plot-surfing-flying-20151029-story.html|title='Point Break' remake looks to make a cult classic new, and serious|first=Steven|last=Zeitchik|publisher=}}</ref> Following the film's success, ''Point Break'' was re-released on [[Blu-ray]] on June 14, 2011; it also spawned a [[Point Break (2015 film)|remake]] that was released in 2015 to negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] quarterback and rookie [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Johnny Utah assists experienced agent Angelo Pappas in investigating a string of bank robberies by the \"Ex-Presidents\": a gang of robbers who wear rubber masks of [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and [[Jimmy Carter]]. Rather than robbing the vault, they only demand the cash the tellers have in their drawers, and are gone within ninety seconds.\n\nPursuing Pappas's theory that the criminals are surfers, Utah goes [[Undercover operation|undercover]] to infiltrate the surfing community. He fabricates a personal family tragedy to persuade orphaned surfer Tyler Endicott to teach him to surf, after she saves him from drowning during his first attempt at [[surfing]]. Through her, he meets Bodhi, the charismatic leader of a gang of surfers consisting of Roach, Grommet, and Nathanial. The group are initially wary of Utah, but accept him when Bodhi recognizes him as the former college football star. As he masters surfing, Utah finds himself increasingly drawn to the surfers' adrenaline-charged lifestyle, Bodhi's philosophies, and Tyler. Following a clue retrieved by analyzing toxins found in the hair of one of the bank robbers, Utah and Pappas lead an FBI raid on another gang of surfers, resulting in the deaths of two of them. The raid inadvertently ruins a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] undercover operation, as those surfers were wanted for separate charges, but they are disproven to be the Ex-Presidents.\n\nWatching Bodhi's group surfing, Utah begins to suspect that they are the \"Ex-Presidents\", noting how close a group they are and the way one of them [[Mooning|moons]] everyone in the same manner one of the robbers does when leaving a bank. Utah and Pappas stake out a bank and the Ex-Presidents appear. While wearing a Reagan mask, the gang leader (implied to be Bodhi) leads Utah on a foot chase through the neighborhood, which ends when Utah's old knee injury flares up after jumping into an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]. Despite having a clear shot, Utah does not shoot and the leader escapes.\n\nAt a campfire that night, it is confirmed that Bodhi and his gang are the Ex-Presidents. Tyler discovers Utah's FBI badge and angrily terminates their relationship after briefly holding him at gunpoint. Shortly afterwards, Bodhi aggressively recruits Utah into going skydiving with the group and he accepts. After the jump, Bodhi reveals that he knows Utah is an FBI agent and has arranged for his friend Rosie, a non-surfing thug, to hold Tyler hostage. Utah is blackmailed into participating in the Ex-Presidents' last bank robbery of the summer. As a result, Grommet, along with an off-duty police officer and a bank guard\u2014who both attempt to foil the robbery\u2014are killed. Outraged by Grommet's death, Bodhi knocks Utah out and leaves the scene.\n\nDefying their superior who arrests Utah for armed robbery, Pappas and Utah head to the airport where Bodhi, Roach, and Nathanial are about to leave for Mexico. During a shootout, Pappas and Nathanial are killed and Roach is seriously wounded. With Roach aboard, Bodhi forces Utah onto the plane at gunpoint. Once airborne and over their intended drop zone, Bodhi and Roach put on their parachutes and jump from the plane, leaving Utah to take the blame. With no other parachutes available, Utah jumps from the plane with Bodhi's gun and intercepts him. After landing safely, Utah's knee gives out again, allowing Bodhi to escape Utah's grasp. Bodhi meets with Rosie and releases Tyler. Roach dies of his wounds, and Bodhi and Rosie leave with the money, with Tyler and Johnny watching on. \n\nNine months later, Utah tracks Bodhi to [[Bells Beach]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], where a record storm is producing lethal waves. This is an event Bodhi had talked about experiencing, calling it the \"50-Year Storm\". Utah attempts to bring Bodhi into custody, but Bodhi refuses. During a brawl in the surf, Utah manages to handcuff himself to Bodhi, who begs Utah to release him so he can ride the once-in-a-lifetime wave. Knowing Bodhi will not come back alive, Utah releases him, bids him farewell, and sees him step towards the wave. While the authorities watch Bodhi surf to his death, Utah walks away, throwing his FBI badge into the ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Bodhi\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Johnny Utah\n* [[Gary Busey]] as Angelo Pappas\n* [[Lori Petty]] as Tyler Endicott\n* [[John C.

Many celebrities, including [[Dominic Monaghan]], [[Mo Rocca]], [[Michael Ian Black]], [[Hal Sparks]], and [[Chris Pontius]], commented about the film and why it deserved to be included in the episode.

In a discussion on the benefits of surfing and the connection of surfers to the universe, the character Dr. [[Larry Fleinhardt]] quotes [[Timothy Leary]]. In response, the character [[Colby Granger]] retorts: \"It's dancing with the universe.\" Confused, Fleinhardt asks who said that, to which Granger replies: \"Bodhi...Patrick Swayze?...from ''Point Break''...?\"\n\nIn the French language comedy ''[[Brice de Nice]]'', and its sequel ''[[Brice 3]]'', both starring [[Jean Dujardin]], the hero of the film is a surfer from Nice who idolizes Bodhi and ''Point Break''.

Peter Iliff. It stars [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Lori Petty]] and [[Gary Busey]], and the film's title refers to the [[surfing]] term \"[[point break]]\", where a wave breaks as it hits a point of land jutting out from the coastline.\n\nThe film features Reeves as an undercover FBI agent tasked with investigating the identities of a group of bank robbers, who then develops a complex relationship with the group's leader.\n\nDevelopment of ''Point Break'' began in 1986, when Iliff wrote an initial treatment for the film. Bigelow soon developed the script with husband [[James Cameron]], and filming took place four years later. It was shot across the western coast of the continental United States and was officially \nbudgeted at $24 million, before being released for traditional viewing on July 12, 1991.\n\n''Point Break'' opened to generally positive critical reception, with critics praising the relationship between Reeves and Swayze. During its theatrical run, the film grossed over $83.5 million, and has since gained a [[cult status|cult following]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/with-the-point-break-remake-ive-reached-a-breaking-point/article27923389/|title=With the Point Break remake, I've reached a breaking point|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-point-break-new-movie-plot-surfing-flying-20151029-story.html|title='Point Break' remake looks to make a cult classic new, and serious|first=Steven|last=Zeitchik|publisher=}}</ref> Following the film's success, ''Point Break'' was re-released on [[Blu-ray]] on June 14, 2011; it also spawned a [[Point Break (2015 film)|remake]] that was released in 2015 to negative reviews.\n\n==Plot==\nFormer [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] quarterback and rookie [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Johnny Utah assists experienced agent Angelo Pappas in investigating a string of bank robberies by the \"Ex-Presidents\": a gang of robbers who wear rubber masks of [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and [[Jimmy Carter]]. Rather than robbing the vault, they only demand the cash the tellers have in their drawers, and are gone within ninety seconds.\n\nPursuing Pappas's theory that the criminals are surfers, Utah goes [[Undercover operation|undercover]] to infiltrate the surfing community. He fabricates a personal family tragedy to persuade orphaned surfer Tyler Endicott to teach him to surf, after she saves him from drowning during his first attempt at [[surfing]]. Through her, he meets Bodhi, the charismatic leader of a gang of surfers consisting of Roach, Grommet, and Nathanial. The group are initially wary of Utah, but accept him when Bodhi recognizes him as the former college football star. As he masters surfing, Utah finds himself increasingly drawn to the surfers' adrenaline-charged lifestyle, Bodhi's philosophies, and Tyler. Following a clue retrieved by analyzing toxins found in the hair of one of the bank robbers, Utah and Pappas lead an FBI raid on another gang of surfers, resulting in the deaths of two of them. The raid inadvertently ruins a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] undercover operation, as those surfers were wanted for separate charges, but they are disproven to be the Ex-Presidents.\n\nWatching Bodhi's group surfing, Utah begins to suspect that they are the \"Ex-Presidents\", noting how close a group they are and the way one of them [[Mooning|moons]] everyone in the same manner one of the robbers does when leaving a bank. Utah and Pappas stake out a bank and the Ex-Presidents appear. While wearing a Reagan mask, the gang leader (implied to be Bodhi) leads Utah on a foot chase through the neighborhood, which ends when Utah's old knee injury flares up after jumping into an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]. Despite having a clear shot, Utah does not shoot and the leader escapes.\n\nAt a campfire that night, it is confirmed that Bodhi and his gang are the Ex-Presidents. Tyler discovers Utah's FBI badge and angrily terminates their relationship after briefly holding him at gunpoint. Shortly afterwards, Bodhi aggressively recruits Utah into going skydiving with the group and he accepts. After the jump, Bodhi reveals that he knows Utah is an FBI agent and has arranged for his friend Rosie, a non-surfing thug, to hold Tyler hostage. Utah is blackmailed into participating in the Ex-Presidents' last bank robbery of the summer. As a result, Grommet, along with an off-duty police officer and a bank guard\u2014who both attempt to foil the robbery\u2014are killed. Outraged by Grommet's death, Bodhi knocks Utah out and leaves the scene.\n\nDefying their superior who arrests Utah for armed robbery, Pappas and Utah head to the airport where Bodhi, Roach, and Nathanial are about to leave for Mexico. During a shootout, Pappas and Nathanial are killed and Roach is seriously wounded. With Roach aboard, Bodhi forces Utah onto the plane at gunpoint. Once airborne and over their intended drop zone, Bodhi and Roach put on their parachutes and jump from the plane, leaving Utah to take the blame. With no other parachutes available, Utah jumps from the plane with Bodhi's gun and intercepts him. After landing safely, Utah's knee gives out again, allowing Bodhi to escape Utah's grasp. Bodhi meets with Rosie and releases Tyler. Roach dies of his wounds, and Bodhi and Rosie leave with the money, with Tyler and Johnny watching on. \n\nNine months later, Utah tracks Bodhi to [[Bells Beach]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]], where a record storm is producing lethal waves. This is an event Bodhi had talked about experiencing, calling it the \"50-Year Storm\". Utah attempts to bring Bodhi into custody, but Bodhi refuses. During a brawl in the surf, Utah manages to handcuff himself to Bodhi, who begs Utah to release him so he can ride the once-in-a-lifetime wave. Knowing Bodhi will not come back alive, Utah releases him, bids him farewell, and sees him step towards the wave. While the authorities watch Bodhi surf to his death, Utah walks away, throwing his FBI badge into the ocean.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Patrick Swayze]] as Bodhi\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as Johnny Utah\n* [[Gary Busey]] as Angelo Pappas\n* [[Lori Petty]] as Tyler Endicott\n* [[John C.

In it, Utah jumps out of a plane without a parachute to catch Bodhi and rescue Tyler. Utah catches up with Bodhi and holds a gun to his head. However, Bodhi refuses to pull the rip cord and Utah must decide between dropping his gun (so he can hold on and pull the rip cord) or letting the two fall to the ground. The film ultimately won \"Most Desirable Male\" for Keanu Reeves.\n\n==Cult status==\n''[[The A.V.

Many celebrities, including [[Dominic Monaghan]], [[Mo Rocca]], [[Michael Ian Black]], [[Hal Sparks]], and [[Chris Pontius]], commented about the film and why it deserved to be included in the episode.

The scene was also tested by the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''[[MythBusters]]''. It was determined that Utah and Bodhi would not have been able to [[free-fall]] for 90 seconds (as in the film), nor would they have been able to hold a conversation in mid-air. However, it was determined that, by streamlining his body, Utah could have conceivably caught up with Bodhi after jumping from the plane.<ref>See [[MythBusters (2007 season)#Point Break Trilogy]]</ref>\n\n''Point Break'' has been referenced in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films twice, in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', by [[Tony Stark]] calling [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] \"Point Break\" in reference to his long, blond hairstyle, similar to Swayze's character's.\n\n''Point Break'' is referenced on the CBS television program ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', at the end of the episode entitled \"Charlie Don't Surf\" (05.7). In a discussion on the benefits of surfing and the connection of surfers to the universe, the character Dr. [[Larry Fleinhardt]] quotes [[Timothy Leary]]. In response, the character [[Colby Granger]] retorts: \"It's dancing with the universe.\" Confused, Fleinhardt asks who said that, to which Granger replies: \"Bodhi...Patrick Swayze?...from ''Point Break''...?\"\n\nIn the French language comedy ''[[Brice de Nice]]'', and its sequel ''[[Brice 3]]'', both starring [[Jean Dujardin]], the hero of the film is a surfer from Nice who idolizes Bodhi and ''Point Break''. In the first film, Brice robs a bank wearing a [[Charles de Gaulle]] mask, parodying the masks worn by Bodhi\u2019s gang of bank robbers.\n\nSeattle-based [[Georgetown Brewing Company]] brews a \"Bodhizafa\" IPA and a \"Johnny Utah\" pale ale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://georgetownbeer.com/beer/details/bodhizafa-ipa|title=Georgetown Brewing Company &#124; Darn Tasty Beer.|website=georgetownbeer.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://georgetownbeer.com/beer/details/johnny-utah|title=Georgetown Brewing Company &#124; Darn Tasty Beer.|website=georgetownbeer.com}}</ref>\n\n==Remake==\n[[Alcon Entertainment]] and [[Warner Bros.]] released a remake of the film in 2015 titled ''[[Point Break (2015 film)|Point Break]]'', which received mostly negative reviews.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cult movies]]\n* [[List of cult films]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0102685|Point Break}}\n* {{Mojo title|pointbreak|Point Break}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|point_break|Point Break}}\n* {{Metacritic film|point-break-1991|Point Break}}\n\n{{Kathryn Bigelow}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Point Break (1991 Film)}}\n[[Category:1991 films]]\n[[Category:American films]] <!-- http://www.allmovie.com/movie/point-break-v38541 -->\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:1990s action thriller films]] <!-- http://www.allmovie.com/movie/point-break-v38541 -->\n[[Category:1990s heist films]]\n[[Category:American buddy cop films]]\n[[Category:American action adventure films]]\n[[Category:American action thriller films]]\n[[Category:American heist films]]\n[[Category:1990s buddy cop films]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Lyndon B.
