After its third season, The WB and [[United Paramount Network|UPN]] merged to form [[The CW]], which then became the broadcaster for the show in the United States. Schwahn served as executive producer while also writing and directing for the show, including the premieres and finales of all seasons.\n\nThe show began with nine main characters in its first season as the roles of Lucas Scott, Nathan Scott, Peyton Sawyer, Brooke Davis, Haley James, Dan Scott, Karen Roe, Keith Scott, and Whitey Durham. After that, characters from that first season left the show, with new main characters having been both written in and out of the series. Originally, it followed two half-brothers Lucas and Nathan Scott who started out as enemies but later formed a close bond as brothers. It also followed the brothers' various relationships with other female leads during their high-school years and in their early twenties. The series ultimately spanned nearly fifteen years across nine seasons, with various time jumps taken into account.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n==Casting==\n[[Chad Michael Murray]] was the first person to be cast for ''One Tree Hill.''<ref name=\"casting\">{{cite video |title=Building a Winning Team: The Making of One Tree Hill |medium=[[Documentary film|Documentary]] |location=[[One Tree Hill DVD releases#Season one|One Tree Hill: The Complete First Season]]'' |publisher=[[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> The producers were originally unsure as to who Murray would play. Series creator [[Mark Schwahn]] wanted him to play the character of [[Nathan Scott]] since Murray had played a bad guy several times before, he felt it was only natural to give him this role.<ref name=\"casting\"/> Murray, however, wanted to portray Lucas due to a connection he felt with the character. He felt that he could inhabit the character as the two share several similarities. Murray's mother left him when he was young, and Lucas was abandoned by his father .

When Nathan asks Haley to tutor him in school because his low grades are putting him in danger of getting kicked off the basketball team and he hopes to further bother Lucas by hanging out with Lucas' best friend, she initially resists knowing that it would anger Lucas. However, Haley changes her mind and promises Nathan that if he leaves Lucas alone she will tutor him and Nathan agrees. When Lucas finds out about this, he is very angry with Haley, until Haley tells him about the deal she made with Nathan. While Haley tutors Nathan, they grow very close and eventually fall in love.

Paul Johansson Returning for Final Season of One Tree Hill|date=July 18, 2011|work=E! Online|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> Daniel Robert \"Dan\" Scott is the original villain in Tree Hill. Dan is the ex-husband of Deb Lee and the father of Nathan and Lucas Scott. Originally wanting nothing to do with Lucas, he begins to want a part in Lucas's life. We find out that not only has Dan been following Lucas all his life, but that he wanted joint custody of Lucas but Karen refused. Lucas later moves in with Dan after learning that he has Dan's heart condition as it's the only way he could afford the medication. When Lucas fails Dan's test, he takes away Lucas's college fund which he had started when Lucas was a baby. He hired a woman (Jules) to make Keith fall in love with her as revenge for sleeping with Deb. Jules actually falls in love with Keith but leaves him on the altar after being threatened by Karen. Deb attempts to murder Dan by burning down his dealership. Dan, thinking it was Keith, shoots Keith and lets Jimmy Edwards take the blame as Jimmy committed suicide. Lucas gradually accepts Dan as his dad until he finds out what he did to Keith. Dan, realizing Nathan will never forgive him, turns himself in to the police. He then spends almost five years in prison and doesn't get out until Lucas' and Lindsey's wedding day.\n\nAfter prison, Dan becomes close with Nathan's son Jamie.

He shoots Carrie and she is believed to be dead. When Jamie finds out what he did, he at first stops talking to Dan. Dan leaves Tree Hill to die as he does not think he will be able to find a new heart since one became available while he was being held hostage and he lost out on it. In the year time gap between seasons six and seven, Dan married Rachel, who takes him to Mexico and illegally buys a heart. After realizing the type of person Rachel is when she wants to take their TV show to the corridor where he murdered Keith, he gives all his money to charity and divorces her. Before leaving Tree Hill once again, he says goodbye to Jamie, who tells him he forgives him. He is seen working in a burger joint, where he is visited by Quinn for help with murdering Katie, but he ends up talking her out of it. He appears shortly in the season eight finale when Nathan gives him a photograph of Lydia and a baseball that Jamie hit in a game. Dan returns in season nine because he loses everything when his diner burns down. He convinces Haley to let him stay with them for a few days, saying he has nowhere else to go. A flash-forward sequence shows Dan with Chris Keller, burning down a house and apparently ready to kill someone. When Nathan is kidnapped, Haley seeks help from Dan who promises her that he will do whatever it takes to bring him back home. Eventually, Dan finds him and he ends up taking a bullet meant for Nathan which critically wounds him. At the hospital, Haley tells Dan that Lucas refuses to come see him. Dan says he's okay with that because he can't blame Lucas for not being there in his final moments when he wasn't there for Lucas his whole life. Dan also makes peace with Haley by saying he's glad he was proven wrong about Haley not being good enough for Nathan as she is the best thing that ever happened to him and apologizes for Keith's murder as Keith also meant a lot to her. Haley lets him hold Lydia and tells Dan that whenever Lydia asks about him, she and Nathan will tell her that he loved her and Jamie very much. Dan also makes amends with Deb and lastly, Nathan (in which Dan has a dream that he and Nathan play basketball just for fun for the first time ever) to which Nathan says that despite all the bad he did, he's still his father and forgives him and Dan dies moments later. Dan is visited by Keith who tells him that he's proud of him for finally learning to put family and friends first and become the brother he always wanted.

She began a serious relationship with Mouth after moving to Tree Hill with Brooke to open a store for \"Clothes Over Bros.\" In season seven after modelling for Brooke, she becomes a full-time model and the face of \"Clothes Over Bros\". This causes her to worry about her weight. As the pressure became too much, she started using cocaine with her new modelling friends. She became a shadow of her former self rejecting Mouth's love and Brooke's friendship. After help from Victoria and Alex, she gets her life back on track and moves back to New York to resume her position as Vice President of the company. She assisted Victoria in forging documents for \"Clothes Over Bros,\" causing Brooke to be arrested when it all came out. Brooke says to her \"the old Millie would have never done this.\" She later falls into bed with Mouth after a drunken night and after a while they get back together. After \"Clothes Over Bros\" closes, she gets a job as a news reporter. At the end of season eight, she and Mouth get their own talk show.

He has gone through life feeling as though he is never good enough as his father had never shown him that he is proud of his achievements. When he first appears he begins a relationship with Peyton when she has broken up with Lucas. After he realizes she will never get over Lucas, he leaves her. Some time after, he heads to Tree Hill to produce a movie version of Lucas's book. At first it seemed like he just wanted Peyton back, but later falls for Brooke as he feels a connection with her as they share a similar past both as footnotes in the Lucas/Peyton love story. In season seven, Julian catches Alex Dupre's eye, a model and actress hired by Brooke for \"Clothes Over Bros.\" Brooke becomes very jealous of the friendship between the two and they break up for a while. After getting back together, the gang take a trip to Utah where Julian proposes to Brooke. She says yes. In season eight, he marries Brooke. Julian and Brooke decide that they want to start a family, so they explore adopting. They meet a nineteen-year-old girl named Chloe. Chloe then decides to give her baby to Brooke and Julian, but once she reconciles with her ex-boyfriend she decides to keep the baby, leaving Julian and Brooke heartbroken. A few weeks later Brooke and Julian decide to move to New York until she discovers they are expecting a baby and decide to stay in Tree Hill. The couple then found out they were expecting twins and after a fall while working they were delivered at seven months and put in a special care unit. At the end of season 8, Julian and Brooke are seen playing at home with their sons, whom they named Jude and Davis. In season nine, Julian accidentally leaves Davis in the car on a hot day and feels extremely guilty for almost killing his son. He carries the guilt around until Brooke forgives him, which allows him to eventually forgive himself. Julian plays a big part in saving Nathan, helping Dan to find and rescue him. Julian also helps Brooke deal with Xavier coming back.\n\n===Clay Evans===\nPlayed by [[Robert Buckley]] from season seven onwards, Clayton \"Clay\" Evans became Nathan's agent and close friend during the time jump of fourteen months between season six and seven. He's also close to Nathan's family, his wife Haley James Scott and their son James Lucas Scott. At first Clay is shown as a flirt and fond of one-night stands. Upon meeting Quinn James, Haley's sister, he's immediately drawn to her but backs off once he learns that she's going through a separation with her husband. In his past, Clay was married to a woman named Sara who died suddenly, leaving Clay emotionally scarred and unable to let go of her. Clay is a loyal friend and helps the Scotts through the Renee scandal but is fired once he fails to re-sign Nathan with the Bobcats. Quinn helps him get his job back and make peace with the loss of his wife so he can move on and the two fall in love.\nIn the season seven finale, both he and Quinn are shot by Clay's stalker, Katie Ryan and left for dead. Clay lingers between life and death with a gunshot wound to the chest and comes close to dying when his organs start to fail, but makes a miraculous recovery after a kidney transplant and awakens with Quinn at his side. He later helps Nathan with a career as a sporting agent.\nWe later find out that Clay in fact fathered a baby with Sara named Logan, who he later meets in a hospital while undergoing counseling for his disease.\nIn the penultimate episode of season 9, Clay proposes to Quinn in Logan's tent, which is set up in the living room. Quinn says yes. In the final episode, Clay and Quinn get married and adopt Logan.\n\n===Quinn James===\n[[File:Shantel VanSanten.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Shantel VanSanten joined the cast in season seven as Haley's sister, Quinn.]]\nPlayed by [[Shantel VanSanten]] since season seven, Quinn Alexandra Evans, (n\u00e9e James, previously Fletcher) is a photographer and the oldest of the James sisters who moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down. She feels that her husband has begun to change and that they no longer have anything in common and later divorces him. She begins a relationship with Nathan's agent Clay. Her younger sister, Taylor, returns to Tree Hill with Quinn's former husband, causing a fight between the sisters. They later make things right before their mother dies of cancer.\n\nQuinn was the first one to be shot by Katie Ryan when she was heading to bed. She and Clay are in limbo while fighting for their lives. Clay tells her that she has to wake up because she is needed, especially by Haley. They confess their love for each other (\"Til kingdom come\") before Quinn wakes up and makes a full recovery, but fears for Clay when Haley tells her that his organs are failing. She visits Clay every day and he awakens with her by his side. Once they return home, Quinn is still haunted by the attack from Katie and keeps a gun hidden. When Clay finds it, he tells her that she should go to Africa for a photography gig because that will save her. She does and when she returns, it's revealed that part of her trip had been spent tracking down Katie as she has numerous photographs of her. She then visits Dan for help in killing her, but backs out at the last minute. Katie however, initiates an attack on Quinn when Clay is out of town but this time it is Quinn who shoots Katie. In season eight, she goes to Brooke's bachelorette party and ends up, after a drunken night, with a tongue piercing, raw meat in her purse and a stolen skateboarding dog. In season nine, Quinn helps Clay with his mental problems and supports Haley when Nathan goes missing. She's quite jarred when Clay reveals he had fathered a son named Logan whose existence he had blocked out of his mind after Sara's death.\n\nIn the penultimate episode of season 9, Clay proposes to Quinn in Logan's tent, set up in the living room. Quinn says yes. In the final episode, Quinn and Clay get married and adopt Logan.\n\n===Alex Dupre===\n\nPortrayed by [[Jana Kramer]] since season seven, Alex Dupre, real name Alice Whitehead, was originally a recurring character, but was moved to starring in the fourteenth episode. She is a fallen starlet whom Millicent hires to be the face of Clothes Over Bro's new line. At first, everyone thinks she is a ditzy and promiscuous girl. She later tries to have Julian produce a movie she scripted (although she at first does not disclose that she wrote it) and butts head with Brooke who sees her as a potential rival for Julian's attention. She almost ruins her chances of working with Julian by making a move on him, but they later reconcile and begin to write a script for a movie. She also jump-starts Millicent's modeling career by drugging another model, leaving Millie to take her spot. She is fired by Brooke when it is revealed she exposed herself to Julian in her hotel room. Later on, Alex and Millie become quite close, and Alex also tries to become close to Julian. When Julian refuses to be with her, she attempts suicide by slitting her wrists. She was hospitalized, and in a coma for a while, but she survives. Eventually, she takes her own place in the Tree Hill crowd, and everyone accepts her. Whilst at the film festival to promote the film she made with Julian, she begins to develop a crush on Chase, who had just broken up with Mia. On the last night, they kiss and then sleep with each other. In the season eight premiere, they have become a couple and Alex flaunts this in front of Mia while Chase teaches her how to bartend. Chase breaks up with her after she lies to him about a new movie project. Alex and Mia later fight over Chase, before it is revealed that he wants to be by himself now. After \"inviting herself\" to Brooke's bachelorette party, while they are all partying and drunk, Alex becomes included within the girls' group. At the end of the episode, she says to Quinn that even though the gang does not like her, she likes them and enjoys spending time with real friends, even though she is not their friend. Quinn then tells her that she considers Alex a friend.\n\n===Chase Adams===\n[[File:Stephen Colletti at the 2012 Comic-Con.jpg|thumb|220px|Stephen Colletti portrays Chase Adams.]]\n[[Stephen Colletti]] portrayed Chase Adams in a recurring role from seasons four till eight, before being upgraded to a regular from the eleventh episode of season eight. He was another member of the Clean Teens who got close to Brooke after she and Rachel joined the Clean Teens. Brooke, after earning a high grade in a test by cheating, agreed to tutor Chase, who initially had no idea of how Brooke really got the grade and they begin to date. When he found out that Brooke cheated he forgave her and they continued to date. Brooke and Chase attended a party at Nathan's mom's house and everyone found out that Nathan and Brooke filmed a sex tape. He visited Brooke while she was setting up for the prom and told her that his ex-girlfriend cheated on him with his best friend. He told her that it's over between them, but he knows how important the prom is to her so they will still go together. Brooke told him it's over because she did not want to be with someone who does not want to be with her. Chase later bumped into Brooke at school, he had been calling her after he heard about her being tied up by Psycho Derek. He was no longer wearing his 'Clean Teens' T-shirt and it is revealed that he still has feelings for Brooke, as she does for him. After a heartfelt confession, Chase and Brooke decided to get back together. In the finale, Brooke and Chase took their relationship to the next level and had sex in the backseat of his car.

In the season seven finale Alex ask him out for a date and kisses him just before he receive a text message from Mia wanting to get back together. Since they came back from the Utah he is now dating Alex. In the fifth episode of the eight season, he breaks up with Alex because she lied to him about a new movie project. Alex and Mia then fight over Chase, before it is revealed that because of their decisions he no longer wants to be with either and is instead choosing to be by himself. On Brooke and Julian's wedding he has \"slutty wedding sex\" with Mia. He then realizes he wants to be more than just a bar manager at TRIC after having a conversation with Mia the day after the wedding, and becomes a \"Big Brother\" to Chuck, one of Jamie's friends. In Season 9, Chase becomes friends with Chris Keller. He is also closer to Chuck and when Chuck's violent dad returns, Chase beats him with a crowbar to protect Chuck and is arrested, resulting in him being discharged from the Air Force.

Tim was Nathan's best friend until Nathan married Haley. He then clung on to Nathan and had a hard time adjusting to the fact that Nathan had new friends outside of him.

He then attended a school for \"slower students\". In Season five, he is now working a delivery boy for a pizza place, is married to Bevin, and they have a son named Nathan, as learned when he gets locked in the library with Haley, Peyton, Brooke, Mia, and Lindsey.

She is not very bright, but she reveals in season four that she only acts dumb for people to rely on her in that way. In season five, we see that she is married to Tim Smith, who is also not smart, and they have a son named Nathan.

She returned in Season two, saying she had earned custody of Jenny through a trial which Jake did not attend because he was in hiding. When Jake refused to give Jenny to her and turned himself in to the police because there was a warrant out for his arrest, she still managed to locate her and take her away.

Derek Sommers is the biological half-brother of Peyton. Lucas is startled to discover that Peyton's brother was black, but ultimately this was not much of a discussion point. He rescues Peyton and Lucas from Psycho Derek. While Psycho Derek escaped from Peyton's house, Peyton did not feel safe anymore and closed herself up in the house. Derek returns and teaches her kickboxing to help her deal with her anger. The lessons were successful, when Psycho Derek returned Peyton uses the lessons to beat Psycho Derek.

She came up with many ideas to take ''Clothes over Bros.'' to the next level including introducing a formal line and a magazine called b. Davis.\nShe misinterpreted Lucas showing Brooke an engagement ring, as the two getting engaged and told Brooke that she would have annulment papers drawn up fast. She felt that Brooke should be focusing on the company and not \u2018boys with rings,\u2019 and reminded her that the company is called Clothes ''over'' Bros. Brooke told Victoria that she was ready to take the company to the next level and Victoria replied that they were going to have everything that they ever wanted. She told Brooke that she would like her to call her Victoria, because 'Mom' makes her sound too old.\nLater on she tried to control Brooke's decision over COB's future as the CEO of the brand (the opening of the Tree Hill boutique and Peyton's label) but ended up alienating her daughter by repeatedly rejecting her. Brooke fired her mother after she went behind her back to scare Rachel off.<ref name=\"OTH511\"/> At the beginning of Season 6 she returned to inform Brooke that she is part owner of Clothes Over Bros and although Brooke protested, she informed her that designers come and go, but the CEO remains the same. She threatened to go to the board to have Brooke removed or there start a legal battle over the company. Brooke countered by telling her that the new line is going to ensure that Victoria will be fired and Brooke will own the company in full. Victoria later arrived at Clothes Over Bros to scare the sketches for the new line out of Millicent who refused calling her \"an evil bitch\" to which Victoria replied, \"You're going to pay for that\". Later that night as Brooke was locking up the store a masked assailant attacked her, brutally injuring her and stealing the computer, money out of the register and the sketches for Brooke's new line. It is speculated that Victoria hired the assailant as a way to steal the sketches with the cover of a robbery so Brooke would be unable to go to the police.\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; margin-left: 2em; font-size: 95%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| \"I loved the opportunity to play such a witch.\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\u2014Zuniga on becoming involved with the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/one-tree-hill/exclusive-interview-daphne-zun-22687.aspx|title=Exclusive Interview: Daphne Zuniga of 'One Tree Hill'|date=September 11, 2008|work=Buddy TV|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\nBrooke later confronted her about the attack/robbery to which Victoria vehemently denied any involvement in. She was shocked to see that Brooke carries a gun with her and explained that she never wanted a child, that she wanted everything Brooke has and that when she could not have it, she decided to end her husband's dream of having a son. Brooke was disgusted with her mother and gave the company over to Victoria who subsequently fired Millicent and closed the Tree Hill Clothes Over Bros store. Victoria returns to Tree Hill after \"Clothes over Bros\" is failing without Brooke's' help. She manages to convince Brooke to come back with a 51% share, and after previously being shunned by Sam because of her unkindness, also manages to befriend Sam, as shown at the end when she comforts Sam while she cries over Jack's departure.

However, just when Millie is about to have the book thrown at her, Victoria comes to her defense and gets her off, as well as offering her old job back as long as she kicks the habit and never steals from C/B again. She then hires a new designer for the companies new men's line \"Clothes 4 Bros\" named Alexander Coyne. Victoria also speaks to Julian and tells him to fight for Brooke as their relationship begins to dissolve. She and her daughter then have another heart to heart where Victoria admits that she is getting \"soft.\" She is caught performing oral sex on Alexander at Quinn's photo gallery opening, and admits as much to the tabloids, which at first thought Brooke was involved.\n\nAt the beginning of season eight, it is discovered Victoria and Millicent have been defrauding Clothes Over Bros. and its investors.

After Lucas kissed Peyton, he proposed to Lindsey, and she said yes. She asked Haley, whom she had befriended, to be her maid of honor and asked Brooke to make her dress.

He was a member of the Tree Hill Ravens. He is originally portrayed as an arrogant jock and harassed Haley on her first day of teaching, and provoked her to fail him for the quarter on her second day, effectively preventing him from joining the revamped Ravens. He quit school, but thanks to Haley's inability to give up on him and convincing Nathan to tell Quentin that he might lose everything just like he did if he did not quit being such a jerk and tells Quentin that he used to be like that. He went back to both Haley's classes and the team and slowly started to change his attitude. His jersey number for the Tree Hill Ravens is #44. After hitting Jason to \"defend Haley's honor\" he suffered from a hand fracture, compromising his chances to be recruited by a college's basketball team. However, after a change of strategy by the Ravens, he became their point guard, even with a broken hand. He also becomes good friends with Jamie and explained that it was because Jamie reminded him so much of his younger brother, Andre. In episode 2 of Season 6, he was shot and killed by an assailant when he accidentally discovered a murder while paying for gas. It is later revealed there is a connection between Quentin's murder and Brooke Davis' attack at Clothes Over Bros. The assailant is Xavier, the brother of Quentin's classmate Sam Walker's friend Jack (he also attacked Brooke at her store for Sam). His jersey #44 was retired by Tree Hill High (joining the #23 jersey of Nathan and #1 jersey for Coach Durham, but replacing the #33 jersey worn by Dan, whose number was un-retired after his murder conviction), and as a tribute to Quentin, the Ravens played with only four players the rest of the season.\n\nFollowing his death, Quentin appears as a ghost to Nathan, urging him to follow his dreams of reaching the NBA. When Nathan is called up to the Charlotte Bobcats, he goes to the cemetery to leave his Bobcats jersey on Quentin's grave. Nathan wrote his initials \"QF\" and jersey number \"44\" on one sneaker, writing the initials of Jamie (JLS) and his favorite number (12) on the other shoe. He is briefly mentioned by Jamie in the season 7 when he mentions the people he misses. Jamie and Nathan are in Lucas' house at the time while Julian, Brooke and Alex are at work on the movie.\n\nQuentin is briefly mentioned in Season 9 by Xavier while he attacks Brooke a second time, taunting her for having the same look in her eyes that Quentin had right before Xavier killed him.\n\n===Carrie===\n[[File:Torrey DeVitto by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|170px|Torrey DeVitto portrays the nanny, Carrie]]\nPortrayed by [[Torrey DeVitto]] during seasons five and six.

When Dan tries to escape, he discovers the grave of a child and that Carrie once had a young son who died. She poses as a hospice nurse who calls Haley and tells her that Dan is near death and is wishing to see Jamie. Haley takes Jamie to see Dan, but tells him to stay in the car while she checks everything out. Once inside, Haley finds Dan restrained to the bed. As she unties him, Dan tries to warn her to get Jamie away, but Carrie sneaks up behind her and knocks her out. As Jamie is wondering where Haley is, Carrie appears and tells him to open the door. Jamie refuses and Carrie gets an ax and breaks the car window, but then sees that Jamie has escaped from the other side of the car and runs into a cornfield. Carrie chases after him, but Jamie is able to hide from her. As he starts running again, he is grabbed by someone who turns out to be Haley. The two of them hide until Haley's phone rings, alerting Carrie to where they are. As she chases Haley and Jamie back to the house, Deb appears and smashes a wine bottle in Carrie's face, momentarily subduing her. Haley asks how she knew where they were and Deb tells her she knew something was up once she saw the address because Dan always hated the woods. At that moment, Carrie charges at them with the ax, but is shot by Dan. Later, Carrie wakes up on the ground and starts laughing at Dan, who's still standing there. Dan tells her that he called the police and Carrie says that she'll get out and come back. Dan reminds her that he told her he'd kill her if she ever came near his family again and Carrie tells Dan she's not dead. Dan says \"Sure you are\" and shoots her again, presumably killing her.\n\n===Mia Catalano===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 95%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:35em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"It's an interesting blend.

Originally, it followed two half-brothers Lucas and Nathan Scott who started out as enemies but later formed a close bond as brothers. It also followed the brothers' various relationships with other female leads during their high-school years and in their early twenties.

He and Nathan started on bad terms but later become close brothers. He is a star on the high school basketball team. He had to quit playing sports after he found out he had a genetic heart problem, inherited from his father - this meant he had more time to focus on writing. He was involved in a complicated love-triangle between Brooke and Peyton, but eventually realized Peyton was the one for him. After Peyton temporarily turned down his proposal because she told him she was not ready, he begins dating his book editor Lindsay and gets engaged. Peyton returns to Tree Hill to get him back and after Lindsay realizes Lucas still loves Peyton she leaves him at the altar. Lucas tells Peyton he hates her and wishes she never came back to Tree Hill because she ruined his life. They later make amends, and after some time, the two get married and have a daughter, \"Sawyer Brooke Scott\". Lucas returns in the ninth season to help Haley deal with Nathan's disappearance by taking care of his nephew and niece. Lucas is currently traveling with Peyton, Karen and Andy, while raising Sawyer and writing a new book.\n\n===Nathan Scott===\n{{Main|Nathan Scott}}\nPortrayed by [[James Lafferty]] since the pilot, Nathan Royal Scott was a basketball player for the Charlotte Bobcats, husband of Haley James Scott and the father of James Lucas Scott and Lydia Bob Scott.

During the course of his life he has experienced many obstacles including spending time in a wheelchair following an accident after a fight; dealing with an overbearing father; an alcoholic-drug addict mother; allegations he cheated on Haley. Nathan overcomes all of his problems throughout the series and vows to never raise his child the way Dan raised him. Nathan maintains a strong bond with his mother, who was at one point Jamie's nanny. After waiting for Haley to go into labor, Haley gives birth to Lydia Bob Scott. In season nine, he is traveling a lot as an agent but when returning to Haley, Jamie and Lydia he is taken by some people that are getting paid to kill him. After some time Nathan is rescued by Chris Keller, Dan and Julian, but Dan is critically injured after taking a bullet meant for Nathan.

In the final episode time jump, Nathan is seen with everyone else at Jamie's basketball game who has since broken Nathan's record for all time scorer.\n\n===Peyton Sawyer===\n[[File:Hilarie Burton Gitmo (crop).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Hilarie Burton portrayed Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer during the first six seasons of the show.]]\n{{Main|Peyton Sawyer}}\nPortrayed by [[Hilarie Burton]] from the pilot until the season six finale, Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer, was introduced in the first season as [[Nathan Scott]]'s on-and-off girlfriend. She has a huge love for music and for art, and frequently sketches certain events in her life, or feelings she cannot bring herself to tell anybody about. Peyton develops feelings for [[Lucas Scott]] in the first season, but frequently tries keeping them to herself since he was consistently off-and-on with Brooke for the first four seasons. Her adoptive mother died in a car accident when she was young, and her adoptive father works out on the sea, which leaves Peyton on her own for most of the first four seasons. She met her birth mother Ellie Harp near the end of the second season, however she also dies from cancer by the middle of the third season. Peyton was consistently surrounded by terrible events: she was shot in the leg during the school shooting in season three and lost a lot of blood, but was rescued by Lucas, and was brutally attacked twice by Ian Banks, who pretended to be her long-lost brother Derek. She was saved the first time by Lucas and her real brother, and the second time by Brooke. Peyton left for Los Angeles to work as an intern at a major record label at the end of season four, but did not enjoy herself or feel she was accomplishing anything, so she returned to Tree Hill in the season five premiere. Peyton eventually married Lucas near the end of season six, and the two had a daughter, Sawyer Brooke Scott. Peyton and Lucas leave Tree Hill to raise Sawyer on the road, alongside Lucas's mother Karen, her daughter Lily, and her boyfriend Andy.\n\n===Haley James Scott===\n[[File:Bethany Joy Galeotti.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Bethany Joy Lenz portrays Haley James Scott.]]\nHaley Bob James Scott is played by Bethany Joy Lenz, Haley Bob James Scott was first seen in the pilot episode and last seen in the series finale 'One Tree Hill'. When the series begins, Haley is best friends with Lucas Scott (Chad Michael Murray). Although Lucas and Nathan Scott are half brothers and teammates on the basketball team, they do not get along at all and Nathan picks on Lucas incessantly. When Nathan asks Haley to tutor him in school because his low grades are putting him in danger of getting kicked off the basketball team and he hopes to further bother Lucas by hanging out with Lucas' best friend, she initially resists knowing that it would anger Lucas. However, Haley changes her mind and promises Nathan that if he leaves Lucas alone she will tutor him and Nathan agrees. When Lucas finds out about this, he is very angry with Haley, until Haley tells him about the deal she made with Nathan. While Haley tutors Nathan, they grow very close and eventually fall in love. Lucas is not initially supportive of the relationship, but as time goes on he forgives Haley, and Lucas and Nathan grow closer as brothers. At the end of the first season Nathan and Haley decide to get married at the age 16. Early in the second season, Haley and Nathan begin their married life and Haley starts to pursue music. She is asked to record a song with a man named Chris Keller, and afterwards he offers her the opportunity to go on tour with him. Nathan does not want her to leave so he gives her an ultimatum in which she could either choose him or the tour. Haley is angry at Nathan's ultimatum and leaves to go on the tour. During the tour, Haley and Nathan struggle with their feelings as they both love and miss each other, but are also quite angry and hurt. They almost get an annulment, but Haley decides to come back home to Nathan. He eventually forgives her and they rekindle their relationship. Feeling more in love than ever, the couple decides to renew their vows in front of all their friends and family. During their senior year, just as Nathan is offered a scholarship to play for Duke University, Haley informs him that she is pregnant. Although he is initially upset about her not informing him about the pregnancy first, Nathan comes around and the two are quite excited about the pregnancy.

Nathan fell into a depression and was quite angry with his circumstances. As the season opens several months after his injuries, Nathan's depression is taking a serious toll on his family. Haley tells him that she can't stay in their marriage any longer if it continues the way it has been. This wakes Nathan up and he reengages in fatherhood, their marriage, and his life. After struggling through marriage counseling, an obsessed nanny, and Haley's depression after the death of her mother, Haley and Nathan's life and relationship settle down and they have a second child, a daughter named Lydia Scott.\n\n===Dan Scott===\n{{for|the broadcaster and politician who briefly used the name \"Dan Scott\"|Dan Patrick (politician)}}\nDaniel Robert Scott, also known as Dan/Danny, played by [[Paul Johansson]] as a series regular from the pilot to the thirteenth episode of season seven. He appeared as a special guest star for two episodes in season eight. He returns in season 9 until he is killed.<ref name=\"Dan Scott Returns\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b252862_dan_back_paul_johansson_returning_final.html|title=Dan Is Back! Paul Johansson Returning for Final Season of One Tree Hill|date=July 18, 2011|work=E! Online|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> Daniel Robert \"Dan\" Scott is the original villain in Tree Hill. Dan is the ex-husband of Deb Lee and the father of Nathan and Lucas Scott. Originally wanting nothing to do with Lucas, he begins to want a part in Lucas's life. We find out that not only has Dan been following Lucas all his life, but that he wanted joint custody of Lucas but Karen refused. Lucas later moves in with Dan after learning that he has Dan's heart condition as it's the only way he could afford the medication. When Lucas fails Dan's test, he takes away Lucas's college fund which he had started when Lucas was a baby. He hired a woman (Jules) to make Keith fall in love with her as revenge for sleeping with Deb. Jules actually falls in love with Keith but leaves him on the altar after being threatened by Karen. Deb attempts to murder Dan by burning down his dealership. Dan, thinking it was Keith, shoots Keith and lets Jimmy Edwards take the blame as Jimmy committed suicide. Lucas gradually accepts Dan as his dad until he finds out what he did to Keith. Dan, realizing Nathan will never forgive him, turns himself in to the police. He then spends almost five years in prison and doesn't get out until Lucas' and Lindsey's wedding day.\n\nAfter prison, Dan becomes close with Nathan's son Jamie. Dan is taken hostage by Carrie, Jamie's ex-nanny who planned to kidnap Jamie and set Dan up for it. He is later rescued by Haley (who went to see him after Carrie called pretending to be a nurse saying Dan was about to die) and Deb (who came afterwards to help Haley and Jamie after realizing where Haley had really gone). He shoots Carrie and she is believed to be dead. When Jamie finds out what he did, he at first stops talking to Dan. Dan leaves Tree Hill to die as he does not think he will be able to find a new heart since one became available while he was being held hostage and he lost out on it. In the year time gap between seasons six and seven, Dan married Rachel, who takes him to Mexico and illegally buys a heart. After realizing the type of person Rachel is when she wants to take their TV show to the corridor where he murdered Keith, he gives all his money to charity and divorces her. Before leaving Tree Hill once again, he says goodbye to Jamie, who tells him he forgives him. He is seen working in a burger joint, where he is visited by Quinn for help with murdering Katie, but he ends up talking her out of it. He appears shortly in the season eight finale when Nathan gives him a photograph of Lydia and a baseball that Jamie hit in a game. Dan returns in season nine because he loses everything when his diner burns down. He convinces Haley to let him stay with them for a few days, saying he has nowhere else to go. A flash-forward sequence shows Dan with Chris Keller, burning down a house and apparently ready to kill someone. When Nathan is kidnapped, Haley seeks help from Dan who promises her that he will do whatever it takes to bring him back home. Eventually, Dan finds him and he ends up taking a bullet meant for Nathan which critically wounds him. At the hospital, Haley tells Dan that Lucas refuses to come see him. Dan says he's okay with that because he can't blame Lucas for not being there in his final moments when he wasn't there for Lucas his whole life. Dan also makes peace with Haley by saying he's glad he was proven wrong about Haley not being good enough for Nathan as she is the best thing that ever happened to him and apologizes for Keith's murder as Keith also meant a lot to her. Haley lets him hold Lydia and tells Dan that whenever Lydia asks about him, she and Nathan will tell her that he loved her and Jamie very much. Dan also makes amends with Deb and lastly, Nathan (in which Dan has a dream that he and Nathan play basketball just for fun for the first time ever) to which Nathan says that despite all the bad he did, he's still his father and forgives him and Dan dies moments later. Dan is visited by Keith who tells him that he's proud of him for finally learning to put family and friends first and become the brother he always wanted. As the two enter the light Dan asks Keith, \"I know where you're going. But what about me?\" Keith answers, \"Don't worry, little brother. You're my plus one.\"\n\n===Brooke Davis===\n[[Image:Sophia Bush cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Sophia Bush portrays Brooke Davis.]]\nPortrayed by [[Sophia Bush]] since the series' second episode, Brooke Penelope Baker, n\u00e9e Davis, was originally an immature party girl, who was neglected by her parents.

She battled alcohol and drug problems in season two and set fire to Dan's car lot, hoping he would die but Lucas dragged him to safety. She again battled drugs in season four, so Dan and Karen set up an intervention but had it turned down and stormed out, but in season 5 she cleaned up her act and became Jamie's nanny. She meets a man on the internet who turns out to be her son's friend \"Skills\" and begins a relationship. Deb later ends it as she believes he should have children and get married which she does not want to do again. In her final episodes, Dan tells her it's as much her fault Keith died as his as he thought it was Keith who set fire to the car lot which is why he killed him, which again leaves Deb filled with guilt. However, in Deb's last scene, Dan tells her to not blame herself and to not feel guilty as it's not her fault. Following this, Deb falls off the canvas, only to return to Tree Hill a few years later upon Nathan going missing. During her return, she consoled Haley and confronted Dan and once he was hospitalized upon rescuing Nathan.

When Skills leaves for a new job in season 7, Mouth begins to date Lauren, which ends his friendship with Skills when he finds out. Skills later forgives Mouth. Despite Lauren wanting to continue their relationship, Mouth refused as his friendship to Skills meant more to him. Since Lucas left Tree Hill, Mouth and Nathan have become close friends. Mouth lost his job because he refused to speak on air about Nathan's scandal. At the beginning of season 8, Mouth and Millicent sleep together after getting drunk together at a bar discussing their problems and why they broke up.

Tim was Nathan's best friend until Nathan married Haley. He then clung on to Nathan and had a hard time adjusting to the fact that Nathan had new friends outside of him. His appearances slowly turned to comic-relief such as when he mistook a pair of female police officers for strippers at a party, insisting on them giving him a show even as they handcuffed him and put him in a police car. He then attended a school for \"slower students\". In Season five, he is now working a delivery boy for a pizza place, is married to Bevin, and they have a son named Nathan, as learned when he gets locked in the library with Haley, Peyton, Brooke, Mia, and Lindsey. At the end of the episode, it turns out that he knew how to get out all along, but didn't say anything because he enjoyed hanging out with everyone again and says that no one really keeps in touch anymore. In the series finale, Bevin reveals that she is divorced due to her extreme hatred for Tim, indicating an unhappy and short marriage between the two.\n\n===Junk Moretti===\nPlayed by [[Cullen Moss]] since the pilot, Jonathan Moretti, also known as Junk, is one of the players from the River Court.

Originally intended to be an extra during cheerleading scenes, Prince was later given lines to speak. Her friendship with Brooke is established in season two when Bevin expresses that she is a great captain. Bevin dates Skills in seasons three and four, but they breakup after the relationship not working out throughout the missing years. She is not very bright, but she reveals in season four that she only acts dumb for people to rely on her in that way. In season five, we see that she is married to Tim Smith, who is also not smart, and they have a son named Nathan. She now works in a department store.<ref name=\"Ep214\">{{cite episode|title=Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows|series=One Tree Hill|credits=R. Lee Fleming, Jr. (writer) & Babu Subramaniam (director)|network=The WB|airdate={{date|2004-02-15|mdy}}|season=2|number=14}}</ref>\nBevin doesn't make another appearance until the series finale when Clay and Quinn go to confirm the adoption of Clay's son, Logan.

Larry also is attracted to Karen for a time, but it fades when she meets Andy.\n\n===Nicki===\n[[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] played Nicki during the first two seasons. She first appeared as a girl who had a one-night stand with Lucas. She wanted to get involved in her daughter's life but Jake would not let her. She told him that she would get to Jenny with or without him. She tried to use Brooke to find out where he was but was fooled into going to Seattle while he was actually in Savannah. She returned in Season two, saying she had earned custody of Jenny through a trial which Jake did not attend because he was in hiding. When Jake refused to give Jenny to her and turned himself in to the police because there was a warrant out for his arrest, she still managed to locate her and take her away. Jake then chased after her and in Season three, it is revealed that they both live in Savannah and will continue to share custody until the next trial.\n\n===Lydia James===\nPlayed by [[Bess Armstrong]] during seasons two and seven.

In Season seven, Lydia visits her daughters, Haley, Taylor and Quinn and it is revealed that her husband had died several years prior and that she has Pancreatic Cancer and is dying, but wants to spend her remaining time with daughters rather than fight it.

Television]]|date=2005}}</ref> The character was made bisexual as opposed to a lesbian so that her past could be kept secret. Anna was presented as a romantic interest for Lucas; \"[Schwahn] thought if she was strictly a lesbian character, that would be really out of nature for her, and a little disingenuous to lesbians\", and they needed to hide what her journey was going to be.<ref name=\"afterellen.com\"/> Alonso feels that the audience was not receptive to the character initially\u2014especially with a large portion of the audience wanting Brooke and Lucas to be together\u2014however over the course of her arc they began to accept Anna.<ref name=\"S2Change\"/>\n\n===Emily Chambers===\nEmily Chambers, who pretended to be Jules, was portrayed by [[Maria Menounos]] during season two.

Davis.\nShe misinterpreted Lucas showing Brooke an engagement ring, as the two getting engaged and told Brooke that she would have annulment papers drawn up fast. She felt that Brooke should be focusing on the company and not \u2018boys with rings,\u2019 and reminded her that the company is called Clothes ''over'' Bros. Brooke told Victoria that she was ready to take the company to the next level and Victoria replied that they were going to have everything that they ever wanted.

Jamie refuses and Carrie gets an ax and breaks the car window, but then sees that Jamie has escaped from the other side of the car and runs into a cornfield. Carrie chases after him, but Jamie is able to hide from her. As he starts running again, he is grabbed by someone who turns out to be Haley.

There were few alterations and adjustments made as the army grew from a limited peacetime defense force of 100,000 men to a war-fighting force of several million men.\n\nThese ranks and insignia were specific to the Heer and in special cases to senior Wehrmacht officers in the independent services; the uniforms and rank systems of the other branches of the ''Wehrmacht'', the [[Ranks and insignia of the Luftwaffe (1935\u20131945)|''Luftwaffe'']] (Air Force) and [[Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']] (Navy), were different, as were those of the [[uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS]] which was a Party organization outside the ''Wehrmacht.'' The [[Nazi Party]] also had its own series of [[Nazi Germany paramilitary ranks|paramilitary uniforms and insignia]].\n\n==Insignia==\n\n===National Emblem (breast eagle): ''Hoheitszeichen'' or ''Wehrmachtsadler''===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal \n| align     = right\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Wehrmachtsadler\n| image1    = Wehrmachtsadler-1935.svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Wehrmachtsadler-1939.svg\n| caption2  = 1939\n| image3    = Wehrmachtsadler-1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Wehrmachtsadler-1944.svg\n| caption4  = 1944\n| image5    = Wehrmachtsadler-Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\nThe ''[[Reichswehr]]'s'' visual acknowledgement of the new [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] reality came on 17 February 1934, when the Commander-in-Chief, [[Werner von Blomberg]], ordered the Nazi Party eagle-and-swastika, now [[Germany]]'s National Emblem, to be worn on uniform blouses and headgear effective 1 May.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} The design adopted, in silver for the ''Reichsheer'' (army) and in gold for the ''Reichsmarine'' (navy), was a stylized eagle with outstretched, beveled wings clutching a wreathed mobile ''Hakenkreuz'', later to be called the ''Wehrmachtsadler'' (\"armed forces eagle\").{{efn|The ''Luftwaffe'', although a branch of the ''Wehrmacht'', would use its own eagle design.}} On tunics this took the form of a cloth patch about 9&nbsp;cm (3\u215d\") wide worn on the right breast, above the pocket. For enlisted uniforms it was jacquard-woven (\"BeVo\") or sometimes machine-embroidered in silver-grey rayon, for officers machine- or hand-embroidered in white silk or bright aluminum wire, and for generals hand-embroidered in gold bullion.{{efn|\"Gold bullion\" in this context does not (usually) refer to actual gold, but to gold-colored wire, typically a bronze alloy}} The backing was \"badge-cloth\" (''Abzeichentuch''), a close-woven velvetish fabric; this was originally ''Reichsheer'' grey, but in late 1935 the renamed ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht Heer]]'' changed its ''Abzeichentuch'' color to a dark blue-green called ''flaschengr\u00fcn'' (bottle-green).\n\nThe war brought several variations to the breast eagle, although it should be kept in mind that none of them was replaced or de-authorized, and all were being worn side by side at war's end. When hostilities began in 1939, on the enlisted ''Feldbluse'' or [[World War II German uniform#Field Tunic (Feldbluse) Model 1936|field blouse]] the eagle was changed from silver-white to matte grey for reduced visibility; and in 1940 backings began to be produced in field-grey (''feldgrau''). Another version appeared with the advent of the [[World War II German uniform#Field Blouse Model 1944|Model 1944 Field Blouse]], which used a triangular backing for speed and simplicity of manufacture. Very late in the war some ''Hoheitszeichen'' were simply printed on thin fabric.\n\nThere were also versions for other uniforms: both white and grey variants on black for the [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform (Sonderbekleidung der Panzertruppen)|Panzer uniform]], and in dull grey-blue on tan backing for the [[World War II German uniform#Tropical uniform|tropical]] (''[[Afrikakorps]]'') uniform.

By the middle of World War I these ornate collars had been reduced to an embroidered representation of short lengths of braid joined at the ends, sewn to patches worn at the front of the collar. When the ''Reichsheer'' was established in 1921 as Germany's first national army{{efn|The German Army of Imperial times comprised in wartime the armies of the Kingdoms of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg under the Prussian General Staff (''Generalstab'').}} ''Litzen'' were prescribed as the universal collar device for all personnel other than generals, and the Third Reich continued the practice.\n\nHowever, for clarification it has to be distinguished between \"collar patch\" ({{lang-de|Kragenpatte or Kragenspiegel}}), and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] braid (Unteroffizierslitze or Kragenlitze) \u2013 the status symbol of all German NCO ranks \u2013 encircling the collar of the uniform tunic. An NCO wore both, collar patches, and the collar encircling braid. [[Commissioned officer]]s wore only collar patches.\n\n==== Design and versions ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)}}\nOn both collar points of any uniform jacket there was a collar patch. Each patch consisted of the padding, and two parallel facings ({{lang-de|Patten}}), the so-called ''Litzenspiegel'', symbolising the double braid of the 19th century.\n\nThe padding of full-dress collar patches showed the wearer's ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'' (corps color). The dress tunic version was embroidered in fine aluminum thread on a patch of ''badge cloth'' ({{lang-de|Abzeichentuch}}). The backing also showed through in the space between the two parallel facings of the collar patch, and formed so a colour center stripe.\n\nOn field \u2013 and service uniforms, beginning in late 1935, the collar patch was dark bottle-green to match the collar; the ''Waffenfarbe'' \"showed through\" (in fact colored cord was sewn into) the center strip of each braid, the ''Litzenspiegel.''\n\nFor enlisted men, service ''collar patches'' were machine-woven in silver-grey rayon; COs' were embroidered more elaborately in white silk or aluminium thread, and were somewhat larger to match their higher collars.\n\nNCOs ({{lang-de|Unteroffiziere}}) wore standard enlisted collar patches but were distinguished by a strip of 9mm silver-grey diamond-woven rayon braid (Unteroffoziers-Tressen, NCO-Tressen), sewn around the collar, except on the dress, where the NCO-Tresse was bright aluminum. However, the aluminum-embroidered NCO-Tressen on dress uniforms ({{lang-de|Ausgangsuniform, Paradeuniform}}) encircled the collar's upper edge, the simpler NCO-Tressen on service \u2013 or field uniform encircled the collar's lower edge.{{Clear}}\n\n====Universal design from 1938====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted versions\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption1  = <center>Dress</center>\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = <center>Field, 1938</center>\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = <center>Field, 1940</center>\n}}\n\n[[File:Feldgendarmerie.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Field tunic with collar patches, NCO-Tressen and [[Gorget]], post 1940.]]\n\nBy 1938 the fast-growing ''Heer'' had found that it was impractical, for the enlisted field uniform, to manufacture and stock a multitude of collar patches in assorted ''Waffenfarben'' which also had to be sewn on and frequently changed by unit tailors. Accordingly, new universal collar patches were introduced with the ''Litzenspiegel'' and ''Mittelstreifen''{{Explain|date=March 2018}} woven in dark green to match the backing patch, and which could be applied at the factory; ''Waffenfarbe'' was now displayed on the shoulder-straps, which simply buttoned on and were easily switched.\n\nWith the wartime change to lower-visibility insignia enlisted collar patches were woven in matte \"mouse-grey\" with field-grey stripes, which were at first sewn to green collar patches as before but increasingly directly to the collar, which beginning in 1940 was made in ''feldgrau'' like the uniform; grey collar patches were never produced. The troops however preferred the green patches (and collars) if they had or could get them, especially on \"clean\" uniforms for walking-out; and long-service veterans took particular pride in pre-38 versions.\n\nIn contrast, officers' service uniform collar patches never changed. While most officers in the front lines wore the enlisted field uniform as per wartime regulations, many opted to have their green-and-silver collar patches added instead of (or on top of) the factory versions. \n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>field & service</small></center>\n| header    = Enlisted versions, tropic\n}}\n\nOn olive tropical uniforms the collar patches were tan with dull grey-blue ''Litzenspiegel'' for all personnel; officers again sometimes added their green collar patches. Tropical NCO collar ''Tressen'' were copper-brown, or sometimes olive drab.{{Clear}}\n\n====Armored vehicle uniforms====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| width     = 45\n| header    = [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]] crew collar insignia\n| image1    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Litzen.jpg\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten ohne Abzeichen.jpg\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (assault artillery)</small></center>\n| footer_background = red\n}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     =\n| image3    = Panzer Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption3  = <center><small>Death's-head</small></center>\n| width3    = 60\n| image1    = Panzersonderbekleidung Kragenpatten.jpg\n| caption1  = <center><small>collar patch</small></center>\n| width1    = 40\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>shoulder strap</small></center>\n| width2    = 120\n| header    = rank insignias armored troops\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (armored corps)</small></center>\n| footer_background = #FF99CC\n}}\n\nA major exception to the wearing of ''Litzen'' was the \"panzer wrap\" ({{lang-de|Panzerjacke}}), the double-breasted jacket worn by crews of tanks and other armored vehicles. When the ''[[Panzertruppe]]'' were established in 1935 they were issued a [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform|distinctive black uniform]] and as a badge the ''Totenkopf'' or Death's-head, versions of which had formerly been worn by the Imperial tank corps and [[Media:AugustvonMackensen.jpg|various cavalry units]]. These skulls took the form of white-metal pins attached to black ''Kragenpatten'' which were edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn mid-1940 crews of assault guns (''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]en'') received a uniform of their own, identical in cut to the ''Panzerjacke'' but in standard field-grey, which they wore with red artillery piping. Over the course of the war a bewildering and changing series of regulations governed the uniforms and insignia for assault guns, tank destroyers, armored cars and self-propelled guns (SPG). Depending on the unit and the date either the black or grey wrap or the standard ''Feldbluse'' might be authorized, and on the grey \"assault gun\" jacket the regulation collar patches could be black with skulls, or grey with skulls, ''Litzen'', or no device at all. The result in practice was chaos; wartime photos show a mix of uniforms and insignia worn not only in the same battalion, but even in the same vehicle.\n\nOfficially both colours of panzer wrap were working and field uniforms to be worn only in or around the vehicle; this regulation was universally ignored. ''Panzertruppen'' were issued standard uniforms for service-dress and walking out but rarely wore them, much preferring their unique jackets.\n\nIn North Africa, [[Armored fighting vehicle|AFV crews]] wore the same tropical uniform as the other branches, including collar patches; many tankers however pinned their ''Totenkopf'' badges to their lapels.{{Clear}}\n\n====Infanterie Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"====\n[[File:Special Single Litzen for NCO ranks of Gro\u00dfdeutschland IR.jpg|thumb|left|200px|NCOs' collar patch and ''Tressen'' of I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]\n\nIn June 1939, the Wehrmacht Heer wanted to renew its ties with the Old Army tradition by introducing a new uniform for its most prestigious unit: ''Wachregiment \"Berlin\"'' which was renamed [[Infantry Regiment Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Infantry Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]. The new dress uniform for I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\" had an elongated collar patch with single ''Litzenspiegel'' for NCOs and two for enlisted. Although shown to the press, this new uniform was not provided to the unit due to the outbreak of World War II and was placed in depot storage.{{Clear}}\n\n==== General Staff Corps Officers ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-51, Rudolf-Christoph v.

They ranked from ''Hauptmann im Generalstab'' (captain) through ''Oberst i.G.'' (colonel). All were, before 1939, graduates of the Military Academy, the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]''. On division staffs they held the position of '''Ia''' (operational chief of staff) or '''Ib''' (chief of the rear echelon). In the higher echelons, the intelligence and training staff sections were most of the time in the personal charge of General Staff Corps officers. The General Staff Officers had their own distinctive Litzen called ''alt-Preu\u00dfische'' (old Prussian), or ''Kolbenstickerei'' (\"lobe-embroidery\"). These were the same whether on carmine dress ''Kragenpatten'' or green service patches; colored ''Litzenspiegel'' were unnecessary. General Staff officers assigned to the supreme headquarters (the ''Reichskriegsministerium'', later the [[OKH]] and the [[OKW]]), the Kriegsakademie, and military attaches were further distinguished by having their Litzen in gold rather than silver. These Generalstaboffiziere were called \"des Generalstabs\", Oberst d.G., etc. The special golden Litzen were abolished in November 1942. Only Military attaches kept their Litzen as long as they were in their present position. The F\u00fchrer wanted a closer union between the front and the OKW and OKH.\n\nIn addition to their collar patches, General Staff Officers wore trouser-stripes, of the same design as generals' but in carmine rather than scarlet.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:WMacht arabesques OF10toOF6-hor 1945.jpg|left|120px]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0408-503, Walter v.

These devices, sometimes called ''Arabesken'' (arabesques), were embroidered in gold bullion or golden synthetic ''Celleon'' on ''Hochrot'' (scarlet) backing.\nField Marshals wore the same ''Arabesken'' as generals until April 1941, when they were authorized a longer variant with three rather than two iterations of the repeating pattern, for a total of six \"prongs\".{{sfn|Rosignoli|1975|p=209}} In some cases GFM did not bother to replace their generals' tabs, or did so only on their dress uniforms.\n\nGeneral officers of the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' \u2013 TDS) and of the specialist careers (medical, veterinary, ordnance, and motor park) wore the same insignia until April 1944, when they were ordered to exchange their scarlet ''Kragenpatten'' for ''alt-Larisch'' tabs backed in their respective ''[[Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)|Waffenfarbe:]]''\n\n* {{Farbindex|93CCEA|bright blue}} \u2013 TDS administrative;\n* {{Farbindex|6495ED|cornflower blue}} \u2013 medical;\n* {{Farbindex|FF7538|orange}} \u2013 ordnance;{{efn|Before June 1944 their Waffenfarbe was bright red.}}\n* {{Farbindex|FFC0CB|pink}} \u2013 motor park;\n* {{Farbindex|960018|carmine}} \u2013 veterinary;\n* {{Farbindex|900020|wine red}} \u2013 TDS judiciary.\n\nIn October 1944, the wear-out period of the scarlet backing color for Generals of the specialist careers was extended for an undetermined period.\n\nThese [[Gorget patches|arabesque collar patches]] are still worn today by general officers of the present-day [[Bundeswehr]].\n\n=====Chief=====\n[[File:VonRundstedt-Shoulderboards-alt-Larisch.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Gorget patch|Kragenpatte]] & [[Epaulette]] of von Rundstedt]]\nIn the Wehrmacht Heer, upon retirement, certain senior German generals were awarded the honorary post of ''Chef'' (Chief) of a regiment, much like the [[Honorary Colonel]] in the British Army. It was a German custom dating from the late 18th century.  These generals were authorized to wear the tunic and insignia of an officer of the regiment, including ordinary officers' ''Litzen.'' Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], ''Chef'' of the {{ill|18th Infantry Regiment (Germany)|lt=18th Infantry Regiment|de|18. Infanterie-Regiment (Reichswehr)}}, wore a big 18 on his shoulderboards, and for everyday wear favored the ornamented tunic of an infantry officer with white piping rather than a general's uniform.\n\nHitler appointed first Generaloberst [[Hans von Seeckt]], ancient \"Chef der Heeresleitung\", to be Chef of the 67th Infanterie Regiment on his 70th birthday in April 1936, a few months before he died. Only seven German generals were appointed Chefs: in addition to Seeckt and Rundstedt they were General der Infanterie [[Franz Ritter von Epp|Ritter von Epp]] (Chef of the 61st Infanterie Regiment in Munich); Generalfeldmarschall [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] (Chef of the 5th Kavallerie Regiment in [[Stolp]]); Generaloberst [[Werner von Fritsch|von Fritsch]] (Chef of the 12th Artillerie Regiment in Schwerin); and Generalfeldmarschall [[Eduard von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli|von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli]] (Chef of the 28th Infanterie Regiment in [[Troppau]]). Generalfeldmarschall [[von Blomberg]] was appointed Chef of Infanterie Regiment 73 and wore a big 73 superimposed over the crossed batons of his shoulder board, but on 4 February 1938 he was dismissed and his name was deleted from the seniority list.\n\n===Shoulder-straps (''Schulterklappen'') and shoulderboards (''Schulterst\u00fccke'')===\n\n====Enlisted men====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 80\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n\n}}\n\nThe ''Reichsheer's'' shoulder-straps were very similar to those of World War I, made of ''feldgrau'' uniform cloth with pointed or \"gable\" button ends. In December 1934 the material was changed to grey badge-cloth (''Abzeichentuch'') and in September 1935 changed again to dark bottle-green (''flaschengr\u00fcn''). These \"first pattern\" shoulder-straps were not edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn 1938, simultaneous with the removal of ''Waffenfarbe'' from field-uniform collar patches, new shoulder-straps were issued. These \"second pattern\" straps had round rather than pointed ends, and were edged on three sides with wool (later rayon) piping in ''Waffenfarbe.''  This pattern would be used through the end of the war, although in 1940 manufacture reverted to field-grey uniform cloth, and as usual alternate versions were made to go with the Panzer uniform (black), tropical uniform (olive cotton) and [[World War II German uniform#HBT fatigue and summer uniforms (Drillichanzug/Sommerfeldanzug)|HBT summer uniform]] (reed-green twill). ''Schulterklappen'' were not worn with the fatigue uniform, nor with camouflage smocks and parkas which used an [[Ranks and Insignia of the German Army in World War II#Smock/parka rank insignia|alternate system of rank insignia]].\n\nFor junior enlisted men (''Mannschaften''), rank insignia if any was worn on the left sleeve. However the epaulettes did indicate the wearer's unit (usually regiment or independent battalion) together with his sub-branch if any, machine-embroidered in branch-color. For example, a ''Schulterklappe'' with rose-pink piping and number \"4\" would indicate the 4th Panzer Regiment; but if it carried a pink number \"4\" and letter \"A\" it would indicate the 4th Armored Reconnaissance (''Aufkl\u00e4rungs'') Battalion. The German Army used a very large assortment of Latin initials, Gothic initials, script ciphers, Arabic numerals, Roman numerals and symbols to designate all its various service branches and installations. Before the war, shoulder-buttons were embossed with the number of the wearer's company as well, this practice was discontinued \"for the duration.\"\n[[File:Trop Oberwachtmeister epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|80px|Cavalry ''Oberwachtmeister'', tropical]]\nBeginning in January 1940, shoulder-straps with unit insignia were (supposed to be) phased out as a security measure, and removable fabric loops with devices were issued instead. In May 1944 the embroidery was changed from ''waffenfarbe'' to light gray.\n\nNon-commissioned officers wore their rank insignia on their shoulder-straps, consisting of braid and pips (pyramidal \"stars\"). An ''Unteroffizier's'' (corporal's) epaulette was edged with ''Tresse'' on three sides and an ''Unterfeldwebel's'' (sergeant's) on all four. Senior NCO's (''Unteroffiziere mit Portepee'') added one to three pips; in addition, their unit identifiers took the form of white-metal pins rather than embroidery.\n\nShoulder-straps were made in both a standard width (4.5&nbsp;cm, 1\u00be\") and a wider one for three-digit unit numbers (5.3&nbsp;cm, 2\"), and in three lengths depending on the size of the man. There was in addition an extra-large size for the overcoat (''Mantel'').\n\n====Officers====\n\n[[File:Hauptmann Epaulette.jpg|thumb|left|90px]]\nOfficers' shoulderboards were constructed from \"Russia\" braid, an aluminum-thread double piping. Company-grade officers (''Leutnant'' through ''Hauptmann/Rittmeister'') wore epaulettes constructed by wrapping two side-by-side lengths of braid around the buttonhole and back, giving the appearance of eight parallel cords; the whole was sewn to an underlay (''Unterlagen'') of ''Waffenfarbe'' badge-cloth. Until 1938 the underlay was of the same outer dimensions as the braid, and only visible edge-on; in that year the underlay was made wider, so as to create the impression of edge piping like the enlisted shoulder-strap. Rank was indicated by zero to two gilt-metal pips; unit designators were also of gilt metal.\n[[File:Major Epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|95px]]\nField-grade officer (''Stabsoffizier'') shoulderboards were made by plaiting together double widths of Russia braid and looping them to form a buttonhole, sewn to a ''Waffenfarbe'' underlay; rank again was displayed by zero to two gilt pips.\n\nOnce the war began, dull grey aluminum braid appeared, but bright aluminum continued in use.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalsrangabzeichen.jpg|thumb|300px|Generals' shoulderboards, Wehrmacht (Heer)]]\n*'''1''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] ([[OF-10]], [[five-star rank]], shoulder strap from April 1941)\n*'''2''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] (OF-10, five-star rank, shoulder strap prior to April 1941)\n*'''3''' [[Generaloberst]] (OF-9, [[four-star rank]])\n*'''4''' [[General of the branch]] (OF-8, [[three-star rank]])\n*'''5''' [[Generalleutnant]] (OF-7, [[two-star rank]])\n*'''6''' [[Generalmajor]] (OF-6, [[one-star rank]])\n\nGenerals' shoulderboards were constructed similarly to those of field-grade officers, but comprised a length of silver Russia braid between two braided cords of gold bullion or ''Celleon.'' Since the resulting combination was wider, generals' boards were plaited in four 'loops' rather than five. Their buttons were gilt, and rank was indicated by zero to three silver pips, or crossed batons in the case of field marshals. The underlay was scarlet, except (from 1944) for generals of staff corps, who were instructed to wear ''Waffenfarbe'' instead.\n\nIn April 1941, ''Generalfeldmarschall'' epaulettes were changed to incorporate a central gold cord instead of silver.\n\nColonels-in-chief wearing that uniform wore gold generals' shoulderboards underlaid with the ''Waffenfarbe'' of the regiment rather than scarlet; GFM von Rundstedt sometimes simply pinned his crossed batons to an infantry colonel's epaulettes.\n\n====Retired personnel====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalmajor (a.D.).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Generalmajor a.D.]]\nBy order of Marshal Hindenburg in March 1932, soldiers who retired after 15 years of service received the right to wear the uniform of the unit they left. The shoulderboards and shoulder straps of retired soldiers had a bridle 1.5&nbsp;cm wide attached under the middle.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Schirmmutze cap badges.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Eagle/swastika and wreathed cockade used on the peaked cap (Schirmm\u00fctze).]] [[File:Insignias casco.svg|thumb|Decals of Heer used on various helmets.]]\nCaps and helmets bore two common insignia elements, in various forms: the [[Coat of arms of Germany#Nazi Germany|National Emblem]] and the national colors. World War I caps had carried dual [[cockades]] or roundels, one in Imperial black-white-red and one in the colors of the particular State within the Empire. The ''[[Reichswehr]]'' changed this to a single cockade in the Weimar Republic's black, red and gold; almost as soon as Hitler took power he restored the [[Flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1866\u20131918)|pre-1919 tricolor flag]], and ordered the Army to return to black-white-red.\n\n===Belt buckles (''Koppelschl\u00f6sser'')===\n[[File:Koppelschloss Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Enlisted ''Koppelschlo\u00df'']]\nBelt buckles for enlisted men were of box type, made of aluminum or stamped steel and bearing a circular device with a version of the ''Hoheitszeichen'' called the Army eagle or ''Heeresadler'' (an eagle with downswept wings clutching an unwreathed swastika) surmounted by the motto ''[[Gott mit uns]]'', or \"God with us.\" For field wear these were usually painted field-grey to reduce visibility and had a smooth finish; on the other hand, dress buckles were silver-washed with a pebbled surface surrounding the Hoheitszeichen.\n\nOfficers' field and service buckles were of a two-pronged frame type. With dress uniform officers wore a belt of silver braid with a circular silver-washed or -plated aluminum buckle, in the form of an oakleaf wreath surrounding a ''Heeresadler.'' Generals' were the same but gilt or gold-plated.\n\nWith the tropical uniform and its belt of cotton webbing, officers wore a buckle identical to the dress buckle but painted olive-drab.\n\n==Ranks and rank insignia==\n\n===Rank tables===\n\n====Enlisted personnel (''Mannschaften'')====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted collar ''Litzen''\n| footer    = Red ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': artillery\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen 1934.svg\n| alt1      = Mannschaft Litzen 1935\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption4  = Dress\n| image5    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted ''Schulterklappen''\n| footer    = White ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': infantry, rose pink: armor\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer uniform\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He was therefore roughly analogous to a Company Sergeant-Major or First Sergeant, although his duties did not usually involve combat leadership. ''Der Spie\u00df''{{efn|\"The spear.\" This may refer to the sergeant of a flintlock-era company having carried a [[polearm]] rather than a musket, or it may relate to Latin ''pilus prior'' \"leading spear,\" the senior centurion in a cohort.}} or ''die Kompanie-Mutter'', as he was called, was not necessarily the ranking ''Unteroffizier'' in the company, especially since typically two of the platoons were commanded by senior NCOs rather than officers. A ''Hauptfeldwebel'' however had to be \nof ''Portepee'' grade; a junior NCO filling the role was a ''Hauptfeldwebeldiensttuer,'' \"one doing ''Hauptfeldwebel'' duties.\"\n\nThe insignia for a ''Hauptfeldwebel'' was a pair of NCO ''Tressen'' encircling each lower sleeve, nicknamed \"piston rings;\" he also carried a leather ''Meldetasche'' or report-case tucked into his tunic front.\n\n====Senior non-commissioned specialist officers====\nIn two specialist career paths it was possible to attain rank above ''Stabsfeldwebel'': fortifications engineers (''Festungspioniere'') and farriers (''Hufbeschlagschmieder'').{{efn|Farriers, blacksmiths specializing in the shoeing and care of horses, were a very important component of the WWII German army, 70\u201380% of which depended on horse-drawn transport.

They consist of civil service personnel performing functions within the Armed Forces and are recruited, in part, from former professional non-commissioned officers who became military candidates for civil service ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4ranw\u00e4rter}}) at the end of their 12-year contractual period of active military service.\n\nUp to 1944, none of these officials were classified as soldiers; in that year certain groups were converted into officers in the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' or TSD). These were the higher administrative officers (''Intendanten'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general; the lower administrative officers (''Zahlmeister'') in the ranks of first and second lieutenant, and the judge advocates (''Richter'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general. At this time all personnel of the Field Post Office were made soldiers as well, but formed a corps of their own rather than belonging to the TSD. It was also made possible for qualified reserve technical service officials to become reserve officers of the motor maintenance troops.\n\nThe officials had titles, not ranks: ''Intendant, Direktor, Rat, Vorsteher, Inspektor, Meister, Assistent''. This is a complex subject as each branch had its own titles.\n\n=== Military officials ===\n==== Shoulderboards ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)#Corps colours of the Heeresverwaltung}}\nWith certain exceptions, military officials ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4r-Beamte}}) wore shoulderboards similar to those of soldiers of equivalent rank, but distinguished by the addition of dark green elements: those equivalent to generals had a central cord in their braided shoulderboards which incorporated green chevrons, and those equivalent to officers wore a narrow green stripe between the rows of braid. WO-equivalent ''officials'' wore a complex braided shoulderboard made of green, black and silver cords. In nearly all cases the shoulderboard underlay was a double layer of dark green under ''Nebenfarbe'', and metal pins with the '''HV''' (German abbreviation of ''Heeresverwaltung'', \"Army Administration\") cipher were worn.\n\nCertain services had insignia of their own: for example the ''Feldpost'' (\"Field Post Office\") wore shoulderboards with gold rather than green elements and the initials '''FP'''; and musical officials wore silver-and-red shoulderboards with a lyre insignia. ''Beamten'' in the employ of a military administration authority in the occupied territories wore '''MV''' (German abbreviation of ''Milit\u00e4rverwaltung'', \"Military Administration\") pins rather than '''HV''' ciphers.\n\nMost officials wore in addition to their dark green Waffenfarbe a secondary colour (''Nebenfarbe'') denoting their branch:\n\nIn March 1940 distinct ''Nebenfarben'' were abolished and replaced with light grey.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = \n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1''' to '''3''') and [[Officer rank]]s ('''4''' to '''6''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 400\n| image2   =\n| caption2  = <center><small>Officer ranks ('''7''' to '''9'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''10-11'''1)</small></center>\n| width2     = 345\n| header    = Rank insignias to officials of the Milit\u00e4rverwaltung (MV)\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps </center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1-2'''), [[Officer rank]]s ('''3''' to '''7'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''8-9''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 600\n| header    = File 2: Rank insignias to officials on the \"Reich\u00b4s court-martial\" <small>([[Reichskriegsgericht]])</small>\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps 1935 until 1945</center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Collar patches ====\n''Heeresbeamten'' wore distinctive collar patches; these tabs indicated not the official's rank or title, but rather the \"grade\" of the service in which the official was employed. These were classified by the minimum educational requirement, and ranged from ''Einfacher Dienst'' (Basic Services), for which a grade-school education was sufficient, through ''Mitteler'' (Middle) and ''Gehobener'' (Elevated) ''Dienst'', to ''H\u00f6herer Dienst'' (Higher Services) which required a university degree.\n\nOfficials in the Basic Services wore collar patches similar to (but larger than) enlisted soldiers', grey ''Litzen'' on dark green ''Patten'', but the patch was piped on three sides in ''Nebenfarbe''; similarly officials in the Middle and Elevated services wore officer-pattern ''Litzen'', again with ''Nebenfarbe''-piped patches. Officials of the Higher Services wore unique ''Kragenpatten'' with ''alt-Preussische Litzen'' in gold like ''Offiziere des Generalstabs'', but on dark green with, again, ''Nebenfarbe'' piping. General officer-equivalents wore green patches with generals' arabesques, similarly bordered.\n\n=== ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer'' ===\nIn addition to the career ''Beamten'', wartime needs led to the creation of \"Officials for the duration of the war,\" or ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer''. These men had needed skills but either did not possess all the qualifications to become full-fledged ''Beamten,'' or were effectively drafted from civilian jobs. The matter was further confused by the fact that Beamter a. K. did the same jobs and held the same titles as career officials.\n\nNonetheless, Beamter a. K. wore entirely distinct collar patches. The backing patch was large and piped on three sides like that worn by career ''Beamten'', but was light grey edged in green. The device was a rectangle pointed at the upper end with braid down the center, much like a British general's [[gorget patch]], the colors indicating the degree of the ''Beamter's'' service: grey with green braid for basic services, silver with green braid for middle and elevated services, and gold on gold for higher services.\n\n=== Military Supreme Court officials (''Wehrmachtbeamte beim Reichskriegsgericht'') ===\nOfficials of the Wehrmacht who worked in Military Supreme Courts wore shoulder straps without the \"HV\" and had the secondary colour of Bordeaux red (''Bordorot'').\n\n=== ''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' ===\n{{Main|Sonderf\u00fchrer}}\n''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' (short: '''Sdf'''; or '''Sf''' \u2013 in the meaning of '''specialist leader''' (literal: ''special leader'') \u2013 introduced to the [[Wehrmacht]] in the year 1937,<ref>{{cite book |author1=''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' |title=Mobilmachungsplan f\u00fcr das Heer vom 12.

There were few alterations and adjustments made as the army grew from a limited peacetime defense force of 100,000 men to a war-fighting force of several million men.\n\nThese ranks and insignia were specific to the Heer and in special cases to senior Wehrmacht officers in the independent services; the uniforms and rank systems of the other branches of the ''Wehrmacht'', the [[Ranks and insignia of the Luftwaffe (1935\u20131945)|''Luftwaffe'']] (Air Force) and [[Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']] (Navy), were different, as were those of the [[uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS]] which was a Party organization outside the ''Wehrmacht.'' The [[Nazi Party]] also had its own series of [[Nazi Germany paramilitary ranks|paramilitary uniforms and insignia]].\n\n==Insignia==\n\n===National Emblem (breast eagle): ''Hoheitszeichen'' or ''Wehrmachtsadler''===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal \n| align     = right\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Wehrmachtsadler\n| image1    = Wehrmachtsadler-1935.svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Wehrmachtsadler-1939.svg\n| caption2  = 1939\n| image3    = Wehrmachtsadler-1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Wehrmachtsadler-1944.svg\n| caption4  = 1944\n| image5    = Wehrmachtsadler-Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\nThe ''[[Reichswehr]]'s'' visual acknowledgement of the new [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] reality came on 17 February 1934, when the Commander-in-Chief, [[Werner von Blomberg]], ordered the Nazi Party eagle-and-swastika, now [[Germany]]'s National Emblem, to be worn on uniform blouses and headgear effective 1 May.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} The design adopted, in silver for the ''Reichsheer'' (army) and in gold for the ''Reichsmarine'' (navy), was a stylized eagle with outstretched, beveled wings clutching a wreathed mobile ''Hakenkreuz'', later to be called the ''Wehrmachtsadler'' (\"armed forces eagle\").{{efn|The ''Luftwaffe'', although a branch of the ''Wehrmacht'', would use its own eagle design.}} On tunics this took the form of a cloth patch about 9&nbsp;cm (3\u215d\") wide worn on the right breast, above the pocket. For enlisted uniforms it was jacquard-woven (\"BeVo\") or sometimes machine-embroidered in silver-grey rayon, for officers machine- or hand-embroidered in white silk or bright aluminum wire, and for generals hand-embroidered in gold bullion.{{efn|\"Gold bullion\" in this context does not (usually) refer to actual gold, but to gold-colored wire, typically a bronze alloy}} The backing was \"badge-cloth\" (''Abzeichentuch''), a close-woven velvetish fabric; this was originally ''Reichsheer'' grey, but in late 1935 the renamed ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht Heer]]'' changed its ''Abzeichentuch'' color to a dark blue-green called ''flaschengr\u00fcn'' (bottle-green).\n\nThe war brought several variations to the breast eagle, although it should be kept in mind that none of them was replaced or de-authorized, and all were being worn side by side at war's end. When hostilities began in 1939, on the enlisted ''Feldbluse'' or [[World War II German uniform#Field Tunic (Feldbluse) Model 1936|field blouse]] the eagle was changed from silver-white to matte grey for reduced visibility; and in 1940 backings began to be produced in field-grey (''feldgrau''). Another version appeared with the advent of the [[World War II German uniform#Field Blouse Model 1944|Model 1944 Field Blouse]], which used a triangular backing for speed and simplicity of manufacture. Very late in the war some ''Hoheitszeichen'' were simply printed on thin fabric.\n\nThere were also versions for other uniforms: both white and grey variants on black for the [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform (Sonderbekleidung der Panzertruppen)|Panzer uniform]], and in dull grey-blue on tan backing for the [[World War II German uniform#Tropical uniform|tropical]] (''[[Afrikakorps]]'') uniform.

By the middle of World War I these ornate collars had been reduced to an embroidered representation of short lengths of braid joined at the ends, sewn to patches worn at the front of the collar. When the ''Reichsheer'' was established in 1921 as Germany's first national army{{efn|The German Army of Imperial times comprised in wartime the armies of the Kingdoms of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg under the Prussian General Staff (''Generalstab'').}} ''Litzen'' were prescribed as the universal collar device for all personnel other than generals, and the Third Reich continued the practice.\n\nHowever, for clarification it has to be distinguished between \"collar patch\" ({{lang-de|Kragenpatte or Kragenspiegel}}), and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] braid (Unteroffizierslitze or Kragenlitze) \u2013 the status symbol of all German NCO ranks \u2013 encircling the collar of the uniform tunic. An NCO wore both, collar patches, and the collar encircling braid. [[Commissioned officer]]s wore only collar patches.\n\n==== Design and versions ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)}}\nOn both collar points of any uniform jacket there was a collar patch. Each patch consisted of the padding, and two parallel facings ({{lang-de|Patten}}), the so-called ''Litzenspiegel'', symbolising the double braid of the 19th century.\n\nThe padding of full-dress collar patches showed the wearer's ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'' (corps color). The dress tunic version was embroidered in fine aluminum thread on a patch of ''badge cloth'' ({{lang-de|Abzeichentuch}}). The backing also showed through in the space between the two parallel facings of the collar patch, and formed so a colour center stripe.\n\nOn field \u2013 and service uniforms, beginning in late 1935, the collar patch was dark bottle-green to match the collar; the ''Waffenfarbe'' \"showed through\" (in fact colored cord was sewn into) the center strip of each braid, the ''Litzenspiegel.''\n\nFor enlisted men, service ''collar patches'' were machine-woven in silver-grey rayon; COs' were embroidered more elaborately in white silk or aluminium thread, and were somewhat larger to match their higher collars.\n\nNCOs ({{lang-de|Unteroffiziere}}) wore standard enlisted collar patches but were distinguished by a strip of 9mm silver-grey diamond-woven rayon braid (Unteroffoziers-Tressen, NCO-Tressen), sewn around the collar, except on the dress, where the NCO-Tresse was bright aluminum. However, the aluminum-embroidered NCO-Tressen on dress uniforms ({{lang-de|Ausgangsuniform, Paradeuniform}}) encircled the collar's upper edge, the simpler NCO-Tressen on service \u2013 or field uniform encircled the collar's lower edge.{{Clear}}\n\n====Universal design from 1938====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted versions\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption1  = <center>Dress</center>\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = <center>Field, 1938</center>\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = <center>Field, 1940</center>\n}}\n\n[[File:Feldgendarmerie.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Field tunic with collar patches, NCO-Tressen and [[Gorget]], post 1940.]]\n\nBy 1938 the fast-growing ''Heer'' had found that it was impractical, for the enlisted field uniform, to manufacture and stock a multitude of collar patches in assorted ''Waffenfarben'' which also had to be sewn on and frequently changed by unit tailors. Accordingly, new universal collar patches were introduced with the ''Litzenspiegel'' and ''Mittelstreifen''{{Explain|date=March 2018}} woven in dark green to match the backing patch, and which could be applied at the factory; ''Waffenfarbe'' was now displayed on the shoulder-straps, which simply buttoned on and were easily switched.\n\nWith the wartime change to lower-visibility insignia enlisted collar patches were woven in matte \"mouse-grey\" with field-grey stripes, which were at first sewn to green collar patches as before but increasingly directly to the collar, which beginning in 1940 was made in ''feldgrau'' like the uniform; grey collar patches were never produced. The troops however preferred the green patches (and collars) if they had or could get them, especially on \"clean\" uniforms for walking-out; and long-service veterans took particular pride in pre-38 versions.\n\nIn contrast, officers' service uniform collar patches never changed. While most officers in the front lines wore the enlisted field uniform as per wartime regulations, many opted to have their green-and-silver collar patches added instead of (or on top of) the factory versions. \n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>field & service</small></center>\n| header    = Enlisted versions, tropic\n}}\n\nOn olive tropical uniforms the collar patches were tan with dull grey-blue ''Litzenspiegel'' for all personnel; officers again sometimes added their green collar patches. Tropical NCO collar ''Tressen'' were copper-brown, or sometimes olive drab.{{Clear}}\n\n====Armored vehicle uniforms====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| width     = 45\n| header    = [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]] crew collar insignia\n| image1    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Litzen.jpg\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten ohne Abzeichen.jpg\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (assault artillery)</small></center>\n| footer_background = red\n}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     =\n| image3    = Panzer Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption3  = <center><small>Death's-head</small></center>\n| width3    = 60\n| image1    = Panzersonderbekleidung Kragenpatten.jpg\n| caption1  = <center><small>collar patch</small></center>\n| width1    = 40\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>shoulder strap</small></center>\n| width2    = 120\n| header    = rank insignias armored troops\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (armored corps)</small></center>\n| footer_background = #FF99CC\n}}\n\nA major exception to the wearing of ''Litzen'' was the \"panzer wrap\" ({{lang-de|Panzerjacke}}), the double-breasted jacket worn by crews of tanks and other armored vehicles. When the ''[[Panzertruppe]]'' were established in 1935 they were issued a [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform|distinctive black uniform]] and as a badge the ''Totenkopf'' or Death's-head, versions of which had formerly been worn by the Imperial tank corps and [[Media:AugustvonMackensen.jpg|various cavalry units]]. These skulls took the form of white-metal pins attached to black ''Kragenpatten'' which were edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn mid-1940 crews of assault guns (''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]en'') received a uniform of their own, identical in cut to the ''Panzerjacke'' but in standard field-grey, which they wore with red artillery piping. Over the course of the war a bewildering and changing series of regulations governed the uniforms and insignia for assault guns, tank destroyers, armored cars and self-propelled guns (SPG). Depending on the unit and the date either the black or grey wrap or the standard ''Feldbluse'' might be authorized, and on the grey \"assault gun\" jacket the regulation collar patches could be black with skulls, or grey with skulls, ''Litzen'', or no device at all. The result in practice was chaos; wartime photos show a mix of uniforms and insignia worn not only in the same battalion, but even in the same vehicle.\n\nOfficially both colours of panzer wrap were working and field uniforms to be worn only in or around the vehicle; this regulation was universally ignored. ''Panzertruppen'' were issued standard uniforms for service-dress and walking out but rarely wore them, much preferring their unique jackets.\n\nIn North Africa, [[Armored fighting vehicle|AFV crews]] wore the same tropical uniform as the other branches, including collar patches; many tankers however pinned their ''Totenkopf'' badges to their lapels.{{Clear}}\n\n====Infanterie Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"====\n[[File:Special Single Litzen for NCO ranks of Gro\u00dfdeutschland IR.jpg|thumb|left|200px|NCOs' collar patch and ''Tressen'' of I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]\n\nIn June 1939, the Wehrmacht Heer wanted to renew its ties with the Old Army tradition by introducing a new uniform for its most prestigious unit: ''Wachregiment \"Berlin\"'' which was renamed [[Infantry Regiment Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Infantry Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]. The new dress uniform for I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\" had an elongated collar patch with single ''Litzenspiegel'' for NCOs and two for enlisted. Although shown to the press, this new uniform was not provided to the unit due to the outbreak of World War II and was placed in depot storage.{{Clear}}\n\n==== General Staff Corps Officers ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-51, Rudolf-Christoph v.

They ranked from ''Hauptmann im Generalstab'' (captain) through ''Oberst i.G.'' (colonel). All were, before 1939, graduates of the Military Academy, the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]''. On division staffs they held the position of '''Ia''' (operational chief of staff) or '''Ib''' (chief of the rear echelon). In the higher echelons, the intelligence and training staff sections were most of the time in the personal charge of General Staff Corps officers. The General Staff Officers had their own distinctive Litzen called ''alt-Preu\u00dfische'' (old Prussian), or ''Kolbenstickerei'' (\"lobe-embroidery\"). These were the same whether on carmine dress ''Kragenpatten'' or green service patches; colored ''Litzenspiegel'' were unnecessary. General Staff officers assigned to the supreme headquarters (the ''Reichskriegsministerium'', later the [[OKH]] and the [[OKW]]), the Kriegsakademie, and military attaches were further distinguished by having their Litzen in gold rather than silver. These Generalstaboffiziere were called \"des Generalstabs\", Oberst d.G., etc. The special golden Litzen were abolished in November 1942. Only Military attaches kept their Litzen as long as they were in their present position. The F\u00fchrer wanted a closer union between the front and the OKW and OKH.\n\nIn addition to their collar patches, General Staff Officers wore trouser-stripes, of the same design as generals' but in carmine rather than scarlet.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:WMacht arabesques OF10toOF6-hor 1945.jpg|left|120px]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0408-503, Walter v.

These devices, sometimes called ''Arabesken'' (arabesques), were embroidered in gold bullion or golden synthetic ''Celleon'' on ''Hochrot'' (scarlet) backing.\nField Marshals wore the same ''Arabesken'' as generals until April 1941, when they were authorized a longer variant with three rather than two iterations of the repeating pattern, for a total of six \"prongs\".{{sfn|Rosignoli|1975|p=209}} In some cases GFM did not bother to replace their generals' tabs, or did so only on their dress uniforms.\n\nGeneral officers of the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' \u2013 TDS) and of the specialist careers (medical, veterinary, ordnance, and motor park) wore the same insignia until April 1944, when they were ordered to exchange their scarlet ''Kragenpatten'' for ''alt-Larisch'' tabs backed in their respective ''[[Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)|Waffenfarbe:]]''\n\n* {{Farbindex|93CCEA|bright blue}} \u2013 TDS administrative;\n* {{Farbindex|6495ED|cornflower blue}} \u2013 medical;\n* {{Farbindex|FF7538|orange}} \u2013 ordnance;{{efn|Before June 1944 their Waffenfarbe was bright red.}}\n* {{Farbindex|FFC0CB|pink}} \u2013 motor park;\n* {{Farbindex|960018|carmine}} \u2013 veterinary;\n* {{Farbindex|900020|wine red}} \u2013 TDS judiciary.\n\nIn October 1944, the wear-out period of the scarlet backing color for Generals of the specialist careers was extended for an undetermined period.\n\nThese [[Gorget patches|arabesque collar patches]] are still worn today by general officers of the present-day [[Bundeswehr]].\n\n=====Chief=====\n[[File:VonRundstedt-Shoulderboards-alt-Larisch.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Gorget patch|Kragenpatte]] & [[Epaulette]] of von Rundstedt]]\nIn the Wehrmacht Heer, upon retirement, certain senior German generals were awarded the honorary post of ''Chef'' (Chief) of a regiment, much like the [[Honorary Colonel]] in the British Army. It was a German custom dating from the late 18th century.  These generals were authorized to wear the tunic and insignia of an officer of the regiment, including ordinary officers' ''Litzen.'' Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], ''Chef'' of the {{ill|18th Infantry Regiment (Germany)|lt=18th Infantry Regiment|de|18. Infanterie-Regiment (Reichswehr)}}, wore a big 18 on his shoulderboards, and for everyday wear favored the ornamented tunic of an infantry officer with white piping rather than a general's uniform.\n\nHitler appointed first Generaloberst [[Hans von Seeckt]], ancient \"Chef der Heeresleitung\", to be Chef of the 67th Infanterie Regiment on his 70th birthday in April 1936, a few months before he died. Only seven German generals were appointed Chefs: in addition to Seeckt and Rundstedt they were General der Infanterie [[Franz Ritter von Epp|Ritter von Epp]] (Chef of the 61st Infanterie Regiment in Munich); Generalfeldmarschall [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] (Chef of the 5th Kavallerie Regiment in [[Stolp]]); Generaloberst [[Werner von Fritsch|von Fritsch]] (Chef of the 12th Artillerie Regiment in Schwerin); and Generalfeldmarschall [[Eduard von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli|von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli]] (Chef of the 28th Infanterie Regiment in [[Troppau]]). Generalfeldmarschall [[von Blomberg]] was appointed Chef of Infanterie Regiment 73 and wore a big 73 superimposed over the crossed batons of his shoulder board, but on 4 February 1938 he was dismissed and his name was deleted from the seniority list.\n\n===Shoulder-straps (''Schulterklappen'') and shoulderboards (''Schulterst\u00fccke'')===\n\n====Enlisted men====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 80\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n\n}}\n\nThe ''Reichsheer's'' shoulder-straps were very similar to those of World War I, made of ''feldgrau'' uniform cloth with pointed or \"gable\" button ends. In December 1934 the material was changed to grey badge-cloth (''Abzeichentuch'') and in September 1935 changed again to dark bottle-green (''flaschengr\u00fcn''). These \"first pattern\" shoulder-straps were not edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn 1938, simultaneous with the removal of ''Waffenfarbe'' from field-uniform collar patches, new shoulder-straps were issued. These \"second pattern\" straps had round rather than pointed ends, and were edged on three sides with wool (later rayon) piping in ''Waffenfarbe.''  This pattern would be used through the end of the war, although in 1940 manufacture reverted to field-grey uniform cloth, and as usual alternate versions were made to go with the Panzer uniform (black), tropical uniform (olive cotton) and [[World War II German uniform#HBT fatigue and summer uniforms (Drillichanzug/Sommerfeldanzug)|HBT summer uniform]] (reed-green twill). ''Schulterklappen'' were not worn with the fatigue uniform, nor with camouflage smocks and parkas which used an [[Ranks and Insignia of the German Army in World War II#Smock/parka rank insignia|alternate system of rank insignia]].\n\nFor junior enlisted men (''Mannschaften''), rank insignia if any was worn on the left sleeve. However the epaulettes did indicate the wearer's unit (usually regiment or independent battalion) together with his sub-branch if any, machine-embroidered in branch-color. For example, a ''Schulterklappe'' with rose-pink piping and number \"4\" would indicate the 4th Panzer Regiment; but if it carried a pink number \"4\" and letter \"A\" it would indicate the 4th Armored Reconnaissance (''Aufkl\u00e4rungs'') Battalion. The German Army used a very large assortment of Latin initials, Gothic initials, script ciphers, Arabic numerals, Roman numerals and symbols to designate all its various service branches and installations. Before the war, shoulder-buttons were embossed with the number of the wearer's company as well, this practice was discontinued \"for the duration.\"\n[[File:Trop Oberwachtmeister epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|80px|Cavalry ''Oberwachtmeister'', tropical]]\nBeginning in January 1940, shoulder-straps with unit insignia were (supposed to be) phased out as a security measure, and removable fabric loops with devices were issued instead. In May 1944 the embroidery was changed from ''waffenfarbe'' to light gray.\n\nNon-commissioned officers wore their rank insignia on their shoulder-straps, consisting of braid and pips (pyramidal \"stars\"). An ''Unteroffizier's'' (corporal's) epaulette was edged with ''Tresse'' on three sides and an ''Unterfeldwebel's'' (sergeant's) on all four. Senior NCO's (''Unteroffiziere mit Portepee'') added one to three pips; in addition, their unit identifiers took the form of white-metal pins rather than embroidery.\n\nShoulder-straps were made in both a standard width (4.5&nbsp;cm, 1\u00be\") and a wider one for three-digit unit numbers (5.3&nbsp;cm, 2\"), and in three lengths depending on the size of the man. There was in addition an extra-large size for the overcoat (''Mantel'').\n\n====Officers====\n\n[[File:Hauptmann Epaulette.jpg|thumb|left|90px]]\nOfficers' shoulderboards were constructed from \"Russia\" braid, an aluminum-thread double piping. Company-grade officers (''Leutnant'' through ''Hauptmann/Rittmeister'') wore epaulettes constructed by wrapping two side-by-side lengths of braid around the buttonhole and back, giving the appearance of eight parallel cords; the whole was sewn to an underlay (''Unterlagen'') of ''Waffenfarbe'' badge-cloth. Until 1938 the underlay was of the same outer dimensions as the braid, and only visible edge-on; in that year the underlay was made wider, so as to create the impression of edge piping like the enlisted shoulder-strap. Rank was indicated by zero to two gilt-metal pips; unit designators were also of gilt metal.\n[[File:Major Epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|95px]]\nField-grade officer (''Stabsoffizier'') shoulderboards were made by plaiting together double widths of Russia braid and looping them to form a buttonhole, sewn to a ''Waffenfarbe'' underlay; rank again was displayed by zero to two gilt pips.\n\nOnce the war began, dull grey aluminum braid appeared, but bright aluminum continued in use.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalsrangabzeichen.jpg|thumb|300px|Generals' shoulderboards, Wehrmacht (Heer)]]\n*'''1''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] ([[OF-10]], [[five-star rank]], shoulder strap from April 1941)\n*'''2''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] (OF-10, five-star rank, shoulder strap prior to April 1941)\n*'''3''' [[Generaloberst]] (OF-9, [[four-star rank]])\n*'''4''' [[General of the branch]] (OF-8, [[three-star rank]])\n*'''5''' [[Generalleutnant]] (OF-7, [[two-star rank]])\n*'''6''' [[Generalmajor]] (OF-6, [[one-star rank]])\n\nGenerals' shoulderboards were constructed similarly to those of field-grade officers, but comprised a length of silver Russia braid between two braided cords of gold bullion or ''Celleon.'' Since the resulting combination was wider, generals' boards were plaited in four 'loops' rather than five. Their buttons were gilt, and rank was indicated by zero to three silver pips, or crossed batons in the case of field marshals. The underlay was scarlet, except (from 1944) for generals of staff corps, who were instructed to wear ''Waffenfarbe'' instead.\n\nIn April 1941, ''Generalfeldmarschall'' epaulettes were changed to incorporate a central gold cord instead of silver.\n\nColonels-in-chief wearing that uniform wore gold generals' shoulderboards underlaid with the ''Waffenfarbe'' of the regiment rather than scarlet; GFM von Rundstedt sometimes simply pinned his crossed batons to an infantry colonel's epaulettes.\n\n====Retired personnel====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalmajor (a.D.).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Generalmajor a.D.]]\nBy order of Marshal Hindenburg in March 1932, soldiers who retired after 15 years of service received the right to wear the uniform of the unit they left. The shoulderboards and shoulder straps of retired soldiers had a bridle 1.5&nbsp;cm wide attached under the middle.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Schirmmutze cap badges.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Eagle/swastika and wreathed cockade used on the peaked cap (Schirmm\u00fctze).]] [[File:Insignias casco.svg|thumb|Decals of Heer used on various helmets.]]\nCaps and helmets bore two common insignia elements, in various forms: the [[Coat of arms of Germany#Nazi Germany|National Emblem]] and the national colors. World War I caps had carried dual [[cockades]] or roundels, one in Imperial black-white-red and one in the colors of the particular State within the Empire. The ''[[Reichswehr]]'' changed this to a single cockade in the Weimar Republic's black, red and gold; almost as soon as Hitler took power he restored the [[Flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1866\u20131918)|pre-1919 tricolor flag]], and ordered the Army to return to black-white-red.\n\n===Belt buckles (''Koppelschl\u00f6sser'')===\n[[File:Koppelschloss Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Enlisted ''Koppelschlo\u00df'']]\nBelt buckles for enlisted men were of box type, made of aluminum or stamped steel and bearing a circular device with a version of the ''Hoheitszeichen'' called the Army eagle or ''Heeresadler'' (an eagle with downswept wings clutching an unwreathed swastika) surmounted by the motto ''[[Gott mit uns]]'', or \"God with us.\" For field wear these were usually painted field-grey to reduce visibility and had a smooth finish; on the other hand, dress buckles were silver-washed with a pebbled surface surrounding the Hoheitszeichen.\n\nOfficers' field and service buckles were of a two-pronged frame type. With dress uniform officers wore a belt of silver braid with a circular silver-washed or -plated aluminum buckle, in the form of an oakleaf wreath surrounding a ''Heeresadler.'' Generals' were the same but gilt or gold-plated.\n\nWith the tropical uniform and its belt of cotton webbing, officers wore a buckle identical to the dress buckle but painted olive-drab.\n\n==Ranks and rank insignia==\n\n===Rank tables===\n\n====Enlisted personnel (''Mannschaften'')====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted collar ''Litzen''\n| footer    = Red ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': artillery\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen 1934.svg\n| alt1      = Mannschaft Litzen 1935\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption4  = Dress\n| image5    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted ''Schulterklappen''\n| footer    = White ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': infantry, rose pink: armor\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer uniform\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He was therefore roughly analogous to a Company Sergeant-Major or First Sergeant, although his duties did not usually involve combat leadership. ''Der Spie\u00df''{{efn|\"The spear.\" This may refer to the sergeant of a flintlock-era company having carried a [[polearm]] rather than a musket, or it may relate to Latin ''pilus prior'' \"leading spear,\" the senior centurion in a cohort.}} or ''die Kompanie-Mutter'', as he was called, was not necessarily the ranking ''Unteroffizier'' in the company, especially since typically two of the platoons were commanded by senior NCOs rather than officers. A ''Hauptfeldwebel'' however had to be \nof ''Portepee'' grade; a junior NCO filling the role was a ''Hauptfeldwebeldiensttuer,'' \"one doing ''Hauptfeldwebel'' duties.\"\n\nThe insignia for a ''Hauptfeldwebel'' was a pair of NCO ''Tressen'' encircling each lower sleeve, nicknamed \"piston rings;\" he also carried a leather ''Meldetasche'' or report-case tucked into his tunic front.\n\n====Senior non-commissioned specialist officers====\nIn two specialist career paths it was possible to attain rank above ''Stabsfeldwebel'': fortifications engineers (''Festungspioniere'') and farriers (''Hufbeschlagschmieder'').{{efn|Farriers, blacksmiths specializing in the shoeing and care of horses, were a very important component of the WWII German army, 70\u201380% of which depended on horse-drawn transport.

They consist of civil service personnel performing functions within the Armed Forces and are recruited, in part, from former professional non-commissioned officers who became military candidates for civil service ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4ranw\u00e4rter}}) at the end of their 12-year contractual period of active military service.\n\nUp to 1944, none of these officials were classified as soldiers; in that year certain groups were converted into officers in the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' or TSD). These were the higher administrative officers (''Intendanten'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general; the lower administrative officers (''Zahlmeister'') in the ranks of first and second lieutenant, and the judge advocates (''Richter'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general. At this time all personnel of the Field Post Office were made soldiers as well, but formed a corps of their own rather than belonging to the TSD. It was also made possible for qualified reserve technical service officials to become reserve officers of the motor maintenance troops.\n\nThe officials had titles, not ranks: ''Intendant, Direktor, Rat, Vorsteher, Inspektor, Meister, Assistent''. This is a complex subject as each branch had its own titles.\n\n=== Military officials ===\n==== Shoulderboards ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)#Corps colours of the Heeresverwaltung}}\nWith certain exceptions, military officials ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4r-Beamte}}) wore shoulderboards similar to those of soldiers of equivalent rank, but distinguished by the addition of dark green elements: those equivalent to generals had a central cord in their braided shoulderboards which incorporated green chevrons, and those equivalent to officers wore a narrow green stripe between the rows of braid. WO-equivalent ''officials'' wore a complex braided shoulderboard made of green, black and silver cords. In nearly all cases the shoulderboard underlay was a double layer of dark green under ''Nebenfarbe'', and metal pins with the '''HV''' (German abbreviation of ''Heeresverwaltung'', \"Army Administration\") cipher were worn.\n\nCertain services had insignia of their own: for example the ''Feldpost'' (\"Field Post Office\") wore shoulderboards with gold rather than green elements and the initials '''FP'''; and musical officials wore silver-and-red shoulderboards with a lyre insignia. ''Beamten'' in the employ of a military administration authority in the occupied territories wore '''MV''' (German abbreviation of ''Milit\u00e4rverwaltung'', \"Military Administration\") pins rather than '''HV''' ciphers.\n\nMost officials wore in addition to their dark green Waffenfarbe a secondary colour (''Nebenfarbe'') denoting their branch:\n\nIn March 1940 distinct ''Nebenfarben'' were abolished and replaced with light grey.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = \n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1''' to '''3''') and [[Officer rank]]s ('''4''' to '''6''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 400\n| image2   =\n| caption2  = <center><small>Officer ranks ('''7''' to '''9'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''10-11'''1)</small></center>\n| width2     = 345\n| header    = Rank insignias to officials of the Milit\u00e4rverwaltung (MV)\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps </center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1-2'''), [[Officer rank]]s ('''3''' to '''7'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''8-9''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 600\n| header    = File 2: Rank insignias to officials on the \"Reich\u00b4s court-martial\" <small>([[Reichskriegsgericht]])</small>\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps 1935 until 1945</center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Collar patches ====\n''Heeresbeamten'' wore distinctive collar patches; these tabs indicated not the official's rank or title, but rather the \"grade\" of the service in which the official was employed. These were classified by the minimum educational requirement, and ranged from ''Einfacher Dienst'' (Basic Services), for which a grade-school education was sufficient, through ''Mitteler'' (Middle) and ''Gehobener'' (Elevated) ''Dienst'', to ''H\u00f6herer Dienst'' (Higher Services) which required a university degree.\n\nOfficials in the Basic Services wore collar patches similar to (but larger than) enlisted soldiers', grey ''Litzen'' on dark green ''Patten'', but the patch was piped on three sides in ''Nebenfarbe''; similarly officials in the Middle and Elevated services wore officer-pattern ''Litzen'', again with ''Nebenfarbe''-piped patches. Officials of the Higher Services wore unique ''Kragenpatten'' with ''alt-Preussische Litzen'' in gold like ''Offiziere des Generalstabs'', but on dark green with, again, ''Nebenfarbe'' piping. General officer-equivalents wore green patches with generals' arabesques, similarly bordered.\n\n=== ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer'' ===\nIn addition to the career ''Beamten'', wartime needs led to the creation of \"Officials for the duration of the war,\" or ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer''. These men had needed skills but either did not possess all the qualifications to become full-fledged ''Beamten,'' or were effectively drafted from civilian jobs. The matter was further confused by the fact that Beamter a. K. did the same jobs and held the same titles as career officials.\n\nNonetheless, Beamter a. K. wore entirely distinct collar patches. The backing patch was large and piped on three sides like that worn by career ''Beamten'', but was light grey edged in green. The device was a rectangle pointed at the upper end with braid down the center, much like a British general's [[gorget patch]], the colors indicating the degree of the ''Beamter's'' service: grey with green braid for basic services, silver with green braid for middle and elevated services, and gold on gold for higher services.\n\n=== Military Supreme Court officials (''Wehrmachtbeamte beim Reichskriegsgericht'') ===\nOfficials of the Wehrmacht who worked in Military Supreme Courts wore shoulder straps without the \"HV\" and had the secondary colour of Bordeaux red (''Bordorot'').\n\n=== ''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' ===\n{{Main|Sonderf\u00fchrer}}\n''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' (short: '''Sdf'''; or '''Sf''' \u2013 in the meaning of '''specialist leader''' (literal: ''special leader'') \u2013 introduced to the [[Wehrmacht]] in the year 1937,<ref>{{cite book |author1=''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' |title=Mobilmachungsplan f\u00fcr das Heer vom 12.

He is a [[solicitor]] and a former member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] for [[District Council (Second)]] constituency.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHo was born in what was then [[British Hong Kong]] on 1 December 1951 in a big family with six children. His father worked in a shipping company by day and as a translator by night, along with two other jobs that he had.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite news|title=Albert Ho Chun-yan|work=HK Magazine|url=http://hk-magazine.com/article/inside-hk/interviews/3941/albert-ho-chun-yan|first=Jan|last=Leung}}</ref> Ho got his [[Bachelor of Laws]] with honors in the [[University of Hong Kong]] in 1974, obtained [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] in 1975.<ref name=\"Martin\">{{cite web|title=Albert Ho Chun-yan|url=http://www.martinlee.org.hk/BiosAlbertHo.html}}</ref>\n\nHe attended lectures given by Hsu Kwan-san, a Chinese historian who later became a professor at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], whom Ho cited his political belief and Chinese national sentiment were influenced by. During his college life, he developed his liberal ideals and actively involved in student politics and campaigned for [[Mak Hoi-wah]] who ran for the [[Hong Kong University Students' Union]] against the Maoist nationalists who dominated the student union in the 1970s.\n\n==Legal and early political career==\nHo got [[admission to practice law]] in 1977 and appointed a [[notary public]] of the common law in 1988. He was employed for Messrs. C.Y. Kwan & Co. as a solicitor for nearly 20 years, then left to set up his own law firm, Ho, Tse, Wai & Partners. His [[litigation]] experience varied from banking cases and commercial law to land law and matrimonial disputes, as well as in criminal and medical negligence cases. Albert Ho worked a number of human rights cases on a [[pro bono]] (undertaken voluntarily and without payment) for the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy camp]].<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nHo stepped into politics when he was first appointed to the [[Kowloon City District Council|Kowloon City District Board]] from 1982 to 1983.<ref name=\"Martin\"/> In 1985 he co-founded the [[Hong Kong Affairs Society]] (HKAS) to participate in the electoral politics during the transition period. During his spell as the leader of the HKAS, he demanded the faster pace of democratisation in Hong Kong and safeguarding the freedom and lifestyles after the handover of Hong Kong to Mainland China after 1997. In 1989, he co-founded the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] to support the [[Tiananmen protests of 1989]] and critical of the Beijing government's bloody crackdown. He became the third chairman of the alliance since 2014, succeeding [[Lee Cheuk-yan]].\n\nHe ran for the [[Urban Council of Hong Kong|Urban Council]] in Kowloon City West in the [[1986 Hong Kong municipal elections|1986 municipal election]] but was defeated by incumbent [[Peter Chan Chi-kwan]]. He ran again in the [[1991 Hong Kong municipal elections|1991 Urban Council election]] in [[Southern District, Hong Kong|Southern District]] but was again lost to incumbent Joseph Chan Yuet-sut of the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong]]. He was elected to the [[Regional Council of Hong Kong|Regional Council]] in the [[1995 Hong Kong municipal elections|municipal elections]] in 1995, receiving the largest number of votes in Regional Council.<ref name=\"Martin\"/> He kept served on the council through 1997 until it was abolished by then [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]] in 2000.\n\nHe had also been member of the [[Tuen Mun District Council]] for [[Lok Tsui (constituency)|Lok Tsui]] since the [[1999 Hong Kong local elections|1999 District Council election]]. He had been targeted by the radical democrats, including [[Albert Chan]] of the [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] in the [[2011 Hong Kong local elections|2011 District Council election]] who opposed Democrats' compromise with the Beijing officials on the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|2012 constitutional reform proposals]] and in the [[2015 Hong Kong local elections|2015 District Council election]] by [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Cheng Chung-tai]]. He kept the seat for 15 years but was defeated in 2015 by [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] lawyer [[Junius Ho]] in 2015 by a narrow margin of 277 votes.\n\n==Legislative Councillor==\nIn April 1990, Ho and other pro-democracy activists co-founded the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] (UDHK), the first major pro-democracy party in the city, in which he became the founding vice chairman. The party transformed into today's [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] in 1994 where he was the member of the party's first executive committee. In 1992, he ran for the [[1992 New Territories West by-election|by-election]] in [[New Territories West (constituency)#1991 Constituencies|New Territories West]] as his first attempt to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] after incumbent Democrat [[Ng Ming-yam]] died of cancer. He was defeated by conservative rural leader [[Tang Siu-tong]] by only four percent of the votes. He ran again in New Territories West in [[1995 Hong Kong legislative election|1995 Legislative Council election]], receiving 54 percent of the popular vote.\n\nHe stepped down from the colonial legislature on 30 June 1997 on the eve of the [[handover of Hong Kong]] after the Beijing government dismantled the \"through train\" agreement of allowing the 1995 elected legislature to transition beyond 1997. The Democratic Party boycotted the [[Provisional Legislative Council]] controlled by Beijing and refused to take part in it. In November 1997, Ho was nominated by the Democratic Party to run for a seat in the [[National People's Congress]], but excluded from competition when failed to obtain the minimum number of nominations from the 400-strong Beijing-appointed election conference.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nIn the [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|first Legislative Council election]] of the SAR period in 1998, Ho won a seat in the New Territories West with his party colleague [[Lee Wing-tat]]. With his strong basis in his strategic district [[Tuen Mun]], he was re-elected in 2000 with one of the three Democratic Party tickets. [[Albert Chan]] who had strong basis in [[Tsuen Wan]] was also elected on the expense of Lee Wing-tat. Ho was re-elected in 2004. After the election, he unsuccessfully challenged [[Rita Fan]] in the [[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legco presidential]] election.\n\n=== 2006 attack ===\nOn 20 August 2006, Ho was assaulted by three unidentified men using [[baseball bat]]s and a [[Club (weapon)|baton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1224922006 |title=Baseball bat attack on MP at democracy rally |accessdate=2006-08-21 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313004148/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1224922006 |archivedate=13 March 2007 |df=dmy }}, ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 20 August 2006</ref> in a McDonald's restaurant in [[Central, Hong Kong]], after he had attended a protest against the government's plan to adopt a [[Goods and Services Tax (Hong Kong)|Goods and Services Tax]].

In December 2006, he was elected as party chairman in the [[2006 Democratic Party (HK) leadership election|leadership election]], defeating [[Chan King-ming]] of the reformist faction. Under his spell, the party absorbed [[Emily Lau]]'s [[the Frontier (Hong Kong)|The Frontier]] in 2008.\n\nIn June 2010, he led the Democratic Party delegation to the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Liaison Office]] to negotiate the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|electoral reform package]] with the representatives of the Beijing government, for the first time since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. The Beijing government eventually accepted the Democratic Party's modified proposal to allow five new directly elected [[District Council (Second)]] seats.<ref>Cheers and jeers for political reform vote, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', Gary Cheung, Albert Wong and Fanny WY Fung, 25 June 2010</ref> The compromise sparked extreme discontent among the radical democrats and created a major unrest among the pan-democracy camp. He was challenged by radical democrat legislator [[Albert Chan]] in his [[Lok Tsui (constituency)|Lok Tsui constituency]] in the following [[2011 Hong Kong local elections|2011 District Council election]] and barely retained his seat.\n\nIn the [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|2012 Legislative Council election]], Albert Ho ran in the newly created District Council (Second) constituency and was elected with 228,840 votes.

During his college life, he developed his liberal ideals and actively involved in student politics and campaigned for [[Mak Hoi-wah]] who ran for the [[Hong Kong University Students' Union]] against the Maoist nationalists who dominated the student union in the 1970s.\n\n==Legal and early political career==\nHo got [[admission to practice law]] in 1977 and appointed a [[notary public]] of the common law in 1988. He was employed for Messrs. C.Y. Kwan & Co. as a solicitor for nearly 20 years, then left to set up his own law firm, Ho, Tse, Wai & Partners. His [[litigation]] experience varied from banking cases and commercial law to land law and matrimonial disputes, as well as in criminal and medical negligence cases. Albert Ho worked a number of human rights cases on a [[pro bono]] (undertaken voluntarily and without payment) for the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy camp]].<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nHo stepped into politics when he was first appointed to the [[Kowloon City District Council|Kowloon City District Board]] from 1982 to 1983.<ref name=\"Martin\"/> In 1985 he co-founded the [[Hong Kong Affairs Society]] (HKAS) to participate in the electoral politics during the transition period. During his spell as the leader of the HKAS, he demanded the faster pace of democratisation in Hong Kong and safeguarding the freedom and lifestyles after the handover of Hong Kong to Mainland China after 1997. In 1989, he co-founded the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] to support the [[Tiananmen protests of 1989]] and critical of the Beijing government's bloody crackdown. He became the third chairman of the alliance since 2014, succeeding [[Lee Cheuk-yan]].\n\nHe ran for the [[Urban Council of Hong Kong|Urban Council]] in Kowloon City West in the [[1986 Hong Kong municipal elections|1986 municipal election]] but was defeated by incumbent [[Peter Chan Chi-kwan]]. He ran again in the [[1991 Hong Kong municipal elections|1991 Urban Council election]] in [[Southern District, Hong Kong|Southern District]] but was again lost to incumbent Joseph Chan Yuet-sut of the conservative [[Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong]]. He was elected to the [[Regional Council of Hong Kong|Regional Council]] in the [[1995 Hong Kong municipal elections|municipal elections]] in 1995, receiving the largest number of votes in Regional Council.<ref name=\"Martin\"/> He kept served on the council through 1997 until it was abolished by then [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]] in 2000.\n\nHe had also been member of the [[Tuen Mun District Council]] for [[Lok Tsui (constituency)|Lok Tsui]] since the [[1999 Hong Kong local elections|1999 District Council election]]. He had been targeted by the radical democrats, including [[Albert Chan]] of the [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] in the [[2011 Hong Kong local elections|2011 District Council election]] who opposed Democrats' compromise with the Beijing officials on the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|2012 constitutional reform proposals]] and in the [[2015 Hong Kong local elections|2015 District Council election]] by [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Cheng Chung-tai]]. He kept the seat for 15 years but was defeated in 2015 by [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] lawyer [[Junius Ho]] in 2015 by a narrow margin of 277 votes.\n\n==Legislative Councillor==\nIn April 1990, Ho and other pro-democracy activists co-founded the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] (UDHK), the first major pro-democracy party in the city, in which he became the founding vice chairman. The party transformed into today's [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] in 1994 where he was the member of the party's first executive committee. In 1992, he ran for the [[1992 New Territories West by-election|by-election]] in [[New Territories West (constituency)#1991 Constituencies|New Territories West]] as his first attempt to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] after incumbent Democrat [[Ng Ming-yam]] died of cancer.

The Democratic Party boycotted the [[Provisional Legislative Council]] controlled by Beijing and refused to take part in it. In November 1997, Ho was nominated by the Democratic Party to run for a seat in the [[National People's Congress]], but excluded from competition when failed to obtain the minimum number of nominations from the 400-strong Beijing-appointed election conference.<ref name=\"Martin\"/>\n\nIn the [[1998 Hong Kong legislative election|first Legislative Council election]] of the SAR period in 1998, Ho won a seat in the New Territories West with his party colleague [[Lee Wing-tat]].
