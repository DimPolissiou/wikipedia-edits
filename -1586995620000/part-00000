However, JICA wanted the bid for rolling stock to have no restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Centre and JICA in a tussle|url=http://www.asianage.com/metros/mumbai/090317/centre-and-jica-in-a-tussle.html|website=Asian Age|accessdate=9 March 2017|date=9 March 2017}}</ref> The MMRC argued that manufacturing rolling stock in India would reduce the cost of maintenance. The agency stated that although bids without restrictions would result in cheaper procurement cost for the rolling stock, the subsequent cost of importing spare parts would be expensive.

The high school was originally named Grandview. Its mascot was the [[Griffin]] and the [[school colors]] were maroon and gold. During the high school's first academic year in 1950\u201351, classes were held in the basement and boiler room of the district's Sappington School elementary building.  Construction began on the new high school in 1951, and classes began at the site in September of that year, even though the building was still under construction.\n\nThe school district decided that the name Grandview sounded too much like a rest home, so in April 1952, the school was renamed Lindbergh, after world-acclaimed pilot [[Charles Lindbergh]].  Its students became the Flyers and the school colors became green and gold.  The [[mascot]] later became Lindy, sporting a chicken or eagle-like costume.  In the fall of 2007, Lindy sported a new look: A black eagle, sporting a flight jacket, aviation cap and aviation goggles, as part of The Green Machine, a student spirit organization known for its rowdy antics.  In 1957 the district also adopted the name, becoming the [[Lindbergh School District]].  Several new school buildings were created over the following years, several of which later closed as a result of a declining student population.\n\nLindbergh High School became the largest high school in the state of [[Missouri]] during the 1970s, enrolling over 4,200 students.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Over the past three decades, the district's population waned (and aged, leading to childless senior citizens), causing the student body to drop significantly over the years. Lindbergh was the first school in Missouri to  offer the [[International Baccalaureate]] program.  In 1995 the school received $25 million for construction and improved facilities through the approval of [[bond measure]], Proposition R.  In 2000 and 2003 similar propositions were passed, giving the school additional revenues for improvements of [[infrastructure]] and [[building|facilities]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web\n  | last =Ashwell\n  | first =Wayne\n  | authorlink =\n  |author2=Vic Lenz\n   | title =Lindbergh High School History\n  | work =Lindbergh High School Website\n  | publisher =Lindbergh School District\n  | year =2004\n  | url =http://www.lindberghschools.ws/lhs/index.php\n  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080226093827/http://lindberghschools.ws/lhs/index.php\n  | url-status =dead\n  | archive-date =2008-02-26\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =  2006-12-17}}</ref>\n\n==Student organizations==\nYoung Republicans, Lindbergh Progressive Coalition, Gay-Straight Alliance, [[National Honors Society]], [[Tri-M]], Improv Troupe, Environmental Club, Mock Trial, [[DECA (Organization)|DECA]],  Thespian Society, Youth in Government, Key Club, RAD, Strolling Strings, The Spirit of Saint Louis Marching Band, yearbook, Robotics, [[Super Smash Bros]] club, a student council, and [[Science Olympiad]].\n\nThe Spirit of St. Louis Marching Band participated in the [[Rose Parade marching bands#2018 (129th)|Rose Parade]] in [[Pasadena, California]] for the third time on January 1, 2018.<ref>[https://www.tournamentofroses.com/sites/default/files/2018%20Spirit%20of%20St.%20Louis%20Marching%20Band.pdf Lindbergh Band Will Play Full Rose Parade Set for Visiting Tournament of Roses\u00ae President on Sept. 8]</ref>\n\n==Recognition and awards==\n\n*In 1996, Lindbergh's student newspaper, ''Pilot Newsmagazine'', was recognized by the [[National Scholastic Press Association]] with a Best of the Net award (now known as the [[National Pacemaker Awards#Online Pacemakers|Online Pacemaker]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=NSPA -

Construction began on the new high school in 1951, and classes began at the site in September of that year, even though the building was still under construction.\n\nThe school district decided that the name Grandview sounded too much like a rest home, so in April 1952, the school was renamed Lindbergh, after world-acclaimed pilot [[Charles Lindbergh]].  Its students became the Flyers and the school colors became green and gold.  The [[mascot]] later became Lindy, sporting a chicken or eagle-like costume.  In the fall of 2007, Lindy sported a new look: A black eagle, sporting a flight jacket, aviation cap and aviation goggles, as part of The Green Machine, a student spirit organization known for its rowdy antics.  In 1957 the district also adopted the name, becoming the [[Lindbergh School District]].  Several new school buildings were created over the following years, several of which later closed as a result of a declining student population.\n\nLindbergh High School became the largest high school in the state of [[Missouri]] during the 1970s, enrolling over 4,200 students.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Over the past three decades, the district's population waned (and aged, leading to childless senior citizens), causing the student body to drop significantly over the years. Lindbergh was the first school in Missouri to  offer the [[International Baccalaureate]] program.  In 1995 the school received $25 million for construction and improved facilities through the approval of [[bond measure]], Proposition R.  In 2000 and 2003 similar propositions were passed, giving the school additional revenues for improvements of [[infrastructure]] and [[building|facilities]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web\n  | last =Ashwell\n  | first =Wayne\n  | authorlink =\n  |author2=Vic Lenz\n   | title =Lindbergh High School History\n  | work =Lindbergh High School Website\n  | publisher =Lindbergh School District\n  | year =2004\n  | url =http://www.lindberghschools.ws/lhs/index.php\n  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080226093827/http://lindberghschools.ws/lhs/index.php\n  | url-status =dead\n  | archive-date =2008-02-26\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =  2006-12-17}}</ref>\n\n==Student organizations==\nYoung Republicans, Lindbergh Progressive Coalition, Gay-Straight Alliance, [[National Honors Society]], [[Tri-M]], Improv Troupe, Environmental Club, Mock Trial, [[DECA (Organization)|DECA]],  Thespian Society, Youth in Government, Key Club, RAD, Strolling Strings, The Spirit of Saint Louis Marching Band, yearbook, Robotics, [[Super Smash Bros]] club, a student council, and [[Science Olympiad]].\n\nThe Spirit of St. Louis Marching Band participated in the [[Rose Parade marching bands#2018 (129th)|Rose Parade]] in [[Pasadena, California]] for the third time on January 1, 2018.<ref>[https://www.tournamentofroses.com/sites/default/files/2018%20Spirit%20of%20St.%20Louis%20Marching%20Band.pdf Lindbergh Band Will Play Full Rose Parade Set for Visiting Tournament of Roses\u00ae President on Sept. 8]</ref>\n\n==Recognition and awards==\n\n*In 1996, Lindbergh's student newspaper, ''Pilot Newsmagazine'', was recognized by the [[National Scholastic Press Association]] with a Best of the Net award (now known as the [[National Pacemaker Awards#Online Pacemakers|Online Pacemaker]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=NSPA -

Both the KC-135 and the [[Boeing 707]] [[airliner]] were developed from the [[Boeing 367-80]] prototype. It is the predominant variant of the [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter|C-135 Stratolifter]] family of transport aircraft.  The KC-135 was the US Air Force's first jet-powered refueling tanker and replaced the [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter|KC-97 Stratofreighter]].  The KC-135 was initially tasked with refueling strategic bombers, but was used extensively in the [[Vietnam War]] and later conflicts such as [[Operation Desert Storm]] to extend the range and endurance of US tactical fighters and bombers.\n\nThe KC-135 entered service with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) in 1957; it is one of six military fixed-wing aircraft with over 50 years of continuous service<ref>The six military fixed-wing aircraft with over 50 years of continuous service are [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] bomber (1955); Boeing KC-135 \"Stratotanker\" mid-air refueller (1957); [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] cargo & troop transporter (1956); [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] naval & submarine surveillance (1962); [[Lockheed U-2]] \"Dragon Lady\" reconnaissance (1957); and [[Northrop T-38 Talon]] jet trainer (1961).  There is also one helicopter: [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] (1962).</ref> with its original operator.  The KC-135 is supplemented by the larger [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10]].  Studies have concluded that many of the aircraft could be flown until 2030, although maintenance costs have greatly increased. The KC-135 is to be partially replaced by the [[Boeing KC-46 Pegasus]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Boeing B-52D-70-BO (SN 56-0582) is refueled by Boeing KC-135A-BN (SN 55-3127) 061127-F-1234S-009.jpg|thumb|A [[Cold War]]-era image of B-52D refueling from a KC-135A]]\n\n===Background===\nLike its sibling, the commercial [[Boeing 707]] [[jet airliner]], the KC-135 was derived from the [[Boeing 367-80]] jet transport \"proof of concept\" demonstrator, which was commonly called the \"Dash-80\".  The KC-135 is similar in appearance to the 707, but has a narrower [[fuselage]] and is shorter than the 707.  The KC-135 predates the 707, and is structurally quite different from the civilian airliner.  Boeing gave the future KC-135 tanker the initial designation Model 717.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lombardi |first=Michael |date=July 2006 |title=Historical Perspective, Start of a PROUD MISSION |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/july/i_history.pdf |journal=Boeing Frontiers |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=21 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140612010633/http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/july/i_history.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1954 [[United States Air Force|USAF]]'s [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) held a competition for a jet-powered aerial refueling tanker.

Lockheed never produced its jet airliner, while Boeing would eventually dominate the market with a family of airliners based on the 707.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hopkins, III |first= Robert S. |title= Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker: More Than Just a Tanker |year= 1997 |publisher= Midland Publishing Limited |location= Leicester, England |isbn= 1-85780-069-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=May |first=Mike |date=Spring 2004 |title=Gas Stations in the Sky |url=http://www.secretprojects.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,1348.0/ |url-status=dead |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention & Technology|Invention & Technology]] |publisher=American Heritage Society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427135402/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/4/2004_4_10.shtml |archivedate=27 April 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the Air Force placed an initial order for 29 KC-135As, the first of an eventual 820 of all variants of the basic C-135 family.  The first aircraft flew in August 1956 and the initial production Stratotanker was delivered to [[Castle Air Force Base]], [[California]], in June 1957.  The last KC-135 was delivered to the Air Force in 1965.\n\n[[File:KC-135Boom-operator-521.jpg|thumb|left|USAF KC-135R [[Boom operator (military)|boom operator]] view from boom pod]]\nDeveloped in the early 1950s, the basic airframe is characterized by 35-degree aft swept wings and [[Empennage|tail]], four underwing-mounted engine pods, a [[horizontal stabilizer]] mounted on the fuselage near the bottom of the [[vertical stabilizer]] with positive [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] on the two horizontal planes and a hi-frequency radio antenna which protrudes forward from the top of the vertical fin or stabilizer. These basic features make it strongly resemble the commercial Boeing 707 and 720 aircraft, although it is actually a different aircraft.\n\n[[Reconnaissance]] and command post variants of the aircraft, including the [[RC-135 Rivet Joint]] and [[Boeing EC-135|EC-135]] [[Operation Looking Glass|Looking Glass]] aircraft were operated by SAC from 1963 through 1992, when they were reassigned to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC).  The USAF EC-135 Looking Glass was subsequently replaced in its role by the [[U.S. Navy]] [[E-6 Mercury]] aircraft, a new build airframe based on the Boeing 707-320B.\n\n=== Engine retrofits ===\nAll KC-135s were originally equipped with [[Pratt & Whitney J57|Pratt & Whitney J57-P-59W]] [[turbojet]] engines, which produced {{convert|10000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of thrust dry, and approximately {{convert|13000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of thrust wet. Wet thrust is achieved through the use of [[Water injection (engine)|water injection]] on takeoff, as opposed to \"wet thrust\" when used to describe an [[Afterburner|afterburning engine]]. {{convert|670|USgal|L}} of water are injected into the engines over the course of three minutes. The water is injected into the inlet and the diffuser case in front of the combustion case.  The water cools the air in the engine to increase its density; it also reduces the turbine gas temperature, which is a primary limitation on many jet engines.  This allows the use of more fuel for proper combustion and creates more thrust for short periods of time, similar in concept to \"[[War emergency power|War Emergency Power]]\" in a [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engined]] aircraft.\n\n[[File:KC-135R-Taxi.JPG|left|thumb|A nose-on view of several reworked KC-135R aircraft [[Elephant walk (aeronautics)|taxiing prior to takeoff]]. The new engines are CFM56-2 high-bypass turbofans.|alt=The front of several gray aircraft are centered in the image.]]\nIn the 1980s the first modification program retrofitted 157 [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]] (AFRES) and [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) tankers with the [[Pratt & Whitney JT3D|Pratt & Whitney TF33-PW-102]] [[turbofan]] engines from 707 airliners retired in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  The modified tanker, designated the KC-135E, was 14% more fuel-efficient than the KC-135A and could offload 20% more fuel on long-duration flights. (The difference is that the A-model's empty weight is {{convert|104000|lb|abbr=on}}, while the E-model has an empty weight of {{convert|115000|lb|abbr=on}}; both have the same maximum takeoff weight.  Therefore, the A-model could take off with a maximum fuel load of {{convert|200000|lb|abbr=on}}, while the E-model could take off with a fuel load of only up to {{convert|190000|lb|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}) Only the KC-135E aircraft were equipped with [[Thrust reversal|thrust-reversers]] for aborted takeoffs and shorter landing roll-outs. The KC-135E fleet has since either been retrofitted as the R-model configuration or placed into long-term storage (\"XJ\"), as Congress has prevented the Air Force from formally retiring them. The final KC-135E, tail number ''56-3630'', was delivered by the [[101st Air Refueling Wing]] of the [[Maine Air National Guard]] to the [[309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group]] (AMARG) at [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]] in September 2009.<ref name=\"KC-135E\">{{cite news |last=Beckham |first=SSgt Tim |date=25 September 2009 |title=Final KC-135E retires at Davis-Monthan |url=http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/119036/final-kc-135e-retires-at-davis-monthan.aspx |accessdate=21 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102152721/http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/119036/final-kc-135e-retires-at-davis-monthan.aspx |archivedate=2 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:KC-135-Stratotanker-Cockpit.jpg|thumb|Flight deck of KC-135R; instrument panel has been modified under the Pacer-CRAG program]]\nThe second modification program retrofitted 500 aircraft with new [[CFM International CFM56]] (military designation: F108) high-bypass turbofan engines produced by [[General Electric]] and [[Snecma]].

The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Richard |title=SR-71 Revealed: The Untold Story |date=1996 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sr71revealedinsi00colr/page/38 38\u201339] |isbn=0760301220 |url=https://archive.org/details/sr71revealedinsi00colr/page/38 }}</ref> When the KC-135Q model received the CFM56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main body tanks from the wing tanks where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T is the presence of a clear window on the underside of the empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted.  It also has two ground refueling ports, located in each rear wheel well so ground crews can fuel both the body tanks and wing tanks separately.\n\n[[File:FRL-Mk.32B-Pod-S.jpg|thumb|Cutaway of the Flight Refueling Limited Mk.32B Refueling Pod.]]\nEight KC-135R aircraft are [[Aerial refueling#Multiple systems|receiver-capable]] tankers, commonly referred to as KC-135R(RT).  All eight aircraft were with the [[22d Air Refueling Wing]] at [[McConnell AFB]], Kansas, in 1994.<ref>Hopkins, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> They are primarily used for force extension and Special Operations missions, and are crewed by highly qualified receiver capable crews.  If not used for the receiver mission, these aircraft can be flown just like any other KC-135R.\n\nThe Multi-point Refueling Systems (MPRS) modification adds refueling pods to the KC-135's wings.  The pods allow refueling of U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and most NATO tactical jet aircraft while keeping the tail-mounted refueling boom. The pods themselves are Flight Refueling Limited (FRL) MK.32B model pods, and refuel via the probe and drogue method common to USN/USMC tactical jets, rather than the primary \"[[Aerial refueling|flying boom]]\" method used by USAF fixed-wing aircraft. This allows the tanker to refuel two receivers at the same time, which increases throughput compared to the boom drogue adapter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/kc-135r-mprsp.htm |title=KC-135R Stratotanker |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=globalsecurity.org |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=21 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008082914/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/kc-135r-mprsp.htm |archivedate=8 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nA number of KC-135A and KC-135B aircraft have been modified to [[Boeing EC-135|EC-135]], [[RC-135]] and [[OC-135]] configurations for use in several different roles (although these could also be considered variants of the [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter|C-135 Stratolifter]] family).\n\n==Design==\nThe KC-135R has four [[turbofan]] engines, mounted under 35-degree swept wings,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/707family/index.html |title=Boeing: Commercial Airplanes - 707 - 707 Family Home |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=boeing.com |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=21 October 2014 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226052709/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/707family/index.html |archivedate=26 February 2013 }}</ref> which power it to takeoffs at gross weights up to {{convert|322500|lb|kg}}.  Nearly all internal fuel can be pumped through the tanker's [[flying boom]], the KC-135's primary fuel transfer method.  A special shuttlecock-shaped drogue, attached to and trailing behind the flying boom, may be used to refuel aircraft fitted with probes.  This apparatus is significantly more unforgiving of pilot error in the receiving aircraft than conventional trailing hose arrangements; an aircraft so fitted is also incapable of refueling by the normal flying boom method until the attachment is removed.  A [[boom operator (military)|boom operator]] stationed in the rear of the aircraft controls the boom while lying prone.  A cargo deck above the refueling system can hold a mixed load of passengers and cargo.  Depending on fuel storage configuration, the KC-135 can carry up to {{convert|83000|lb|kg}} of cargo.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Introduction into service===\n[[File:KC-135 refueling.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An F-15 backs out after refueling from a KC-135R.]]\n\nThe KC-135 was initially purchased to support bombers of the [[Strategic Air Command]], but by the late 1960s, in the [[Vietnam War|Southeast Asia]] theater, the KC-135 Stratotanker's ability as a force multiplier came to the fore. Midair refueling of [[F-105]] and [[F-4]] fighter-bombers as well as B-52 bombers brought far-flung bombing targets within reach, and allowed fighter missions to spend hours at the front, rather than a few minutes, which was usual due to their limited fuel reserves and high fuel consumption. KC-135 crews refueled both [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] / [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] aircraft; though they would have to change to [[probe and drogue]] adapters depending upon the mission, the Navy and Marine Corps not having fitted their aircraft with flying boom receptacles since the USAF boom system was impractical for aircraft carrier operations. Crews also helped to bring in damaged aircraft which could sometimes fly while being fed by fuel to a landing site or to ditch over the water (specifically those with punctured fuel tanks).  KC-135s continued their tactical support role in later conflicts such as [[Operation Desert Storm]] and current aerial strategy.\n\nThe [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) had the KC-135 Stratotanker in service with Regular Air Force SAC units from 1957 through 1992 and with SAC-gained [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) and [[Air Force Reserve]] (AFRES) units from 1975 through 1992.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite report |author=HQ USSTRATCOM/CSH |date=January 2004 |title=HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES STRATEGIC COMMAND, June 1, 1992 \u2014 October 1, 2002 |url=http://www.stratcom.mil/files/History.pdf |publisher=United States Strategic Command |page=21 |accessdate=23 October 2014 |quote=[...] a similar ceremony [at Scott AFB] marked the inactivation of MAC and the activation of the new Air Mobility Command, which now assumed responsibility for SAC's KC-135 and KC-10 air refueling aircraft. |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306200214/https://www.stratcom.mil/files/History.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2016 }}</ref> Following a major USAF reorganization that resulted in the inactivation of SAC in 1992, most KC-135s were reassigned to the newly created [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC).<ref name=\"auto\"/> While AMC gained the preponderance of the aerial refueling mission, a small number of KC-135s were also assigned directly to [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] (USAFE), [[Pacific Air Forces]] (PACAF) and the [[Air Education and Training Command]] (AETC).

As the Tu-154 took off, its right wing struck the fairing of the KC-135R's No. 1 engine. The force of the impact nearly severed the No. 1 engine and destroyed a portion of the left wing. The resulting fire caused extensive damage to the KC-135. The Tu-154 lost about 6 feet of its right wingtip, but was able to get airborne and return to the airport for an emergency landing. The tanker crew had been directed to use a taxiway which was not usable for night operations and the controller failed to note that they reported \"holding short\" of that taxiway, rather than \"clear of\" that point.

Both the KC-135 and the [[Boeing 707]] [[airliner]] were developed from the [[Boeing 367-80]] prototype. It is the predominant variant of the [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter|C-135 Stratolifter]] family of transport aircraft.  The KC-135 was the US Air Force's first jet-powered refueling tanker and replaced the [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter|KC-97 Stratofreighter]].  The KC-135 was initially tasked with refueling strategic bombers, but was used extensively in the [[Vietnam War]] and later conflicts such as [[Operation Desert Storm]] to extend the range and endurance of US tactical fighters and bombers.\n\nThe KC-135 entered service with the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) in 1957; it is one of six military fixed-wing aircraft with over 50 years of continuous service<ref>The six military fixed-wing aircraft with over 50 years of continuous service are [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] bomber (1955); Boeing KC-135 \"Stratotanker\" mid-air refueller (1957); [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] cargo & troop transporter (1956); [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] naval & submarine surveillance (1962); [[Lockheed U-2]] \"Dragon Lady\" reconnaissance (1957); and [[Northrop T-38 Talon]] jet trainer (1961).  There is also one helicopter: [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook]] (1962).</ref> with its original operator.  The KC-135 is supplemented by the larger [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10]].  Studies have concluded that many of the aircraft could be flown until 2030, although maintenance costs have greatly increased. The KC-135 is to be partially replaced by the [[Boeing KC-46 Pegasus]].\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Boeing B-52D-70-BO (SN 56-0582) is refueled by Boeing KC-135A-BN (SN 55-3127) 061127-F-1234S-009.jpg|thumb|A [[Cold War]]-era image of B-52D refueling from a KC-135A]]\n\n===Background===\nLike its sibling, the commercial [[Boeing 707]] [[jet airliner]], the KC-135 was derived from the [[Boeing 367-80]] jet transport \"proof of concept\" demonstrator, which was commonly called the \"Dash-80\".  The KC-135 is similar in appearance to the 707, but has a narrower [[fuselage]] and is shorter than the 707.  The KC-135 predates the 707, and is structurally quite different from the civilian airliner.  Boeing gave the future KC-135 tanker the initial designation Model 717.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lombardi |first=Michael |date=July 2006 |title=Historical Perspective, Start of a PROUD MISSION |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/july/i_history.pdf |journal=Boeing Frontiers |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=21 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140612010633/http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2006/july/i_history.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1954 [[United States Air Force|USAF]]'s [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) held a competition for a jet-powered aerial refueling tanker. Lockheed's tanker version of the proposed [[Lockheed L-193]] airliner with rear fuselage-mounted engines was declared the winner in 1955.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bright |first=Charles |date=January 1986 |title=The Jet Makers: The Aerospace Industry from 1945\u20131972 |url=https://archive.org/details/jetmakersaerospa0000brig |location=Lawrence, Kansas |publisher=[[University Press of Kansas]] |chapter=VII - The Heartbreak Market: Airliners |chapterurl=http://www.generalatomic.com/jetmakers/chapter7.html |isbn=978-0700601721 |accessdate=21 October 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Since Boeing's proposal was already flying, the KC-135 could be delivered two years earlier and Air Force Secretary [[Harold E. Talbott]] ordered 250 KC-135 tankers until Lockheed's design could be manufactured. In the end, orders for the Lockheed tanker were dropped rather than supporting two tanker designs. Lockheed never produced its jet airliner, while Boeing would eventually dominate the market with a family of airliners based on the 707.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hopkins, III |first= Robert S. |title= Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker: More Than Just a Tanker |year= 1997 |publisher= Midland Publishing Limited |location= Leicester, England |isbn= 1-85780-069-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=May |first=Mike |date=Spring 2004 |title=Gas Stations in the Sky |url=http://www.secretprojects.co.uk/forum/index.php/topic,1348.0/ |url-status=dead |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention & Technology|Invention & Technology]] |publisher=American Heritage Society |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427135402/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2004/4/2004_4_10.shtml |archivedate=27 April 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the Air Force placed an initial order for 29 KC-135As, the first of an eventual 820 of all variants of the basic C-135 family.  The first aircraft flew in August 1956 and the initial production Stratotanker was delivered to [[Castle Air Force Base]], [[California]], in June 1957.  The last KC-135 was delivered to the Air Force in 1965.\n\n[[File:KC-135Boom-operator-521.jpg|thumb|left|USAF KC-135R [[Boom operator (military)|boom operator]] view from boom pod]]\nDeveloped in the early 1950s, the basic airframe is characterized by 35-degree aft swept wings and [[Empennage|tail]], four underwing-mounted engine pods, a [[horizontal stabilizer]] mounted on the fuselage near the bottom of the [[vertical stabilizer]] with positive [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] on the two horizontal planes and a hi-frequency radio antenna which protrudes forward from the top of the vertical fin or stabilizer. These basic features make it strongly resemble the commercial Boeing 707 and 720 aircraft, although it is actually a different aircraft.\n\n[[Reconnaissance]] and command post variants of the aircraft, including the [[RC-135 Rivet Joint]] and [[Boeing EC-135|EC-135]] [[Operation Looking Glass|Looking Glass]] aircraft were operated by SAC from 1963 through 1992, when they were reassigned to the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC).  The USAF EC-135 Looking Glass was subsequently replaced in its role by the [[U.S. Navy]] [[E-6 Mercury]] aircraft, a new build airframe based on the Boeing 707-320B.\n\n=== Engine retrofits ===\nAll KC-135s were originally equipped with [[Pratt & Whitney J57|Pratt & Whitney J57-P-59W]] [[turbojet]] engines, which produced {{convert|10000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of thrust dry, and approximately {{convert|13000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of thrust wet. Wet thrust is achieved through the use of [[Water injection (engine)|water injection]] on takeoff, as opposed to \"wet thrust\" when used to describe an [[Afterburner|afterburning engine]]. {{convert|670|USgal|L}} of water are injected into the engines over the course of three minutes. The water is injected into the inlet and the diffuser case in front of the combustion case.  The water cools the air in the engine to increase its density; it also reduces the turbine gas temperature, which is a primary limitation on many jet engines.  This allows the use of more fuel for proper combustion and creates more thrust for short periods of time, similar in concept to \"[[War emergency power|War Emergency Power]]\" in a [[Reciprocating engine|piston-engined]] aircraft.\n\n[[File:KC-135R-Taxi.JPG|left|thumb|A nose-on view of several reworked KC-135R aircraft [[Elephant walk (aeronautics)|taxiing prior to takeoff]].

The modified tanker, designated the KC-135E, was 14% more fuel-efficient than the KC-135A and could offload 20% more fuel on long-duration flights. (The difference is that the A-model's empty weight is {{convert|104000|lb|abbr=on}}, while the E-model has an empty weight of {{convert|115000|lb|abbr=on}}; both have the same maximum takeoff weight.

The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Richard |title=SR-71 Revealed: The Untold Story |date=1996 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sr71revealedinsi00colr/page/38 38\u201339] |isbn=0760301220 |url=https://archive.org/details/sr71revealedinsi00colr/page/38 }}</ref> When the KC-135Q model received the CFM56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main body tanks from the wing tanks where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T is the presence of a clear window on the underside of the empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted.  It also has two ground refueling ports, located in each rear wheel well so ground crews can fuel both the body tanks and wing tanks separately.\n\n[[File:FRL-Mk.32B-Pod-S.jpg|thumb|Cutaway of the Flight Refueling Limited Mk.32B Refueling Pod.]]\nEight KC-135R aircraft are [[Aerial refueling#Multiple systems|receiver-capable]] tankers, commonly referred to as KC-135R(RT).  All eight aircraft were with the [[22d Air Refueling Wing]] at [[McConnell AFB]], Kansas, in 1994.<ref>Hopkins, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> They are primarily used for force extension and Special Operations missions, and are crewed by highly qualified receiver capable crews.  If not used for the receiver mission, these aircraft can be flown just like any other KC-135R.\n\nThe Multi-point Refueling Systems (MPRS) modification adds refueling pods to the KC-135's wings.  The pods allow refueling of U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and most NATO tactical jet aircraft while keeping the tail-mounted refueling boom. The pods themselves are Flight Refueling Limited (FRL) MK.32B model pods, and refuel via the probe and drogue method common to USN/USMC tactical jets, rather than the primary \"[[Aerial refueling|flying boom]]\" method used by USAF fixed-wing aircraft. This allows the tanker to refuel two receivers at the same time, which increases throughput compared to the boom drogue adapter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/kc-135r-mprsp.htm |title=KC-135R Stratotanker |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=globalsecurity.org |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=21 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008082914/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/kc-135r-mprsp.htm |archivedate=8 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nA number of KC-135A and KC-135B aircraft have been modified to [[Boeing EC-135|EC-135]], [[RC-135]] and [[OC-135]] configurations for use in several different roles (although these could also be considered variants of the [[Boeing C-135 Stratolifter|C-135 Stratolifter]] family).\n\n==Design==\nThe KC-135R has four [[turbofan]] engines, mounted under 35-degree swept wings,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/707family/index.html |title=Boeing: Commercial Airplanes - 707 - 707 Family Home |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=boeing.com |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=21 October 2014 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226052709/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/707family/index.html |archivedate=26 February 2013 }}</ref> which power it to takeoffs at gross weights up to {{convert|322500|lb|kg}}.  Nearly all internal fuel can be pumped through the tanker's [[flying boom]], the KC-135's primary fuel transfer method.  A special shuttlecock-shaped drogue, attached to and trailing behind the flying boom, may be used to refuel aircraft fitted with probes.  This apparatus is significantly more unforgiving of pilot error in the receiving aircraft than conventional trailing hose arrangements; an aircraft so fitted is also incapable of refueling by the normal flying boom method until the attachment is removed.  A [[boom operator (military)|boom operator]] stationed in the rear of the aircraft controls the boom while lying prone.  A cargo deck above the refueling system can hold a mixed load of passengers and cargo.  Depending on fuel storage configuration, the KC-135 can carry up to {{convert|83000|lb|kg}} of cargo.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Introduction into service===\n[[File:KC-135 refueling.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An F-15 backs out after refueling from a KC-135R.]]\n\nThe KC-135 was initially purchased to support bombers of the [[Strategic Air Command]], but by the late 1960s, in the [[Vietnam War|Southeast Asia]] theater, the KC-135 Stratotanker's ability as a force multiplier came to the fore. Midair refueling of [[F-105]] and [[F-4]] fighter-bombers as well as B-52 bombers brought far-flung bombing targets within reach, and allowed fighter missions to spend hours at the front, rather than a few minutes, which was usual due to their limited fuel reserves and high fuel consumption. KC-135 crews refueled both [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] / [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] aircraft; though they would have to change to [[probe and drogue]] adapters depending upon the mission, the Navy and Marine Corps not having fitted their aircraft with flying boom receptacles since the USAF boom system was impractical for aircraft carrier operations. Crews also helped to bring in damaged aircraft which could sometimes fly while being fed by fuel to a landing site or to ditch over the water (specifically those with punctured fuel tanks).  KC-135s continued their tactical support role in later conflicts such as [[Operation Desert Storm]] and current aerial strategy.\n\nThe [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) had the KC-135 Stratotanker in service with Regular Air Force SAC units from 1957 through 1992 and with SAC-gained [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) and [[Air Force Reserve]] (AFRES) units from 1975 through 1992.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite report |author=HQ USSTRATCOM/CSH |date=January 2004 |title=HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES STRATEGIC COMMAND, June 1, 1992 \u2014 October 1, 2002 |url=http://www.stratcom.mil/files/History.pdf |publisher=United States Strategic Command |page=21 |accessdate=23 October 2014 |quote=[...] a similar ceremony [at Scott AFB] marked the inactivation of MAC and the activation of the new Air Mobility Command, which now assumed responsibility for SAC's KC-135 and KC-10 air refueling aircraft. |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306200214/https://www.stratcom.mil/files/History.pdf |archivedate=6 March 2016 }}</ref> Following a major USAF reorganization that resulted in the inactivation of SAC in 1992, most KC-135s were reassigned to the newly created [[Air Mobility Command]] (AMC).<ref name=\"auto\"/> While AMC gained the preponderance of the aerial refueling mission, a small number of KC-135s were also assigned directly to [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] (USAFE), [[Pacific Air Forces]] (PACAF) and the [[Air Education and Training Command]] (AETC).

The KC-135 fleet is currently flying double its planned yearly flying hour program to meet airborne refueling requirements, and has resulted in higher than forecast usage and sustainment costs.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Opening Statement of Chairman Roscoe Bartlett, ''Hearing on the Aerial Refueling Recapitalization Program'' |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/congress/2006_hr/060228-bartlett.pdf |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=globalsecurity.org |date=28 February 2006 |accessdate=23 October 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082343/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/congress/2006_hr/060228-bartlett.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}</ref> In March 2009, the Air Force indicated that KC-135s would require additional skin replacement to allow their continued use beyond 2018.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=9 March 2000 |title=Thin Skin |url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/kc-135-looking-costly-re-skinning |journal=[[Aviation Week & Space Technology]] |publisher=Penton Media |volume=70 |issue=10 |pages=18 |accessdate=23 October 2014 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141025065928/http://aviationweek.com/awin/kc-135-looking-costly-re-skinning |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kc135-f35-marchafb.jpg|thumb|View from the boom operator's hatch as a [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] takes on fuel from a KC-135 of the 912d ARS]]\nThe USAF decided to replace the KC-135 fleet.  However, the KC-135 fleet is large and will need to be replaced gradually.  Initially the first batch of replacement planes was to be an air tanker version of the [[Boeing 767]], leased from [[Boeing]].  In 2003, this was changed to contract where the Air Force would purchase 80 KC-767 aircraft and lease 20 more.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tirpak |first=John A. |date=February 2004 |title=Tanker Twilight Zone |url=http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2004/February%202004/0204tanker.aspx |url-status=dead |journal=Air Force Magazine |location=Arlington, Virginia |publisher=[[Air Force Association]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040206211941/http://www.afa.org/magazine/Feb2004/0204tanker.asp |archivedate=6 February 2004 |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> In December 2003, the Pentagon froze the contract and in January 2006, the [[Boeing KC-767|KC-767]] contract was canceled.  This followed public revelations of corruption in how the contract was awarded, as well as controversy regarding the original leasing rather than outright purchase agreement.  Then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld stated that this move will in no way impair the Air Force's ability to deliver the mission of the KC-767, which will be accomplished by continuing upgrades to the KC-135 and [[KC-10 Extender]] fleet.\n\nIn January 2007, the U.S. Air Force formally launched the [[KC-X]] program with a [[request for proposal]] (RFP).

As the Tu-154 took off, its right wing struck the fairing of the KC-135R's No. 1 engine. The force of the impact nearly severed the No. 1 engine and destroyed a portion of the left wing.

The tanker crew had been directed to use a taxiway which was not usable for night operations and the controller failed to note that they reported \"holding short\" of that taxiway, rather than \"clear of\" that point.

Everyone individually earned ''Running Balls'' throughout the missions and the balls selected during the lottery machine segment represented the individuals who were the winners for the night. The format of missions was also changed:\n* Mission 1 was ''Challenge 1 vs. X''.\n* Mission 2 was ''Find the Thief''. From episode 15 this was changed to different games related to the landmark.\n* Mission 3 was the race mission, ''Bells Hide and Seek''.\nAs of the eighteenth episode, only those who had earned no ''Running Balls'' at all throughout the night were the ones to be punished.\n|-\n| 26\u201343\n| January 16, 2011{{snd}}May 15, 2011\n| Beginning with the twenty-sixth episode, the race mission, ''Bells Hide and Seek'', was replaced with a ''Find the Guests'' mission. The MCs and guests were locked inside a landmark and were required to earn ''Running Balls'' for a chance to escape punishment. Through a series of missions, the ''Running Man'' members were divided into teams and/or individually earned ''Running Balls''. The format for the missions in episodes 26 to 43 were:\n* Mission 1 was the race mission, ''Find the Guests''. From episodes 39 to 41, it was ''Catch the Running Man''.\n* Mission 2 featured games related to the landmark.\n* Mission 3 was the ''One Chance'' challenge, which was played in episodes 27 to 31.\nIf there were many members with no ''Running Balls'', they were automatically punished and no lottery was conducted. Additionally, if the members succeeded in the ''One Chance'' mission, they were all relieved of the punishment regardless of how many ''Running Balls'' each of them possessed. As of episode 38 and onwards, there were some episodes which included spy/spies. These spies could either be part of the cast, guest, or both.\n|-\n| 44\u201347\n| May 22, 2011{{snd}}June 12, 2011\n| From episodes 44 to 47, staff (of the landmark location involved in the game) voted for who they believed would be the overall winner of the games and became supporters of that member/team. Teams were decided by the winner of the ''race mission'', who received the first ''Running Ball'', and the two teams then competed for more ''Running Balls'' throughout missions spread over two days (two episodes). The format for the missions was as follows:\n* Mission 1 was the ''race mission'', ''Find the Guests''.\n* Mission 2 featured missions related to the staff of the landmark.\n* Mission 3 was a second ''race mission''.\n* Mission 4 featured missions related to the landmark.\nThe team with the most ''Running Balls'' was declared the winner and their supporters received a bonus from their boss.\n|-\n| 119, 131, 144\n| November 11, 2012; February 3, 2013; May 5, 2013\n| In these episodes, the members would arrive at the starting venue separately. An announcer would announce that \"The XX Running Man is entering the arena\". This announcement would include the guests for the day. After all the guest were introduced, the announcer would immediately announce their first mission. The race would officially begin after the first mission ends. The winner of the first mission would be given an advantage to his/her team in the race. The format for the missions are as follows:\n* Mission 1 was the ''opening mission'': ''Name Tag Elimination''\n* Mission 2 onwards would follow the usual format of the show: one long race with continuous missions during the race.\n|}\n\n== Personnel ==\n{{Main|List of Running Man cast members}}\n\n=== Production staff ===\nThe staff run the games, often showing up on camera either by actively participating in the game or influencing the outcome of various missions.\n\nThis includes the personal cameramen (VJs), production directors (PDs), floor directors (FDs), stylists, boom operators, etc.\n\nChief producer, Nam Seung-yong, is responsible for the production of the program, with PD Jo Hyo-jin, Im Hyung-taek, and Kim Joo-hyung<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/List/Enter/3/09/20131028/58503932/1|script-title=ko:\uc774\uad11\uc218 \uc608\ub2a5-\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8-\uad11\uace0 3\ubc15\uc790 \ub2e4 \ud1b5\ud588\ub2e4|publisher=Donga|date=2013-10-28|accessdate=2014-01-28|language=Korean|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202120558/http://news.donga.com/List/Enter/3/09/20131028/58503932/1|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}</ref> mainly responsible for the directing and production of the recordings of the program since inception.

In the rather fast-paced urban societies in Asia, the show helps to provide release from the daily tensions that such streets and buildings are associated with.\"<ref name=\"stratitstimes\" /> Liew thinks that the cast members are not particularly good looking, thus have nothing to lose, even if they \"wrestle with one another like children\".<ref name=\"stratitstimes\" />\n\nAccording to producer Jo Hyo-jin, the show is popular because the concept of having to choose a winner is culturally easy to understand.

For example, after the airing of the [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]] episodes, some viewers complained that the band won too easily. Jo Hyo-jin, however, denied any special treatment of the celebrities. Jo explained that fans are also highly critical of the games, therefore it is not possible for the crew to reuse games without changing them.<ref name=\"straits2\" />\n\nThe regular members of ''Running Man'' have held several fan meetings throughout Asia.

Additionally, if the members succeeded in the ''One Chance'' mission, they were all relieved of the punishment regardless of how many ''Running Balls'' each of them possessed.

The format for the missions was as follows:\n* Mission 1 was the ''race mission'', ''Find the Guests''.\n* Mission 2 featured missions related to the staff of the landmark.\n* Mission 3 was a second ''race mission''.\n* Mission 4 featured missions related to the landmark.\nThe team with the most ''Running Balls'' was declared the winner and their supporters received a bonus from their boss.\n|-\n| 119, 131, 144\n| November 11, 2012; February 3, 2013; May 5, 2013\n| In these episodes, the members would arrive at the starting venue separately. An announcer would announce that \"The XX Running Man is entering the arena\". This announcement would include the guests for the day. After all the guest were introduced, the announcer would immediately announce their first mission. The race would officially begin after the first mission ends. The winner of the first mission would be given an advantage to his/her team in the race. The format for the missions are as follows:\n* Mission 1 was the ''opening mission'': ''Name Tag Elimination''\n* Mission 2 onwards would follow the usual format of the show: one long race with continuous missions during the race.\n|}\n\n== Personnel ==\n{{Main|List of Running Man cast members}}\n\n=== Production staff ===\nThe staff run the games, often showing up on camera either by actively participating in the game or influencing the outcome of various missions.\n\nThis includes the personal cameramen (VJs), production directors (PDs), floor directors (FDs), stylists, boom operators, etc.\n\nChief producer, Nam Seung-yong, is responsible for the production of the program, with PD Jo Hyo-jin, Im Hyung-taek, and Kim Joo-hyung<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/List/Enter/3/09/20131028/58503932/1|script-title=ko:\uc774\uad11\uc218 \uc608\ub2a5-\ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8-\uad11\uace0 3\ubc15\uc790 \ub2e4 \ud1b5\ud588\ub2e4|publisher=Donga|date=2013-10-28|accessdate=2014-01-28|language=Korean|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202120558/http://news.donga.com/List/Enter/3/09/20131028/58503932/1|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}</ref> mainly responsible for the directing and production of the recordings of the program since inception.

In the rather fast-paced urban societies in Asia, the show helps to provide release from the daily tensions that such streets and buildings are associated with.\"<ref name=\"stratitstimes\" /> Liew thinks that the cast members are not particularly good looking, thus have nothing to lose, even if they \"wrestle with one another like children\".<ref name=\"stratitstimes\" />\n\nAccording to producer Jo Hyo-jin, the show is popular because the concept of having to choose a winner is culturally easy to understand.

For example, after the airing of the [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]] episodes, some viewers complained that the band won too easily. Jo Hyo-jin, however, denied any special treatment of the celebrities. Jo explained that fans are also highly critical of the games, therefore it is not possible for the crew to reuse games without changing them.<ref name=\"straits2\" />\n\nThe regular members of ''Running Man'' have held several fan meetings throughout Asia.

Their first charter was granted under the name Louisville Area Council in 1912. The council was then renamed to the Old Kentucky Home Council. In 1992, the George Rogers Clark Council merged with the Old Kentucky Home Council, forming the Lincoln Heritage Council. In 2012, the territory of the Shawnee Trails Council was transferred to the Lincoln Heritage Council.\n\nShawnee Trails Council was formed from the merger of the Four Rivers Council and the Audubon Council. The Four Rivers Council originally served youth within the area bounded by the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers, the Tennessee state line except for South Fulton, TN and the river counties in Southern Illinois. Audubon originally served youth within a jagged border formed by the Ohio, Rough, Tennessee, and Barren Rivers. In 1951, the Cogioba Council, headquartered in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] merged with the West Kentucky Area Council to form the Audubon Council serving a good third of Kentucky. In the early 90s, Audubon merged with the [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] based Four Rivers Council, adding the additional counties on the other side of the Tennessee River as well as counties in southern Illinois and northwestern Tennessee with the exception of the Fort Campbell military reservation in southern Trigg and Christian counties, which remained a part of the Middle Tennessee Council.\n\nThe Mammoth Cave District is the home of Camp Rotary at Temple Hill, run by the Rotary Scout Foundation. The camp was the former home camp belonging to the long-merged Cogioba Council. Rotary Scout Reservation provided the setting for the B-P Rover Crew's semi-annual Rover Scout Wee Moot, the longest-running Rover Scout Moot in the United States, which took place from 1953\u20131993, with a reunion held in 1999.\n\n==Camps==\n\n===Harry S. Frazier Jr. Scout Reservation===\nThe Harry S. Frazier Jr. Scout Reservation is located in [[Clermont, Kentucky]]. It was originally created as the Old Kentucky Home Scout Reservation. Its primary draw is its week-long summer camp, Camp Crooked Creek, which offers advancement opportunities to both Boy Scouts and Varsity Scouts. It offers the following program areas in which Scouts can advance: Shooting Sports, Ecology, Citizenships, Handicraft, Aquatics and Outdoor Skills. The camp features a first year camper program known as Dan Boone Hill as well as two elements for older Scouts: a [[Project COPE]] course and a climbing tower. Camp Crooked Creek is also home to the Green River Trek and Frontier Town, which gives older Scouts the ability to learn new skills.\n\n===Tunnel Mill Scout Reservation===\nTunnel Mill Scout Reservation is located in [[Charlestown, Indiana]]. It includes the [[John Work House and Mill Site]], a Registered Historic Place. Tunnel Mill held Boy Scouts summer camps as early as 1917 and yearly under the direction of the George Rogers Clark Council (after it was formed) from 1928 - 1992.  After merging into the Lincoln Heritage Council in 1993, it has been used regularly for Cub Scout Day camps, Webelos camps,  and various camporees and Order of the Arrow activities, while still being utilized for various unit activities when camp schedules permit.<ref>[http://www.tunnelmill.org Tunnel Mill Historical Society]</ref>\n\n===Pfeffer Scout Reservation===\nPfeffer Scout Reservation is located on the shores of [[Kentucky Lake]] near [[Aurora, Kentucky|Aurora]]. It hosts '''Camp Roy C. Manchester'''  (RCM; formerly the Four Rivers Scout Camp or Reservation),  having changed its name in 1979 to honor [[Roy C. Manchester]]. From 1973-1983, Camp RCM took advantage of the BSA's attempt to create regional Outdoor Adventure (\"High Adventure\") bases around the nation. A \"first year camper\" program offered at the camp was featured in the March/April 1981 issue of Scouting magazine, which resulted in similar programs being offered in all BSA camps nationally. The Land Between the Lakes National Outdoor Adventure Center was a cooperative effort between the BSA and the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA). The BSA officially abandoned the National base but permitted the Four Rivers Council to continue to offer high adventure-related facilities for sailing, canoeing, kayaking and U.S. Coast Guard approved Sailing training. \n\nRCM has been used for summer camp since August 1956. Prior to 1957, summer camp was at Camp Pakentuck (named as a contraction of Paducah, Kentucky) in Southern Illinois. Summer Camp was held in both locations in 1956, first at Camp Pakentuck and then three weeks of rough \"outpost\" camping in early August at Kentucky Lake. Camp Pakentuck was owned by the Four Rivers Council but was also used by the Egyptian Council of Southern Illinois, and was sold to the Catholic Diocese of Belleville where it became part of the larger [[Camp Ondessonk]]. RCM was originally named the Kentucky Lake Scout Reservation, which was later changed to the Four Rivers Scout Camp (frequently called the Four Rivers Scout Reservation in earlier years), with a final change to its current name in 1979. Camp Roy C. Manchester was also the home camp of the former White Feather Lodge, Order of the Arrow and currently serves as the home camp for the White Horse Lodge, Order of the Arrow.\n\nWhile participating at summer camp, Scouts take part in traditional flag raising and lowering ceremonies. Summer camp at Camp Roy C. Manchester offers Scouts a chance to learn Scout Skills in a safe, outdoor environment. The camp has sixteen campsites located on over four hundred acres of land and six miles of shoreline. Program focus includes, the First Year Camper (Eaglebound) program and a variety of [[List of water sports|aquatics activities]]\u2014including [[sailing]], [[water skiing]], motor boating, swimming, canoeing, rowing, and fishing. Older Scouts have the opportunity to sail on Kentucky Lake, the largest artificial lake by surface area east of the Mississippi River. Current programs for older scouts include High-Adventure Sailing and Operation Iron Eagle, a week-long back country camping experience.\n\n===Camp Wildcat Hollow===\nCamp Wildcat Hollow is a {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} camp located in [[Russellville, Kentucky]]. Camp Wildcat Hollow served as the Shawnee Trails Council summer camp until the program was moved to Camp Roy C. Manchester in 1995. Camp Wildcat Hollow is now used as a training facility and for Cub Scout day camps. Camp Wildcat Hollow was also the home camp of the former Wapiti Lodge.\n\n==Order of the Arrow==\n===Nguttitehen Lodge #205===\nThe council currently is served by the Nguttitehen Lodge #205.  The lodge was formed in the merger between White Horse Lodge #201 and Talligewi Lodge #62 in 2012.  The lodge totem is a fire, representing the fire of cheerfulness.  The lodge name is Lenni-Lennape meaning \"to be of one heart and one mind:\".<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/talligewi62 Talligewi Lodge Facebook Merger Announcement July 3, 2012]</ref>\n\n====Talligewi Lodge #62====\nTalligewi Lodge #62 was first chartered on January 1, 1995. The creation of the Lodge came as a result of the merger between Tseyedin Lodge #65 of the George Rogers Clark Area Council and Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123 of the Old Kentucky Home Council.<ref>[http://www.talligewi62.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46&Itemid=63 Our Lodge History]</ref>\n\nA merger committee of four advisers and six youth from each lodge and the OA Staff Advisor met several times in the late Spring and Summer of 1994 to work out details of the merger.  Both lodges interacted somewhat at the [[National Order of the Arrow Conference]] held at [[Purdue University]] and came together that fall for a joint Fall Fellowship weekend at Tunnel Mill Scout Reservation.\n\nThe totem for Talligewi Lodge #62 was a Mandan Indian.<ref>[http://www.talligewi62.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=73&Itemid=109 Official Lodge Patch List from Talligewi Lodge #62]</ref> The Talligewi were an ancient tribe that was thought to have been wiped out at the Battle of Sand Island at the Falls of the Ohio River between Clarksville, IN and Louisville, KY.  A brief history of the Talligewi Indian tribe can be seen here.<ref>[http://www.talligewi62.org/who.php Brief History of the Talligewi indians]</ref>\n\n=====Tseyedin Lodge #65=====\nTseyedin Lodge #65 <ref>[http://www.oaimages.com/65a.shtml Tseyedin Lodge Order of the Arrow Insignia]</ref> was chartered in 1932. The totem for Tseyedin Lodge #65 was the raccoon although it is thought that they were originally known as \u201cthe fox tribe\u201d since a fox appears on the very earliest lodge flap (F1) and arrowhead patches (A1, and A2).<ref>[http://www.oaimages.com/123.shtml Tseyedin Lodge Order of the Arrow Insignia]</ref>  But through slight changes in the lodge totem, it is evident that the raccoon was the lodge\u2019s totem for the remaining decades of the lodge\u2019s existence.\n\n=====Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123=====\nZit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123 <ref>[http://www.oaimages.com/123.shtml Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge Order of the Arrow Insignia]</ref> was chartered in 1938. The totem for Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123 was the cardinal since this bird is so prevalent throughout Kentucky and the lodge\u2019s name translates to \u201cRed Bird\u201d in the Sioux language.\n\n====White Horse Lodge #201====\nWhite Horse Lodge #201 was first chartered on January 1, 1996.  The creation of the Lodge came as a result of the merger between Wapiti Lodge #367 of the Audubon Council and White Feather Lodge #499 of the Four Rivers Council. White Horse Lodge was selected as the name of the replacement lodge as (i) the horse was important to the Native American, and (ii) white was arguably part of both predecessor lodges (as Wapiti meant American, or white, elk and the former White Feather Lodge).\n\n=====Wapiti Lodge #367=====\nWapiti Lodge was first chartered in 1949 and its totem was the American Elk.<ref>[http://www.oaimages.com/367.shtml Wapiti Lodge Order of the Arrow Insignia]</ref>   Wapiti means elk in the Shawnee language.\n\n======Land of the Big Caves and Walah Elemamekhaki Lodges #405======\nLand of the Big Caves Lodge #405 of the Mammoth Caves Council was first chartered in 1949 and changed its name to Walah Elemamekhaki Lodge #405 in 1950.  Its totem was a Kodiak Grizzly Bear.<ref>[http://www.oaimages.com/405.shtml Walah Elemamekhaki Lodge Order of the Arrow Insignia]</ref> The lodge was absorbed by Wapiti Lodge #367 in 1952.  \n\n=====White Feather Lodge #499=====\nA precursor to the lodge, called the White Feather Society, was founded at Camp Pakentuck (a combination name of Paducah and Kentucky) in southern Illinois in 1951. The Society was modeled after Blackhawk Lodge from Illinois, as the camp director at the time had been active in the Blackhawk Lodge. The Society issued a red ribbon with a white feather silk screened on it. A few neckerchiefs with the white feather silk screened on them are known to exist. The society was converted into an OA lodge in 1953 via a ceremonial team from Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123.  Don Thom performed the role of Allowat Sakima during the ceremony. In 1957, the lodge changed its home camp to [[Camp Roy C. Manchester]] on [[Kentucky Lake]].\n\nThomas Fielder, of [[Paducah, Kentucky]], was elected National Conference Chief in December 1968 at the Order of the Arrow national committee meeting<ref>{{cite web|title=Order of the Arrow - Ini-To Lodge 324, Flint River Council BSA|url=http://ini-to324.org/h-sixties.htm|publisher=Flint River Council, BSA|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=2 December 2015|quote=In December the Order of the Arrow National Committee met.

Their first charter was granted under the name Louisville Area Council in 1912. The council was then renamed to the Old Kentucky Home Council. In 1992, the George Rogers Clark Council merged with the Old Kentucky Home Council, forming the Lincoln Heritage Council. In 2012, the territory of the Shawnee Trails Council was transferred to the Lincoln Heritage Council.\n\nShawnee Trails Council was formed from the merger of the Four Rivers Council and the Audubon Council. The Four Rivers Council originally served youth within the area bounded by the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers, the Tennessee state line except for South Fulton, TN and the river counties in Southern Illinois. Audubon originally served youth within a jagged border formed by the Ohio, Rough, Tennessee, and Barren Rivers. In 1951, the Cogioba Council, headquartered in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] merged with the West Kentucky Area Council to form the Audubon Council serving a good third of Kentucky. In the early 90s, Audubon merged with the [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] based Four Rivers Council, adding the additional counties on the other side of the Tennessee River as well as counties in southern Illinois and northwestern Tennessee with the exception of the Fort Campbell military reservation in southern Trigg and Christian counties, which remained a part of the Middle Tennessee Council.\n\nThe Mammoth Cave District is the home of Camp Rotary at Temple Hill, run by the Rotary Scout Foundation. The camp was the former home camp belonging to the long-merged Cogioba Council. Rotary Scout Reservation provided the setting for the B-P Rover Crew's semi-annual Rover Scout Wee Moot, the longest-running Rover Scout Moot in the United States, which took place from 1953\u20131993, with a reunion held in 1999.\n\n==Camps==\n\n===Harry S. Frazier Jr. Scout Reservation===\nThe Harry S. Frazier Jr. Scout Reservation is located in [[Clermont, Kentucky]]. It was originally created as the Old Kentucky Home Scout Reservation. Its primary draw is its week-long summer camp, Camp Crooked Creek, which offers advancement opportunities to both Boy Scouts and Varsity Scouts. It offers the following program areas in which Scouts can advance: Shooting Sports, Ecology, Citizenships, Handicraft, Aquatics and Outdoor Skills. The camp features a first year camper program known as Dan Boone Hill as well as two elements for older Scouts: a [[Project COPE]] course and a climbing tower. Camp Crooked Creek is also home to the Green River Trek and Frontier Town, which gives older Scouts the ability to learn new skills.\n\n===Tunnel Mill Scout Reservation===\nTunnel Mill Scout Reservation is located in [[Charlestown, Indiana]]. It includes the [[John Work House and Mill Site]], a Registered Historic Place. Tunnel Mill held Boy Scouts summer camps as early as 1917 and yearly under the direction of the George Rogers Clark Council (after it was formed) from 1928 - 1992.  After merging into the Lincoln Heritage Council in 1993, it has been used regularly for Cub Scout Day camps, Webelos camps,  and various camporees and Order of the Arrow activities, while still being utilized for various unit activities when camp schedules permit.<ref>[http://www.tunnelmill.org Tunnel Mill Historical Society]</ref>\n\n===Pfeffer Scout Reservation===\nPfeffer Scout Reservation is located on the shores of [[Kentucky Lake]] near [[Aurora, Kentucky|Aurora]]. It hosts '''Camp Roy C. Manchester'''  (RCM; formerly the Four Rivers Scout Camp or Reservation),  having changed its name in 1979 to honor [[Roy C. Manchester]]. From 1973-1983, Camp RCM took advantage of the BSA's attempt to create regional Outdoor Adventure (\"High Adventure\") bases around the nation. A \"first year camper\" program offered at the camp was featured in the March/April 1981 issue of Scouting magazine, which resulted in similar programs being offered in all BSA camps nationally. The Land Between the Lakes National Outdoor Adventure Center was a cooperative effort between the BSA and the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA). The BSA officially abandoned the National base but permitted the Four Rivers Council to continue to offer high adventure-related facilities for sailing, canoeing, kayaking and U.S. Coast Guard approved Sailing training. \n\nRCM has been used for summer camp since August 1956. Prior to 1957, summer camp was at Camp Pakentuck (named as a contraction of Paducah, Kentucky) in Southern Illinois. Summer Camp was held in both locations in 1956, first at Camp Pakentuck and then three weeks of rough \"outpost\" camping in early August at Kentucky Lake. Camp Pakentuck was owned by the Four Rivers Council but was also used by the Egyptian Council of Southern Illinois, and was sold to the Catholic Diocese of Belleville where it became part of the larger [[Camp Ondessonk]]. RCM was originally named the Kentucky Lake Scout Reservation, which was later changed to the Four Rivers Scout Camp (frequently called the Four Rivers Scout Reservation in earlier years), with a final change to its current name in 1979. Camp Roy C. Manchester was also the home camp of the former White Feather Lodge, Order of the Arrow and currently serves as the home camp for the White Horse Lodge, Order of the Arrow.\n\nWhile participating at summer camp, Scouts take part in traditional flag raising and lowering ceremonies. Summer camp at Camp Roy C. Manchester offers Scouts a chance to learn Scout Skills in a safe, outdoor environment. The camp has sixteen campsites located on over four hundred acres of land and six miles of shoreline. Program focus includes, the First Year Camper (Eaglebound) program and a variety of [[List of water sports|aquatics activities]]\u2014including [[sailing]], [[water skiing]], motor boating, swimming, canoeing, rowing, and fishing. Older Scouts have the opportunity to sail on Kentucky Lake, the largest artificial lake by surface area east of the Mississippi River. Current programs for older scouts include High-Adventure Sailing and Operation Iron Eagle, a week-long back country camping experience.\n\n===Camp Wildcat Hollow===\nCamp Wildcat Hollow is a {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} camp located in [[Russellville, Kentucky]]. Camp Wildcat Hollow served as the Shawnee Trails Council summer camp until the program was moved to Camp Roy C. Manchester in 1995. Camp Wildcat Hollow is now used as a training facility and for Cub Scout day camps. Camp Wildcat Hollow was also the home camp of the former Wapiti Lodge.\n\n==Order of the Arrow==\n===Nguttitehen Lodge #205===\nThe council currently is served by the Nguttitehen Lodge #205.  The lodge was formed in the merger between White Horse Lodge #201 and Talligewi Lodge #62 in 2012.  The lodge totem is a fire, representing the fire of cheerfulness.  The lodge name is Lenni-Lennape meaning \"to be of one heart and one mind:\".<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/talligewi62 Talligewi Lodge Facebook Merger Announcement July 3, 2012]</ref>\n\n====Talligewi Lodge #62====\nTalligewi Lodge #62 was first chartered on January 1, 1995. The creation of the Lodge came as a result of the merger between Tseyedin Lodge #65 of the George Rogers Clark Area Council and Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123 of the Old Kentucky Home Council.<ref>[http://www.talligewi62.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46&Itemid=63 Our Lodge History]</ref>\n\nA merger committee of four advisers and six youth from each lodge and the OA Staff Advisor met several times in the late Spring and Summer of 1994 to work out details of the merger.  Both lodges interacted somewhat at the [[National Order of the Arrow Conference]] held at [[Purdue University]] and came together that fall for a joint Fall Fellowship weekend at Tunnel Mill Scout Reservation.\n\nThe totem for Talligewi Lodge #62 was a Mandan Indian.<ref>[http://www.talligewi62.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=73&Itemid=109 Official Lodge Patch List from Talligewi Lodge #62]</ref> The Talligewi were an ancient tribe that was thought to have been wiped out at the Battle of Sand Island at the Falls of the Ohio River between Clarksville, IN and Louisville, KY.

The totem for Tseyedin Lodge #65 was the raccoon although it is thought that they were originally known as \u201cthe fox tribe\u201d since a fox appears on the very earliest lodge flap (F1) and arrowhead patches (A1, and A2).<ref>[http://www.oaimages.com/123.shtml Tseyedin Lodge Order of the Arrow Insignia]</ref>  But through slight changes in the lodge totem, it is evident that the raccoon was the lodge\u2019s totem for the remaining decades of the lodge\u2019s existence.\n\n=====Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123=====\nZit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123 <ref>[http://www.oaimages.com/123.shtml Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge Order of the Arrow Insignia]</ref> was chartered in 1938. The totem for Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123 was the cardinal since this bird is so prevalent throughout Kentucky and the lodge\u2019s name translates to \u201cRed Bird\u201d in the Sioux language.\n\n====White Horse Lodge #201====\nWhite Horse Lodge #201 was first chartered on January 1, 1996.  The creation of the Lodge came as a result of the merger between Wapiti Lodge #367 of the Audubon Council and White Feather Lodge #499 of the Four Rivers Council. White Horse Lodge was selected as the name of the replacement lodge as (i) the horse was important to the Native American, and (ii) white was arguably part of both predecessor lodges (as Wapiti meant American, or white, elk and the former White Feather Lodge).\n\n=====Wapiti Lodge #367=====\nWapiti Lodge was first chartered in 1949 and its totem was the American Elk.<ref>[http://www.oaimages.com/367.shtml Wapiti Lodge Order of the Arrow Insignia]</ref>   Wapiti means elk in the Shawnee language.\n\n======Land of the Big Caves and Walah Elemamekhaki Lodges #405======\nLand of the Big Caves Lodge #405 of the Mammoth Caves Council was first chartered in 1949 and changed its name to Walah Elemamekhaki Lodge #405 in 1950.  Its totem was a Kodiak Grizzly Bear.<ref>[http://www.oaimages.com/405.shtml Walah Elemamekhaki Lodge Order of the Arrow Insignia]</ref> The lodge was absorbed by Wapiti Lodge #367 in 1952.  \n\n=====White Feather Lodge #499=====\nA precursor to the lodge, called the White Feather Society, was founded at Camp Pakentuck (a combination name of Paducah and Kentucky) in southern Illinois in 1951. The Society was modeled after Blackhawk Lodge from Illinois, as the camp director at the time had been active in the Blackhawk Lodge. The Society issued a red ribbon with a white feather silk screened on it. A few neckerchiefs with the white feather silk screened on them are known to exist. The society was converted into an OA lodge in 1953 via a ceremonial team from Zit-Kala-Sha Lodge #123.  Don Thom performed the role of Allowat Sakima during the ceremony. In 1957, the lodge changed its home camp to [[Camp Roy C. Manchester]] on [[Kentucky Lake]].\n\nThomas Fielder, of [[Paducah, Kentucky]], was elected National Conference Chief in December 1968 at the Order of the Arrow national committee meeting<ref>{{cite web|title=Order of the Arrow - Ini-To Lodge 324, Flint River Council BSA|url=http://ini-to324.org/h-sixties.htm|publisher=Flint River Council, BSA|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=2 December 2015|quote=In December the Order of the Arrow National Committee met.

{"title_page": "History of Tampa, Florida", "text_new": "{{main|Tampa, Florida|History of Florida}}\n\nThe modern '''history of Tampa, Florida''' can be traced to the founding of [[Fort Brooke]] at the mouth of the [[Hillsborough River (Florida)|Hillsborough River]] in today's [[downtown Tampa|downtown]] in 1824, soon after the United States had taken possession of Florida from [[Spanish Florida|Spain]]. The outpost brought a small population of civilians to the area, and the town of Tampa was first incorporated in 1855.\n\nGrowth came slowly as poor transportation links, conflicts with the [[Seminole|Seminole tribe]], and repeated outbreaks of [[yellow fever]] made development difficult. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] caused the city government to disincorporate for over a decade.\n\nIn the 1880s the construction of the first [[railroad]] links laid by [[Henry B. Plant]] brought the development of thriving [[cigar]] and [[Phosphate mining in the United States|phosphate]] industries. The founding of the cigar-centered [[Neighborhoods in Tampa, Florida|neighborhood]] of [[Ybor City]] in 1885 brought an influx of [[Cubans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Italians]], and other immigrants. Tampa's population jumped from less than 800 residents in 1880 to over 15,000 in 1900, making it one of the largest cities in Florida.\n\nBy the 20th century Tampa emerged as a modern financial, trade, and commercial hub. It saw the start of the [[Gasparilla Pirate Festival]] and pioneering aviator [[Tony Jannus]] captaining the inaugural flight of the [[St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line]], the world's first commercial [[passenger airline]]. It also saw the rise of organized crime.\n\nThe number of residents exceeded 100,000 during the 1930s, 250,000 during the 1950s, and 300,000 during the 1990s. The land area of Tampa also grew, most notably when the city annexed the neighboring communities of [[West Tampa]] in 1925, [[Sulphur Springs, Tampa, Florida|Sulphur Springs]] and [[Palma Ceia, Tampa, Florida|Palma Ceia]] in 1953, [[Port Tampa]] in 1961, and [[New Tampa]] in 1988. Most of the land added to Tampa over the years was unincorporated. Five incorporated municipalities{{disputed inline|date=June 2014}} have been consolidated into Tampa: North Tampa, Ybor City, Fort Brooke, West Tampa, and Port Tampa.<ref name=\"ws1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/US_Mayors2.html|title=Mayors of U.S. Cities M-W|author=Ben Cahoon|date=|publisher=Worldstatesmen.org|accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Florida History Navbar}}\nThere is some dispute as to the origin and meaning of the name \"Tampa\". It is believed to mean \"sticks of fire\" in the language of the [[Calusa]], an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribe that once lived south of the area. This may relate to the high concentration of [[lightning]] strikes that west central Florida receives every year during the summer months.\n\nOther historians claim the name refers to \"the place to gather sticks\". [[Toponymy|Toponymist]] [[George R. Stewart]] writes that the name was the result of a miscommunication between the Spanish and the Indians, the Indian word being \"itimpi\", meaning simply \"near it\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|2008|page= 231}}</ref> Another source relates Tampa comes from a Seminole word for wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.hcplc.org/digital/collection/p15391coll2/id/1247/rec/8|title=Page 1|website=digitalcollections.hcplc.org}}</ref>\n\nThe name first appears in the memoir of [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]] from 1575, who had spent 17 years as a Calusa captive. He calls it \"Tanpa\" and describes it as an important Calusa town.\n\nWhile \"Tanpa\" may be the basis for the modern name \"Tampa\", [[archaeologist]] Jerald Milanich places the Calusa village of Tanpa at the mouth of [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] near current day [[Pineland, Florida|Pineland]]. Map maker [[Bernard Romans]] found certain difficulties in translating earlier Spanish-era maps of Florida for English use and may have accidentally transferred the name north to Tampa Bay, the next large inlet up the west coast of Florida.<ref>{{Harvnb|Milanich|1995|page=40}}</ref>\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|History of Florida}}\n\n[[File:TocobagaTerritory.GIF|thumb|200px|Approximate extent of [[Tocobaga]] culture]]\n\n===Indigenous population===\n{{see also|Tocobaga|Pohoy|Indigenous peoples of Florida}}\n\nArcheological evidence indicates that the shores of Tampa Bay have been inhabited for thousands of years. Artifacts suggest that early inhabitants of the region relied on the sea for most of their resources, and a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline.\n\nThe [[Manasota culture]] is the earliest documented group, spanning from about 500 B.C. until about 700 A.D., by which time it had evolved into the [[Safety Harbor culture]]. It loosely organized into three or four chiefdoms on the shores of the bay.\n\nThe [[Tocobaga]]'s principal town was located at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today's [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]] in [[Pinellas County]]. [[Uzita (Florida)|Uzita]] controlled the south shore of Tampa Bay, from the [[Little Manatee River]] to [[Sarasota Bay]]. [[Mocoso]] was on the east side of Tampa Bay, on the [[Alafia River]] and, possibly, the Hillsborough River. There may have been a fourth independent chiefdom, the [[Pohoy]] or Capaloey, centered on Hillsborough Bay near today's downtown and [[Port of Tampa|port]], possibly extending to the Hillsborough River.<ref>Milanich 1989: 299</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Milanich|1995|pages=28, 73, 103\u2013104, 110}}</ref>\n\nThese small coastal villages contained a temple mound, a central plaza, and one or more [[midden|shell middens]], which were trash heaps from which much archeological information has been obtained.<ref>Bullen, Ripley P.

The ill-fated [[Narv\u00e1ez Expedition]] landed near present-day Tampa with the intention of starting a colony. After being told by the natives of wealthier cultures to the north, they abandoned their camp after only a week to begin a long but futile search for non-existent riches. A dozen years later, a surviving member of the expedition named Juan Ortiz was rescued by [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition.<ref name=\"fwp286\" /><ref>[http://fcit.usf.edu/FLORIDA/docs/d/desoto.htm ''Floripedia'' \"De Soto, Hernando\"] \u2013 URL retrieved January 30, 2007</ref>\n\nDe Soto conducted a peace treaty with the Tocobaga, and a short-lived Spanish outpost was established. However, this was abandoned when it became clear that there was no [[gold]] in the area, that the local Indians were not interested in converting to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], and that they were too skilled as warriors to easily conquer.\n\nThough they successfully avoided being conquered by guns, the indigenous peoples had little defense against germs. [[Columbian exchange #disease|Diseases introduced by European contact]] would decimate the native population in the ensuing decades,<ref>Hann, John H. (2003). ''Indians of Central and South Florida: 1513\u20131763''. University Press of Florida. {{ISBN|0-8130-2645-8}}</ref> leading to the near-total collapse of every established culture across peninsular Florida. Between this depopulation and the indifference of its colonial owners, the Tampa Bay area would be virtually uninhabited for the next 200+ years.\n\n====English rule====\n\n[[File:1stMarquessOfDownshire.jpg|thumb|140px|Lord Hillsborough]]\nGreat Britain acquired Florida in 1763 as part of the treaty which ended the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]). The bay was rechristened \"Hillsborough Bay\" after [[Lord Hillsborough]], the then-[[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. Though the name \"Tampa Bay\" was later restored, the English period is still reflected in the names of Hillsborough river and county. Like Spain, Britain was much more concerned with the strategically important Atlantic coast of Florida (especially [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]) than other parts of the territory and did not attempt to found settlements along the Gulf coast.\n\nHowever, the Tampa Bay area did have a few residents: Indians and [[Cubans|Cuban]] fishermen who lived in a seasonal encampment at the mouth of [[Spanish Town Creek]], a freshwater stream that once ran through today's [[Hyde Park (Tampa)|Hyde Park neighborhood]] to [[Bayshore Boulevard]]. A handful of these people may have stayed year round, but the majority spent a few months catching and smoking fish (especially [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]]) from the teeming waters of the bay, then returned to sell them in Cuba.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas Angarano |url=http://www.webcoast.com/pinellas.htm |title=About Tampa Bay \u2013 Pinellas County History |publisher=Webcoast.com |date=1915-05-27 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\nSpain regained control of Florida in 1783 as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[American Revolution]]. Once again, the Florida's Gulf Coast was not a vital concern to its European owner.\n\n===Florida becomes a US territory===\nSince the mid-1700s, people from various native Indian tribes, especially [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creeks]] from Georgia, had fled to largely uninhabited Florida to distance themselves from encroaching settlers in their homelands. They were joined by escaped [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] from neighboring colonies / states, and these disparate refugees developed a new [[Seminole]] culture.\n\n== Fort Brooke and the Seminole Wars ==\n[[File:Charles Willson Peale - portrait of Andrew Jackson, 1819.jpg|thumb|130px|Andrew Jackson, 1819]]\n\nAfter the [[War of 1812]], [[Andrew Jackson]] invaded Florida kicking off the [[First Seminole War]].\nIn 1821, the United States [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|purchased Florida from Spain]], mainly to end (alleged) cross-frontier Indians raids and to eliminate the southern refuge for slaves. In fact, one of the first U.S. actions in its new territory was to launch a raid which destroyed [[Angola, Florida|Angola]], a village built by escaped slaves on the eastern shore of Tampa Bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/02/07/Tampabay/Excavators_seeking_fr.shtml |title=Excavators seeking freedom pioneers \u2013 St. Pete Times |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lookingforangola.org/Interview_Canter_Brown_Jr.asp?mnu=sub3 |title=Looking for Angola |publisher=Looking for Angola |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815193156/http://lookingforangola.org/Interview_Canter_Brown_Jr.asp?mnu=sub3 |archivedate=2010-08-15 }}</ref>\n\n===Fort Brooke===\nIn 1823, the United States imposed upon the leaders of the Seminoles to sign the [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]], which created a large [[Indian reservation]] in the interior of peninsular Florida. The U.S. government then built a series of forts and trading posts throughout the territory to enforce the provisions of the treaty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/florida/lessons/sem_war/sem_war1.htm|title=The Seminole Wars|website=fcit.usf.edu}}</ref>\n\nAs part of this effort, [[Fort Brooke]] was established on January 10, 1824 by Colonels [[George Mercer Brooke]] and [[James Gadsden]] at the mouth of the Hillsborough River on Tampa Bay, just about where today's [[Tampa Convention Center]] sits downtown. The site was marked by a huge [[hickory tree]] set atop an ancient [[Indian mound]] most likely built by the Tocobaga centuries before.[[File:Fort Brooke.jpg|thumb|Barracks and tents at Fort Brooke in Tampa Bay, c. 1835|alt=|left]]Colonel Brooke, the outpost's first commander, directed his troops to clear the area for the construction of a [[Fortification|wooden fort]] and support buildings, but ordered that several ancient [[live oak]] trees inside the encampment be spared to provide shade and cheer.<ref name=\"Brown, Cantor\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1999}}</ref>  On January 22, 1824, the post was officially named [[Fort Brooke]].<ref>{{cite web|author=museumofcigars.com |url=http://www.museumofcigars.com/fort-brooke.htm |title=fort brooke |publisher=Museumofcigars.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> [[John Mercer Brooke]] was born there.

Dade]]  while they were on their way from Fort Brooke to Fort King (near present-day [[Ocala]]) in a rout that was dubbed the [[Dade Massacre]], triggering the [[Second Seminole War]]. \n\nDuring the war, Fort Brooke first served as a refuge for settlers, then as a vital military depot and staging area. After almost seven years of vicious fighting, the war was over and the Seminoles were forced away from the Tampa region, and the tiny village began a period of slow growth. \n\n==== Third Seminole War ====\n[[File:Billy bowlegs harpers.jpg|thumb|130px|Seminole Billy Bowlegs]]\nSeminole chief [[Billy Bowlegs]] attacked the whites at Fort Myers in late 1855 triggering the [[Third Seminole War]]. When the news of the attack reached Tampa, the men of the city elected militia officers and organized companies. The newly formed militia marched to the Peace River valley, recruited more men, and manned some forts along the river.\n\n==Statehood to Civil War==\nThe Territory of Florida had grown enough by 1845 to become the 27th state. Pioneer families of Tampa during the antebellum period migrated largely from Northern Florida, Central Florida, Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas, along with their slaves, excepting a few settlers from Ireland, France, Spain and the North.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/bluebooktampaflo00haze/bluebooktampaflo00haze_djvu.txt|title=The Blue Book and History of Pioneers|last1=Brown-Hazen|first1=Pauline|date=1914|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company|edition=1st|location=Tampa, Florida|pages=4\u201331|oclc=19034562}}</ref>  John Parker was the town's first [[Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office|sheriff]].

Ybor City and North Tampa were annexed into Tampa in 1887.<ref name=\"ws1\" />\n\nThese changes combined to bring sudden prosperity and explosive growth \u2013 Tampa's population jumped from less than 800 residents in 1880 to over 15,000 in 1900, making it one of the largest cities in Florida.\n\nW.

The Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company bought out the Tampa Street Railway Company in 1894. The company also acquired control of the Tampa and Palmetto Beach Rail Company, becoming the sole streetcar operator in Tampa. The [[TECO Energy|Tampa Electric Company]] acquired control of the Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company in 1899.\n\nThe Tampa Electric Company acquired 21 miles (34&nbsp;km) of streetcar track. After acquiring the Tampa and Sulphur Springs Traction Company in 1913, Tampa Electric had almost 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) of track, increasing to 53 miles (85&nbsp;km) by 1926. That year the Tampa Electric system carried almost 24 million passengers. The streetcar system in Tampa was shut down after World War II.\n\nStreetcars returned to Tampa in 2002, when the initial 2.4&nbsp;mi (3.86&nbsp;km) long heritage line was opened, operated by the [[Hillsborough Area Regional Transit|transit authority]].\n\n===Cigar industry===\n\n[[File:Seal of Tampa, Florida.svg|thumb|120px|Seal of Tampa]]\n\nThe new railroad link attracted another industry which would finally make Tampa prosper. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade, especially W. C. Brown and W. B. Henderson, helped broker a land deal with [[Vicente Martinez Ybor]], Ignacio Haya, and [[Gavino Gutierrez]] to move their [[cigar]] manufacturing operations to Tampa from [[Key West]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Grismer|1950|pages=182\u2013183}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ucf.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%3A22405/datastream/OBJ/view/The_Florida_historical_quarterly.pdf|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|volume=45|title=The Historical Beginnings of Ybor City and Modern Tampa|author=Durward Long|page=34}}</ref>\n\nGutierrez had first come to Tampa in 1884 due to a false rumor about the ability to find [[guava]] trees.{{refn|group=n|In the 1970s columnist Steve Otto gave Tampa the nickname [[The Big Guava]], mimicking New York's \"[[Big Apple]]\".  Halloween in Ybor City is known as [[Guavaween]].}} Ybor had been attracted by Tampa's warm and humid climate, which kept [[tobacco]] fresh and workable, and its new transportation links. Close proximity (and Henry Plant's [[steamship]]s) made import of fine Cuban tobacco easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land. This relationship is acknowledged in the [[Seal of Tampa]], which depicts Plant's steamship ''Mascotte'', a vessel that carried thousands of immigrants and tons of tobacco to Tampa.\n\n====Ybor City====\n{{see also|History of Ybor City}}\n[[File:El Pasaje Ybor.jpg|thumb|[[El Pasaje]], one of the first buildings in Ybor City]]\n\nYbor built the [[Ybor Factory Building]] and [[El Pasaje]] and Ybor City (as the settlement was dubbed) quickly made Tampa a major cigar production center. Ybor City began as a separate [[municipality]], but, seeing the potential for greatly increased tax rolls, the city of Tampa annexed the bustling community in 1886.\n\nSince Tampa was still a small town at the time (population less than 5,000), Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of thousands of Cuban and Spanish cigar workers. Other cigar manufacturers soon moved in, such as [[Cuesta-Rey]]. In 1896, Ybor built a large [[Florida Brewing Company building|brewery]], the tallest building in the [[Ybor City Historic District|historic district]].\n\n=====Immigrants=====\n\n====== Cubans ======\n[[File:Jose Marti in Ybor City.jpg|thumb|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed with cigar factory workers in Ybor City, 1893.]]In the early 1890s, [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] was invited to Ybor City to collect funding for the cause of Cuban independence, which he did alongside [[Paulina Pedroso]].\n\n====== Spaniards ======\nIn the 1890s, Las Novedades, Tampa's oldest restaurant, opened.<ref>http://www.tampapix.com/lasnovedades.htm</ref>\n\n====== Italians ======\nStarting in the late 1880s, many Italian and a few eastern European Jewish immigrants also arrived.

The [[Cracker Country]] museum started in 1978 and the [[Tampa Museum of Art]] began in 1979. The Ybor City Museum Society was established in 1982. The [[Glazer Children's Museum|Children's Museum]] started in 1987. Tampa's first history museum were started in 1989. The [[Florida Aquarium]] opened in 1995.\n\n=== High rises ===\n[[File:Floridian Hotel, Tampa FL.JPG|thumb|160px|Hotel Floridan]]Tampa's first high rise, the [[Citizens Bank Building (Tampa, Florida)|Citizens Bank Building]] was built in 1913 by James. [[Tampa City Hall|City Hall]] was built in 1915 by [[Franklin O. Adams]]. In 1927, the [[Floridan Palace Hotel|Hotel Floridan]] opened.  The [[Franklin Exchange Building]] was constructed in 1966.\n\nThe [[Park Tower (Tampa, Florida)|Park Tower]] (opened in 1973) was the city's only substantial skyscraper (460 feet/36 stories) constructed until the building boom of the 1980s. [[One Tampa City Center]] and the [[Fifth Third Center (Tampa)|Fifth Third Center]] opened in 1981. [[One Mack-Cali Center]] was built in 1983. The [[Wells Fargo Center (Tampa)|Wells Fargo Center]] was completed in 1985. The [[Bank of America Plaza (Tampa)|Bank of America Plaza]] was completed in 1986. The [[Rivergate Tower]] opened in 1988.\n\nIn 1992, the [[SunTrust Financial Centre]] and [[100 North Tampa]], Tampa's [[List of tallest buildings in Tampa|tallest building]], went up. The [[Tampa Marriott Waterside]], the area's largest hotel, was completed in 2000.\n\n=== Segregation ===\nSegregation continued into the 20th century. Most blacks lived in \"the Scrub\" (Tampa's [[Central Avenue (Tampa, Florida)|Central Avenue]] district), West Tampa, Ybor City, [[Dobyville]], and College Hill. According to Benjamin Mays' report ''A Study of Negro Life in Tampa'', the black population grew from 4,383 in 1900 to 23,323 in 1927. Businessman [[Moses White (activist)|Moses White]] was known as the \"Mayor of Central Avenue\". [[Ole Pete]] was supposed to live in Port Tampa.\n[[File:Jackson Rooming House Tampa.jpg|thumb|160px|Jackson Rooming House]]\n\nThe [[Jackson Rooming House]], the area's only boarding house for blacks,  was built in the Scrub in 1901.  In 1908, [[Clara C. Frye]] opened a hospital for black patients in her home, assisted by Mack Winton. Her dining room table was the [[operating table]].\n\nA building was secured in 1923 and was purchased by the City of Tampa in 1928. The Clara Frye Memorial Hospital that existed in West Tampa from 1938 to 1967 was named after her. The Tampa Municipal Hospital did not admit black patients until the 1950s.\n\nIn 1922, [[Garfield Devoe Rogers Sr.]] helped start the Central Life Insurance Company, which sold policies to blacks. In 1938, [[Blanche Armwood]] became the first black woman in Florida to graduate from an accredited law school. Black Cuban Francisco Rodriguez became a lawyer in 1951. In 1952, the NAACP moved its state headquarters to Tampa, and educator Edward Daniel Davis was president of Central Life Insurance Company.\n\nIn 1919, William W. Andrews opened the ''[[Florida Sentinel]]'' newspaper office in Jacksonville. The office was closed during the Depression. In 1945, General Andrews's son, C. Blythe Andrews, re-opened the ''Florida Sentinel'' on Central Avenue. In 1959, he bought the ''Tampa Bulletin'' newspaper, and merged the two newspapers to make the ''Florida Sentinel Bulletin''. In 1962, the newspaper office was moved to Ybor City.<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/PhotoFullSize.asp?PhotoID=67579 Florida Sentinel Bulletin Marker] (photo).</ref> The [[C. Blythe Andrews Jr. Public Library]] was named in his honor.\n\n[[Cody Fowler]] formed the Bi-Racial Commission in 1959. His mother Maude helped develop Temple Terrace and is the namesake of [[Florida State Road 582|Fowler Avenue]].{{refn|group=n|Cody's [[Cody Fowler House|house]] is in Temple Terrace.}}\n\n=== Women ===\nIn 1900, the Tampa Woman's Club formed.<ref>https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1164&context=sunlandtribune</ref> Kate V. Jackson founded the Tampa Civic Association in 1911. In 1923, Elizabeth Dortsch Barnard was the town's first female postmaster.  In 1926, the [[Junior League]] of Tampa was founded.\n\n===Mafia===\n[[File:Bolita balls.jpg|right|thumb|200px| A set of bolita balls on display at the Ybor City State Museum.]]\nBeginning in the late 19th century, illegal [[bolita]] lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City.\n\n==== Charlie Wall ====\nIn the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by [[Charlie Wall]], whose father was the town's former mayor and a pioneer in yellow fever research, [[John Perry Wall]], and whose mother was a McKay.\n\nWall's operations thrived as he expanded them to include liquor distribution and speakeasies (this was the era of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) and prostitution. Other smaller [[organized crime]] groups tried to muscle in on the action, and long-simmering rivalries were kindled.\n\nThese organizations were able to operate openly because of kick-backs and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials. Wall was well-connected, and he used those connections to keep his businesses running and put down his competition. Tampa's political elite, which had held an inconsistent but mostly ambivalent attitude toward organized crime, quietly became de facto partners.\n\n==== Trafficantes and the Era of Blood ====\n{{see also|Trafficante crime family}}\nWhile Charlie Wall was Tampa's first major crime boss, various factions vied for control of the area in later years. Ongoing power struggles resulted in regular organized-crime related \"unsolved\" murders of crime-connected figures in what became known as the \"Era of Blood\". To protect their interests (and keep gangland killings unsolved), crime bosses regularly kept local officials \u2013 from state attorneys to top law enforcement personnel and even mayors \u2013 on the payroll.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deitche |first=Scott |url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/the_mob/Content?oid=317 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; Cover &#124; The Mob |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113104959/http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/the_mob/Content?oid=317 |archivedate=2009-01-13 }}</ref>\n[[File:Santo Trafficante, Jr.jpg|thumb|130px|Santo Trafficante, Jr. mugshot]]\nThe first Italian gang in the Tampa Bay area was created by the Sicilian [[Ignacio Antinori]] in 1925.  By the late 1940s, most of the area's crime organizations were under the control of [[made man|mafioso]] [[Santo Trafficante, Sr.]] and his faction. After his death in 1954 from [[cancer]], control passed to his son [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]], who established alliances with families in New York City and extended his power throughout Florida and into [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]]-era [[Cuba]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Deitche |first=Scott |url=http://www.weeklyplanet.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa |publisher=Weeklyplanet.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315022914/http://www.weeklyplanet.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A317 |archivedate=2006-03-15 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_101.html |title=Feature Articles 101 |publisher=AmericanMafia.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206141849/http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_101.html |archivedate=2010-02-06 }}</ref>\n\n====Election controversies====\nFrom the early 1930s until the early 1950s, every municipal election was tainted by electoral abnormalities, most with alleged mob connections. The first widespread example was Tampa's mayoral election of 1931, when over 100 people were arrested for \"cheating at the polls\". Most were supporters of the winning candidate, Robert E. Lee Chancey, who his opponents claimed had close ties to Tampa's \"underworld\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Kerstein|2001}}</ref> After the election, all of the charges were either reduced or dropped altogether. Many of those involved had been on the city payroll at the time of their arrest, and most remained there.\n \nThe situation was even more chaotic during the next election cycle in 1935. This started before election day when Tampa's chief of police (who supported the incumbent mayor) and the Hillsborough County Sheriff (who supported the challenger) both claimed to be the proper authority to monitor the actual voting. Anticipating trouble, [[David Sholtz|Florida Governor Sholtz]] mobilized the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to prevent violence. Still, both sheriff's officers and city police were deployed at polling places, resulting in police officers arresting sheriff's deputies and vice versa.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) the large number of observers, [[ballot stuffing]] and re-voting was widespread. The day may have turned violent if not for the presence of the National Guard troops and a sideswipe from the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]], which passed just west of Tampa during the afternoon and pelted the area with torrential rains and high winds.\n\nIn the end, the Tampa Election Board determined that Chancey had easily won re-election. They had reached these results by throwing out all ballots from 29 precincts due to \"fraudulent voting\". The Board may not have been the most impartial judge of the matter, however, as Chancey had appointed the members himself.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\n====Reforms====\n\n[[File:SenatorKefauver(D-TN).jpg|thumb|130px|Estes Kefauver]]\nThe era of rampant and open corruption came to a head in the early 1950s when the [[Kefauver hearings]], [[Estes Kefauver|Senator Estes Kefauver's]] traveling investigation of organized crime in America, came to town. Informants (including the retired Charlie Wall) came forward to make startling accusations of corruption throughout Tampa's power structure. The hearings were followed by misconduct trials of several local officials and the \"unsolved\" murders of some of the government informants (including the retired Charlie Wall).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nThough most of the accused persons were acquitted or given light sentences, the trials helped to motivate Tampa to end the corruption and general sense of lawlessness which had prevailed for decades. Ethics and election reforms were passed, and the link between local government and organized crime weakened.\n\nHowever, major corruption was not eliminated entirely. In 1983, 3 out of the 5 members of the [[Hillsborough County, Florida#Government|Hillsborough County Commission]] were charged with accepting bribes. Unlike earlier crooked officials, however, these three were convicted of their crimes and sentenced to federal prison. This scandal resulted in another round of ethics reforms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deeson |first=Mike |url=http://www.tampabays10.com/news/local/article.aspx?storyid=73000 |title=Public Corruption Arrests 25 years later |publisher=Tampabays10.com |date=1983-02-01 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\nThe first [[Sports in the Tampa Bay area|athletic]] venue in Tampa was [[Plant Field]], a race track and field built by Plant in 1899. In 1908 the YMCA opened.\n\n[[Curtis Hixon Hall]] opened in 1965, named for former mayor [[Curtis Hixon]], hosted basketball, boxing matches, and concerts.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Skatepark of Tampa]] was completed.\n\n====Football====\nIn 1926, [[Jim Thorpe]] led the barnstorming [[Tampa Cardinals]] against [[Red Grange]] and the [[Chicago Bears]] in the first professional football game in Tampa. The next venue after Plant Field was [[Phillips Field (Florida)|Phillips Field]], which hosted the University of Tampa football team, and was the site of the [[Cigar Bowl]].\n[[File:Tampa Stadium1.jpg|thumb|Tampa Stadium]]\nIn 1967, [[Tampa Stadium]] was built. Tampa was chosen for a team as part of the [[National Football League]]'s expansion after the AFL/NFL merger in 1970, and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] had their first season in 1976, as members of the [[AFC West]] division. The following year, the Bucs were moved to the [[NFC Central]].\n\nThe team was the worst in the league until 1979, with a brief period of success from 1979 to 1982 with a defense led by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Lee Roy Selmon]]. The team was again the worst in the league from 1983 to 1996, until they hired Hall of Fame coach [[Tony Dungy]] who pioneered the [[Tampa 2]] defense. In 1998, the team moved to [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nIn 2002, the Bucs moved to the [[NFC South]], and under head coach [[Jon Gruden]] the team won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]. Tampa hosted [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]], [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]], and [[Super Bowl XXXV|XXXV]]. Super Bowl [[Super Bowl XLIII|XLIII]] was hosted in Tampa, and [[Super Bowl LV|LV]] is scheduled to be. Tampa also hosts the [[Outback Bowl]]. There also used to be the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]] of the [[United States Football League]], coached by [[Steve Spurrier]], and the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] of the [[Arena Football League]]. \"The War on I-4\" refers to both the Tampa-Orlando rivalry in [[War on I-4 (arena football)|arena football]] and [[South Florida\u2013UCF rivalry|college football]].\n\n====Baseball====\nIn 1913, the [[Chicago Cubs]] moved their [[spring training]] site to the city of Tampa. The original [[minor league baseball]] team in Tampa was the [[Tampa Smokers]], established in 1919 as a charter member of the [[Florida State League]].\n[[File:Al Lopez Field entrance.JPG|thumb|Al Lopez Field]]\nThe [[New York Yankees]] train in Tampa at [[George M. Steinbrenner Field]], formerly Legends Field, which is the home of the [[Tampa Tarpons]]. [[Al Lopez Field]] used to be in West Tampa, named for Hall of Famer and Tampa native [[Al Lopez]]. Lopez's home is now the [[Tampa Baseball Museum]]. USF baseball used to play at [[Red McEwen Field]].\n\nIn 1998, Tampa got a [[Major League Baseball]] team, the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], which plays at [[Tropicana Field]]. Hall of Famer [[Wade Boggs]] grew up in Tampa, as did [[Tony La Russa]], [[Lou Piniella]], [[Tino Martinez]], [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], [[Doc Gooden]], and [[Gary Sheffield]].\n\nThe Devil Rays changed their name to the Rays in 2008. [[USF Baseball Stadium]] opened in 2011. .\n\n====Basketball====\nUSF basketball plays at the [[Yuengling Center]], formerly the Sun Dome.\n\n====Hockey====\n\nThe [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] of the [[National Hockey League]] formed in 1992, and plays at [[Amalie Arena]], formerly the Ice Palace and St. Pete Times Forum. The Lightning won the [[Stanley Cup]] in 2004.\n\n==== Soccer ====\nThere used to be the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u201393)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]].\n\n====Tennis====\n\nFrom 1979 to 1990, Tampa hosted the [[Eckerd Open]].\n\n====Golf====\n\nGarfield Rogers built [[Rogers Park, Tampa|Rogers Park]], the first [[golf course]] for blacks in Tampa. In 1974, the City of Tampa took over [[Babe Zaharias]]'s golf course in the [[Forest Hills (Tampa)|Forest Hills]] neighborhood.\n\n==21st century==\n[[The Stovall]] was built in 2001. The [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] programming language conference was held in Tampa in 2001. The [[Florida Museum of Photographic Arts]] also started in 2001. The American Victory Ship & Museum with [[SS American Victory]] started in 2003.  The [[MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre|Ford Amphitheater]], and [[Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Tampa]] in [[Tampa Indian Reservation]], also opened in 2004.\n\n===2002 plane crash===\nOn January 5, 2002, just four months after the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], 15-year-old amateur pilot [[Charles Bishop (pilot)|Charles Bishop]] [[2002 Tampa plane crash|crashed]] a [[Cessna]] plane into the Bank of America Plaza. Bishop died, but there were no other injuries (because the crash occurred on a Saturday, when few people were in the building). A [[suicide]] note found in the wreckage expressed support for [[Osama bin Laden]]. Bishop had been taking a [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medicine for [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] called [[Accutane]] that may have had the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]] of [[clinical depression|depression]] or severe psychosis. His family later sued Hoffman-La Roche, the company that makes Accutane, for $70 million; however, an autopsy found no traces of the drug in the teenager's system.\n\n===2004 hurricane season===\nThe [[2004 Atlantic Hurricane Season]] was historically busy for all of Florida, including Tampa. Tampa's [[Climate of the Tampa Bay area|climate]] was affected by a record four hurricanes that year; [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]], [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]], and to a lesser extent, [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]].\n\nThe eyes of both Jeanne and Frances passed within a few miles of Tampa as they slashed their way across the state from the east coast. Charley was forecast to make a direct hit on Tampa Bay from the south (the worst-case scenario for local flooding). But the storm made a sudden and unexpected turn to the northeast and brought only tropical storm force winds to Tampa, devastating the [[Ft. Myers]]/[[Port Charlotte, Florida|Port Charlotte]] area instead. Ivan roared past the Florida gulf coast on its way to landfall near the [[Alabama]]/[[Florida]] border, passing near enough to bring high seas and stormy conditions to the Tampa area.\n\n===Downtown revitalization===\n[[File:Tampa Channelside.JPG|thumb|right|Luxury condos are rising in the former warehouse district of [[Channel District, Tampa, Florida|Channelside]], downtown Tampa]]\n\nFormer Tampa mayor [[Pam Iorio]] made the redevelopment of downtown a priority and focused on bringing residents into the decidedly non-residential area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/10/Floridian/Urban_culture_clash.shtml |title=Floridian: Urban culture clash |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> Several residential and mixed-development high-rises were planned and constructed. [[The Alagon on Bayshore]] was built in 2006. The [[Towers of Channelside]] and [[SkyPoint]] were finished in 2007. [[Element (Tampa)|Element]] was built in 2009.\n\n====Riverwalk====\nAnother of Mayor Iorio's initiatives was to improve the Tampa Riverwalk. The development plan expanded use of the land along the Hillsborough River in downtown, where Tampa was first established. The [[Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park]] opened in 2010, next to the Riverwalk and the former site of Curtis Hixon Hall. [[Water Works Park (Tampa, Florida)|Water Works Park]] opened in 2014.\n\n=====Museums=====\nSeveral museums were part of the plan, including the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts, which relocated in 2006, the [[Tampa Bay History Center]], which began in 2009; the Tampa Children's Museum, which relocated in 2010 and was renamed the Glazer Children's Museum, the Tampa Museum of Art, which relocated in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A52700 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; Downtowns On The Verge |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423004825/http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A52700 |archivedate=2009-04-23 }}</ref>\n\nTampa Mayor [[Bob Buckhorn]] has continued the development and redevelopment focused work.

The outpost brought a small population of civilians to the area, and the town of Tampa was first incorporated in 1855.\n\nGrowth came slowly as poor transportation links, conflicts with the [[Seminole|Seminole tribe]], and repeated outbreaks of [[yellow fever]] made development difficult. The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] caused the city government to disincorporate for over a decade.\n\nIn the 1880s the construction of the first [[railroad]] links laid by [[Henry B. Plant]] brought the development of thriving [[cigar]] and [[Phosphate mining in the United States|phosphate]] industries. The founding of the cigar-centered [[Neighborhoods in Tampa, Florida|neighborhood]] of [[Ybor City]] in 1885 brought an influx of [[Cubans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Italians]], and other immigrants. Tampa's population jumped from less than 800 residents in 1880 to over 15,000 in 1900, making it one of the largest cities in Florida.\n\nBy the 20th century Tampa emerged as a modern financial, trade, and commercial hub. It saw the start of the [[Gasparilla Pirate Festival]] and pioneering aviator [[Tony Jannus]] captaining the inaugural flight of the [[St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line]], the world's first commercial [[passenger airline]]. It also saw the rise of organized crime.\n\nThe number of residents exceeded 100,000 during the 1930s, 250,000 during the 1950s, and 300,000 during the 1990s. The land area of Tampa also grew, most notably when the city annexed the neighboring communities of [[West Tampa]] in 1925, [[Sulphur Springs, Tampa, Florida|Sulphur Springs]] and [[Palma Ceia, Tampa, Florida|Palma Ceia]] in 1953, [[Port Tampa]] in 1961, and [[New Tampa]] in 1988. Most of the land added to Tampa over the years was unincorporated. Five incorporated municipalities{{disputed inline|date=June 2014}} have been consolidated into Tampa: North Tampa, Ybor City, Fort Brooke, West Tampa, and Port Tampa.<ref name=\"ws1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/US_Mayors2.html|title=Mayors of U.S. Cities M-W|author=Ben Cahoon|date=|publisher=Worldstatesmen.org|accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Florida History Navbar}}\nThere is some dispute as to the origin and meaning of the name \"Tampa\". It is believed to mean \"sticks of fire\" in the language of the [[Calusa]], an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribe that once lived south of the area. This may relate to the high concentration of [[lightning]] strikes that west central Florida receives every year during the summer months.\n\nOther historians claim the name refers to \"the place to gather sticks\". [[Toponymy|Toponymist]] [[George R. Stewart]] writes that the name was the result of a miscommunication between the Spanish and the Indians, the Indian word being \"itimpi\", meaning simply \"near it\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Stewart|2008|page= 231}}</ref> Another source relates Tampa comes from a Seminole word for wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.hcplc.org/digital/collection/p15391coll2/id/1247/rec/8|title=Page 1|website=digitalcollections.hcplc.org}}</ref>\n\nThe name first appears in the memoir of [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]] from 1575, who had spent 17 years as a Calusa captive. He calls it \"Tanpa\" and describes it as an important Calusa town.\n\nWhile \"Tanpa\" may be the basis for the modern name \"Tampa\", [[archaeologist]] Jerald Milanich places the Calusa village of Tanpa at the mouth of [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] near current day [[Pineland, Florida|Pineland]]. Map maker [[Bernard Romans]] found certain difficulties in translating earlier Spanish-era maps of Florida for English use and may have accidentally transferred the name north to Tampa Bay, the next large inlet up the west coast of Florida.<ref>{{Harvnb|Milanich|1995|page=40}}</ref>\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|History of Florida}}\n\n[[File:TocobagaTerritory.GIF|thumb|200px|Approximate extent of [[Tocobaga]] culture]]\n\n===Indigenous population===\n{{see also|Tocobaga|Pohoy|Indigenous peoples of Florida}}\n\nArcheological evidence indicates that the shores of Tampa Bay have been inhabited for thousands of years. Artifacts suggest that early inhabitants of the region relied on the sea for most of their resources, and a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline.\n\nThe [[Manasota culture]] is the earliest documented group, spanning from about 500 B.C. until about 700 A.D., by which time it had evolved into the [[Safety Harbor culture]]. It loosely organized into three or four chiefdoms on the shores of the bay.\n\nThe [[Tocobaga]]'s principal town was located at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today's [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]] in [[Pinellas County]]. [[Uzita (Florida)|Uzita]] controlled the south shore of Tampa Bay, from the [[Little Manatee River]] to [[Sarasota Bay]]. [[Mocoso]] was on the east side of Tampa Bay, on the [[Alafia River]] and, possibly, the Hillsborough River. There may have been a fourth independent chiefdom, the [[Pohoy]] or Capaloey, centered on Hillsborough Bay near today's downtown and [[Port of Tampa|port]], possibly extending to the Hillsborough River.<ref>Milanich 1989: 299</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Milanich|1995|pages=28, 73, 103\u2013104, 110}}</ref>\n\nThese small coastal villages contained a temple mound, a central plaza, and one or more [[midden|shell middens]], which were trash heaps from which much archeological information has been obtained.<ref>Bullen, Ripley P.

The ill-fated [[Narv\u00e1ez Expedition]] landed near present-day Tampa with the intention of starting a colony. After being told by the natives of wealthier cultures to the north, they abandoned their camp after only a week to begin a long but futile search for non-existent riches. A dozen years later, a surviving member of the expedition named Juan Ortiz was rescued by [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition.<ref name=\"fwp286\" /><ref>[http://fcit.usf.edu/FLORIDA/docs/d/desoto.htm ''Floripedia'' \"De Soto, Hernando\"] \u2013 URL retrieved January 30, 2007</ref>\n\nDe Soto conducted a peace treaty with the Tocobaga, and a short-lived Spanish outpost was established. However, this was abandoned when it became clear that there was no [[gold]] in the area, that the local Indians were not interested in converting to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], and that they were too skilled as warriors to easily conquer.\n\nThough they successfully avoided being conquered by guns, the indigenous peoples had little defense against germs. [[Columbian exchange #disease|Diseases introduced by European contact]] would decimate the native population in the ensuing decades,<ref>Hann, John H. (2003). ''Indians of Central and South Florida: 1513\u20131763''. University Press of Florida. {{ISBN|0-8130-2645-8}}</ref> leading to the near-total collapse of every established culture across peninsular Florida. Between this depopulation and the indifference of its colonial owners, the Tampa Bay area would be virtually uninhabited for the next 200+ years.\n\n====English rule====\n\n[[File:1stMarquessOfDownshire.jpg|thumb|140px|Lord Hillsborough]]\nGreat Britain acquired Florida in 1763 as part of the treaty which ended the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]). The bay was rechristened \"Hillsborough Bay\" after [[Lord Hillsborough]], the then-[[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. Though the name \"Tampa Bay\" was later restored, the English period is still reflected in the names of Hillsborough river and county. Like Spain, Britain was much more concerned with the strategically important Atlantic coast of Florida (especially [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]) than other parts of the territory and did not attempt to found settlements along the Gulf coast.\n\nHowever, the Tampa Bay area did have a few residents: Indians and [[Cubans|Cuban]] fishermen who lived in a seasonal encampment at the mouth of [[Spanish Town Creek]], a freshwater stream that once ran through today's [[Hyde Park (Tampa)|Hyde Park neighborhood]] to [[Bayshore Boulevard]]. A handful of these people may have stayed year round, but the majority spent a few months catching and smoking fish (especially [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]]) from the teeming waters of the bay, then returned to sell them in Cuba.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomas Angarano |url=http://www.webcoast.com/pinellas.htm |title=About Tampa Bay \u2013 Pinellas County History |publisher=Webcoast.com |date=1915-05-27 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\nSpain regained control of Florida in 1783 as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[American Revolution]]. Once again, the Florida's Gulf Coast was not a vital concern to its European owner.\n\n===Florida becomes a US territory===\nSince the mid-1700s, people from various native Indian tribes, especially [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creeks]] from Georgia, had fled to largely uninhabited Florida to distance themselves from encroaching settlers in their homelands. They were joined by escaped [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] from neighboring colonies / states, and these disparate refugees developed a new [[Seminole]] culture.\n\n== Fort Brooke and the Seminole Wars ==\n[[File:Charles Willson Peale - portrait of Andrew Jackson, 1819.jpg|thumb|130px|Andrew Jackson, 1819]]\n\nAfter the [[War of 1812]], [[Andrew Jackson]] invaded Florida kicking off the [[First Seminole War]].\nIn 1821, the United States [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|purchased Florida from Spain]], mainly to end (alleged) cross-frontier Indians raids and to eliminate the southern refuge for slaves.

The U.S. government then built a series of forts and trading posts throughout the territory to enforce the provisions of the treaty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/florida/lessons/sem_war/sem_war1.htm|title=The Seminole Wars|website=fcit.usf.edu}}</ref>\n\nAs part of this effort, [[Fort Brooke]] was established on January 10, 1824 by Colonels [[George Mercer Brooke]] and [[James Gadsden]] at the mouth of the Hillsborough River on Tampa Bay, just about where today's [[Tampa Convention Center]] sits downtown. The site was marked by a huge [[hickory tree]] set atop an ancient [[Indian mound]] most likely built by the Tocobaga centuries before.[[File:Fort Brooke.jpg|thumb|Barracks and tents at Fort Brooke in Tampa Bay, c. 1835|alt=|left]]Colonel Brooke, the outpost's first commander, directed his troops to clear the area for the construction of a [[Fortification|wooden fort]] and support buildings, but ordered that several ancient [[live oak]] trees inside the encampment be spared to provide shade and cheer.<ref name=\"Brown, Cantor\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1999}}</ref>  On January 22, 1824, the post was officially named [[Fort Brooke]].<ref>{{cite web|author=museumofcigars.com |url=http://www.museumofcigars.com/fort-brooke.htm |title=fort brooke |publisher=Museumofcigars.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> [[John Mercer Brooke]] was born there. The first post office was established in 1831.<ref name=\"fwp286\">{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1939|page=286}}</ref>\n\n====Second Seminole War====\nA few settlers established homesteads near the palisade, but growth was very slow due to difficult pioneer conditions and the constant fear of attack from the Seminole population, some of whom lived nearby in an uneasy truce.\n\nFollowing [[Osceola]]'s murder of the US Indian agent General [[Wiley Thompson]], in December 1835 Osceola and [[Micanopy]] ambushed the forces of Major [[Francis L. Dade]]  while they were on their way from Fort Brooke to Fort King (near present-day [[Ocala]]) in a rout that was dubbed the [[Dade Massacre]], triggering the [[Second Seminole War]]. \n\nDuring the war, Fort Brooke first served as a refuge for settlers, then as a vital military depot and staging area. After almost seven years of vicious fighting, the war was over and the Seminoles were forced away from the Tampa region, and the tiny village began a period of slow growth. \n\n==== Third Seminole War ====\n[[File:Billy bowlegs harpers.jpg|thumb|130px|Seminole Billy Bowlegs]]\nSeminole chief [[Billy Bowlegs]] attacked the whites at Fort Myers in late 1855 triggering the [[Third Seminole War]]. When the news of the attack reached Tampa, the men of the city elected militia officers and organized companies. The newly formed militia marched to the Peace River valley, recruited more men, and manned some forts along the river.\n\n==Statehood to Civil War==\nThe Territory of Florida had grown enough by 1845 to become the 27th state. Pioneer families of Tampa during the antebellum period migrated largely from Northern Florida, Central Florida, Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas, along with their slaves, excepting a few settlers from Ireland, France, Spain and the North.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/bluebooktampaflo00haze/bluebooktampaflo00haze_djvu.txt|title=The Blue Book and History of Pioneers|last1=Brown-Hazen|first1=Pauline|date=1914|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company|edition=1st|location=Tampa, Florida|pages=4\u201331|oclc=19034562}}</ref>  John Parker was the town's first [[Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office|sheriff]].

Every building in Tampa was either damaged or destroyed, including most of Fort Brooke. Much of the population stayed to rebuild, and some desperate lobbying in Washington, D.C. persuaded the [[US Army]] to reconsider a plan to abandon the fort and its garrison of troops.<ref name=\"Brown, Cantor\" />\n\n===Incorporation and early township===\nThe settlement of Tampa recovered enough by 1849 to incorporate as the \"Village of Tampa\", which officially occurred on January 18. At the time, Tampa was home to 185 inhabitants, excluding military personnel stationed at Fort Brooke. The city's first official [[U.S. Census|census]] count in 1850 listed [[Tampa-Fort Brooke, Florida|Tampa-Fort Brooke]] as having 974 residents.<ref>http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1850c-11.pdf</ref> [[Oaklawn Cemetery]], the first public burying ground, was established the same year.\n\nIn 1855 the first official [[Tampa Police Department|law enforcement]] position created was City Marshall.

Of particular importance was the founding of the cigar-centered neighborhood of Ybor City in 1885, which brought a large influx of Cubans, Spaniards, Italians, and a handful of other immigrants to what had previously been a typical small southern town. Ybor City and North Tampa were annexed into Tampa in 1887.<ref name=\"ws1\" />\n\nThese changes combined to bring sudden prosperity and explosive growth \u2013 Tampa's population jumped from less than 800 residents in 1880 to over 15,000 in 1900, making it one of the largest cities in Florida.\n\nW. B. Henderson was foreman of the first [[volunteer fire department|volunteer]] [[Tampa Fire Rescue Department|fire fighting group]] in Tampa, Hook & Ladder Company No. 1, organized in 1884.

E. Mitchell, operated by the [[TECO Line Streetcar System|Tampa Street Railway Company]], which included Henderson and Lesley as members.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grismer|1950|page=190}}</ref>\n\nIn 1892 it merged with the Florida Electric Company to form the Tampa Street Railway and Power Company, and converted to electrically powered streetcars in 1893. The Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company bought out the Tampa Street Railway Company in 1894. The company also acquired control of the Tampa and Palmetto Beach Rail Company, becoming the sole streetcar operator in Tampa. The [[TECO Energy|Tampa Electric Company]] acquired control of the Consumers Electric Light and Street Railway Company in 1899.\n\nThe Tampa Electric Company acquired 21 miles (34&nbsp;km) of streetcar track. After acquiring the Tampa and Sulphur Springs Traction Company in 1913, Tampa Electric had almost 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) of track, increasing to 53 miles (85&nbsp;km) by 1926. That year the Tampa Electric system carried almost 24 million passengers. The streetcar system in Tampa was shut down after World War II.\n\nStreetcars returned to Tampa in 2002, when the initial 2.4&nbsp;mi (3.86&nbsp;km) long heritage line was opened, operated by the [[Hillsborough Area Regional Transit|transit authority]].\n\n===Cigar industry===\n\n[[File:Seal of Tampa, Florida.svg|thumb|120px|Seal of Tampa]]\n\nThe new railroad link attracted another industry which would finally make Tampa prosper. In 1885, the Tampa Board of Trade, especially W. C. Brown and W. B. Henderson, helped broker a land deal with [[Vicente Martinez Ybor]], Ignacio Haya, and [[Gavino Gutierrez]] to move their [[cigar]] manufacturing operations to Tampa from [[Key West]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Grismer|1950|pages=182\u2013183}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ucf.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/ucf%3A22405/datastream/OBJ/view/The_Florida_historical_quarterly.pdf|journal=The Florida Historical Quarterly|volume=45|title=The Historical Beginnings of Ybor City and Modern Tampa|author=Durward Long|page=34}}</ref>\n\nGutierrez had first come to Tampa in 1884 due to a false rumor about the ability to find [[guava]] trees.{{refn|group=n|In the 1970s columnist Steve Otto gave Tampa the nickname [[The Big Guava]], mimicking New York's \"[[Big Apple]]\".  Halloween in Ybor City is known as [[Guavaween]].}} Ybor had been attracted by Tampa's warm and humid climate, which kept [[tobacco]] fresh and workable, and its new transportation links. Close proximity (and Henry Plant's [[steamship]]s) made import of fine Cuban tobacco easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land. This relationship is acknowledged in the [[Seal of Tampa]], which depicts Plant's steamship ''Mascotte'', a vessel that carried thousands of immigrants and tons of tobacco to Tampa.\n\n====Ybor City====\n{{see also|History of Ybor City}}\n[[File:El Pasaje Ybor.jpg|thumb|[[El Pasaje]], one of the first buildings in Ybor City]]\n\nYbor built the [[Ybor Factory Building]] and [[El Pasaje]] and Ybor City (as the settlement was dubbed) quickly made Tampa a major cigar production center. Ybor City began as a separate [[municipality]], but, seeing the potential for greatly increased tax rolls, the city of Tampa annexed the bustling community in 1886.\n\nSince Tampa was still a small town at the time (population less than 5,000), Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of thousands of Cuban and Spanish cigar workers. Other cigar manufacturers soon moved in, such as [[Cuesta-Rey]]. In 1896, Ybor built a large [[Florida Brewing Company building|brewery]], the tallest building in the [[Ybor City Historic District|historic district]].\n\n=====Immigrants=====\n\n====== Cubans ======\n[[File:Jose Marti in Ybor City.jpg|thumb|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed with cigar factory workers in Ybor City, 1893.]]In the early 1890s, [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] was invited to Ybor City to collect funding for the cause of Cuban independence, which he did alongside [[Paulina Pedroso]].\n\n====== Spaniards ======\nIn the 1890s, Las Novedades, Tampa's oldest restaurant, opened.<ref>http://www.tampapix.com/lasnovedades.htm</ref>\n\n====== Italians ======\nStarting in the late 1880s, many Italian and a few eastern European Jewish immigrants also arrived. These new arrivals had difficulty breaking into the insular cigar businesses, so many opened businesses and shops that catered to the cigar workers.[[File:Ferlita Bakery.jpg|thumb|180px|Ferlita Bakery]]\n\nThe majority of Italian immigrants came from [[Alessandria Della Rocca]] and [[Santo Stefano Quisquina]], two small [[Sicily|Sicilian]] towns with which Tampa still maintains strong ties. In 1896, Sicilian Francisco Ferlita established what is likely the earliest U.S. bakery to produce [[Cuban bread]], now the site of [[Ybor City Museum State Park]].\n\n====West Tampa====\nIn 1892, [[Scottish-American|Scottish]] businessman Hugh MacFarlane founded [[West Tampa]], a new community across the Hillsborough River that sought to attract more cigar factories and workers. By 1900, the town already had one of the largest populations in Florida, mostly Cubans involved in the cigar industry.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|last=Garcia |first=Wayne |url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A11138 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; The Western Front |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabayhistorycenter.org/cigar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227114313/http://www.tampabayhistorycenter.org/cigar.htm |archivedate=2007-02-27 }}</ref>\n\n===New churches===\nNew church [[Christian denomination|denominations]] came to Tampa, including [[St. Andrews Episcopal Church (Tampa, Florida)|St. Andrew's Episcopal]] in 1871,<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=26906 \u201cSt. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal Church\u201d.] [http://www.hmdb.org ''The Historical Marker Database''.].

In 1972, the Sant'Yago Knight Parade was added to the festivities.\n\n=== Cigars ===\nDuring the first few decades of the 20th century, the cigar making factories in Ybor City and West Tampa continued to be the backbone of Tampa's economy. In the peak year of 1929, over 500,000,000 cigars were hand rolled in the city.<ref>Ybor City: The Making of a Landmark Town by Frank Lastra</ref>\n\n==== Hav-a-Tampa ====\nThe Hav-a-Tampa Cigar Company was founded by Eli Witt in 1907.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smokeshopmag.com/0809/industry.htm|title=SMOKESHOP 08/09 \u2013 Industry News|website=www.smokeshopmag.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Immigrants ===\n\n[[File:German-american_club_ybor.jpg|thumb|160px|German-American Club]]\n\nThe German-American Club first organized in 1901, with Glogowski as president.\n\n==== Cubans ====\nIn 1902, the year Cuba seceded from Spain, the [[Circulo Cubano de Tampa]] was founded, in a building built by [[M. Leo Elliott]]. [[Brocato's Sandwich Shop]] opened in 1948.\n\n==== Spaniards ====\nIn 1905, the [[Columbia Restaurant]] was opened.

The [[Centro Asturiano de Tampa]] was built by Elliott in 1913. [[La Segunda Central Bakery]] opened in 1915.\n\nIn 1926, physician Mack Winton worked in the Sanatorio del Centro Espanol, which treated Spanish patients.\n\n==== Italians ====\n[[Alessi Bakery]] was founded in 1912. The [[L'Unione Italiana]] building designed by Elliott was constructed in 1918. Elliott built [[Masonic Temple No. 25]] to look Italian in 1928.\n\n==== Newspapers ====\nIn 1912, the El Comercio Spanish-language newspaper began publication, and in 1916, the Heraldo Dominical Spanish-language newspaper began publication. In 1922 the trilingual ''[[La Gaceta (Tampa)|La Gaceta]]'' began publication, founded by Victoriano Manteiga, a former ''[[History of Ybor City#El Lector|lector]]'' in the cigar factories.\n\n=== Growth and changes ===\n[[Eugene Holtsinger]] and [[Alfred Swann]] arrived in Tampa in 1905. The town of Fort Brooke was annexed in 1907.\n\n====Florida Land Boom====\n[[File:TampaFranklinStreetNorth.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A view north along Franklin Street,  1922.]]In 1921, a [[Tampa Bay Hurricane of 1921|hurricane]] hit Tampa for the first time since 1848. Despite this, the 1920s saw the [[Florida Land Boom]].\n\nDuring this time, [[Davis Islands (Tampa)|Davis Islands]], two man-made islands, were built by developer and Tampa native [[D. P. Davis]]. After the bubble burst, in 1926, the Tampa Municipal Hospital on Davis Islands was opened, now [[Tampa General Hospital]].\n\nIn 1924, the [[Gandy Bridge]] to St. Petersburg was built.

Also in 1925, the Municipal Auditorium was built and Tampa annexed the neighboring town of West Tampa. This approximately doubled the size and population of the city.\n\n==== Depression ====\nAs the market for cigars began to wane during the [[Great Depression]], other industries came to the fore, especially shipping and, of course, tourism. In 1931, there was a [[Tampa cigar makers' strike of 1931|strike]] of cigar workers.\n\nBy 1929, Maas Brothers dominated Florida's West Coast. It was known as \"Greater Tampa's Greatest Store.\" The [[Flag of Tampa, Florida|flag of Tampa]] was adopted in 1930.\n\nThe Davis Causeway opened in 1934. The [[Colonnade (restaurant)|Colonnade]] restaurant was established in 1935.\n\n==== WW2 ====\nThe [[Fort Homer W. Hesterly Armory]] was built in the 1930s and dedicated the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor. During World War II, the [[Tampa Shipbuilding Company]] built several ships.

Suburban growth hollowed downtown as business deteriorated. Many industries began to move to outlying areas. The combination of the decline of the cigar industry and the construction of Interstates [[Interstate 4|4]] and [[Interstate 275 (Florida)|275]] further deteriorated historic areas such as Ybor City and West Tampa.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flheritage.com/services/magazine/index.cfm?action=article&season=06spring&article=50|title=Services \u2013 Office of Cultural & Historical Programs|author=[By Elaine C.

Most blacks lived in \"the Scrub\" (Tampa's [[Central Avenue (Tampa, Florida)|Central Avenue]] district), West Tampa, Ybor City, [[Dobyville]], and College Hill. According to Benjamin Mays' report ''A Study of Negro Life in Tampa'', the black population grew from 4,383 in 1900 to 23,323 in 1927. Businessman [[Moses White (activist)|Moses White]] was known as the \"Mayor of Central Avenue\". [[Ole Pete]] was supposed to live in Port Tampa.\n[[File:Jackson Rooming House Tampa.jpg|thumb|160px|Jackson Rooming House]]\n\nThe [[Jackson Rooming House]], the area's only boarding house for blacks,  was built in the Scrub in 1901.  In 1908, [[Clara C. Frye]] opened a hospital for black patients in her home, assisted by Mack Winton. Her dining room table was the [[operating table]].\n\nA building was secured in 1923 and was purchased by the City of Tampa in 1928. The Clara Frye Memorial Hospital that existed in West Tampa from 1938 to 1967 was named after her. The Tampa Municipal Hospital did not admit black patients until the 1950s.\n\nIn 1922, [[Garfield Devoe Rogers Sr.]] helped start the Central Life Insurance Company, which sold policies to blacks. In 1938, [[Blanche Armwood]] became the first black woman in Florida to graduate from an accredited law school. Black Cuban Francisco Rodriguez became a lawyer in 1951. In 1952, the NAACP moved its state headquarters to Tampa, and educator Edward Daniel Davis was president of Central Life Insurance Company.\n\nIn 1919, William W. Andrews opened the ''[[Florida Sentinel]]'' newspaper office in Jacksonville. The office was closed during the Depression. In 1945, General Andrews's son, C. Blythe Andrews, re-opened the ''Florida Sentinel'' on Central Avenue. In 1959, he bought the ''Tampa Bulletin'' newspaper, and merged the two newspapers to make the ''Florida Sentinel Bulletin''. In 1962, the newspaper office was moved to Ybor City.<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/PhotoFullSize.asp?PhotoID=67579 Florida Sentinel Bulletin Marker] (photo).</ref> The [[C.

Jackson founded the Tampa Civic Association in 1911. In 1923, Elizabeth Dortsch Barnard was the town's first female postmaster.  In 1926, the [[Junior League]] of Tampa was founded.\n\n===Mafia===\n[[File:Bolita balls.jpg|right|thumb|200px| A set of bolita balls on display at the Ybor City State Museum.]]\nBeginning in the late 19th century, illegal [[bolita]] lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes, especially in Ybor City.\n\n==== Charlie Wall ====\nIn the early 1920s, this small-time operation was taken over by [[Charlie Wall]], whose father was the town's former mayor and a pioneer in yellow fever research, [[John Perry Wall]], and whose mother was a McKay.\n\nWall's operations thrived as he expanded them to include liquor distribution and speakeasies (this was the era of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) and prostitution. Other smaller [[organized crime]] groups tried to muscle in on the action, and long-simmering rivalries were kindled.\n\nThese organizations were able to operate openly because of kick-backs and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials. Wall was well-connected, and he used those connections to keep his businesses running and put down his competition. Tampa's political elite, which had held an inconsistent but mostly ambivalent attitude toward organized crime, quietly became de facto partners.\n\n==== Trafficantes and the Era of Blood ====\n{{see also|Trafficante crime family}}\nWhile Charlie Wall was Tampa's first major crime boss, various factions vied for control of the area in later years. Ongoing power struggles resulted in regular organized-crime related \"unsolved\" murders of crime-connected figures in what became known as the \"Era of Blood\". To protect their interests (and keep gangland killings unsolved), crime bosses regularly kept local officials \u2013 from state attorneys to top law enforcement personnel and even mayors \u2013 on the payroll.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deitche |first=Scott |url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/the_mob/Content?oid=317 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; Cover &#124; The Mob |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113104959/http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/the_mob/Content?oid=317 |archivedate=2009-01-13 }}</ref>\n[[File:Santo Trafficante, Jr.jpg|thumb|130px|Santo Trafficante, Jr. mugshot]]\nThe first Italian gang in the Tampa Bay area was created by the Sicilian [[Ignacio Antinori]] in 1925.

The first widespread example was Tampa's mayoral election of 1931, when over 100 people were arrested for \"cheating at the polls\". Most were supporters of the winning candidate, Robert E. Lee Chancey, who his opponents claimed had close ties to Tampa's \"underworld\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{Harvnb|Kerstein|2001}}</ref> After the election, all of the charges were either reduced or dropped altogether. Many of those involved had been on the city payroll at the time of their arrest, and most remained there.\n \nThe situation was even more chaotic during the next election cycle in 1935. This started before election day when Tampa's chief of police (who supported the incumbent mayor) and the Hillsborough County Sheriff (who supported the challenger) both claimed to be the proper authority to monitor the actual voting. Anticipating trouble, [[David Sholtz|Florida Governor Sholtz]] mobilized the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] to prevent violence. Still, both sheriff's officers and city police were deployed at polling places, resulting in police officers arresting sheriff's deputies and vice versa.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nDespite (or perhaps because of) the large number of observers, [[ballot stuffing]] and re-voting was widespread. The day may have turned violent if not for the presence of the National Guard troops and a sideswipe from the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]], which passed just west of Tampa during the afternoon and pelted the area with torrential rains and high winds.\n\nIn the end, the Tampa Election Board determined that Chancey had easily won re-election. They had reached these results by throwing out all ballots from 29 precincts due to \"fraudulent voting\". The Board may not have been the most impartial judge of the matter, however, as Chancey had appointed the members himself.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\n====Reforms====\n\n[[File:SenatorKefauver(D-TN).jpg|thumb|130px|Estes Kefauver]]\nThe era of rampant and open corruption came to a head in the early 1950s when the [[Kefauver hearings]], [[Estes Kefauver|Senator Estes Kefauver's]] traveling investigation of organized crime in America, came to town. Informants (including the retired Charlie Wall) came forward to make startling accusations of corruption throughout Tampa's power structure. The hearings were followed by misconduct trials of several local officials and the \"unsolved\" murders of some of the government informants (including the retired Charlie Wall).<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nThough most of the accused persons were acquitted or given light sentences, the trials helped to motivate Tampa to end the corruption and general sense of lawlessness which had prevailed for decades. Ethics and election reforms were passed, and the link between local government and organized crime weakened.\n\nHowever, major corruption was not eliminated entirely. In 1983, 3 out of the 5 members of the [[Hillsborough County, Florida#Government|Hillsborough County Commission]] were charged with accepting bribes. Unlike earlier crooked officials, however, these three were convicted of their crimes and sentenced to federal prison. This scandal resulted in another round of ethics reforms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deeson |first=Mike |url=http://www.tampabays10.com/news/local/article.aspx?storyid=73000 |title=Public Corruption Arrests 25 years later |publisher=Tampabays10.com |date=1983-02-01 |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\nThe first [[Sports in the Tampa Bay area|athletic]] venue in Tampa was [[Plant Field]], a race track and field built by Plant in 1899. In 1908 the YMCA opened.\n\n[[Curtis Hixon Hall]] opened in 1965, named for former mayor [[Curtis Hixon]], hosted basketball, boxing matches, and concerts.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Skatepark of Tampa]] was completed.\n\n====Football====\nIn 1926, [[Jim Thorpe]] led the barnstorming [[Tampa Cardinals]] against [[Red Grange]] and the [[Chicago Bears]] in the first professional football game in Tampa. The next venue after Plant Field was [[Phillips Field (Florida)|Phillips Field]], which hosted the University of Tampa football team, and was the site of the [[Cigar Bowl]].\n[[File:Tampa Stadium1.jpg|thumb|Tampa Stadium]]\nIn 1967, [[Tampa Stadium]] was built. Tampa was chosen for a team as part of the [[National Football League]]'s expansion after the AFL/NFL merger in 1970, and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] had their first season in 1976, as members of the [[AFC West]] division. The following year, the Bucs were moved to the [[NFC Central]].\n\nThe team was the worst in the league until 1979, with a brief period of success from 1979 to 1982 with a defense led by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Lee Roy Selmon]]. The team was again the worst in the league from 1983 to 1996, until they hired Hall of Fame coach [[Tony Dungy]] who pioneered the [[Tampa 2]] defense. In 1998, the team moved to [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nIn 2002, the Bucs moved to the [[NFC South]], and under head coach [[Jon Gruden]] the team won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]]. Tampa hosted [[Super Bowl]]s [[Super Bowl XVIII|XVIII]], [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]], and [[Super Bowl XXXV|XXXV]]. Super Bowl [[Super Bowl XLIII|XLIII]] was hosted in Tampa, and [[Super Bowl LV|LV]] is scheduled to be. Tampa also hosts the [[Outback Bowl]]. There also used to be the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]] of the [[United States Football League]], coached by [[Steve Spurrier]], and the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] of the [[Arena Football League]]. \"The War on I-4\" refers to both the Tampa-Orlando rivalry in [[War on I-4 (arena football)|arena football]] and [[South Florida\u2013UCF rivalry|college football]].\n\n====Baseball====\nIn 1913, the [[Chicago Cubs]] moved their [[spring training]] site to the city of Tampa. The original [[minor league baseball]] team in Tampa was the [[Tampa Smokers]], established in 1919 as a charter member of the [[Florida State League]].\n[[File:Al Lopez Field entrance.JPG|thumb|Al Lopez Field]]\nThe [[New York Yankees]] train in Tampa at [[George M. Steinbrenner Field]], formerly Legends Field, which is the home of the [[Tampa Tarpons]]. [[Al Lopez Field]] used to be in West Tampa, named for Hall of Famer and Tampa native [[Al Lopez]]. Lopez's home is now the [[Tampa Baseball Museum]]. USF baseball used to play at [[Red McEwen Field]].\n\nIn 1998, Tampa got a [[Major League Baseball]] team, the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], which plays at [[Tropicana Field]]. Hall of Famer [[Wade Boggs]] grew up in Tampa, as did [[Tony La Russa]], [[Lou Piniella]], [[Tino Martinez]], [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]], [[Doc Gooden]], and [[Gary Sheffield]].\n\nThe Devil Rays changed their name to the Rays in 2008. [[USF Baseball Stadium]] opened in 2011. .\n\n====Basketball====\nUSF basketball plays at the [[Yuengling Center]], formerly the Sun Dome.\n\n====Hockey====\n\nThe [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] of the [[National Hockey League]] formed in 1992, and plays at [[Amalie Arena]], formerly the Ice Palace and St. Pete Times Forum. The Lightning won the [[Stanley Cup]] in 2004.\n\n==== Soccer ====\nThere used to be the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u201393)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]].\n\n====Tennis====\n\nFrom 1979 to 1990, Tampa hosted the [[Eckerd Open]].\n\n====Golf====\n\nGarfield Rogers built [[Rogers Park, Tampa|Rogers Park]], the first [[golf course]] for blacks in Tampa. In 1974, the City of Tampa took over [[Babe Zaharias]]'s golf course in the [[Forest Hills (Tampa)|Forest Hills]] neighborhood.\n\n==21st century==\n[[The Stovall]] was built in 2001. The [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] programming language conference was held in Tampa in 2001. The [[Florida Museum of Photographic Arts]] also started in 2001. The American Victory Ship & Museum with [[SS American Victory]] started in 2003.  The [[MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre|Ford Amphitheater]], and [[Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Tampa]] in [[Tampa Indian Reservation]], also opened in 2004.\n\n===2002 plane crash===\nOn January 5, 2002, just four months after the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], 15-year-old amateur pilot [[Charles Bishop (pilot)|Charles Bishop]] [[2002 Tampa plane crash|crashed]] a [[Cessna]] plane into the Bank of America Plaza. Bishop died, but there were no other injuries (because the crash occurred on a Saturday, when few people were in the building). A [[suicide]] note found in the wreckage expressed support for [[Osama bin Laden]]. Bishop had been taking a [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medicine for [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] called [[Accutane]] that may have had the [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side effect]] of [[clinical depression|depression]] or severe psychosis. His family later sued Hoffman-La Roche, the company that makes Accutane, for $70 million; however, an autopsy found no traces of the drug in the teenager's system.\n\n===2004 hurricane season===\nThe [[2004 Atlantic Hurricane Season]] was historically busy for all of Florida, including Tampa. Tampa's [[Climate of the Tampa Bay area|climate]] was affected by a record four hurricanes that year; [[Hurricane Frances|Frances]], [[Hurricane Jeanne|Jeanne]], [[Hurricane Charley|Charley]], and to a lesser extent, [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]].\n\nThe eyes of both Jeanne and Frances passed within a few miles of Tampa as they slashed their way across the state from the east coast. Charley was forecast to make a direct hit on Tampa Bay from the south (the worst-case scenario for local flooding). But the storm made a sudden and unexpected turn to the northeast and brought only tropical storm force winds to Tampa, devastating the [[Ft. Myers]]/[[Port Charlotte, Florida|Port Charlotte]] area instead. Ivan roared past the Florida gulf coast on its way to landfall near the [[Alabama]]/[[Florida]] border, passing near enough to bring high seas and stormy conditions to the Tampa area.\n\n===Downtown revitalization===\n[[File:Tampa Channelside.JPG|thumb|right|Luxury condos are rising in the former warehouse district of [[Channel District, Tampa, Florida|Channelside]], downtown Tampa]]\n\nFormer Tampa mayor [[Pam Iorio]] made the redevelopment of downtown a priority and focused on bringing residents into the decidedly non-residential area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/08/10/Floridian/Urban_culture_clash.shtml |title=Floridian: Urban culture clash |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-16}}</ref> Several residential and mixed-development high-rises were planned and constructed. [[The Alagon on Bayshore]] was built in 2006. The [[Towers of Channelside]] and [[SkyPoint]] were finished in 2007. [[Element (Tampa)|Element]] was built in 2009.\n\n====Riverwalk====\nAnother of Mayor Iorio's initiatives was to improve the Tampa Riverwalk. The development plan expanded use of the land along the Hillsborough River in downtown, where Tampa was first established. The [[Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park]] opened in 2010, next to the Riverwalk and the former site of Curtis Hixon Hall. [[Water Works Park (Tampa, Florida)|Water Works Park]] opened in 2014.\n\n=====Museums=====\nSeveral museums were part of the plan, including the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts, which relocated in 2006, the [[Tampa Bay History Center]], which began in 2009; the Tampa Children's Museum, which relocated in 2010 and was renamed the Glazer Children's Museum, the Tampa Museum of Art, which relocated in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A52700 |title=Creative Loafing Tampa &#124; News &#124; Downtowns On The Verge |publisher=Tampa.creativeloafing.com |accessdate=2010-05-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423004825/http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A52700 |archivedate=2009-04-23 }}</ref>\n\nTampa Mayor [[Bob Buckhorn]] has continued the development and redevelopment focused work. The [[2012 Republican National Convention]] was held in Tampa\n\n=====Historical monuments=====\nIn 2012, commissions for six bronze busts of prominent figures from the history of Tampa put on the Riverwalk, sculpted by [[Steven Dickey]]. They included Mocoso, Tocobaga, and Pohoy mound builders; James McKay Sr.; Vicente Martinez Ybor; Henry B. Plant; Eleanor McWilliams Chamberlain; and Clara C.
