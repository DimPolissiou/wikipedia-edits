George along with his friends Shambu ([[Shabareesh Varma]]) and Koya (Krishna Shankar), often follow Mary around in an attempt to talk to her but he is afraid of her father who beats up boys pestering his daughter. Nonetheless, every time he gathers the courage to talk to her, something or the other comes up and George ends up disappointed. He is eventually heartbroken to know that Mary is in a relationship with another boy, also named George. The seriousness of life finally sinks in when George, Shambu, and Koya introspect about their academic future after a dismal performance in their year-end examination.\n\nFive years later, in 2005, George and his friends enroll in college. One day, while on a ragging streak, George and his friends meet Malar ([[Sai Pallavi]]), a new lecturer in their college, who happens to be [[Tamilian]]. George instantly falls for her and seemingly gets her to feel the same about him. Convinced that they are in love with each other, he extends their relationship and contemplates marriage. Simultaneously, George's college teacher, Vimal Sir ([[Vinay Forrt]]) also falls for her and tries to woo her with the help of his friend, a [[physical training|PT]] teacher ([[Soubin Shahir]]). Later that year, Malar goes to visit her family in [[Kodaikanal]], accompanied by her cousin, Arivazhagan ([[Ananth Nag (Tamil actor)|Ananth Nag]]). Weeks later, it is announced in the college that Malar met with an accident and consequently had left her job at the lecture. George and his friends immediately ride to Kodaikanal to see Malar. Malar lost part of her memory due to the injuries suffered in the accident. She fails to recognize George and is not able to recall her relationship with him. Subsequently, Malar gets married to her cousin, Arivazhagan and George attends her wedding reception with his friends.\n\nIn 2014, George, now 30, runs a cafe, with his childhood friend Jojo (Willson Joseph). George meets 22-year-old Celine (Madonna Sebastian) in his cafe and feels an affinity towards her, not knowing that she is the same little girl who used to walk home from school with Mary every day. Despite the age difference, George decides to propose to Celine, but she is about to get engaged to a man named Roney Varghese (Alphonse Putharen), who is a cocaine addict and continuously insults Celine, which results in the engagement being called off. Roney's obsessive behavior in pestering Celine upsets George, who in response teams up with his friends and beats up Roney. \n\nFinally, George marries Celine. During their wedding reception, Malar arrives with her husband.  Celine called Malar herself. Even though Malar had regained her memory, she did not reveal to George as George was happy with Celine and she needed to let things be the way they were.\n\n== Cast == \n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Nivin Pauly]] as George David\n* [[Madonna Sebastian]] as Celine George \n* [[Sai Pallavi]] as Malar \n* [[Anupama Parameswaran]] as Mary George\n* [[Shabareesh Varma]] as Shambu\n* [[Krishna Shankar]] as Koya\n* Eva Prakash as young Celine\n* [[Vinay Forrt]] as Vimal \"Java\" Sir \n* [[Soubin Shahir]] as P.T.

George along with his friends Shambu ([[Shabareesh Varma]]) and Koya (Krishna Shankar), often follow Mary around in an attempt to talk to her but he is afraid of her father who beats up boys pestering his daughter. Nonetheless, every time he gathers the courage to talk to her, something or the other comes up and George ends up disappointed. He is eventually heartbroken to know that Mary is in a relationship with another boy, also named George. The seriousness of life finally sinks in when George, Shambu, and Koya introspect about their academic future after a dismal performance in their year-end examination.\n\nFive years later, in 2005, George and his friends enroll in college. One day, while on a ragging streak, George and his friends meet Malar ([[Sai Pallavi]]), a new lecturer in their college, who happens to be [[Tamilian]]. George instantly falls for her and seemingly gets her to feel the same about him. Convinced that they are in love with each other, he extends their relationship and contemplates marriage. Simultaneously, George's college teacher, Vimal Sir ([[Vinay Forrt]]) also falls for her and tries to woo her with the help of his friend, a [[physical training|PT]] teacher ([[Soubin Shahir]]). Later that year, Malar goes to visit her family in [[Kodaikanal]], accompanied by her cousin, Arivazhagan ([[Ananth Nag (Tamil actor)|Ananth Nag]]). Weeks later, it is announced in the college that Malar met with an accident and consequently had left her job at the lecture. George and his friends immediately ride to Kodaikanal to see Malar. Malar lost part of her memory due to the injuries suffered in the accident. She fails to recognize George and can't able to recall her relationship with him. Subsequently, Malar gets married to her cousin, Arivazhagan and George attends her wedding reception with his friends.\n\nIn 2014, George, now 30, runs a cafe, with his childhood friend Jojo (Willson Joseph). George meets 22-year-old Celine (Madonna Sebastian) in his cafe and feels an affinity towards her, not knowing that she is the same little girl who used to walk home from school with Mary every day. Despite the age difference, George decides to propose to Celine, but she is about to get engaged to a man named Roney Varghese (Alphonse Putharen), who is a cocaine addict and continuously insults Celine, which results in the engagement being called off. Roney's obsessive behavior in pestering Celine upsets George, who in response teams up with his friends and beats up Roney. \n\nFinally, George marries Celine. During their wedding reception, Malar arrives with her husband.  Celine called Malar herself. Even though Malar had regained her memory, she did not reveal to George as George was happy with Celine and she needed to let things be the way they were.\n\n== Cast == \n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Nivin Pauly]] as George David\n* [[Madonna Sebastian]] as Celine George \n* [[Sai Pallavi]] as Malar \n* [[Anupama Parameswaran]] as Mary George\n* [[Shabareesh Varma]] as Shambu\n* [[Krishna Shankar]] as Koya\n* Eva Prakash as young Celine\n* [[Vinay Forrt]] as Vimal \"Java\" Sir \n* [[Soubin Shahir]] as P.T.

Although the procedure benefits some patients, regular medical complications have also been reported by different sources. According to ''Journal of Surgical Oncology'', \"The overall complication rate was 9.38% (seroma\u2009=\u20092, hematoma\u2009=\u20091, cellulitis\u2009=\u20092, wound dehiscence\u2009=\u20093, and operating room take back\u2009=\u20091)\".<ref>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jso.25465   Journal of Surgical Oncology: Outcomes analysis of Goldilocks mastectomy and breast reconstruction: A single institution experience of 96 cases  (Arif Chaudhry MD, Jeremie D.

To organize this group as a set it can first be coded as the [[Tuple|quadruple]] ({0,1},+,&minus;,0), which in turn can be coded using one of several conventions as a set representing that quadruple, which in turn entails encoding the operations + and &minus; and the constant 0 as sets.\n\nSets may include ordered denotation of the particular identities and operations that apply to them, indicating a group, abelian group, ring, field, or other mathematical object. These types of mathematical objects are commonly studied in [[abstract algebra]].\n\n==Foundational paradoxes==\nIf, however, the goal of mathematical ontology is taken to be the internal consistency of mathematics, it is more important that mathematical objects be definable in some uniform way (for example, as sets) regardless of actual practice, in order to lay bare the [[essence]] of its [[paradox]]es.  This has been the viewpoint taken by [[foundations of mathematics]], which has traditionally accorded the management of paradox higher priority than the faithful reflection of the details of mathematical practice as a justification for defining mathematical objects to be sets.\n\nMuch of the tension created by this foundational identification of mathematical objects with sets can be relieved without unduly compromising the goals of foundations by allowing two kinds of objects into the mathematical universe, sets and [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s, without requiring that either be considered merely an instance of the other.
