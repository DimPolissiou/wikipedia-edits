A granite obelisk now marks the original site of the cottage in Great Ayton. The obelisk is constructed from granite taken from [[Point Hicks]], the first land sighted by Cook in Australia.

A statue on High Green depicts James Cook at the age of 16 looking towards [[Staithes]] where, according to tradition, he first felt the lure of the sea.  The sculpture was commissioned by Hambleton District Council and is the work of sculptor Nicholas Dimbleby.

The Cleveland Dyke, a narrow band of hard [[whinstone]] rock that runs for about 31 miles between [[Robin Hood's Bay]] and [[Eaglescliffe]] lies to the north-east of the village.\n\n== Governance ==\nAn [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] of the same name exists.

The [[Cook's Cottage|Cook family home]] on Bridge Street was built by James' father in 1755. The cottage was dismantled in 1934 to be shipped to [[Australia]].  Each stone was numbered so that the cottage could be reconstructed exactly in its new home in the [[Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne|Fitzroy Gardens]] in [[Melbourne]].  A granite obelisk now marks the original site of the cottage in Great Ayton. The obelisk is constructed from granite taken from [[Point Hicks]], the first land sighted by Cook in Australia.  The Captain Cook Schoolroom Museum is within a former [[charity school]], founded in 1704 by landowner Michael Postgate.  James Cook received his early education here from 1736 to 1740. A statue on High Green depicts James Cook at the age of 16 looking towards [[Staithes]] where, according to tradition, he first felt the lure of the sea.  The sculpture was commissioned by Hambleton District Council and is the work of sculptor Nicholas Dimbleby. It was unveiled on 12 May 1997.\n\nIn the parish of Little Ayton high on [[Easby Moor]] is [[Easby Moor#Captain Cook's Monument|Captain Cook's Monument]] a {{convert|51|ft|m|abbr=on}} high [[obelisk]] and visible for miles around.  It was constructed from local sandstone and was erected in 1827.\n\n{{gallery |align=center\n|File:\"Capt.

Meanwhile, just two days prior to the airing of the event, AMPAS and ABC came under fire for rejecting a commercial for Frida Mom which depicted a [[postpartum]] mother changing her own, [[nocturnal enuresis|visibly wet]], absorbent pad in the middle of the night; the academy felt it was too graphic to air during the telecast, citing guidelines laid out in AMPAS that state that, among other items, \"feminine hygiene products (and) adult diapers\" could not be advertised on the telecast. The rejection sparked outrage from women's groups and from [[Busy Philipps]], who posted the rejected ad on her [[Instagram]] account. Ratings wise, this telecast would average at least 23.6 million viewers and a 5.3 rating among the key ad-sales demo of adults 18\u201349, down 20 percent year-over-year in viewers and 31 percent in adults 18\u201349.\n|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/culture/movies/2018/08/08/oscars-add-popular-film-category-sets-earlier-2020-date|title=Oscars add popular film category, sets earlier 2020 date|website=Boston.com|first=Lindsey|last=Bahr|date=August 8, 2018|accessdate=January 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://www.huffpost.com/entry/frida-mom-postpartum-ad-rejected-oscars-abc_l_5e3dcbedc5b6bb0ffc10df29 \"Mothers Push Back After Frida Mom Postpartum Ad Rejected By Oscars\"] from Huffington Post (February 7, 2020)</ref><br><ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-wins-two-oscars-irishman-leaves-empty-handed-1277795 \"Netflix Wins Two Oscars, 'The Irishman' Leaves Empty-Handed\"] from The Hollywood Reporter (February 10, 2020)</ref><ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/oscars-hit-all-time-low-tv-ratings-sunday-feb-9-2020-1278364 \"TV Ratings: Oscars Fall to All-Time Lows\"] from The Hollywood Reporter (February 10, 2020)</ref>\n|-\n! 11\n|''[[The Conners]]'' aired a special live episode the night of the [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]] on ABC, which incorporated voting results reported by [[ABC News]] as they became available into the storyline.

This led to the paradoxical situation that the Nubians were both \"detribalised\" yet had also a distinct identity intimately linked to the West Nile region, to Islam, and to military service.{{sfn|Leopold|2005|p=60}} Amin himself stated that members of different tribes could become Nubians.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}} }}\n\nAmin joined an Islamic school in [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]] in 1941.

Nyabire, a member of the [[Kakwa people|Kakwa ethnic group]], converted from [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to [[Islam]] in 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada. He named his first-born son after himself. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Idi Amin grew up with his mother's family in a rural farming town in north-western Uganda.
