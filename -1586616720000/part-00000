Fidel Castro was openly ambiguous about his beliefs at the time. Some orthodox historians argue Castro was a communist from the beginning with a long term plan; however, others have argued he had no strong ideological loyalties. [[Leslie Dewart]] has stated that there is no evidence to suggest Castro was ever a communist agent. Levine and Papasotiriou believe Castro believed in little outside of a distaste for American imperialism. As evidence for his lack of communist leanings they note his friendly relations with the [[United States]] shortly after the revolution and him not joining the Cuban Communist Party during the beginning of his [[Land reform in Cuba|land reforms]].<ref name=ideology></ref>\n\n===Women's roles===\n[[File:Ra\u00fal, Vilma, Jorge Risquet y Jos\u00e9 Nivaldo Causse.jpg|thumb|Ra\u00fal Castro, [[Vilma Esp\u00edn]], [[Jorge Risquet]] and Jos\u00e9 Nivaldo Causse in 1958]]\nThe importance of women's contributions to the Cuban Revolution is reflected in the very accomplishments that allowed the revolution to be successful, from the participation in the [[Moncada Barracks]], to the Mariana Grajales all-women's platoon that served as Fidel Castro's personal security detail.

Castro was joined by CIA connected [[Frank Sturgis]] who offered to train Castro's troops in guerrilla warfare. Castro accepted the offer, but he also had an immediate need for guns and ammunition, so Sturgis became a gunrunner. Sturgis purchased boatloads of weapons and ammunition from CIA weapons expert Samuel Cummings' International Armament Corporation in Alexandria, Virginia. Sturgis opened a training camp in the Sierra Maestra mountains, where he taught Che Guevara and other 26th of July Movement rebel soldiers guerrilla warfare.\n\nIn addition, poorly armed irregulars known as ''[[escopeteros]]'' harassed Batista's forces in the foothills and plains of [[Oriente Province]].

Fidel Castro was openly ambiguous about his beliefs at the time. Some orthodox historians argue Castro was a communist from the beginning with a long term plan; however, others have argued he had no strong ideological loyalties. [[Leslie Dewart]] has stated that there is no evidence to suggest Castro was ever a communist agent. Levine and Papasotiriou believe Castro believed in little outside of a distaste for American imperialism. As evidence for his lack of communist leanings they note his friendly relations with the [[United States]] shortly after the revolution and him not joining the Cuban Communist Party during the beginning of his [[Land reform in Cuba|land reforms]].<ref name=ideology></ref>\n\n===Women's roles===\n[[File:Ra\u00fal, Vilma, Jorge Risquet y Jos\u00e9 Nivaldo Causse.jpg|thumb|Ra\u00fal Castro, [[Vilma Esp\u00edn]], [[Jorge Risquet]] and Jos\u00e9 Nivaldo Causse in 1958]]\nThe importance of women's contributions to the Cuban Revolution is reflected in the very accomplishments that allowed the revolution to be successful, from the participation in the [[Moncada Barracks]], to the Mariana Grajales all-women's platoon that served as Fidel Castro's personal security detail.

His writings cover many subjects. including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[esthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], [[theatre]], [[music]], [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]], and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual [[lexicon]], as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.\n\nLittle is known about his life. Aristotle was born in the city of [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]] in [[Northern Greece]]. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined [[Plato's Academy]] in [[Athens]] and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]] 347 BC).{{sfn|Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.)}} Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] beginning in 343 BC.{{sfn|Russell| 1972}} He established a library in the [[Lyceum_(Classical)|Lyceum]] which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]]. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}}\n\nAristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl (reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]. Aristotle's influence on logic also continued well into the 19th century.\n\nHe influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\u20131400)|Islamic thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]], as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\" and among medieval Christians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] as simply \"The Philosopher\". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]], such as in the thinking of  [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Philippa Foot]].\n\n==Life==\n[[File:20160518 092 mieza nympheum.jpg | thumb | left | School of Aristotle in [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia, Greece]]]]\n\nIn general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.{{efn-ua | See{{harv|Shields|2012|pp=3\u201316}};{{harv|D\u00fcring|1957}} covers ancient biographies of Aristotle.}}\n\nAristotle, whose name means \"the best purpose\" in Ancient Greek,{{sfn|Campbell}}<!--better source desirable--> was born in 384&nbsp;BC in [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]], [[Chalcidice]], about 55&nbsp;km (34 miles) east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].{{sfn|McLeisch|1999|p=5}}{{sfn|Aristoteles-Park in Stagira}} His father [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]]. Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] became his guardian.{{sfn|Hall|2018|p=14}} Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Kingship and the royal court|Macedonian monarchy]].{{sfn|Anagnostopoulos|2013|page=4}}\n\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]].{{sfn|Blits|1999|pp=58\u201363}} He probably experienced the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, \"to experience is to learn\" [\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u0129\u03bd].{{sfn|Evans|2006}} Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47&nbsp;BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew [[Speusippus]], although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died.{{sfn|Aristotle|1984|pp=Introduction}} Aristotle then accompanied [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married [[Pythias]], either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].{{sfn|Shields|2016}}{{sfn|Russell|1972}}\n\n[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg | thumb | upright | [[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] (1st or 2nd century AD) copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]\n\nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]].{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58\u201359}} Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle's own attitude towards [[Persia]] was unabashedly [[Ethnocentricism|ethnocentric]]. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be \"a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants\".{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58\u201359}} By 335&nbsp;BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', he also had an ''[[eromenos|er\u00f4menos]]'', [[Palaephatus | Palaephatus of Abydus]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=88}}\n\nThis period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.{{sfn|Russell|1972}} He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to \"logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre.\"{{sfn|Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.)}}\n\nNear the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an [[Hagnothemis|unlikely claim]] made some six years after the death.{{sfn|Green|1991|p=460}} Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322&nbsp;BC, Demophilus and [[Eurymedon the Hierophant]] reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety,{{sfn|Filonik|2013|pp=72\u201373}} prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis | Chalcis, on Euboea]], at which occasion he was said to have stated: \"I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy\"{{sfn|Jones|1980|p=216}}{{sfn|Gigon|2017|p=41}}{{sfn|D\u00fcring|1957|p=T44a-e}} \u2013 a reference to Athens's [[Trial of Socrates|trial and execution of Socrates]].

The term \"logic\" he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the ''[[Organon]]'' around 40 BC by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]] or others among his followers.{{sfn| Pickover | 2009 | page=52}} The books are:\n# ''Categories''\n# ''On Interpretation''\n# ''Prior Analytics''\n# ''Posterior Analytics''\n# ''Topics''\n# ''On Sophistical Refutations''[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg | thumb | upright | [[Plato]] (left) and Aristotle in [[Raphael]]'s 1509 fresco, ''[[The School of Athens]]''. Aristotle holds his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and gestures to the earth, representing his view in immanent realism, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, indicating his Theory of Forms, and holds his ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.{{sfn| School of Athens}}{{sfn|Stewart|2019}}]]\n\nThe order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics''){{sfn| Prior Analytics | pp= 24b18\u201320}}{{sfn| Bobzien | 2015}} and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The ''Rhetoric'' is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the ''Topics''.{{sfn| Smith | 2017}}\n\n===Metaphysics===\n{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}\nThe word \"metaphysics\" appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name ''Metaphysics''.{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}} Aristotle called it \"first philosophy\", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (''theoretik\u0113'') philosophy which is \"theological\" and studies the divine. He wrote in his ''Metaphysics'' (1026a16):\n\n{{quote | if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge; but if there is some motionless independent thing, the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy, and it is universal ''in just this way'', because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1999 | page=111}}}}\n\n==== Substance ====\n{{see | Hylomorphism }}\n\nAristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] (''ousia'') and [[essence]] (''to ti \u00ean einai'', \"the what it was to be\") in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called [[hylomorphism]]. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1043a 10\u201330}}{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}\n\n===== Immanent realism =====\n[[File:Platonic and Aristotelian Forms.svg | thumb | upright=1.6 | [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of forms|forms]] exist as [[universals]], like the ideal form of an apple. For Aristotle, both matter and form belong to the individual thing ([[hylomorphism]]).]]\n{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}\nLike his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Problem of universals|universal]]. Aristotle's [[ontology]] places the universal (''katholou'') in [[particular]]s (''kath' hekaston''), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate.  For Aristotle, \"form\" is still what [[phenomena]] are based on, but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}\n\nPlato argued that all things have a [[Theory of forms|universal form]], which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}{{sfn| Lloyd | 1968 | pages=43\u201347}}\n\n===== Potentiality and actuality =====\n{{see | Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}\n\nWith regard to the change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' 319b\u2013320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:\n\n# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;\n# locomotion, which is change in space; and\n# alteration, which is change in quality.\n\n[[File:Flute-player dolphin Alcesti Group MAN.jpg | thumb | Aristotle argued that a capability like playing the flute could be acquired \u2013 [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|the potential made actual]] \u2013 by learning.]]\n\nThe coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if it is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate \u2013 being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise \u2013 acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}\n\n{{quote | For that for the sake of which (''to hou heneka'') a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=IX 1050a 5\u201310}}}}\n\nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to [[Plato]] there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1045a\u2013b}}\n\n===Epistemology===\nAristotle's immanent realism means his [[epistemology]] is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.{{sfn|Smith|2017}} Aristotle uses [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from examples alongside [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], whereas Plato relies on deduction from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.{{sfn|Smith|2017}}\n\n==Natural philosophy==\n\nAristotle's \"natural philosophy\" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} In Aristotle's terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.{{sfn|Wildberg|2016}}\n\n===Physics===\n[[File:Four Classical Elements in Burning Log.svg | thumb | The four [[classical element]]s (fire, air, water, earth) of [[Empedocles]] and Aristotle illustrated with a burning log.

In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], the divine substance of the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]], stars and planets.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1968 | pages=133\u201339, 166\u201369}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[Classical element|Aristotle's elements]]{{sfn|Lloyd|1968|pages=133\u201339, 166\u201369}}\n!

In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also; in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest,{{sfn| Allain | 2016}}{{efn-ua | Rhett Allain notes that [[Newton's First Law]] is \"essentially a direct reply to Aristotle, that the natural state is ''not to change'' motion.{{sfn| Allain | 2016}}}} since Aristotle does not address [[friction]].{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60\u201384}} With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}{{efn-ua | Leonard Susskind comments that Aristotle had clearly never gone [[ice skating]] or he would have seen that it takes force to stop an object.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}}} This would imply the equation{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}\n\n:: <math>F=mv</math>,\n\nincorrect in modern physics.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}\n\nNatural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens,{{efn-ua | For heavenly bodies like the Sun, Moon, and stars, the observed motions are \"to a very good approximation\" circular around the Earth's centre, (for example, the apparent rotation of the sky because of the rotation of the Earth, and the rotation of the moon around the Earth) as Aristotle stated.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23\u201340}}}} while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23\u201340}}{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60\u201384}}{{efn-ua | Drabkin quotes numerous passages from ''Physics'' and ''On the Heavens'' (''De Caelo'') which state Aristotle's laws of motion.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60\u201384}}}}\n\n[[File:Aristotle's laws of motion.svg | thumb | upright=1.5 | Aristotle's laws of motion.

[[John Philoponus]] (in the [[Middle Ages]]) and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} A contrary opinion is given by [[Carlo Rovelli]], who argues that Aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the [[Earth]]'s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23\u201340}}), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}{{efn-ua | Philoponus and Galileo correctly objected that for the transient phase (still increasing in speed) with heavy objects falling a short distance, the law does not apply: Galileo used balls on a short incline to show this. Rovelli notes that \"Two heavy balls with the same shape and different weight do fall at different speeds from an aeroplane, confirming Aristotle's theory, not Galileo's.\"{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23\u201340}}}}\n\nNewton's \"forced\" motion corresponds to Aristotle's \"violent\" motion with its external agent, but Aristotle's assumption that the agent's effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower's hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval [[theory of impetus]].{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23\u201340}}\n\n====Four causes====\n{{main | Four causes}}\n[[File:Aristotle's Four Causes of a Table.svg | thumb | upright=1.6 | Aristotle argued by analogy with woodwork that a thing takes its form from [[four causes]]: in the case of a table, the wood used ([[material cause]]), its design ([[formal cause]]), the tools and techniques used ([[efficient cause]]), and its decorative or practical purpose ([[final cause]]).{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=88\u201390}}]]\n\nAristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors. His term ''aitia'' is traditionally translated as \"cause\", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as \"explanation\", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}}{{sfn| Hankinson | 1998 | page=159}}\n* [[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood. It is not about action. It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}}\n* The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}}\n* The [[efficient cause]] is \"the primary source\", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of \"cause\" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. In the case of two dominoes, when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}} In the case of animals, this agency is a combination of [[developmental biology|how it develops from the egg]], and [[physiology|how its body functions]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91\u201392, 369\u201373}}\n* The [[final cause]] (''telos'') is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}} In the case of living things, it implies [[adaptation]] to a particular way of life.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91\u201392, 369\u201373}}\n\n====Optics====\n{{further | History of optics}}\n\nAristotle describes experiments in [[optics]] using a [[camera obscura]] in ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]]'', book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small [[aperture]] that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun's image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.{{sfn| Lahanas}}\n\n====Chance and spontaneity====\n{{further | Accident (philosophy)}}\n\nAccording to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental things]], \"from what is spontaneous\". There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names \"luck\", that only applies to people's moral choices.{{sfn| Physics | p=2.6}}{{sfn| Miller | 1973 | pp=204\u201313}}\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{further | History of astronomy}}\n\nIn [[astronomy]], Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of \"those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,\" pointing out correctly that if \"the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.\"{{sfn| Meteorology | p=1. 8}}\n\n[[File:DenglerSW-Stromboli-20040928-1230x800.jpg | thumb | Aristotle noted that the ground level of the [[Aeolian islands]] changed before a [[volcanic eruption]].]]\n\n===Geology===\n{{further | History of geology}}\n\nAristotle was one of the first people to record any [[geology|geological]] observations.

He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of [[Lesbos]] and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=14}}{{sfn| Thompson | 1910 | page=Prefatory Note}} His data in ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', ''[[Movement of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'' are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=196, 248}} His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on [[botany]] have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived.{{sfn| Day | 2013 | pp=5805\u201316}}\n\nAristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and the catches of fishermen. He describes the [[catfish]], [[electric ray]], and [[frogfish]] in detail, as well as [[cephalopod]]s such as the [[octopus]] and [[paper nautilus]]. His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=66\u201374, 137}} He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of [[ruminant]]s,{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=118\u201319}} and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=73}}\n\nHe notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function, so, among birds, the [[heron]], which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish, has a long neck and long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas [[duck]]s that swim have short legs and webbed feet.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=135\u201336}} [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of [[evolution]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=206}} Aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridizations]] could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles's materialist theory of a \"survival of the fittest\" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results.{{sfn| Sedley | 2007 | page=189}} To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a [[common descent|common ancestor]], or that one kind can [[speciation|change into another]], or that kinds can become [[extinction|extinct]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=273}}\n\n====Scientific style====\n[[File:Two of Aristotle's Growth Laws.svg | thumb | left | upright=1.4 | Aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals, including that [[brood size]] decreases with body mass, whereas [[gestation]] period increases. He was correct in these predictions, at least for mammals: data are shown for mouse and elephant.]]\n\nAristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense.{{sfn| Taylor | 1922 | page=42}} He used the ancient Greek term ''pepeiramenoi'' to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=361\u201365}} In ''Generation of Animals'', he finds a fertilized hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside.{{sfn| Leroi | 2011}}{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=197\u2013200}}\n\nInstead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=365\u201368}}{{sfn| Taylor | 1922 | page=49}} This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as [[genomics]]. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=365\u201368}}\n\nFrom the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of [[biological rules|rules]] relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=408}}{{-}}\n\n====Classification of living things====\n{{further | Scala naturae}}\n[[File:Scyliorhinus retifer embryo.JPG | thumb | Aristotle recorded that the [[embryo]] of [[Mustelus canis|<!--a different species shown-->a dogfish]] was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the [[yolk sac]]), like a higher animal; this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=72\u201374}}]]\n\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of [[animal]]s,{{sfn| Bergstrom | Dugatkin | 2012 | page=35}}{{sfn| Rhodes | 1974 | page=7}} arranging these in the ''History of Animals'' in a graded scale of perfection, a ''[[scala naturae]]'', with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave [[viviparity|live birth]] to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above [[plant]]s, and these in turn were above minerals.{{sfn| Mayr | 1982 | pages=201\u201302}} see also:{{sfn| Lovejoy | 1976}} He grouped what the modern zoologist would call [[vertebrate]]s as the hotter \"animals with blood\", and below them the colder [[invertebrate]]s as \"animals without blood\". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing ([[mammal]]s), and the egg-laying ([[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]]). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled \u2013 cephalopods, and [[crustacea|shelled]]) and the hard-shelled [[mollusc]]s ([[bivalve]]s and [[gastropod]]s). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a [[placenta]] like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle,<!--Leroi | p= 113--> is [[convergent evolution]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=111\u201319}} He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this [[teleological]] view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | pp=43\u201344}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|+ Aristotle's ''[[Scala naturae]]'' (highest to lowest)\n!

Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the ''[[Nous#Aristotle|nous]]'' (intellect) and ''logos'' (reason).{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=156\u201363}}\n\nFor Aristotle, the soul is the [[Hylomorphism#Body\u2013soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).{{sfn| Shields | 2016}} In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | p=45}} Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].{{sfn| Guthrie | 2010 | p=348}}\n\n====Memory====\n\nAccording to Aristotle in ''On the Soul'', memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=12}} In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian '[[common sense]]', and thinking.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=61}}{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=16}}\n\nAristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=25}}\n\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=30}} Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=25}} Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression.{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=19}} Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=296}}\n\n[[File:Aristotle Senses Perception Memory Dreams Action.svg | thumb | upright=2.3 | Senses, perception, memory, dreams, action in Aristotle's psychology. Impressions are stored in the [[sensorium]] (the heart), linked by his [[laws of association]] (similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]]).]]\n\nAristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], described in his [[laws of association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=259}}{{sfn | Sorabji | 2006 | p=54}}\n\n====Dreams====\n{{see | Dream#Classical history}}\n\nAristotle describes sleep in ''On Sleep and Wakefulness''.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} or of digestion,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} so it is vital to the body.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep,{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} albeit differently,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} unless they are weary.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}}\n\nDreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169\u201381}} During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} In ''De Anima'' iii 3, Aristotle ascribes the ability to create, to store, and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination, ''phantasia''.{{sfn| Shields | 2016}}\n\nOne component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences.{{sfn| Webb | 1990 | pages=174\u201384}} Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169\u201381}}\n\n==Practical philosophy==\n\nAristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" align=right style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|+ Virtues and their accompanying vices{{sfn|Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.)}}\n!

In Aristotelian philosophy, the abolition of what he considers \"[[natural slavery]]\" would undermine civic [[freedom]]. The pursuit of freedom is inseparable from pursuing mastery over \"those who deserve to be slaves\". According to ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle's Politics'' the targets of this aggressive warfare were non-Greeks, noting Aristotle's view that \"our poets say 'it is proper for Greeks to rule non-Greeks'\".{{sfn|Deslauriers|Destr\u00e9e|2013|pp=157-162}}\n\nAristotle generally has a favourable opinion of war, extolling it as a chance for [[virtue]] and writing that \"the leisure that accompanies peace\" tends to make people \"arrogant\". War to \"avoid becoming enslaved to others\" is justified as self-defense. He writes that war \"compels people to be just and temperate\", however, in order to be just \"war must be chosen for the sake of peace\" (with the exception of wars of aggression discussed above).{{sfn|Deslauriers|Destr\u00e9e|2013|pp=157-162}}\n\n===Ethics===\n\n{{main | Aristotelian ethics}}\n\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.{{sfn| Kraut | 2001}}\n\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuch\u0113]]'' (''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency{{sfn| Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.)}}) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''\u0113thik\u0113'' ''[[arete (moral virtue)|aret\u0113]]''), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | ps= &nbsp;Book I. See for example chapter 7.}}\n\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | p= Book VI}}\n\n===Politics===\n\n{{main | Politics (Aristotle)}}\n\nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\".{{sfn| Politics | pp=1253a19\u201324}} He also famously stated that \"man is by nature a political animal\" and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality.{{sfn| Aristotle | 2009 | pages=320\u201321}} Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.{{sfn| Ebenstein | Ebenstein | 2002 | page=59}}\n\n[[File:Aristotle's constitutions.svg | thumb|upright=1.7 | Aristotle's classifications of political constitutions]]\n\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (''koin\u014dnia'')<!-- (1252a1) -->. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability<!-- (1280b29\u201331) -->, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together<!-- (1281a1\u20133) -->.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences.\"{{efn-ua | For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, Karl (1957) \"Aristotle Discovers the Economy\" in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed.

And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.{{sfn| Hutchinson | Johnson | 2015 | p=22}}}}\n\n===Economics===\n{{main | Politics (Aristotle)}}\n\nAristotle made substantial contributions to [[economics|economic thought]], especially to thought in the Middle Ages.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20\u201324}} In ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', Aristotle addresses the city, [[property]], and [[trade]]. His response to criticisms of [[private property]], in [[Lionel Robbins]]'s view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall [[utility]] of social arrangements.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20\u201324}} Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from [[human nature]]. In ''Politics'', Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of [[money]].{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20\u201324}} Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or [[silver]].{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16\u201328}}\n\nAristotle's discussions on [[retail]] and [[interest]] was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16\u201328}}\n\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them \"commensurable\".{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16\u201328}} He goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, \"if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it\".{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16\u201328}}\n\n===Rhetoric and poetics===\n[[File:B\u00e9nigne Gagneraux, The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods.jpg | thumb | upright=1.3 | ''The Blind Oedipus Commending his Children to the Gods'' (1784) by [[B\u00e9nigne Gagneraux]]. In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle uses the tragedy ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus Tyrannus]]'' by [[Sophocles]] as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured, with a generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous, but loses everything through some ''[[hamartia]]'' (fault).{{sfn| Kaufmann | 1968 | pages=56\u201360}}]]\n{{main | Rhetoric (Aristotle) | Poetics (Aristotle)}}\n\nAristotle's ''Rhetoric'' proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: ''[[ethos]]'' (an appeal to the speaker's character), ''[[pathos]]'' (an appeal to the audience's emotion), and ''[[logos]]'' (an appeal to logical reasoning).{{sfn| Garver | 1994 | pages=109\u201310}} He also categorizes rhetoric into three genres: [[epideictic]] (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), [[Forensic rhetoric|forensic]] (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue).{{sfn| Rorty | 1996 | pages=3\u20137}} Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical [[Proof (truth)|proofs]]: ''[[enthymeme]]'' (proof by [[syllogism]]) and ''[[paradeigma]]'' (proof by example).{{sfn| Grimaldi | 1998 | p=71}}\n\nAristotle writes in his ''Poetics'' that [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb | dithyrambic poetry]], painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of ''[[mimesis]]'' (\"imitation\"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152\u201359}}{{sfn| Poetics | p= I 1447a}} He applies the term ''mimesis'' both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152\u201359}} and contends that the audience's realisation of the ''mimesis'' is vital to understanding the work itself.{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152\u201359}} Aristotle states that ''mimesis'' is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152\u201359}}{{sfn| Poetics | p= IV}} and that all human artistry \"follows the pattern of nature\".{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152\u201359}} Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what [[Stephen Halliwell (academic)|Stephen Halliwell]] calls \"highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.\"{{sfn| Halliwell | 2002 | pp=152\u201359}} For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation \u2013 through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.{{sfn| Poetics | p=III}}\n\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' originally comprised two books \u2013 one on comedy and one on tragedy \u2013 only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.{{sfn| Poetics | p=VI}} The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.{{sfn| Poetics | p=XXVI}} Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].{{sfn| Aesop | 1998 | pages=Introduction, xi\u2013xii}}\n\n===Views on women===\n{{main | Aristotle's views on women}}\n{{further | Aristotle's biology#Inheritance}}\n\nAristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element.

Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?\"{{sfn| Plutarch | 1919 | p= Part 1, 7:7}}\n\n===On Hellenistic science===\n{{details | Ancient Greek medicine}}\n\nAfter Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work.

Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to \"discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]\", rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.}}{{sfn| House | 1956 | page=35}} Aristotle's \"lost\" works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication, the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication.{{sfn| Irwin | Fine | 1996 | pp= xi\u2013xii }}{{sfn| Barnes | 1995 | p=12}} [[Cicero]]'s description of Aristotle's literary style as \"a river of gold\" must have applied to the published works, not the surviving notes.{{efn-ua | \"''veniet flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles''\", (Google translation: \"Aristotle will come pouring forth a golden stream of eloquence\").{{sfn| Cicero | 1874}}}} A major question in the history of Aristotle's works is how the exoteric writings were all lost, and how the ones we now possess came to us.{{sfn| Barnes | Griffin | 1999 | pages=1\u201369}} The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.{{sfn| Anagnostopoulos | 2013 | page=16}}{{sfn| Barnes | 1995 | pp=10\u201315}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Depictions===\n;Paintings\n\nAristotle has been depicted by major artists including [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]],{{sfn| Lucas Cranach the Elder}} [[Justus van Gent]], [[Raphael]], [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]],{{sfn| Lee | Robinson | 2005}} [[Rembrandt]],{{sfn| Aristotle with Bust | 2002}} and [[Francesco Hayez]] over the centuries.

Ingemar D\u00fcring, ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'', G\u00f6teborg, 1957,{{p.|253}}}} was a Greek [[philosopher]] and [[polymath]] during the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] in [[Ancient Greece]]. Taught by [[Plato]], he was the founder of the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], the [[Peripatetic school]] of philosophy, and the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tradition. His writings cover many subjects. including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[biology]], [[zoology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], [[ethics]], [[esthetics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], [[theatre]], [[music]], [[rhetoric]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]], and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual [[lexicon]], as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.\n\nLittle is known about his life. Aristotle was born in the city of [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]] in [[Northern Greece]]. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined [[Plato's Academy]] in [[Athens]] and remained there until the age of thirty-seven ([[Circa|c.]] 347 BC).{{sfn|Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.)}} Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored [[Alexander the Great]] beginning in 343 BC.{{sfn|Russell| 1972}} He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]]. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=9}}\n\nAristotle's views on [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]]. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl (reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[John Buridan]]. Aristotle's influence on logic also continued well into the 19th century.\n\nHe influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800\u20131400)|Islamic thought]] during the [[Middle Ages]], as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\" and among medieval Christians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] as simply \"The Philosopher\". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]], such as in the thinking of  [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Philippa Foot]].\n\n==Life==\n[[File:20160518 092 mieza nympheum.jpg | thumb | left | School of Aristotle in [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia, Greece]]]]\n\nIn general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.{{efn-ua | See{{harv|Shields|2012|pp=3\u201316}};{{harv|D\u00fcring|1957}} covers ancient biographies of Aristotle.}}\n\nAristotle, whose name means \"the best purpose\" in Ancient Greek,{{sfn|Campbell}}<!--better source desirable--> was born in 384&nbsp;BC in [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]], [[Chalcidice]], about 55&nbsp;km (34 miles) east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].{{sfn|McLeisch|1999|p=5}}{{sfn|Aristoteles-Park in Stagira}} His father [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]]. Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and [[Proxenus of Atarneus]] became his guardian.{{sfn|Hall|2018|p=14}} Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Kingship and the royal court|Macedonian monarchy]].{{sfn|Anagnostopoulos|2013|page=4}}\n\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]].{{sfn|Blits|1999|pp=58\u201363}} He probably experienced the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the Eleusinian Mysteries, \"to experience is to learn\" [\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03bd \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u0129\u03bd].{{sfn|Evans|2006}} Aristotle remained in Athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47&nbsp;BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew [[Speusippus]], although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died.{{sfn|Aristotle|1984|pp=Introduction}} Aristotle then accompanied [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married [[Pythias]], either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]].{{sfn|Shields|2016}}{{sfn|Russell|1972}}\n\n[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg | thumb | upright | [[Bust (sculpture)|Portrait bust]] of Aristotle; an [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] (1st or 2nd century AD) copy of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]\n\nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]].{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58\u201359}} Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle's own attitude towards [[Persia]] was unabashedly [[Ethnocentricism|ethnocentric]]. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be \"a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants\".{{sfn|Green|1991|pp=58\u201359}} By 335&nbsp;BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', he also had an ''[[eromenos|er\u00f4menos]]'', [[Palaephatus | Palaephatus of Abydus]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=88}}\n\nThis period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.{{sfn|Russell|1972}} He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to \"logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre.\"{{sfn|Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.)}}\n\nNear the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an [[Hagnothemis|unlikely claim]] made some six years after the death.{{sfn|Green|1991|p=460}} Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322&nbsp;BC, Demophilus and [[Eurymedon the Hierophant]] reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety,{{sfn|Filonik|2013|pp=72\u201373}} prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis | Chalcis, on Euboea]], at which occasion he was said to have stated: \"I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy\"{{sfn|Jones|1980|p=216}}{{sfn|Gigon|2017|p=41}}{{sfn|D\u00fcring|1957|p=T44a-e}} \u2013 a reference to Athens's [[Trial of Socrates|trial and execution of Socrates]].

The term \"logic\" he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the ''[[Organon]]'' around 40 BC by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]] or others among his followers.{{sfn| Pickover | 2009 | page=52}} The books are:\n# ''Categories''\n# ''On Interpretation''\n# ''Prior Analytics''\n# ''Posterior Analytics''\n# ''Topics''\n# ''On Sophistical Refutations''[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg | thumb | upright | [[Plato]] (left) and Aristotle in [[Raphael]]'s 1509 fresco, ''[[The School of Athens]]''.

It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics''){{sfn| Prior Analytics | pp= 24b18\u201320}}{{sfn| Bobzien | 2015}} and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The ''Rhetoric'' is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the ''Topics''.{{sfn| Smith | 2017}}\n\n===Metaphysics===\n{{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}\nThe word \"metaphysics\" appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name ''Metaphysics''.{{sfn| Cohen | 2000}} Aristotle called it \"first philosophy\", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (''theoretik\u0113'') philosophy which is \"theological\" and studies the divine. He wrote in his ''Metaphysics'' (1026a16):\n\n{{quote | if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge; but if there is some motionless independent thing, the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy, and it is universal ''in just this way'', because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1999 | page=111}}}}\n\n==== Substance ====\n{{see | Hylomorphism }}\n\nAristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] (''ousia'') and [[essence]] (''to ti \u00ean einai'', \"the what it was to be\") in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called [[hylomorphism]]. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1043a 10\u201330}}{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}\n\n===== Immanent realism =====\n[[File:Platonic and Aristotelian Forms.svg | thumb | upright=1.6 | [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of forms|forms]] exist as [[universals]], like the ideal form of an apple. For Aristotle, both matter and form belong to the individual thing ([[hylomorphism]]).]]\n{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}\nLike his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Problem of universals|universal]]. Aristotle's [[ontology]] places the universal (''katholou'') in [[particular]]s (''kath' hekaston''), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate.  For Aristotle, \"form\" is still what [[phenomena]] are based on, but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}\n\nPlato argued that all things have a [[Theory of forms|universal form]], which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}{{sfn| Lloyd | 1968 | pages=43\u201347}}\n\n===== Potentiality and actuality =====\n{{see | Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}\n\nWith regard to the change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' 319b\u2013320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:\n\n# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;\n# locomotion, which is change in space; and\n# alteration, which is change in quality.\n\n[[File:Flute-player dolphin Alcesti Group MAN.jpg | thumb | Aristotle argued that a capability like playing the flute could be acquired \u2013 [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|the potential made actual]] \u2013 by learning.]]\n\nThe coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if it is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate \u2013 being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise \u2013 acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}\n\n{{quote | For that for the sake of which (''to hou heneka'') a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=IX 1050a 5\u201310}}}}\n\nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to [[Plato]] there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.{{sfn| Cohen | 2016}}{{sfn| Metaphysics | p=VIII 1045a\u2013b}}\n\n===Epistemology===\nAristotle's immanent realism means his [[epistemology]] is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these.{{sfn|Smith|2017}} Aristotle uses [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from examples alongside [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], whereas Plato relies on deduction from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles.{{sfn|Smith|2017}}\n\n==Natural philosophy==\n\nAristotle's \"natural philosophy\" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} In Aristotle's terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.{{sfn|Wildberg|2016}}\n\n===Physics===\n[[File:Four Classical Elements in Burning Log.svg | thumb | The four [[classical element]]s (fire, air, water, earth) of [[Empedocles]] and Aristotle illustrated with a burning log.

In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], the divine substance of the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]], stars and planets.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1968 | pages=133\u201339, 166\u201369}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ [[Classical element|Aristotle's elements]]{{sfn|Lloyd|1968|pages=133\u201339, 166\u201369}}\n!

In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also; in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest,{{sfn| Allain | 2016}}{{efn-ua | Rhett Allain notes that [[Newton's First Law]] is \"essentially a direct reply to Aristotle, that the natural state is ''not to change'' motion.{{sfn| Allain | 2016}}}} since Aristotle does not address [[friction]].{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60\u201384}} With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}{{efn-ua | Leonard Susskind comments that Aristotle had clearly never gone [[ice skating]] or he would have seen that it takes force to stop an object.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}}} This would imply the equation{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}\n\n:: <math>F=mv</math>,\n\nincorrect in modern physics.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}\n\nNatural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens,{{efn-ua | For heavenly bodies like the Sun, Moon, and stars, the observed motions are \"to a very good approximation\" circular around the Earth's centre, (for example, the apparent rotation of the sky because of the rotation of the Earth, and the rotation of the moon around the Earth) as Aristotle stated.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23\u201340}}}} while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23\u201340}}{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60\u201384}}{{efn-ua | Drabkin quotes numerous passages from ''Physics'' and ''On the Heavens'' (''De Caelo'') which state Aristotle's laws of motion.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60\u201384}}}}\n\n[[File:Aristotle's laws of motion.svg | thumb | upright=1.5 | Aristotle's laws of motion.

Henri Carteron held the \"extreme view\"{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60\u201384}} that Aristotle's concept of force was basically qualitative,{{sfn| Carteron | 1923 | pages=1\u201332 and passim}} but other authors reject this.{{sfn| Drabkin | 1938 | pp=60\u201384}}\n\n[[Archimedes]] corrected Aristotle's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they [[Archimedes' principle|displace enough water]]; floating depends in Archimedes' scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not as Aristotle thought its elementary composition.{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23\u201340}}\n\nAristotle's writings on motion remained influential until the [[Early Modern]] period. [[John Philoponus]] (in the [[Middle Ages]]) and [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}} A contrary opinion is given by [[Carlo Rovelli]], who argues that Aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the [[Earth]]'s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not{{sfn| Rovelli | 2015 | pp=23\u201340}}), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.{{sfn| Susskind | 2011}}{{efn-ua | Philoponus and Galileo correctly objected that for the transient phase (still increasing in speed) with heavy objects falling a short distance, the law does not apply: Galileo used balls on a short incline to show this.

His term ''aitia'' is traditionally translated as \"cause\", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as \"explanation\", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}}{{sfn| Hankinson | 1998 | page=159}}\n* [[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed.

It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}}\n* The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells us what a thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}}\n* The [[efficient cause]] is \"the primary source\", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of \"cause\" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. In the case of two dominoes, when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}} In the case of animals, this agency is a combination of [[developmental biology|how it develops from the egg]], and [[physiology|how its body functions]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91\u201392, 369\u201373}}\n* The [[final cause]] (''telos'') is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition.{{sfn| Lloyd | 1996 | pages=96\u2013100, 106\u201307}} In the case of living things, it implies [[adaptation]] to a particular way of life.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=91\u201392, 369\u201373}}\n\n====Optics====\n{{further | History of optics}}\n\nAristotle describes experiments in [[optics]] using a [[camera obscura]] in ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]]'', book 15.

He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.{{sfn| Lahanas}}\n\n====Chance and spontaneity====\n{{further | Accident (philosophy)}}\n\nAccording to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental things]], \"from what is spontaneous\".

His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=66\u201374, 137}} He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of [[ruminant]]s,{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=118\u201319}} and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=73}}\n\nHe notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function, so, among birds, the [[heron]], which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish, has a long neck and long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas [[duck]]s that swim have short legs and webbed feet.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=135\u201336}} [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of [[evolution]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=206}} Aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridizations]] could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles's materialist theory of a \"survival of the fittest\" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results.{{sfn| Sedley | 2007 | page=189}} To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a [[common descent|common ancestor]], or that one kind can [[speciation|change into another]], or that kinds can become [[extinction|extinct]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=273}}\n\n====Scientific style====\n[[File:Two of Aristotle's Growth Laws.svg | thumb | left | upright=1.4 | Aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals, including that [[brood size]] decreases with body mass, whereas [[gestation]] period increases. He was correct in these predictions, at least for mammals: data are shown for mouse and elephant.]]\n\nAristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense.{{sfn| Taylor | 1922 | page=42}} He used the ancient Greek term ''pepeiramenoi'' to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=361\u201365}} In ''Generation of Animals'', he finds a fertilized hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside.{{sfn| Leroi | 2011}}{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=197\u2013200}}\n\nInstead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=365\u201368}}{{sfn| Taylor | 1922 | page=49}} This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as [[genomics]]. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=365\u201368}}\n\nFrom the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of [[biological rules|rules]] relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | page=408}}{{-}}\n\n====Classification of living things====\n{{further | Scala naturae}}\n[[File:Scyliorhinus retifer embryo.JPG | thumb | Aristotle recorded that the [[embryo]] of [[Mustelus canis|<!--a different species shown-->a dogfish]] was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the [[yolk sac]]), like a higher animal; this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest.{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=72\u201374}}]]\n\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of [[animal]]s,{{sfn| Bergstrom | Dugatkin | 2012 | page=35}}{{sfn| Rhodes | 1974 | page=7}} arranging these in the ''History of Animals'' in a graded scale of perfection, a ''[[scala naturae]]'', with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave [[viviparity|live birth]] to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above [[plant]]s, and these in turn were above minerals.{{sfn| Mayr | 1982 | pages=201\u201302}} see also:{{sfn| Lovejoy | 1976}} He grouped what the modern zoologist would call [[vertebrate]]s as the hotter \"animals with blood\", and below them the colder [[invertebrate]]s as \"animals without blood\". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing ([[mammal]]s), and the egg-laying ([[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]]). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled \u2013 cephalopods, and [[crustacea|shelled]]) and the hard-shelled [[mollusc]]s ([[bivalve]]s and [[gastropod]]s). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a [[placenta]] like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle,<!--Leroi | p= 113--> is [[convergent evolution]].{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=111\u201319}} He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this [[teleological]] view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | pp=43\u201344}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|+ Aristotle's ''[[Scala naturae]]'' (highest to lowest)\n!

Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the ''[[Nous#Aristotle|nous]]'' (intellect) and ''logos'' (reason).{{sfn| Leroi | 2015 | pages=156\u201363}}\n\nFor Aristotle, the soul is the [[Hylomorphism#Body\u2013soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).{{sfn| Shields | 2016}} In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.{{sfn| Mason | 1979 | p=45}} Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].{{sfn| Guthrie | 2010 | p=348}}\n\n====Memory====\n\nAccording to Aristotle in ''On the Soul'', memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=12}} In other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian '[[common sense]]', and thinking.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=61}}{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=16}}\n\nAristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.{{sfn| Bloch | 2007 | p=25}}\n\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=30}} Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=25}} Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression.{{sfn| Carruthers | 2007 | p=19}} Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=296}}\n\n[[File:Aristotle Senses Perception Memory Dreams Action.svg | thumb | upright=2.3 | Senses, perception, memory, dreams, action in Aristotle's psychology. Impressions are stored in the [[sensorium]] (the heart), linked by his [[laws of association]] (similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]]).]]\n\nAristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and [[Contiguity (psychology)|contiguity]], described in his [[laws of association]]. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn| Warren | 1921 | p=259}}{{sfn | Sorabji | 2006 | p=54}}\n\n====Dreams====\n{{see | Dream#Classical history}}\n\nAristotle describes sleep in ''On Sleep and Wakefulness''.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} or of digestion,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} so it is vital to the body.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep,{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} albeit differently,{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} unless they are weary.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}}\n\nDreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored.{{sfn| Shute | 1941 | pages=115\u201318}} However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169\u201381}} During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.{{sfn| Holowchak | 1996 | pp=405\u201323}} In ''De Anima'' iii 3, Aristotle ascribes the ability to create, to store, and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination, ''phantasia''.{{sfn| Shields | 2016}}\n\nOne component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences.{{sfn| Webb | 1990 | pages=174\u201384}} Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.{{sfn| Modrak | 2009 | pp=169\u201381}}\n\n==Practical philosophy==\n\nAristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric.{{sfn| Wildberg | 2016}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" align=right style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|+ Virtues and their accompanying vices{{sfn|Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.)}}\n!

In Aristotelian philosophy, the abolition of what he considers \"[[natural slavery]]\" would undermine civic [[freedom]]. The pursuit of freedom is inseparable from pursuing mastery over \"those who deserve to be slaves\". According to ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle's Politics'' the targets of this aggressive warfare were non-Greeks, noting Aristotle's view that \"our poets say 'it is proper for Greeks to rule non-Greeks'\".{{sfn|Deslauriers|Destr\u00e9e|2013|pp=157-162}}\n\nAristotle generally has a favourable opinion of war, extolling it as a chance for [[virtue]] and writing that \"the leisure that accompanies peace\" tends to make people \"arrogant\". War to \"avoid becoming enslaved to others\" is justified as self-defense. He writes that war \"compels people to be just and temperate\", however, in order to be just \"war must be chosen for the sake of peace\" (with the exception of wars of aggression discussed above).{{sfn|Deslauriers|Destr\u00e9e|2013|pp=157-162}}\n\n===Ethics===\n\n{{main | Aristotelian ethics}}\n\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.{{sfn| Kraut | 2001}}\n\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuch\u0113]]'' (''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency{{sfn| Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.)}}) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''\u0113thik\u0113'' ''[[arete (moral virtue)|aret\u0113]]''), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | ps= &nbsp;Book I. See for example chapter 7.}}\n\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.{{sfn| Nicomachean Ethics | p= Book VI}}\n\n===Politics===\n\n{{main | Politics (Aristotle)}}\n\nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\".{{sfn| Politics | pp=1253a19\u201324}} He also famously stated that \"man is by nature a political animal\" and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality.{{sfn| Aristotle | 2009 | pages=320\u201321}} Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.{{sfn| Ebenstein | Ebenstein | 2002 | page=59}}\n\n[[File:Aristotle's constitutions.svg | thumb|upright=1.7 | Aristotle's classifications of political constitutions]]\n\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (''koin\u014dnia'')<!-- (1252a1) -->. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability<!-- (1280b29\u201331) -->, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together<!-- (1281a1\u20133) -->.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences.\"{{efn-ua | For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, Karl (1957) \"Aristotle Discovers the Economy\" in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78\u2013115.}}\n\nIn ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]'', the character 'Aristotle' states:{{sfn| Hutchinson | Johnson | 2015 | p=22}}\n\n{{quote | For we all agree that the most excellent man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.{{sfn| Hutchinson | Johnson | 2015 | p=22}}}}\n\n===Economics===\n{{main | Politics (Aristotle)}}\n\nAristotle made substantial contributions to [[economics|economic thought]], especially to thought in the Middle Ages.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20\u201324}} In ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', Aristotle addresses the city, [[property]], and [[trade]]. His response to criticisms of [[private property]], in [[Lionel Robbins]]'s view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall [[utility]] of social arrangements.{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20\u201324}} Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from [[human nature]]. In ''Politics'', Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of [[money]].{{sfn| Robbins | 2000 | pages=20\u201324}} Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or [[silver]].{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16\u201328}}\n\nAristotle's discussions on [[retail]] and [[interest]] was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a [[profit (economics)|profit]]. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.{{sfn| Aristotle | 1948 | pages=16\u201328}}\n\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement.

The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation \u2013 through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.{{sfn| Poetics | p=III}}\n\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' originally comprised two books \u2013 one on comedy and one on tragedy \u2013 only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.{{sfn| Poetics | p=VI}} The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.{{sfn| Poetics | p=XXVI}} Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].{{sfn| Aesop | 1998 | pages=Introduction, xi\u2013xii}}\n\n===Views on women===\n{{main | Aristotle's views on women}}\n{{further | Aristotle's biology#Inheritance}}\n\nAristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element.

Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?\"{{sfn| Plutarch | 1919 | p= Part 1, 7:7}}\n\n===On Hellenistic science===\n{{details | Ancient Greek medicine}}\n\nAfter Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work.

After the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] Thomas Aquinas wrote his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', working from Moerbeke's translations and calling Aristotle \"The Philosopher\",{{sfn|Aquinas|2013}} the demand for Aristotle's writings grew, and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn| Kuhn | 2018}} These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages.

The event was originally named the ''Nations Cup'' and opposed by FISA. In 2002 the name was changed to the ''World Rowing U23 Regatta'' and further changed to ''[[World Rowing U23 Championships]]'' in 2005.\n\n===World Rowing Coastal Championships===\nFirst held in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrowing.com/coastal/ |title=Coastal/Tour |website=Worldrowing.com |accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===World Rowing Indoor Championships===\nWorld Rowing, in partnership with Concept2, USRowing and the Erg Sprints organising committee of Alexandria, Virginia, USA, are pleased to announce the first World Rowing Indoor Championships to be staged in Alexandria from 17 to 18 February 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrowing.com/news/the-first-world-rowing-indoor-championships-announced |title=The first World Rowing Indoor Championships announced |website=Worldrowing.com |accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===World Rowing Masters Regatta===\nHeld since 1973, this event is for rowers 27 years of age or over.

Crews from [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[United States]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] took part in the 500 m race. Famous rowing champions raced, including [[Matthew Pinsent]], [[James Cracknell]], and [[Marcel Hacker]].\n\nEach team was made up of 13 rowers (5 women, 7 men, and a cox). Events were held in Women's Single Sculls, Men's Single Sculls, Women's Double Sculls, Men's Pairs, Women's Pairs and Men's Fours.

It is also responsible for running the qualification program to select the participants for the games.\n\n===World Rowing Cup===\n{{main|World Rowing Cup}}\nStarted in 1997, the World Cup comprises three regattas held in early Summer.\n\n===World Rowing Championships===\n{{main|World Rowing Championships}}\nA week-long regatta held every year.  During Olympic years, only non-Olympic boat classes race.\n\n===World Rowing Junior Championships===\n{{main|World Rowing Junior Championships}}\nRunning since 1967, the Junior Championships is for those who are under 18 by the end of the current calendar year.  During Olympic years it is held at the same time as the World Rowing Championships.\n\n===World Rowing Under 23 Championships===\n{{main|World Rowing U23 Championships}}\nFirst held in 1976, this regatta is for those too old for the Junior Championships but who do not turn 23 by the end of the current calendar year (previously categorised as ''Senior B'' by FISA). The event was originally named the ''Nations Cup'' and opposed by FISA. In 2002 the name was changed to the ''World Rowing U23 Regatta'' and further changed to ''[[World Rowing U23 Championships]]'' in 2005.\n\n===World Rowing Coastal Championships===\nFirst held in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrowing.com/coastal/ |title=Coastal/Tour |website=Worldrowing.com |accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===World Rowing Indoor Championships===\nWorld Rowing, in partnership with Concept2, USRowing and the Erg Sprints organising committee of Alexandria, Virginia, USA, are pleased to announce the first World Rowing Indoor Championships to be staged in Alexandria from 17 to 18 February 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldrowing.com/news/the-first-world-rowing-indoor-championships-announced |title=The first World Rowing Indoor Championships announced |website=Worldrowing.com |accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===World Rowing Masters Regatta===\nHeld since 1973, this event is for rowers 27 years of age or over.  Men and women compete in age categories ranging from \"A\" (27 to 35) to \"K\" (85 and older).  The largest annual international regatta, in 2013 it attracted approximately 3500 competitors who competed in 440 races over four days.   There are also events for mixed crews - where half the crew is men and half women (excluding cox). The 2010 regatta took place in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, 2011 in Poznan Poland, 2012 in Duisburg Germany, 2013 in Varese Italy, 2014 in Ballarat Australia, 2015 in Hazewinkel Belgium, 2016 in Copenhagen Denmark, e 2017 in Bled Slovenia, 2018 in Sarasota USA, and 2019 in Lake Valence Hungary.

The first (and only) event took place on the [[Serpentine (lake)|Serpentine Lake]] in [[Hyde Park, London]] and was sponsored by [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Crews from [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[United States]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] took part in the 500 m race. Famous rowing champions raced, including [[Matthew Pinsent]], [[James Cracknell]], and [[Marcel Hacker]].\n\nEach team was made up of 13 rowers (5 women, 7 men, and a cox). Events were held in Women's Single Sculls, Men's Single Sculls, Women's Double Sculls, Men's Pairs, Women's Pairs and Men's Fours.  These crews then combined to form Mixed Quad Sculls and Eights.\n\nGreat Britain were the eventual winners and crowned the ''Mercedes-Benz Sprints Champions''.\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{portal|Sports}}}}\n* [[Thomas Keller Medal]], awarded annually by FISA to a rower(s) with an outstanding international career\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.worldrowing.com}}\n\n{{International Sports Federations}}\n{{National members of the World Rowing Federation}}\n{{Rowing (sport)}}\n{{Rowing Competitions}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:World Rowing Federation| ]]\n[[Category:Rowing governing bodies]]\n[[Category:Sports organizations established in 1892]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Lausanne|Row]]\n[[Category:International sports bodies based in Switzerland|Row]]\n", "name_user": "46.126.72.238", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rowing_Federation"}

They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required.

[[Cryptography]] is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information. Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.\n\n====Databases====\n{{main|Database}}\n{{Missing information|a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.|date=September 2018}}\nA database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database model]]s and [[query language]]s.\n\n===Computer applications===\n\n====Computer graphics and visualization====\n{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}\nComputer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], and [[computational geometry]], and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and [[video game]]s.\n\n====Human\u2013computer interaction====\n{{main|Human\u2013computer interaction}}\nResearch that develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers, so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.\n\n====Scientific computing and simulation====\n[[Scientific computing]] (or [[computational science]]) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical models]] and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyze and solve [[Science|scientific]] problems. A major usage of scientific computing is [[simulation]] of various processes, including computational [[fluid dynamics]], physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE,<ref>Muhammad H. Rashid, 2016. SPICE for Power Electronics and Electric Power. CRC Press. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-1-4398-6047-2}}.</ref> as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs.

From its origins in [[cybernetics]] and in the [[History of artificial intelligence|Dartmouth Conference]] (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as [[applied mathematics]], [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]]. AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question \"Can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; text-align:center; margin:auto;\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|-\n| [[File:Nicolas P.

It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software\u2014it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal maintenance and arrangement.\n\n==Discoveries==\nThe philosopher of computing [[William J. Rapaport|Bill Rapaport]] noted three ''Great Insights of Computer Science'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|title=What Is Computation?|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|last = Rapaport|first = William J.|date = 20 September 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s, [[George Boole]]'s, [[Alan Turing]]'s, [[Claude Shannon]]'s, and [[Samuel Morse]]'s insight: there are only ''two objects'' that a computer has to deal with in order to represent \"anything\".{{refn |group=\"note\"|The word \"anything\" is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever (the [[Halting problem]]).}}\n:: All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as \"on/off\", \"magnetized/de-magnetized\", \"high-voltage/low-voltage\", etc.).\n{{see also|Digital physics}}\n* [[Alan Turing]]'s insight: there are only ''five actions'' that a computer has to perform in order to do \"anything\".\n:: Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:<ref>B.

Cengage Learning. p. 122. {{ISBN|0-538-47866-7}}.</ref>\n\n:: Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:\n::*''sequence'': first do this, then do that;\n::* '' selection'': IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;\n::* ''repetition'': WHILE such-and-such is the case, DO this.\n:: Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of [[goto]] (which means it is more elementary than [[structured programming]]).\n{{see also|Elementary function arithmetic#Friedman's grand conjecture}}\n\n==Programming paradigms==\n{{main|Programming paradigm}}\n\nProgramming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Common programming paradigms include:\n\n* [[Functional programming]], a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.<ref>Md. Rezaul Karim; Sridhar Alla; 2017. Scala and Spark for Big Data Analytics: Explore the concepts of functional programming, data streaming, and machine learning. Packt Publishing Ltd. p. 87. {{ISBN|978-1-78355-050-0}}.</ref>\n* [[Imperative programming]], a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.<ref>Lex Sheehan, 2017. Learning Functional Programming in Go: Change the way you approach your applications using functional programming in Go. Packt Publishing Ltd. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-1-78728-604-7}}.</ref> In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\n* [[Object-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.<ref>Evelio Padilla, 2015. Substation Automation Systems: Design and Implementation. Wiley. p. 245. {{ISBN|978-1-118-98730-8}}.</ref>\n\nMany languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Multi-Paradigm Programming Language |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |website=developer.mozilla.org |publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052407/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |archive-date=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Academia==\n{{further|List of computer science conferences|Category:Computer science journals}}\nConferences are important events for computer science research.

Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{main|Philosophy of computer science}}\nA number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science.

They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.\n\n===Computer systems===\n\n====Computer architecture and computer engineering====\n{{main|Computer architecture|Computer engineering}}\nComputer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.

AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question \"Can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; text-align:center; margin:auto;\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|-\n| [[File:Nicolas P.

Common programming paradigms include:\n\n* [[Functional programming]], a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.<ref>Md. Rezaul Karim; Sridhar Alla; 2017.

Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\n* [[Object-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.<ref>Evelio Padilla, 2015. Substation Automation Systems: Design and Implementation.

It has been superseded by [[X3D]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Is a 3D web more than just empty promises? |author= Paul Festa and John Borland |work=CNET News.com |date= May 19, 2005 |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,39199121,00.htm }}</ref>\n\n==WRL file format==\n\nVRML is a [[text file]] format where, e.g., [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] and edges for a 3D [[polygon]] can be specified along with the surface color, [[UV mapping|UV-mapped]] [[texture mapping|textures]], [[specularity|shininess]], [[transparency (optics)|transparency]], and so on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/VRML1.0/index.html |title=Version 1.0 Specification |publisher=Web3d.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martinreddy.net/gfx/3d/VRML.spec |title=VRML Version 1.0 Specification |date= |accessdate=2018-11-27}}</ref> [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] can be associated with [[graphic]]al components so that a [[web browser]] might fetch a webpage or a new VRML file from the [[Internet]] when the [[user (computing)|user]] clicks on the specific graphical component. [[Animation]]s, [[sound]]s, [[lighting]], and other aspects of the [[virtual world]] can interact with the user or may be triggered by external [[Event-driven programming|events]] such as [[timer]]s. A special Script Node allows the addition of [[Source code|program code]] (e.g., written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[ECMAScript]]) to a VRML file.\n\nVRML files are commonly called \"worlds\" and have the .wrl [[filename extension|extension]] (for example, island.wrl). VRML files are in [[plain text]] and generally compress well using [[gzip]], useful for transferring over the Internet more quickly (some gzip compressed files use the .wrz [[filename extension|extension]]). Many [[3D computer graphics software|3D modeling programs]] can save [[object (image processing)|objects]] and [[scenery|scenes]] in VRML format.\n\n==Standardization==\n\nThe [[Web3D Consortium]] has been formed to further the collective development of the format. VRML (and its successor, [[X3D]]), have been accepted as international standards by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).\n\nThe first version of VRML was specified in November 1994. This version was specified from, and very closely resembled, the [[Application Programming Interface|API]] and [[file format]] of the [[Open Inventor]] [[software component]], originally developed by [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]. Version 2.0 development was guided by the ad-hoc VRML Architecture Group (VAG).<ref name=\"Ando\">{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Hideyuki |last2=Kubota |first2=Akihiro |last3=Kiriyama |first3=Takashi |title=Study on the collaborative design process over the Internet: a case study on VRML 2.0 specification design |journal=Design Studies |date=July 1998 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=289\u2013308 |doi=10.1016/S0142-694X(98)00007-6 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142694X98000076 |accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref> A working draft was published in August 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs248-98-fall/Assignments/Assignment3/VRML2_Specification/ |title=VRML Version 2.0 Specification |date=1996-08-04 |accessdate=2018-11-27}}</ref>.

The current and functionally complete version is VRML97 (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997). VRML has now been superseded by [[X3D]] (ISO/IEC 19775-1).\n\n==Emergence, popularity, and rival technical upgrade==\n\nThe term VRML was coined by [[Dave Raggett]] in a paper called \u201cExtending WWW to support Platform Independent Virtual Reality\u201d<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/vrml/vrml.html |title=Extending WWW to support Platform Independent Virtual Reality |author=Dave Raggett |date=1994 |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}</ref> submitted to the [[World Wide Web Conference 1|First World Wide Web Conference]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www94.web.cern.ch/WWW94/ |title=First World Wide Web Conference |publisher=4.web.cern.ch |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> in 1994, and first discussed at the WWW94 VRML BOF established by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], where [[Mark Pesce]] presented the Labyrinth demo he developed with [[Tony Parisi (software developer)|Tony Parisi]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080302070914/http://mediamachines.com/management.php Media Machines Management]</ref> and [[Peter Kennard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingwork.com/peterk/ |title=Peter Kennard's page |publisher=Livingwork.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref> VRML was introduced to a wider audience in the [[SIGGRAPH]] Course, VRML: Using 3D to Surf the Web<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hardenbergh |first1=Jan |last2=Bell |first2=Gavin |last3=Pesce |first3=Mark |title=Course 12 - VRML: Using 3D to Surf the Web |date=August 1995 |publisher=[[ACM SIGGRAPH]]}}</ref> in August 1995.

Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.</ref>\n\nIn 1997, a new version of the format was finalized, as VRML97 (also known as VRML2 or VRML 2.0), and became an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard. VRML97 was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites such as \"CyberTown\", which offered 3D chat using Blaxxun Software. The format was championed by SGI's Cosmo Software; when SGI restructured in 1998, the division was sold to the [[VREAM|VREAM Division]] of [[Platinum Technology]], which was then taken over by [[Computer Associates]], which did not develop or distribute the software. To fill the void a variety of proprietary Web 3D formats emerged over the next few years, including [[Microsoft Chrome]] and [[Adobe Atmosphere]], neither of which is supported today. VRML's capabilities remained largely the same while realtime 3D graphics kept improving. The VRML Consortium changed its name to the Web3D Consortium, and began work on the successor to VRML\u2014[[X3D]].<ref>[http://www.siggraph.org/~rhyne/carto/3D/3D-geovrml.html A Commentary on GeoVRML]</ref>\n\nSGI ran a web site at vrml.sgi.com on which was hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called \"Floops\" who was a VRML character in a VRML world. Floops was a creation of a company called \"Protozoa\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biota.org/book/chbi/chbi2.htm |title=Floops general narrative |publisher=Biota.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspace.com/avatars/book/authorp/floplate.jpg |title=Floops in his first episode |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref>\n\nH-Anim is a standard for animated Humanoids, which is based around VRML, and later X3D. The initial version 1.0 of the H-Anim standard was scheduled for submission at the end of March 1998.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170106235009/http://h-anim.org/charter.html VRML Consortium Charter for Humanoid Animation Working Group]</ref>\n\nVRML provoked much interest but has never seen much serious widespread use.<ref>{{cite web |author=David Sabine |url=https://tumblr.davesabine.com/post/3690293814/what-is-was-vrml |title=What is (was) VRML?|author-link=David Sabine }}</ref> One reason for this may have been the lack of available [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]].<ref>[http://www.agocg.ac.uk/brief/vrml.htm Introduction to VRML]</ref> At the time of VRML's popularity, a majority of users, both business and personal, were using slow [[dial-up Internet access]].\n\nVRML experimentation was primarily in education and research where an open specification is most valued.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IBxnTBFJxIUC&printsec=frontcover&hl=pl#v=onepage&q&f=false Web-Based Control and Robotics Education, page 30]</ref> It has now been re-engineered as [[X3D]]. The [[MPEG-4]] Interactive Profile (ISO/IEC 14496) was based on VRML<ref>[http://www.extremetech.com/computing/77260-3d-online-browser-plugins-and-more/6?print 3D Online: Browser Plugins and More]</ref> (now on X3D), and X3D is largely backward-compatible with it. VRML is also widely used as a file format for interchange of 3D models, particularly from [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-matters43/index.html |title=XML Matters |publisher=Ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref>\n\nA free cross-platform runtime implementation of VRML is available in [[OpenVRML]]. Its libraries can be used to add both VRML and X3D support to applications, and a GTK+ plugin is available to render VRML/X3D worlds in web browsers.\n\nIn the 2000s, many companies like Bitmanagement improved the quality level of virtual effects in VRML to the quality level of [[DirectX]] 9.0c, but at the expense of using proprietary solutions. All main features like game modeling are already complete.

pronounced ''vermal'' or by its initials, originally\u2014before 1995\u2014known as the Virtual Reality Markup Language) is a standard [[file format]] for representing [[3-D computer graphics|3-dimensional]] (3D) interactive [[vector graphics]], designed particularly with the [[World Wide Web]] in mind. It has been superseded by [[X3D]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Is a 3D web more than just empty promises? |author= Paul Festa and John Borland |work=CNET News.com |date= May 19, 2005 |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,1000000097,39199121,00.htm }}</ref>\n\n==WRL file format==\n\nVRML is a [[text file]] format where, e.g., [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] and edges for a 3D [[polygon]] can be specified along with the surface color, [[UV mapping|UV-mapped]] [[texture mapping|textures]], [[specularity|shininess]], [[transparency (optics)|transparency]], and so on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/VRML1.0/index.html |title=Version 1.0 Specification |publisher=Web3d.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martinreddy.net/gfx/3d/VRML.spec |title=VRML Version 1.0 Specification |date= |accessdate=2018-11-27}}</ref> [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]] can be associated with [[graphic]]al components so that a [[web browser]] might fetch a webpage or a new VRML file from the [[Internet]] when the [[user (computing)|user]] clicks on the specific graphical component. [[Animation]]s, [[sound]]s, [[lighting]], and other aspects of the [[virtual world]] can interact with the user or may be triggered by external [[Event-driven programming|events]] such as [[timer]]s. A special Script Node allows the addition of [[Source code|program code]] (e.g., written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[ECMAScript]]) to a VRML file.\n\nVRML files are commonly called \"worlds\" and have the .wrl [[filename extension|extension]] (for example, island.wrl). VRML files are in [[plain text]] and generally compress well using [[gzip]], useful for transferring over the Internet more quickly (some gzip compressed files use the .wrz [[filename extension|extension]]). Many [[3D computer graphics software|3D modeling programs]] can save [[object (image processing)|objects]] and [[scenery|scenes]] in VRML format.\n\n==Standardization==\n\nThe [[Web3D Consortium]] has been formed to further the collective development of the format. VRML (and its successor, [[X3D]]), have been accepted as international standards by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).\n\nThe first version of VRML was specified in November 1994. This version was specified from, and very closely resembled, the [[Application Programming Interface|API]] and [[file format]] of the [[Open Inventor]] [[software component]], originally developed by [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]]. Version 2.0 development was guided by the ad-hoc VRML Architecture Group (VAG).<ref name=\"Ando\">{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Hideyuki |last2=Kubota |first2=Akihiro |last3=Kiriyama |first3=Takashi |title=Study on the collaborative design process over the Internet: a case study on VRML 2.0 specification design |journal=Design Studies |date=July 1998 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=289\u2013308 |doi=10.1016/S0142-694X(98)00007-6 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142694X98000076 |accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref> A working draft was published in August 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs248-98-fall/Assignments/Assignment3/VRML2_Specification/ |title=VRML Version 2.0 Specification |date=1996-08-04 |accessdate=2018-11-27}}</ref>.

VRML97 was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites such as \"CyberTown\", which offered 3D chat using Blaxxun Software. The format was championed by SGI's Cosmo Software; when SGI restructured in 1998, the division was sold to the [[VREAM|VREAM Division]] of [[Platinum Technology]], which was then taken over by [[Computer Associates]], which did not develop or distribute the software. To fill the void a variety of proprietary Web 3D formats emerged over the next few years, including [[Microsoft Chrome]] and [[Adobe Atmosphere]], neither of which is supported today. VRML's capabilities remained largely the same while realtime 3D graphics kept improving. The VRML Consortium changed its name to the Web3D Consortium, and began work on the successor to VRML\u2014[[X3D]].<ref>[http://www.siggraph.org/~rhyne/carto/3D/3D-geovrml.html A Commentary on GeoVRML]</ref>\n\nSGI ran a web site at vrml.sgi.com on which was hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called \"Floops\" who was a VRML character in a VRML world.

Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must also overcome several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers and host defenses. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.\n\nViral pathogenesis comprise of various factors: '''(1)''' transmission, entry and spread within the host, '''(2)''' [[tropism]], '''(3)''' virus virulence and disease mechanisms, '''(4)''' host factors and host defense.<ref name =\"sherris2014\">{{cite book |title =Sherris Medical Microbiology |chapter = Chapter 7 Viral Pathogenesis |edition =6 |editor1=Kenneth J Ryan |editor2=C George Ray |date =2014 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Mechanisms of infection==\nViruses need to establish infections in host cells in order to multiply. For infections to occur, the virus has to hijack host factors and evade the host immune response for safe replication. Viral replication frequently requires complex interactions between the virus and host factors that may result in deleterious effects in the host, which confers the virus its pathogenicity. \n\n===Important steps of a virus life cycle that shape pathogenesis:===\n[[File:Typical sites of virus entry into the body.png|thumb|300px|right|Typical sites of virus entry into the body: The first steps of viral infection is determined by the site at which the virus implants into the body.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells.

A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication. An individual who has a viral infection but does not display disease symptoms is known as a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]. \n\n===Damage caused by the virus===\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can either be [[lytic]] or [[Persistent infection|persistent]]. '''Lytic infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, lytic viruses are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 }}  </ref>  Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can induce oncogenic transformation of host cells. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" />\n\n===Damage caused by host immune system===\nSometimes, instead of cell death or cellular dysfunction caused by the virus, the host immune response can mediate disease and excessive [[inflammation]]. The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''. [[Molecular mimicry]] refers to an overlap in structural similarity between a viral [[antigen]] and a self-antigen. The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites. \n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name =\"patho\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Viral pathogenesis''' is the study of how [[virus]]es cause diseases in their target [[Host (biology)|host]]s, usually carried out at the cellular or molecular level.

It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Molecular Virology (Sixth Edition) |last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\nA viral infection does not always cause disease. A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication. An individual who has a viral infection but does not display disease symptoms is known as a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]. \n\n===Damage caused by the virus===\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can either be [[lytic]] or [[Persistent infection|persistent]]. '''Lytic infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, lytic viruses are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 }}  </ref>  Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can induce oncogenic transformation of host cells. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" />\n\n===Damage caused by host immune system===\nSometimes, instead of cell death or cellular dysfunction caused by the virus, the host immune response can mediate disease and excessive [[inflammation]]. The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''. [[Molecular mimicry]] refers to an overlap in structural similarity between a viral [[antigen]] and a self-antigen. The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites. \n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name =\"patho\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVirus factors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}

As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical to, property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].The law of property defines and classifies proprietary rights (for instance, as either real or personal), and determines the methods whereby they are acquired, lost and protected, as well as the consequences of their exercise and the limitations imposed.   \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] reconstitution as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]].  In the 17th and 18th century, the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] a group of academics wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. Following the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]] ,continued to operate as a separate legal system under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]] and the jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[Parliament of Great Britain|1800]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]].

'''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights in rem and rights in personam. Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action in rem there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref> \n\nIn Scots law, a personal right is that such as a [[contract]]<nowiki/>ual or [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]]<nowiki/>ual right against a single individual whereas a real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> Accordingly, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.\n\n== Property ==\nFurther distinctions are also made when classifying property in Scots law, again following Roman law principles. '''Heritable''' property includes land, any buildings and structures upon it and real rights in the land. M'''oveable''' property includes property which can actually be physically moved. Moveable property contains two further distinctions: '''corporeal''' moveables such as physical goods and furniture and '''incorporeal''' moveables such as rights in company shares or intellectual property rights such as [[Patent|patents]], [[Trademark|trade marks]] and [[Copyright|copyrights]]. \n\n=== Heritable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=====Feudal law=====\nThe [[feudal]] system lingered on in Scots law on land ownership, so that a [[landowner]] as a ''[[vassal]]'' still had obligations to a ''[[feudal superior]]'' including payment of ''[[feu duty]]''. This enabled developers to impose [[Eternity|perpetual]] conditions dictating how buildings had to be constructed and maintained, but added complications and became abused to demand payments from ''vassals'' who wanted to make minor changes. In 1974 legislation began a process of redeeming ''feu duties'' so that most of these payments were ended. A major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) commenced on 28 November 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref>\n\nAgreement on an offer for property purchase is a legally binding contract, resulting in a system of [[conveyancing]] where buyers get their [[surveying|survey]] done before making a bid to the seller's solicitor, and after a closing date for [[Bidding|bid]]s the seller's acceptance is binding on both parties, preventing [[gazump]]ing. In recent times sales of house by way of offering to sell to the first party to make an unconditional offer of a fixed price has eroded the traditional ''offers over'' system.

As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical to, property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].The law of property defines and classifies proprietary rights (for instance, as either real or personal), and determines the methods whereby they are acquired, lost and protected, as well as the consequences of their exercise and the limitations imposed.   \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] reconstitution as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]].  In the 17th and 18th century, the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] a group of academics wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. Following the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]] ,continued to operate as a separate legal system under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]] and the jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[Parliament of Great Britain|1800]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999. so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Subject Matter of Property Rights ==\n\n=== Real Rights and Personal Rights ===\nA fundamental distinction in Scots law is that of '''personal rights''' and '''real rights,''' which follows the Roman law classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which the authoritative works of Barry Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights in rem and rights in personam. Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action in rem there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref> \n\nIn Scots law, a personal right is that such as a [[contract]]<nowiki/>ual or [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]]<nowiki/>ual right against a single individual whereas a real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> Accordingly, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.\n\n== Property ==\nFurther distinctions are also made when classifying property in Scots law, again following Roman law principles. '''Heritable''' property includes land, any buildings and structures upon it and real rights in the land. M'''oveable''' property includes property which can actually be physically moved. Moveable property contains two further distinctions: '''corporeal''' moveables such as physical goods and furniture and '''incorporeal''' moveables such as rights in company shares or intellectual property rights such as [[Patent|patents]], [[Trademark|trade marks]] and [[Copyright|copyrights]]. \n\n=== Heritable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=====Feudal law=====\nThe [[feudal]] system lingered on in Scots law on land ownership, so that a [[landowner]] as a ''[[vassal]]'' still had obligations to a ''[[feudal superior]]'' including payment of ''[[feu duty]]''. This enabled developers to impose [[Eternity|perpetual]] conditions dictating how buildings had to be constructed and maintained, but added complications and became abused to demand payments from ''vassals'' who wanted to make minor changes. In 1974 legislation began a process of redeeming ''feu duties'' so that most of these payments were ended. A major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) commenced on 28 November 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref>\n\nAgreement on an offer for property purchase is a legally binding contract, resulting in a system of [[conveyancing]] where buyers get their [[surveying|survey]] done before making a bid to the seller's solicitor, and after a closing date for [[Bidding|bid]]s the seller's acceptance is binding on both parties, preventing [[gazump]]ing. In recent times sales of house by way of offering to sell to the first party to make an unconditional offer of a fixed price has eroded the traditional ''offers over'' system.  It is important historically because the [[feu (land tenure)|feu]] was first created in Scotland, which is an antecedent of the [[fee]] system, used in conveyancing throughout the [[common law]] system.\n\n=====Udal law=====\nThe [[Northern Isles]] used a system called [[Udal Law]], owing to their former status as territory of [[Norway]].  However, following legal reforms in November 2004, the significance of udal law in those islands has greatly reduced.\n\n=== Moveable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n\n'''Corporeal Moveables'''\n\n[Section in Edit]\n\n\nIncorporeal Moveables\n\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=====Intellectual property =====\n{{main|Scots intellectual property law}}\n[[Intellectual property]] (IP) in Scotland is governed mostly by [[statute]] and is governed on a UK wide level.

{"title_page": "Residence time", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\nThe '''residence time''' of a [[fluid parcel]] is the total time that the parcel has spent inside a [[control volume]] (e.g.: a [[chemical reactor]], a [[lake]], a [[human body]]). The residence time of a [[Set_(mathematics)|set]] of parcels is quantified in terms of the [[Frequency_(statistics)|frequency distribution]] of the residence time in the set, which is known as '''residence time distribution''' (RTD), or in terms of its average, known as '''mean residence time'''. \n\nResidence time plays an important role in [[chemistry]] and especially in [[environmental science]] and [[pharmacology]]. Under the name ''[[lead time]]'' or ''waiting time'' it plays a central role respectively in [[supply chain management]] and [[queueing theory]], where the material that flows is usually discrete instead of continuous.\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of residence time originated in models of chemical reactors. The first such model was an ''axial dispersion model'' by [[Irving Langmuir]] in 1908. This received little attention for 45 years; other models were developed such as the [[plug flow reactor model]] and the [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]], and the concept of a ''washout function'' (representing the response to a sudden change in the input) was introduced. Then, in 1953, [[Peter Danckwerts]] resurrected the axial dispersion model and formulated the modern concept of residence time.<ref name=Nauman>{{cite journal|last1=Nauman|first1=E. Bruce|title=Residence Time Theory|journal=Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research|date=May 2008|volume=47|issue=10|pages=3752\u20133766|doi=10.1021/ie071635a}}</ref>\n\n== Distributions ==\n[[File:Control volume.svg|thumb|[[Control volume]] with incoming flow rate ''f''<sub>in</sub>, outgoing flow rate ''f''<sub>out</sub> and amount stored ''m'']]\n\nThe time that a particle of fluid has been in a [[control volume]] (e.g. a reservoir) is known as its ''age''. In general, each particle has a different age. The frequency of occurrence of the age <math>\\tau</math> in the set of all the particles that are located inside the control volume at time <math>t</math> is quantified by means of the (internal) '''age distribution''' <math>I</math>.<ref name=Bolin/>\n\nAt the moment a particle leaves the control volume, its age is the total time that the particle has spent inside the control volume, which is known as its ''residence time''. The frequency of occurrence of the age <math>\\tau</math> in the set of all the particles that are leaving the control volume at time <math>t</math> is quantified by means of the '''residence time distribution''', also known as '''exit age distribution''' <math>E</math>.<ref name=Bolin/>\n\nBoth distributions are assumed to be positive and to have unitary integral along the age:<ref name=Bolin/>\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty E(\\tau,t)d\\tau = \\int_0^\\infty I(\\tau,t)d\\tau = 1</math>\n\nIn the case of [[Fluid_dynamics#Steady_vs_unsteady_flow|steady flow]], the distributions are assumed to be independent of time, that is <math>\\partial_tE=\\partial_tI=0 \\; \\forall t</math>, which may allow to redefine the distributions as simple functions of the age only.\n\nIf the flow is steady (but a generalization to non-steady flow is possible<ref name=Schwartz/>) and is [[Continuity_equation#Fluid_dynamics|conservative]], then the exit age distribution and the internal age distribution can be related one to the other:<ref name=Bolin/>\n:<math>\\left.\\begin{aligned}\n \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t}=\\frac{dm}{dt}=0 & \\\\\n f_\\text{in}=f_\\text{out}=f &\n\\end{aligned}\\ \\right\\} \\implies fE=-m\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial \\tau}</math>\n\nDistributions other than <math>E</math> and <math>I</math> can be usually traced back to them. For example, the fraction of particles leaving the control volume at time <math>t</math> with an age greater or equal than <math>\\tau</math> is quantified by means of the '''washout function''' <math>W</math>, that is the complementary to one of the cumulative exit age distribution:\n:<math>W(\\tau,t)=1-\\int_0^\\tau E(s,t)ds</math>\n\n==Averages==\n===Mean age and mean residence time===\nThe '''mean age''' of all the particles inside the control volume at time ''t'' is the first [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of the age distribution:<ref name=Bolin/><ref name=Schwartz/>\n:<math> \\tau_a(t) = \\int_0^\\infty \\tau I(\\tau,t) d\\tau</math>\n\nThe '''mean residence time''' or '''mean transit time''' of the particles leaving the control volume at time ''t'' is the first moment of the residence time distribution:<ref name=Bolin/><ref name=Schwartz/>\n:<math> \\tau_t(t) = \\int_0^\\infty \\tau E(\\tau,t) d\\tau.</math>\n\nThe mean age and the mean transit time generally have different values:<ref name=Bolin/>\n* <math>\\tau_a < \\tau_t</math>: it takes some time for particles to begin leaving the system. Examples include water in a lake with inlet and outlet on opposite sides; and a [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear bomb test]] where [[Nuclear fallout|radioactive material]] is introduced high in the [[stratosphere]] and filters down to the [[troposphere]].\n* <math>\\tau_a = \\tau_t</math>: the frequency functions ''E'' and ''I'' are [[Exponential decay|exponential]], as in the CSTR model above. Such a distribution occurs whenever all particles have a fixed probability per unit time of leaving the system. Examples include [[radioactive decay]] and [[Rate equation#first-order reaction|first order chemical reactions]] (where the reaction rate is proportional to the amount of [[reactant]]).\n* <math>\\tau_a > \\tau_t</math>: most of the particles pass through quickly, but some are held up. This can happen when the main source and sink are very close together or the same. For example, most [[water vapor]] rising from the ocean surface soon returns to the ocean, but water vapor that gets sufficiently far away will probably return much later in the form of rain.<ref name=Bolin/>\n\n===Turnover time===\nIf the flow is [[Fluid_dynamics#Steady_vs_unsteady_flow|steady]] and [[Continuity_equation#Fluid_dynamics|conservative]], the mean residence time equals the ratio between the amount of fluid contained in the control volume and the flow rate through it:<ref name=\"Bolin\"/>\n:<math>\\left.\\begin{aligned}\n \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t}=\\frac{dm}{dt}=0 & \\\\\n f_\\text{in}=f_\\text{out}=f &\n\\end{aligned}\\ \\right\\} \\implies \\tau_t = \\frac{m}{f}</math>\nThis ratio is commonly known as the '''turnover time''' or '''flushing time'''.<ref name=\"Monsen\"/> When applied to liquids, it is also known as the '''hydraulic retention time''' (''HRT''), ''hydraulic residence time'' or ''hydraulic detention time''.<ref name=Davis>{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Mackenzie L.|last2=Masten|first2=Susan J.|title=Principles of environmental engineering and science|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston, Mass.|isbn=9780072921861|pages=150, 267, 480, 500}}</ref> In the field of chemical engineering this is also known as '''space time'''.<ref>Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering (4th Edition) by H. Scott Fogler, Prentice Hall PTR, 2005. {{ISBN|0-13-047394-4}}</ref>\n\nNote that the residence time of a specific compound in a mixture equals the turnover time (that of the compound, as well as that of the mixture) only if the compound doesn't take part in any chemical reaction (otherwise its flow isn't conservative) and its concentration is [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]].<ref name=\"Schwartz\"/>\n\nAlthough the equivalence between the residence time and the ratio <math>m/f</math> doesn't hold if the flow isn't stationary or it isn't conservative, it does hold ''on average'' if the flow is steady and conservative ''on average'', and not necessarily at any instant. Under such conditions, which are common in [[queueing theory]] and [[supply chain management]], the relation is known as [[Little's Law]].\n\n==Simple flow models==\nDesign equations are equations relating the space time to the fractional conversion and other properties of the reactor. Different design equations have been derived for different types of the reactor and depending on the reactor the equation more or less resemble that describing the average residence time. Often design equations are used to minimize the reactor volume or volumetric flow rate required to operate a reactor.<ref name=\"CEKRD\">Chemical Engineering Kinetics and Reactor Design by Charles G. Hill, Jr. John Wiley & Sons Inc, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0471396093}}</ref>\n\n===Plug flow reactor===\nIn an ideal [[Plug flow reactor model|plug flow reactor]] (PFR) the fluid particles leave in the same order they arrived, not mixing with those in front and behind. Therefore, the particles entering at time ''t'' will exit at time ''t'' + ''T'', all spending a time ''T'' inside the reactor. The residence time distribution will be then a [[Dirac delta function]] delayed of ''T'':\n:<math>E(\\tau) = \\delta(\\tau-T)\\,</math>\nThe mean is ''T'' and the variance is zero.<ref name=Nauman/>\n\nThe RTD of a real reactor deviates from that of an ideal reactor, depending on the hydrodynamics within the vessel. A non-zero variance indicates that there is some dispersion along the path of the fluid, which may be attributed to turbulence, a non-uniform velocity profile, or diffusion. If the mean of the distribution is earlier than the expected time ''T'' it indicates that there is [[Stagnation point|stagnant fluid]] within the vessel. If the RTD curve shows more than one main peak it may indicate channeling, parallel paths to the exit, or strong internal circulation.\n\nIn PFRs, reactants enter the reactor at one end and react as they move down the reactor. Consequently, the reaction rate is dependent on the concentrations which vary along the reactor requiring the inverse of the reaction rate to be integrated over the fractional conversion.\n\n:<math> \\tau = C_{AO} \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})}\\,df_{A}</math>\n\n===Batch reactor===\nBatch reactors are reactors in which the reactants are put in the reactor at time 0 and react until the reaction is stopped. Consequently, the space time is the same as the average residence time in a batch reactor.\n\n:<math> \\tau = N_{AO} \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})V_{R}}\\,df_{A} </math>\n\n===Continuous stirred-tank reactor===\nIn an ideal [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]] (CSTR), the flow at the inlet is completely and instantly mixed into the bulk of the reactor. The reactor and the outlet fluid have identical, homogeneous compositions at all times. The residence time distribution is exponential:\n:<math>E(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\tau}{T}\\right).</math>\nThe mean is ''T'' and the variance is 1.<ref name=Nauman/> A notable difference from the plug flow reactor is that material introduced into the system will never completely leave it.<ref name=Monsen/>\n\nIn reality, it is impossible to obtain such rapid mixing, especially on industrial scales where reactor vessels may range between 1 and thousands of cubic meters, and hence the RTD of a real reactor will deviate from the ideal exponential decay. For example, there will be some finite delay before ''E'' reaches its maximum value and the length of the delay will reflect the rate of mass transfer within the reactor. Just as was noted for a plug-flow reactor, an early mean will indicate some stagnant fluid within the vessel, while the presence of multiple peaks could indicate channeling, parallel paths to the exit, or strong internal circulation. Short-circuiting fluid within the reactor would appear in an RTD curve as a small pulse of concentrated tracer that reaches the outlet shortly after injection.\nR\neactants continuously enter and leave a tank where they are mixed. Consequently, the reaction proceeds at a rate dependent on the outlet concentration:\n:<math> \\tau = \\frac{C_{A in}- C_{A out}}{(-r_{A})}\\ </math>\n\n===Laminar flow reactor===\nIn a [[laminar flow reactor]], the fluid flows through a long tube or parallel plate reactor and the flow is in layers parallel to the walls of the tube. The velocity of the flow is a parabolic function of radius. In the absence of [[molecular diffusion]], the RTD is<ref name=\"Colli and Bisang, 2015\" >{{Cite journal  |title=Study of the influence of boundary conditions, non ideal stimulus and dynamics of sensors on the evaluation of residence time distributions  |first1=A.

In a real reactor, diffusion will eventually mix the layers so that the tail of the RTD becomes exponential and the variance finite; but laminar flow reactors can have variance greater than 1, the maximum for CTSD reactors.<ref name=Nauman/>\n\n===Recycle reactors===\nRecycle reactors are PFRs with a recycle loop. Consequently, they behave like a hybrid between PFRs and CSTRs.\n\n:<math> \\tau = C_{AO}(R+1) \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})}\\,df_{A} </math>\n\nIn all of these equations :<math> -r_{A} </math> is the consumption rate of A, a reactant. This is equal to the rate expression A is involved in. The rate expression is often related to the fractional conversion both through the consumption of A and through any k changes through temperature changes that are dependent on conversion.<ref name=\"CEKRD\" />\n\n===Variable volume reactions===\nIn some reactions the reactants and the products have significantly different densities. Consequently, as the reaction proceeds the volume of the reaction changes. This variable volume adds terms to the design equations. Taking this volume change into consideration the volume of the reaction becomes:\n\n:<math> V_{R} = V_{R initial}(1-\\delta_{A}f_{A}) </math>\n\nPlugging this into the design equations results in the following equations:\n\n====Batch====\n\n:<math> \\tau = N_{AO} \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})V_{R}(1-\\delta_{A}f_{A})}\\,df_{A} </math>\n\n====Plug flow reactors====\n\n:<math> \\tau = C_{AO} \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})(1-\\delta_{A}f_{A})}\\,df_{A}</math>\n\n====Continuous stirred-tank reactors====\n\n:<math> \\tau = \\frac{C_{A in}- C_{A out}}{(-r_{AF})(1-\\delta_{A}f_{A})}\\ </math>\n\nGenerally, when reactions take place in the liquid and solid phases the change in volume due to reaction is not significant enough that it needs to be taken into account. Reactions in the gas phase often have significant changes in volume and in these cases one should use these modified equations.<ref name=\"CEKRD\" />\n\n==Determining the RTD experimentally==\nResidence time distributions are measured by introducing a non-reactive [[Dye tracer|tracer]] into the system at the inlet. Its input concentration is changed according to a known function and the output concentration measured. The tracer should not modify the physical characteristics of the fluid (equal density, equal viscosity) or the [[hydrodynamic]] conditions and it should be easily detectable.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fogler|first1=H. Scott|title=Elements of chemical reaction engineering|date=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0130473943|edition=4th}}</ref>\nIn general, the change in tracer concentration will either be a ''pulse'' or a ''step''. Other functions are possible, but they require more calculations to [[deconvolution|deconvolute]] the RTD curve.\n\n===Pulse experiments===\nThis method required the introduction of a very small volume of concentrated tracer at the inlet of the reactor, such that it approaches the [[Dirac delta function]].<ref name=\"Colli and Bisang, 2011\" >{{Cite journal |title=Evaluation of the hydrodynamic behaviour of turbulence promoters in parallel plate electrochemical reactors by means of the dispersion model |first1=A.

It is easy to numerically integrate an experimental pulse response to obtain a very high-quality estimate of the step response, but the reverse is not the case because any noise in the concentration measurement will be amplified by numeric differentiation.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Chemical reactors===\n[[Image:Typical CSTR RTD curve.svg|thumb|right|An RTD curve for a reasonably well-mixed reactor]]\nIn [[chemical reactor]]s, the goal is to make components react with a high [[yield (chemistry)|yield]]. In a homogeneous, [[first-order reaction]], the probability that an atom or molecule will react depends only on its residence time:\n:<math>P_\\mathrm{R} = \\exp\\left(-k t\\right)</math>\nfor a [[rate constant]] <math>k</math>. Given a RTD, the average probability is equal to the ratio of the concentration <math>a</math> of the component before and after:<ref name=Nauman/>\n:<math>\\overline{P_\\mathrm{R}} = a_\\mathrm{out}/a_\\mathrm{in} = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-k t\\right)E(t)dt.</math>\n\nIf the reaction is more complicated, then the output is not uniquely determined by the RTD. It also depends on the degree of ''[[micromixing]]'', the mixing between molecules that entered at different times. If there is no mixing, the system is said to be ''completely segregated'', and the output can be given in the form\n:<math>a_\\mathrm{out} = \\int_0^\\infty a_\\mathrm{batch}(t)E(t)dt.</math>\nFor given RTD, there is an upper limit on the amount of mixing that can occur, called the ''maximum mixedness'', and this determines the achievable yield. A continuous stirred-tank reactor can be anywhere in the spectrum between completely segregated and [[perfect mixing]].<ref name=Nauman/>\n\n===Groundwater flow===\n\nHydraulic residence time (HRT) is an important factor in the transport of environmental toxins or other chemicals through [[groundwater]]. The amount of time that a pollutant spends traveling through a delineated subsurface space is related to the saturation and the [[hydraulic conductivity]] of the soil or rock.<ref name=Noel>{{Cite journal|last=Noel|first=M.|date=1999|title=Some physical properties of water transport in waste material|url=https://www.imwa.info/docs/imwa_1999/IMWA1999_Noel_449.pdf|journal=Mine, Water & Environment|volume=1999 IMWA Congress|pages=|via=}}</ref> [[Porosity]] is another significant contributing factor to the mobility of water through the ground (e.g. toward the [[water table]]). The intersection between pore density and size determines the degree or magnitude of the flow rate through the media. This idea can be illustrated by a comparison of the ways water moves through [[clay]] versus [[gravel]]. The retention time through a specified vertical distance in clay will be longer than through the same distance in gravel, even though they are both characterized as high porosity materials. This is because the pore sizes are much larger in gravel media than in clay, and so there is less [[Hydrostatic stress|hydrostatic tension]] working against the subsurface [[pressure gradient]] and gravity.\n\nGroundwater flow is important parameter for consideration in the design of waste rock basins for [[mining]] operations. Waste rock is heterogeneous material with particles varying from boulders to clay-sized particles, and it contains [[Acid mine drainage|sulfidic pollutants]] which must be controlled such that they do not compromise the quality of the water table and also so the runoff does not create environmental problems in the surrounding areas.<ref name=Noel /> [[Aquifer#Aquifers versus aquitards|Aquitards]] are clay zones that can have such a degree of impermeability that they partially or completely retard water flow.<ref name=Davis /><ref name=Faybishenko>{{cite book|last1=Faybishenko|first1=Boris|last2=Witherspoon|first2=Paul A.|last3=Gale|first3=John|title=Dynamics of fluids and transport in fractured rock|date=2005|publisher=American Geophysical Union|location=Washington|isbn=9780875904276|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dynamicsoffluids0000unse/page/165 165\u2013167]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dynamicsoffluids0000unse/page/165}}</ref> These clay lenses can slow or stop seepage into the water table, although if an aquitard is fractured and contaminated then it can become a long-term source of groundwater contamination due to its low permeability and high HRT.<ref name=Faybishenko />\n\n===Water treatment===\n{{See also|Activated sludge|Waste stabilization pond}}\n[[Primary treatment]] for wastewater or drinking water includes settling in a [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] chamber to remove as much of the solid matter as possible before applying additional treatments.<ref name=Davis /> The amount removed is controlled by the hydraulic residence time (HRT).<ref name=Davis /> When water flows through a volume at a slower rate, less energy is available to keep solid particles entrained in the stream and there is more time for them to settle to the bottom.

More specifically it is the time during which water remains within an aquifer, lake, river, or other water body before continuing around the [[hydrological cycle]]. The time involved may vary from days for shallow gravel [[aquifer]]s to millions of years for deep aquifers with very low values for [[hydraulic conductivity]]. Residence times of water in rivers are a few days, while in large lakes residence time ranges up to several decades. Residence times of continental ice sheets is hundreds of thousands of years, of small glaciers a few decades.\n\nGround water residence time applications are useful for determining the amount of time it will take for a pollutant to reach and [[water contamination|contaminate]] a ground water drinking water source and at what concentration it will arrive. This can also work to the opposite effect to determine how long until a ground water source becomes uncontaminated via inflow, outflow, and volume. The residence time of lakes and streams is important as well to determine the concentration of pollutants in a lake and how this may affect the local population and marine life.\n\nHydrology, the study of water, discusses the water budget in terms of residence time. The amount of time that water spends in each different stage of life (glacier, atmosphere, ocean, lake, stream, river), is used to show the relation of all of the water on the earth and how it relates in its different forms.\n\n===Pharmacology===\nA large class of [[drug]]s are [[enzyme inhibitor]]s that bind to [[enzyme]]s in the body and inhibit their activity.

Hill, Jr. John Wiley & Sons Inc, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0471396093}}</ref>\n\n===Plug flow reactor===\nIn an ideal [[Plug flow reactor model|plug flow reactor]] (PFR) the fluid particles leave in the same order they arrived, not mixing with those in front and behind. Therefore, the particles entering at time ''t'' will exit at time ''t'' + ''T'', all spending a time ''T'' inside the reactor. The residence time distribution will be then a [[Dirac delta function]] delayed of ''T'':\n:<math>E(\\tau) = \\delta(\\tau-T)\\,</math>\nThe mean is ''T'' and the variance is zero.<ref name=Nauman/>\n\nThe RTD of a real reactor deviates from that of an ideal reactor, depending on the hydrodynamics within the vessel. A non-zero variance indicates that there is some dispersion along the path of the fluid, which may be attributed to turbulence, a non-uniform velocity profile, or diffusion. If the mean of the distribution is earlier than the expected time ''T'' it indicates that there is [[Stagnation point|stagnant fluid]] within the vessel. If the RTD curve shows more than one main peak it may indicate channeling, parallel paths to the exit, or strong internal circulation.\n\nIn PFRs, reactants enter the reactor at one end and react as they move down the reactor. Consequently, the reaction rate is dependent on the concentrations which vary along the reactor requiring the inverse of the reaction rate to be integrated over the fractional conversion.\n\n:<math> \\tau = C_{AO} \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})}\\,df_{A}</math>\n\n===Batch reactor===\nBatch reactors are reactors in which the reactants are put in the reactor at time 0 and react until the reaction is stopped. Consequently, the space time is the same as the average residence time in a batch reactor.\n\n:<math> \\tau = N_{AO} \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})V_{R}}\\,df_{A} </math>\n\n===Continuous stirred-tank reactor===\nIn an ideal [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]] (CSTR), the flow at the inlet is completely and instantly mixed into the bulk of the reactor. The reactor and the outlet fluid have identical, homogeneous compositions at all times. The residence time distribution is exponential:\n:<math>E(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{T} \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\tau}{T}\\right).</math>\nThe mean is ''T'' and the variance is 1.<ref name=Nauman/> A notable difference from the plug flow reactor is that material introduced into the system will never completely leave it.<ref name=Monsen/>\n\nIn reality, it is impossible to obtain such rapid mixing, especially on industrial scales where reactor vessels may range between 1 and thousands of cubic meters, and hence the RTD of a real reactor will deviate from the ideal exponential decay. For example, there will be some finite delay before ''E'' reaches its maximum value and the length of the delay will reflect the rate of mass transfer within the reactor. Just as was noted for a plug-flow reactor, an early mean will indicate some stagnant fluid within the vessel, while the presence of multiple peaks could indicate channeling, parallel paths to the exit, or strong internal circulation. Short-circuiting fluid within the reactor would appear in an RTD curve as a small pulse of concentrated tracer that reaches the outlet shortly after injection.\nR\neactants continuously enter and leave a tank where they are mixed. Consequently, the reaction proceeds at a rate dependent on the outlet concentration:\n:<math> \\tau = \\frac{C_{A in}- C_{A out}}{(-r_{A})}\\ </math>\n\n===Laminar flow reactor===\nIn a [[laminar flow reactor]], the fluid flows through a long tube or parallel plate reactor and the flow is in layers parallel to the walls of the tube. The velocity of the flow is a parabolic function of radius. In the absence of [[molecular diffusion]], the RTD is<ref name=\"Colli and Bisang, 2015\" >{{Cite journal  |title=Study of the influence of boundary conditions, non ideal stimulus and dynamics of sensors on the evaluation of residence time distributions  |first1=A.

In a real reactor, diffusion will eventually mix the layers so that the tail of the RTD becomes exponential and the variance finite; but laminar flow reactors can have variance greater than 1, the maximum for CTSD reactors.<ref name=Nauman/>\n\n===Recycle reactors===\nRecycle reactors are PFRs with a recycle loop. Consequently, they behave like a hybrid between PFRs and CSTRs.\n\n:<math> \\tau = C_{AO}(R+1) \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})}\\,df_{A} </math>\n\nIn all of these equations :<math> -r_{A} </math> is the consumption rate of A, a reactant. This is equal to the rate expression A is involved in. The rate expression is often related to the fractional conversion both through the consumption of A and through any k changes through temperature changes that are dependent on conversion.<ref name=\"CEKRD\" />\n\n===Variable volume reactions===\nIn some reactions the reactants and the products have significantly different densities. Consequently, as the reaction proceeds the volume of the reaction changes. This variable volume adds terms to the design equations. Taking this volume change into consideration the volume of the reaction becomes:\n\n:<math> V_{R} = V_{R initial}(1-\\delta_{A}f_{A}) </math>\n\nPlugging this into the design equations results in the following equations:\n\n====Batch====\n\n:<math> \\tau = N_{AO} \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})V_{R}(1-\\delta_{A}f_{A})}\\,df_{A} </math>\n\n====Plug flow reactors====\n\n:<math> \\tau = C_{AO} \\int \\frac{1}{(-r_{A})(1-\\delta_{A}f_{A})}\\,df_{A}</math>\n\n====Continuous stirred-tank reactors====\n\n:<math> \\tau = \\frac{C_{A in}- C_{A out}}{(-r_{AF})(1-\\delta_{A}f_{A})}\\ </math>\n\nGenerally, when reactions take place in the liquid and solid phases the change in volume due to reaction is not significant enough that it needs to be taken into account. Reactions in the gas phase often have significant changes in volume and in these cases one should use these modified equations.<ref name=\"CEKRD\" />\n\n==Determining the RTD experimentally==\nResidence time distributions are measured by introducing a non-reactive [[Dye tracer|tracer]] into the system at the inlet. Its input concentration is changed according to a known function and the output concentration measured. The tracer should not modify the physical characteristics of the fluid (equal density, equal viscosity) or the [[hydrodynamic]] conditions and it should be easily detectable.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fogler|first1=H. Scott|title=Elements of chemical reaction engineering|date=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0130473943|edition=4th}}</ref>\nIn general, the change in tracer concentration will either be a ''pulse'' or a ''step''. Other functions are possible, but they require more calculations to [[deconvolution|deconvolute]] the RTD curve.\n\n===Pulse experiments===\nThis method required the introduction of a very small volume of concentrated tracer at the inlet of the reactor, such that it approaches the [[Dirac delta function]].<ref name=\"Colli and Bisang, 2011\" >{{Cite journal |title=Evaluation of the hydrodynamic behaviour of turbulence promoters in parallel plate electrochemical reactors by means of the dispersion model |first1=A.

If a mass of tracer, <math>M</math>, is introduced into a vessel of volume <math>V</math> and an expected residence \ntime of <math>\\tau</math>, the resulting curve of <math>C(t)</math> can be transformed into a dimensionless residence time distribution curve by the following relation:\n\n: <math>E(t) = \\frac{C(t)}{\\int_0^\\infty C(t)\\ dt}</math>\n\n===Step experiments===\nThe concentration of tracer in a step experiment at the reactor inlet changes abruptly from 0 to <math>C_0</math>. The concentration of tracer at the outlet is measured and normalized to the concentration <math>C_0</math> to obtain the non-dimensional curve <math>F(t)</math> which goes from 0 to 1:\n: <math>F(t) = \\frac {C(t)}{C_{0}}</math>.\n\nThe step- and pulse-responses of a reactor are related by the following:\n: <math>F(t) = \\int_{0}^t E(t')\\, dt' \\qquad E(t) = \\frac {dF(t)}{dt}</math>\n\nA step experiment is often easier to perform than a pulse experiment, but it tends to smooth over some of the details that a pulse response could show. It is easy to numerically integrate an experimental pulse response to obtain a very high-quality estimate of the step response, but the reverse is not the case because any noise in the concentration measurement will be amplified by numeric differentiation.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Chemical reactors===\n[[Image:Typical CSTR RTD curve.svg|thumb|right|An RTD curve for a reasonably well-mixed reactor]]\nIn [[chemical reactor]]s, the goal is to make components react with a high [[yield (chemistry)|yield]]. In a homogeneous, [[first-order reaction]], the probability that an atom or molecule will react depends only on its residence time:\n:<math>P_\\mathrm{R} = \\exp\\left(-k t\\right)</math>\nfor a [[rate constant]] <math>k</math>. Given a RTD, the average probability is equal to the ratio of the concentration <math>a</math> of the component before and after:<ref name=Nauman/>\n:<math>\\overline{P_\\mathrm{R}} = a_\\mathrm{out}/a_\\mathrm{in} = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-k t\\right)E(t)dt.</math>\n\nIf the reaction is more complicated, then the output is not uniquely determined by the RTD. It also depends on the degree of ''[[micromixing]]'', the mixing between molecules that entered at different times. If there is no mixing, the system is said to be ''completely segregated'', and the output can be given in the form\n:<math>a_\\mathrm{out} = \\int_0^\\infty a_\\mathrm{batch}(t)E(t)dt.</math>\nFor given RTD, there is an upper limit on the amount of mixing that can occur, called the ''maximum mixedness'', and this determines the achievable yield. A continuous stirred-tank reactor can be anywhere in the spectrum between completely segregated and [[perfect mixing]].<ref name=Nauman/>\n\n===Groundwater flow===\n\nHydraulic residence time (HRT) is an important factor in the transport of environmental toxins or other chemicals through [[groundwater]]. The amount of time that a pollutant spends traveling through a delineated subsurface space is related to the saturation and the [[hydraulic conductivity]] of the soil or rock.<ref name=Noel>{{Cite journal|last=Noel|first=M.|date=1999|title=Some physical properties of water transport in waste material|url=https://www.imwa.info/docs/imwa_1999/IMWA1999_Noel_449.pdf|journal=Mine, Water & Environment|volume=1999 IMWA Congress|pages=|via=}}</ref> [[Porosity]] is another significant contributing factor to the mobility of water through the ground (e.g. toward the [[water table]]). The intersection between pore density and size determines the degree or magnitude of the flow rate through the media. This idea can be illustrated by a comparison of the ways water moves through [[clay]] versus [[gravel]]. The retention time through a specified vertical distance in clay will be longer than through the same distance in gravel, even though they are both characterized as high porosity materials. This is because the pore sizes are much larger in gravel media than in clay, and so there is less [[Hydrostatic stress|hydrostatic tension]] working against the subsurface [[pressure gradient]] and gravity.\n\nGroundwater flow is important parameter for consideration in the design of waste rock basins for [[mining]] operations. Waste rock is heterogeneous material with particles varying from boulders to clay-sized particles, and it contains [[Acid mine drainage|sulfidic pollutants]] which must be controlled such that they do not compromise the quality of the water table and also so the runoff does not create environmental problems in the surrounding areas.<ref name=Noel /> [[Aquifer#Aquifers versus aquitards|Aquitards]] are clay zones that can have such a degree of impermeability that they partially or completely retard water flow.<ref name=Davis /><ref name=Faybishenko>{{cite book|last1=Faybishenko|first1=Boris|last2=Witherspoon|first2=Paul A.|last3=Gale|first3=John|title=Dynamics of fluids and transport in fractured rock|date=2005|publisher=American Geophysical Union|location=Washington|isbn=9780875904276|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dynamicsoffluids0000unse/page/165 165\u2013167]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dynamicsoffluids0000unse/page/165}}</ref> These clay lenses can slow or stop seepage into the water table, although if an aquitard is fractured and contaminated then it can become a long-term source of groundwater contamination due to its low permeability and high HRT.<ref name=Faybishenko />\n\n===Water treatment===\n{{See also|Activated sludge|Waste stabilization pond}}\n[[Primary treatment]] for wastewater or drinking water includes settling in a [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] chamber to remove as much of the solid matter as possible before applying additional treatments.<ref name=Davis /> The amount removed is controlled by the hydraulic residence time (HRT).<ref name=Davis /> When water flows through a volume at a slower rate, less energy is available to keep solid particles entrained in the stream and there is more time for them to settle to the bottom.

More specifically it is the time during which water remains within an aquifer, lake, river, or other water body before continuing around the [[hydrological cycle]]. The time involved may vary from days for shallow gravel [[aquifer]]s to millions of years for deep aquifers with very low values for [[hydraulic conductivity]]. Residence times of water in rivers are a few days, while in large lakes residence time ranges up to several decades. Residence times of continental ice sheets is hundreds of thousands of years, of small glaciers a few decades.\n\nGround water residence time applications are useful for determining the amount of time it will take for a pollutant to reach and [[water contamination|contaminate]] a ground water drinking water source and at what concentration it will arrive. This can also work to the opposite effect to determine how long until a ground water source becomes uncontaminated via inflow, outflow, and volume. The residence time of lakes and streams is important as well to determine the concentration of pollutants in a lake and how this may affect the local population and marine life.\n\nHydrology, the study of water, discusses the water budget in terms of residence time. The amount of time that water spends in each different stage of life (glacier, atmosphere, ocean, lake, stream, river), is used to show the relation of all of the water on the earth and how it relates in its different forms.\n\n===Pharmacology===\nA large class of [[drug]]s are [[enzyme inhibitor]]s that bind to [[enzyme]]s in the body and inhibit their activity.
