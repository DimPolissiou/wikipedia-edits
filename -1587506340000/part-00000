It represented an important transition in Indian art from use of wood to stone. It was a royal art patronized by Mauryan kings especially [[Ashoka]]. Pillars, Stupas, caves are the most prominent survivals.\n\n[[File:Elephant-sculpture-dhauli.JPG|thumb|The stone elephant at [[Dhauli]].]]\nThe most significant remains of monumental Mauryan art include the remains of the royal palace and the city of [[Pataliputra]], a monolithic rail at [[Sarnath]], the ''Bodhimandala'' or the altar resting on four pilars at [[Bodhgaya]], the rock-cut [[chaitya]]-halls in the [[Barabar Caves]] near [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] including the Sudama cave bearing the inscription dated the 12th regnal year of [[Ashoka]], the non-edict bearing and edict bearing pillars, the animal sculptures crowning the pillars with animal and vegetal reliefs decorating the abaci of the capitals and the front half of the representation of an elephant carved out in the round from a live rock at Dhauli.<ref>Mahajan V.D.

The elaborately carved animal capitals surviving on from some [[Pillars of Ashoka]] are the best known works, and among the finest, above all the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] from [[Sarnath]] that is now the [[National Emblem of India]]. Coomaraswamy distinguishes between court art and a more popular art during the Mauryan period. Court art is represented by the pillars and their capitals,<ref name=Thapar>Thapar, Romila (2001). ''{{IAST|A\u015boka}} and the Decline of the Mauryas'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564445-X}}, pp.267-70</ref> and surviving popular art by some stone pieces, and many smaller works in [[terracotta]]. \n\nThe highly polished surface of court sculpture is often called [[Mauryan polish]]. However this seems not to be entirely reliable as a diagnostic tool for a Mauryan date, as some works from considerably later periods also have it.  The [[Didarganj Yakshi]], now most often thought to be from the 2nd century CE, is an example.  \n\n===Pillars and their capitals===\n{{see also|Pillars of Ashoka}}\n[[File:Pataliputra capital, Bihar Museum, Patna, 3rd century BCE.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pataliputra capital]], showing both Achaemenid and [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Greek influence]],  with [[volute]], [[bead and reel]], [[Meander (art)|meander]] and [[Palmette|honeysuckle]] designs.

It has been described as [[Persia|Perso]]-[[Ionic order|Iionic]], with a strong [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] stylistic influence, including [[volute]], [[bead and reel]], [[Meander (art)|meander]] or [[Palmette|honeysuckle]] designs. This monumental piece of architecture tends to suggest the [[Achaemenid]] and [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] at the Mauryan court from early on.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/reportonexcavat01waddgoog Report on the excavations at P\u0101taliputra (Patna); the Palibothra of the Greeks by Waddell, L.

These pillars were carved in two types of stone. Some were of the spotted red and white sandstone from the region of [[Mathura]], the others of buff-coloured fine grained hard sandstone usually with small black spots quarried in the [[Chunar]] near [[Varanasi]]. The uniformity of style in the pillar capitals suggests that they were all sculpted by craftsmen from the same region. It would therefore seem, that stone transported from Mathura and Chunar to the various sites where the pillars have been found and here the stone was cut and carved by craftsmen<ref name=\"Thapar\"/> They were given a fine polish characteristic of Mauryan sculpture. \n\nThese pillars were mainly erected in the [[Gangetic plains]]. They were inscribed with edicts of Ashoka on [[Dhamma]] or righteousness. The animal capital as a finely carved lifelike representation, noteworthy are the lion capital of [[Sarnath]], the bull capital of [[Rampurva]] and the lion capital of [[Lauria Nandangarh]]. Much speculation has been made about the similarity between these capitals and [[Achaemenid]] works.\n\n===\"Popular\" sculpture===\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n[[File:Patna Yakshas and inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The two monumental [[Yaksha]]s discovered in [[Patna]] (size: 2 meters tall), and thought to be 3rd century BCE.

This consisted of sculpture which probably was not commissioned by the emperor. The patrons of the popular art were the local governors and the more well-to-do subjects. It is represented by figures such as the female figure of Besnagar, the male figure of Parkham and the [[Didarganj Yakshi|whisk-bearer from Didarganj]] (although its age is debated). Technically they are fashioned with less skill than the pillar capitals. They express a considerable earthiness and physical vitality.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>\n\nThe stone elephant at [[Dhauli]] was also probably carved by local craftsmen and not by the court-based artists who were responsible for the animal capitals. The image of the elephant emerging from the rock is a most impressive one, and its purpose was probably to draw attention to the inscription nearby.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>\n\n===Terracottas===\nPopular [[terracotta]] objects of various sizes have been found at Mauryan sites, and elsewhere, and are probably the most numerous Mauryan works of art.  Made by local people who may not have been specialists, but for example potters with a sideline, they are very difficult to date if not recorded as coming from an identifiable archaeological context.  Many are regarded as pre-Mauryan, but a continuation of the tradition of making mother-goddesses in clay, which dates back to the prehistoric period is revealed by the discovery of these objects at Mauryan levels during the excavations at Ahicchatra. \n\nThey are found more commonly from [[Pataliputra]] to [[Taxila]]. Many have stylized forms and technically they are more accomplished, in that they have a well-defined shape and clear ornamentation. Some appear to have been made from moulds, yet there is little duplication. Terracotas from Taxila consists of deity figures, votive reliefs with deities, toys, dice, ornaments and beads. Among the ornaments were round medallions, similar to the ''bullae'' worn by Roman boys.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>  Terracotta images of folk gods and goddesses often have an earthy charm (some of them are perhaps dolls).  Many animal figures are probably toys for children.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Female figure, northern India, Maurya period, c. 320-200 BCE, terracotta, HAA.JPG|Female [[terracotta]] figure, northern India, c. 320-200 BCE\nFile:Indian - Head of an Indian Village Deity - Walters 2563 (cropped).jpg|Head of an Indian Village Deity, terracotta, 3rd century BCE\nFile:Indian - A Votive Figurine - Walters 25249 - Three Quarter Left (cropped).jpg|Mother goddess (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Elephant LACMA AC1994.233.2.jpg|Elephant (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Forepart of an Animal LACMA AC1994.233.1.jpg|Forepart of an animal (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Mathura, epoca maurya-sunga, scimmia, III-II sec ac. 02.JPG|Monkey (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd-2nd century BCE\n</gallery>\n\n===Ringstones===\n[[File:Ringstone MET DT9196.jpg|thumb|\"Ringstone with Four Goddesses and Four Date Palms\", [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York)<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 50, their no. 2</ref>]]\n[[File:MET 1987 142 374 O (cropped).jpg|thumb|Broken section with \"goddess\" flanked by birds, probably geese, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York)<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 50, their no. 4</ref>]]\n{{main|Ringstone}}\nThe ringstone is a distinctive type of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]] and miniature sculpture made in India during the approximate period of the Mauryan Empire and the following [[Sunga Empire]] (187-78 BCE).  They are usually dated to the 3rd or 2nd centuries BCE.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48; Bennett (2017); V&A</ref>  They are shaped like a [[doughnut]], but with straighter sides, and flat and plain on the bottom.  They are in stone, with the top side very finely carved in [[relief]] with several circular zones of decoration running around the hole in the centre.  When complete, they are about 2.5 to 4 inches across.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48-50; V&A. They may also be called \"ring stones\" or \"ring-stones\"</ref> \n\nThe designs vary, but all examples are finely carved, despite their small size.  A number of components appear in a variety of variations. Typically the innermost zone, which runs down the sloping sides of the hole, has standing female figures, often nude or nearly so, but with jewellery and elaborate hairstyles, with trees in between them.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48</ref>  These may be called \"goddesses\", or \"mother goddesses\", and the trees, apparently of various species, as the [[tree of life]], but these interpretations are not universally accepted.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48; V&A; Bennett (2017)</ref>\n\nTheir purpose, and any practical function, remains unclear and \"enigmatic\".  They may have a specific religious purpose, or a more general one promoting fertility, or been used to make jewellery by hammering metal foil over the designs.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48 (quoted); Bennett (2019), 99; V&A</ref>  About 70 have been found, many only as fragments, with a 2014 find in [[Thailand]] the first from outside the Indian subcontinent; it is assumed this was imported from India.<ref>Bennett (2019), 95</ref>\n\n== Painting ==\nWhile we can be sure of Mauryan proficiency in this field based on the descriptions of [[Megasthenes]], unfortunately no proper representative has been found to date.  Many centuries later, the paintings of the [[Ajanta Caves]], the oldest significant body of Indian painting, show there was a well-developed tradition, which may well stretch back to Mauryan times.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Lomas_Rishi_entrance.jpg|thumb|[[Lomas Rishi Cave]] in the [[Barabar Caves]], 3rd century BCE.]]\nWhile the period marked a second transition to use of brick and stone, wood was still the material of choice. [[Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]] advises the use of brick and stone for their durability. Yet he devotes a large section to safeguards to be taken against conflagrations in wooden buildings indicating their popularity.\n\n[[File:Kumhrar Maurya level ASIEC 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|Plan of the 80-columns pillared hall in [[Kumhrar]].]]\nThe Greek ambassador [[Megasthenes]] mentions that the capital city of [[Pataliputra]] was encircled by a massive timber-palisade, perforated by holes or slits through which archers could shoot. It had sixty-four gates and 570 towers.<ref>Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). ''Ancient India'', New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}}, p.281</ref> According to [[Strabo]], the gilded pillars of the palace were adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The palace stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds. It was furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs. Excavations carried out by Spooner and Waddell have brought to light remains of huge wooden palisades at [[Bulandi Bagh]] in [[Pataliputra]]. The remains of one of the buildings, an 80 pillared hall at [[Kumrahar]] are of particular significance. Out of 80 stone columns, that once stood on a wooden platform and supported a wooden roof, Spooner was able to discover the entire lower part of at least one in almost perfect conditions. It is more or less similar to an Ashokan pillar, smooth, polished and made of grey [[Chunar stone|Chunar sandstone]].<ref name=Mahajan>Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). ''Ancient India'', New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}}, p.349</ref>\n\nMany stupas like those at [[Sanchi]], [[Sarnath]] and probably [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] were originally built as brick and masonry mounds during the reign of [[Ashoka]]. Unfortunately they were renovated many times, which leaves us with hardly a clue of the original structures.\n\n== Pottery ==\nUse of the potters wheel became universal. The pottery associated with the Mauryan period consists of many types of ware. But the most highly developed technique is seen in a special type of pottery known as the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] (NBP), which was the hallmark of the preceding and early Mauryan periods.  The NBP ware is made of finely levigated alluvial clay, which when seen in section is usually of a grey and sometimes of a red hue. It has a brilliantly burnished dressing of the quality of a glaze which ranges from a jet black to a deep grey or a metallic steel blue. Occasionally small red-brown patches are apparent on the surface. It can be distinguished from other polished or graphite-coated red wares by its peculiar lustre and brilliance. \n\nThis ware was used largely for dishes and small bowls.

It represented an important transition in Indian art from use of wood to stone. It was a royal art patronized by Mauryan kings especially [[Ashoka]]. Pillars, Stupas, caves are the most prominent survivals.\n\n[[File:Elephant-sculpture-dhauli.JPG|thumb|The stone elephant at [[Dhauli]].]]\nThe most significant remains of monumental Mauryan art include the remains of the royal palace and the city of [[Pataliputra]], a monolithic rail at [[Sarnath]], the ''Bodhimandala'' or the altar resting on four pilars at [[Bodhgaya]], the rock-cut [[chaitya]]-halls in the [[Barabar Caves]] near [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] including the Sudama cave bearing the inscription dated the 12th regnal year of [[Ashoka]], the non-edict bearing and edict bearing pillars, the animal sculptures crowning the pillars with animal and vegetal reliefs decorating the abaci of the capitals and the front half of the representation of an elephant carved out in the round from a live rock at Dhauli.<ref>Mahajan V.D.

The elaborately carved animal capitals surviving on from some [[Pillars of Ashoka]] are the best known works, and among the finest, above all the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] from [[Sarnath]] that is now the [[National Emblem of India]]. Coomaraswamy distinguishes between court art and a more popular art during the Mauryan period. Court art is represented by the pillars and their capitals,<ref name=Thapar>Thapar, Romila (2001). ''{{IAST|A\u015boka}} and the Decline of the Mauryas'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-564445-X}}, pp.267-70</ref> and surviving popular art by some stone pieces, and many smaller works in [[terracotta]]. \n\nThe highly polished surface of court sculpture is often called [[Mauryan polish]]. However this seems not to be entirely reliable as a diagnostic tool for a Mauryan date, as some works from considerably later periods also have it.  The [[Didarganj Yakshi]], now most often thought to be from the 2nd century CE, is an example.  \n\n===Pillars and their capitals===\n{{see also|Pillars of Ashoka}}\n[[File:Pataliputra capital, Bihar Museum, Patna, 3rd century BCE.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pataliputra capital]], showing both Achaemenid and [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Greek influence]],  with [[volute]], [[bead and reel]], [[Meander (art)|meander]] and [[Palmette|honeysuckle]] designs.

These pillars were carved in two types of stone. Some were of the spotted red and white sandstone from the region of [[Mathura]], the others of buff-coloured fine grained hard sandstone usually with small black spots quarried in the [[Chunar]] near [[Varanasi]]. The uniformity of style in the pillar capitals suggests that they were all sculpted by craftsmen from the same region. It would therefore seem, that stone transported from Mathura and Chunar to the various sites where the pillars have been found and here the stone was cut and carved by craftsmen<ref name=\"Thapar\"/> They were given a fine polish characteristic of Mauryan sculpture. \n\nThese pillars were mainly erected in the [[Gangetic plains]]. They were inscribed with edicts of Ashoka on [[Dhamma]] or righteousness. The animal capital as a finely carved lifelike representation, noteworthy are the lion capital of [[Sarnath]], the bull capital of [[Rampurva]] and the lion capital of [[Lauria Nandangarh]]. Much speculation has been made about the similarity between these capitals and [[Achaemenid]] works.\n\n===\"Popular\" sculpture===\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|Statuettes of the Mauryan era]]\n[[File:Patna Yakshas and inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The two monumental [[Yaksha]]s discovered in [[Patna]] (size: 2 meters tall), and thought to be 3rd century BCE.

This consisted of sculpture which probably was not commissioned by the emperor. The patrons of the popular art were the local governors and the more well-to-do subjects. It is represented by figures such as the female figure of Besnagar, the male figure of Parkham and the [[Didarganj Yakshi|whisk-bearer from Didarganj]] (although its age is debated). Technically they are fashioned with less skill than the pillar capitals. They express a considerable earthiness and physical vitality.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>\n\nThe stone elephant at [[Dhauli]] was also probably carved by local craftsmen and not by the court-based artists who were responsible for the animal capitals. The image of the elephant emerging from the rock is a most impressive one, and its purpose was probably to draw attention to the inscription nearby.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>\n\n===Terracottas===\nPopular [[terracotta]] objects of various sizes have been found at Mauryan sites, and elsewhere, and are probably the most numerous Mauryan works of art.  Made by local people who may not have been specialists, but for example potters with a sideline, they are very difficult to date if not recorded as coming from an identifiable archaeological context.  Many are regarded as pre-Mauryan, but a continuation of the tradition of making mother-goddesses in clay, which dates back to the prehistoric period is revealed by the discovery of these objects at Mauryan levels during the excavations at Ahicchatra. \n\nThey are found more commonly from [[Pataliputra]] to [[Taxila]]. Many have stylized forms and technically they are more accomplished, in that they have a well-defined shape and clear ornamentation. Some appear to have been made from moulds, yet there is little duplication. Terracotas from Taxila consists of deity figures, votive reliefs with deities, toys, dice, ornaments and beads. Among the ornaments were round medallions, similar to the ''bullae'' worn by Roman boys.<ref name=\"Thapar\"/>  Terracotta images of folk gods and goddesses often have an earthy charm (some of them are perhaps dolls).  Many animal figures are probably toys for children.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Female figure, northern India, Maurya period, c. 320-200 BCE, terracotta, HAA.JPG|Female [[terracotta]] figure, northern India, c. 320-200 BCE\nFile:Indian - Head of an Indian Village Deity - Walters 2563 (cropped).jpg|Head of an Indian Village Deity, terracotta, 3rd century BCE\nFile:Indian - A Votive Figurine - Walters 25249 - Three Quarter Left (cropped).jpg|Mother goddess (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Elephant LACMA AC1994.233.2.jpg|Elephant (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Forepart of an Animal LACMA AC1994.233.1.jpg|Forepart of an animal (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd century BCE\nFile:Mathura, epoca maurya-sunga, scimmia, III-II sec ac. 02.JPG|Monkey (terracotta) from [[Mathura]], 3rd-2nd century BCE\n</gallery>\n\n===Ringstones===\n[[File:Ringstone MET DT9196.jpg|thumb|\"Ringstone with Four Goddesses and Four Date Palms\", [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York)<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 50, their no. 2</ref>]]\n[[File:MET 1987 142 374 O (cropped).jpg|thumb|Broken section with \"goddess\" flanked by birds, probably geese, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York)<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 50, their no. 4</ref>]]\n{{main|Ringstone}}\nThe ringstone is a distinctive type of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefact]] and miniature sculpture made in India during the approximate period of the Mauryan Empire and the following [[Sunga Empire]] (187-78 BCE).  They are usually dated to the 3rd or 2nd centuries BCE.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48; Bennett (2017); V&A</ref>  They are shaped like a [[doughnut]], but with straighter sides, and flat and plain on the bottom.  They are in stone, with the top side very finely carved in [[relief]] with several circular zones of decoration running around the hole in the centre.  When complete, they are about 2.5 to 4 inches across.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48-50; V&A. They may also be called \"ring stones\" or \"ring-stones\"</ref> \n\nThe designs vary, but all examples are finely carved, despite their small size.  A number of components appear in a variety of variations. Typically the innermost zone, which runs down the sloping sides of the hole, has standing female figures, often nude or nearly so, but with jewellery and elaborate hairstyles, with trees in between them.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48</ref>  These may be called \"goddesses\", or \"mother goddesses\", and the trees, apparently of various species, as the [[tree of life]], but these interpretations are not universally accepted.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48; V&A; Bennett (2017)</ref>\n\nTheir purpose, and any practical function, remains unclear and \"enigmatic\".  They may have a specific religious purpose, or a more general one promoting fertility, or been used to make jewellery by hammering metal foil over the designs.<ref>Lerner and Kossak, 48 (quoted); Bennett (2019), 99; V&A</ref>  About 70 have been found, many only as fragments, with a 2014 find in [[Thailand]] the first from outside the Indian subcontinent; it is assumed this was imported from India.<ref>Bennett (2019), 95</ref>\n\n== Painting ==\nWhile we can be sure of Mauryan proficiency in this field based on the descriptions of [[Megasthenes]], unfortunately no proper representative has been found to date.  Many centuries later, the paintings of the [[Ajanta Caves]], the oldest significant body of Indian painting, show there was a well-developed tradition, which may well stretch back to Mauryan times.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Lomas_Rishi_entrance.jpg|thumb|[[Lomas Rishi Cave]] in the [[Barabar Caves]], 3rd century BCE.]]\nWhile the period marked a second transition to use of brick and stone, wood was still the material of choice. [[Kautilya]] in the [[Arthashastra]] advises the use of brick and stone for their durability. Yet he devotes a large section to safeguards to be taken against conflagrations in wooden buildings indicating their popularity.\n\n[[File:Kumhrar Maurya level ASIEC 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|Plan of the 80-columns pillared hall in [[Kumhrar]].]]\nThe Greek ambassador [[Megasthenes]] mentions that the capital city of [[Pataliputra]] was encircled by a massive timber-palisade, perforated by holes or slits through which archers could shoot. It had sixty-four gates and 570 towers.<ref>Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). ''Ancient India'', New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}}, p.281</ref> According to [[Strabo]], the gilded pillars of the palace were adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The palace stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds. It was furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs. Excavations carried out by Spooner and Waddell have brought to light remains of huge wooden palisades at [[Bulandi Bagh]] in [[Pataliputra]]. The remains of one of the buildings, an 80 pillared hall at [[Kumrahar]] are of particular significance. Out of 80 stone columns, that once stood on a wooden platform and supported a wooden roof, Spooner was able to discover the entire lower part of at least one in almost perfect conditions. It is more or less similar to an Ashokan pillar, smooth, polished and made of grey [[Chunar stone|Chunar sandstone]].<ref name=Mahajan>Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). ''Ancient India'', New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-219-0887-6}}, p.349</ref>\n\nMany stupas like those at [[Sanchi]], [[Sarnath]] and probably [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]] were originally built as brick and masonry mounds during the reign of [[Ashoka]]. Unfortunately they were renovated many times, which leaves us with hardly a clue of the original structures.\n\n== Pottery ==\nUse of the potters wheel became universal. The pottery associated with the Mauryan period consists of many types of ware. But the most highly developed technique is seen in a special type of pottery known as the [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] (NBP), which was the hallmark of the preceding and early Mauryan periods.  The NBP ware is made of finely levigated alluvial clay, which when seen in section is usually of a grey and sometimes of a red hue. It has a brilliantly burnished dressing of the quality of a glaze which ranges from a jet black to a deep grey or a metallic steel blue. Occasionally small red-brown patches are apparent on the surface. It can be distinguished from other polished or graphite-coated red wares by its peculiar lustre and brilliance. \n\nThis ware was used largely for dishes and small bowls. It is found in abundance in the [[Ganges]] valley. Although NBP was not very rare, it was obviously a more expensive ware than the other varieties, since potsherds of NBP were occasionally found riveted with copper pins indicating that even a cracked vessel in NBP ware had its value.<ref name=Romila>Thapar, Romila (2001).

{"title_page": "Subcategorization", "text_new": "In [[linguistics]], '''subcategorization''' refers to the types of [[verb argument|argument]]s required or allowed by [[lexical item]]s (usually verbs).<ref>Chomsky (1965) is a prominent early source on the concept of subcategorization.</ref> The properties of a word that are crucial to their linguistic analysis are included in its ''lexical entry''.<ref name=\":0\">Grimshaw, J. (2003). Subcategorization and Selection. In International Encyclopedia of Linguistics. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2 Apr. 2020</ref> Violating the requirements of subcategorization and selection will produce an ill-formed sentence. <blockquote>\"They put the papers {under the desk/*to the desk/*the desk/*tidy}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Keeping in mind that an asterisk (*) is used to indicate ungrammaticality, this example shows that out of the options given, only \"under the desk\" leads to the production of a well-formed sentence. The term selection is commonly used alongside subcategorization, but the two encode two different types of information.<ref name=\":0\" /> Selection is used to represent the semantic requirements placed on arguments and subcategorization is used to represent the syntactic requirements placed on complements.<blockquote>\"They tried to kill the {president/person/weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to murder the {president/person/*weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to assassinate the {president/*person/*weeds/*box}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Here we see that the object of the verb \"kill\" can be any living thing, that of \"murder\" must be human, and that of \"assassinate\" must be a famous human.\n\n==Lexical Entries==\nA lexical entry indicates crucial syntactic information about the heard of a phrase, such as what it selects and where it must be positioned. The term lexical entries come from the idea of the \"mental lexicon\", which specifies what speakers know about individual lexical items (Kroger, 2005). We can think of a lexical entry analogously to a dictionary entry. Each lexical item (LI) is associated with a lexical entry, minimally a triplet of features: Phonological, Formal, and Semantic, if not also other grammatical information such as irregular forms or patterns associated with that specific word (Kroger, 2005). Phonological features indicate pronunciation information and whether the LI is free or bound. Formal features indicate syntactic category labels, otherwise known as parts of speech. Finally, semantic features indicate meaning and theta roles. In accordance with X-Bar Theory and the Projection Principle, all of these features must be satisfied by each head in order to create a well formed sentence. For example, a partial lexical entry for the English noun ''dog'' has been illustrated below (Kroger, 2005). \n\n\n''dog'' /d\u00f4g/<br>\n\n'a domesticated carnivorous mammal, typically found with four legs\"<br>\n\n<sub>CAT</sub>: N<br>\n\n[+count]<br>\n\n<sub>PLURAL</sub>: ''dogs''\n\n\n\n===Argument Structure===\nArgument structure is the list of selected arguments associated with a lexical category, such as a verb (SKS, 2015). When every predicate, otherwise known as a verb, is used, it selects a specific set of arguments that need to be fulfilled to create a well-formed sentence (Kroger, 2005). These are arguments such as <small>AGENT</small>, <small>PATIENT</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>RECIPIENT</small>, and <small>STIMULUS</small>. To illustrate this, the sentence ''The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa'', has been broken down into its semantic roles and argument selections below. \n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! Category (Head) !! Selection Restriction: Argument Selection\n|-\n| ''ask'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<small>THEME</small>}\n|-\n| ''pee'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<sub>THEME</sub>}\n|-\n| ''adults'' || N || \n|-\n| ''cats'' || N || \n|-\n| ''sofa'' || N || {(PP<sub>THEME</sub>)}\n|}\n\n\nIt is necessary to understand the fundamentals of argument structure to understand the idea of subcategorization because subcategorization, as noted above, refers to the sub-categories a verb (or other semantic role) requires (Kroger, 2005). For example, the verb ''ask'' from above subcategorizes for a DP<small>AGENT</small> and CP<small>THEME</small>, otherwise known as a subject and direct object, respectively. In this way, subcategorization is an important piece of information to include in any lexical entry.\n\n===Thematic Roles and S-Selection===\n''Theta roles'' identify the meaning relation between the constituent and the selected predicate (SKS 2015). There are eight theta roles: <small>AGENT</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>CAUSE</small>, <small>POSSESSOR</small>, <small>LOCATION</small>,<small>GOAL</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, and <small>BENEFICIARY</small>. Each term indicates the relationship between the verb, predicate, and one of its arguments. This is what is called ''s-selection'', a shortening of semantic selection. S-Selection is an important addition to any lexical entry in order to make them easier to interpret (SKS 2015). It is important to understand that, according to the ''Theta Criterion'', every argument bears one and only one theta role (Chomsky, 1965). Below is an example for each theta role (SKS 2015):\n\n<small>CAUSE</small>: a cause; ''The dog bit the child. This made him cry''\n\n\n<small>AGENT</small>: a person on entity which intentionally is causing or doing something; ''Joshua intentionally hit him''\n\n\n<small>EXPERIENCER</small>: a sentient being inside of, or acquiring, a psychological state; ''Sam hates cats/Josh noticed Alice''\n\n\n<small>LOCATION</small>: a location; ''Marianne leaped through the field''\n\n\n<small>GOAL</small>: a location/being that is the endpoint; ''Moses gave Josh a toothbrush''\n\n\n<small>BENEFICIARY</small>: a beneficiary; ''Susie made cookies for Sarah''\n\n\n<small>POSSESSOR</small>: a possessor; ''Shelly owns cats''\n\n\n<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small>: what is possessed; ''Shelly's cats''\n*<small>POSSESSEE/POSSESSED</small> is a subset of <small>POSSESSOR</small> which is why it has been included but not given its own role\n\n\n<small>THEME</small>: something that undergoes a change, such as location change, or any kind of progression;''Josie sent Riven cookies/''\n*<small>THEME</small> is also commonly used for things that do not fit any other theta role, such as ''Josie is short'' or ''Sarah said that it is foggy''\n\n==Verbs==\nWhile subcategorization is a concept that can apply to almost any type of lexical item, it is usually discussed with respect to verbs. Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.<ref>See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.</ref> The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\n::Luke worked.\n::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.\n::Tom waited for us.\n\nThe verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb ''ate/eat'' is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here ''Indiana Jones'' and ''chilled monkey brain''), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb ''waited/wait'' subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition ''for''. In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:\n\n::work [NP __ ]\n::eat [NP __ (NP)]\n::wait [NP __ (''for'' NP)]\n\nThese examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as [[lexicon|lexical]] information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.\n\nSubcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of [[phrase structure grammar]]s, e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Minimalism (linguistics)|Minimalism]].\n\n==Occurrences==\nSubcategorization can be observed in any language, including but not limited to:\nFrench\nGerman\nMandarin \n==Valency==\nThe subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], although subcategorization originates with [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] tradition,<ref>See Chomsky (1965).</ref> whereas valency originates with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] of the [[dependency grammar]] tradition.<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject. As it was originally conceived of, subcategorization did not include the subject, that is, a verb subcategorized for its [[complement (linguistics)|complement]](s) (=object and oblique arguments) but not for its subject.<ref>For examples of theories that exclude the subject from subcategorization frames, see Burton-Roberts (1886:73ff.), Horrocks (1986:34f.), Haegeman (1994:40-42, 45 note 10), Bennet (1995:43ff.), Green and Morgan (1996:68 note 6), Fromkin et al. (2000:230).</ref> Many modern theories now include the subject in the subcategorization frame, however.<ref>For examples of theories that include the subject in the subcategorization frame, see Kaplan and Bresnan (1982:210-212), Cattell (198428ff.), Pollard and Sag (1994:23), Culicover (1997:17), Carnie (2007:50ff.).</ref> Valency, in contrast, included the subject from the start.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:109, chapter 51, paragraph 13) emphasized that from a syntactic point of view, the subject is a complement just like the object.</ref> In this regard, subcategorization is moving in the direction of valency, since many phrase structure grammars now see verbs subcategorizing for their subject as well as for their object(s).\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Argument (linguistics)|Argument]]\n*[[Complement (linguistics)|Complement]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Lexical item]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammar)|Transitivity]]\n*[[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col}}\n* Bennet, P. 1995.

Spikes in approval coincide with the September 11 attacks, the invasion of Iraq, and the capture of Saddam Hussein.]]\n\nThe '''rally 'round the flag effect''' (or '''syndrome''') is a concept used in [[political science]] and [[international relations]] to explain increased short-run popular support of the [[President of the United States]] during periods of [[international crisis]] or [[war]].<ref name=\"Goldstein\">Goldstein, Joshua S.; Pevehouse, Jon C. (2008). ''International Relations: Eighth Edition''. New York: Pearson Longman.</ref> Because rally 'round the flag effect can reduce criticism of governmental policies, it can be seen as a factor of [[diversionary foreign policy]].<ref name=\"Goldstein\"/> In 2020, there was some evidence of a similar effect in [[Europe]] for other heads of government, in particular [[Boris Johnson]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]],<ref name=Economist>{{cite news|url=|accessdate=|date=April 11-17, 2020|work=The Economist|title=Patient number one; Missing Boris: The illness of a man who once divided the nation has united it|page=34-36}}</ref>  although \"it might not last.\"<ref name=Erlanger>{{cite news|url=|work=New York Times|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=|first=Steven|last=Erlanger|title=Popular support Lifts Leaders Everywhere. It May Not Last.|page=A6}}</ref>\n\n== Mueller's definition ==\nPolitical scientist [[John Mueller]] suggested the effect in 1970, in a landmark paper called \"Presidential Popularity from Truman to Johnson\". He defined it as coming from an event with three qualities:<ref name=\"Mueller\">{{cite journal |last=Mueller |first=John |title=Presidential Popularity from Truman to Johnson |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201334 |year=1970 |doi=10.2307/1955610 |jstor=1955610}}</ref>\n\n#\"Is international\"\n#\"Involves the United States and particularly the President directly\"\n#\"Specific, dramatic, and sharply focused\"\n\nIn addition, Mueller created five categories of rallies. These categories are considered dated by modern political scientists, as they rely heavily on [[Cold War]] events.<ref name=\"Hetherington\">{{Cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|last2=Nelson|first2=Michael|date=2003|title=Anatomy of a Rally Effect: George W. Bush and the War on Terrorism|jstor=3649343|journal=PS: Political Science and Politics|volume=36|issue=1|pages=37\u201342|doi=10.1017/S1049096503001665}}</ref> Mueller's five categories are:\n\n#\"Sudden US military intervention\" (e.g., [[Korean War]], [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]])\n#\"Major diplomatic actions\" (e.g., [[Truman Doctrine]])\n#\"Dramatic technological developments\" (e.g., [[Sputnik crisis|Sputnik]])\n#\"US-Soviet summit meetings\" (e.g., [[Potsdam Conference]])\n#\"Major military developments in ongoing wars\" (e.g., [[Tet Offensive]])\n\n== Causes and durations ==\nSince Mueller's original theories, two schools of thought have emerged to explain the causes of the effect. The first, \"The Patriotism School of Thought\" holds that in times of crisis, the American public sees the President as the embodiment of national unity. The second, \"The Opinion Leadership School\" believes that the rally emerges from a lack of criticism from members of the opposition party, most often in the [[United States Congress]]. If opposition party members appear to support the president, the media has no conflict to report, thus it appears to the public that all is well with the performance of the president.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=William D.|last2=Oneal|first2=John R.|date=2001|title=Patriotism or Opinion Leadership?: The Nature and Origins of the 'Rally 'Round the Flag' Effect|jstor=3176318|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=45|issue=5|pages=661\u2013687|doi=10.1177/0022002701045005006}}</ref> The two theories have both been criticized, but it is generally accepted that the Patriotism School of thought is better to explain causes of rallies, while the Opinion Leadership School of thought is better to explain duration of rallies.<ref name=\"Hetherington\"/> It is also believed that the lower the presidential approval rating before the crisis, the larger the increase will be in terms of percentage points because it leaves the president more room for improvement. For example, Franklin Roosevelt only had a 12% increase in approval from 72% to 84% following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], whereas George W. Bush had a 39% increase from 51% to 90% following the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=\"Chapman\">{{cite journal |last1=Chapman |first1=Terrence L. |last2=Reiter |first2=Dan |authorlink2=Dan Reiter |year=2004 |title=The United Nations Security Council and the Rally 'Round the Flag Effect |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=886\u2013909 |jstor=4149799 |doi=10.1177/0022002704269353}}</ref>\n\nAnother theory about the cause of the effect is believed to be embedded in the [[US Constitution]]. Unlike in other countries, the constitution makes the President both [[head of government]] and [[head of state]]. Because of this, the president receives a temporary boost in popularity because his Head of State role gives him symbolic importance to the American people. However, as time goes on his duties as Head of Government require partisan decisions that polarize opposition parties and diminish popularity. This theory falls in line more with the Opinion Leadership School.\n\nDue to the highly statistical nature of presidential polls, University of Alabama political scientist John O'Neal has approached the study of rally 'round the flag using mathematics. O'Neal has postulated that the Opinion Leadership School is the more accurate of the two using mathematical equations. These equations are based on quantified factors such as the number of headlines from the [[New York Times]] about the crisis, the presence of bipartisan support or hostility, and prior popularity of the president.<ref name=\"Lian\">{{cite journal |last1=Lian |first1=Bradley |first2=John R. |last2=O'Neal |title=Presidents, the Use of Military Force, and Public Opinion |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=277\u2013300 |year=1993 |jstor=174524 |doi=10.1177/0022002793037002003}}.</ref>\n\nPolitical Scientist from [[University of California, Los Angeles|The University of California Los Angeles]], Matthew A. Baum found that the source of a rally 'round the flag effect is from independents and members of the opposition party shifting their support behind the President after the rallying effect. Baum also found that when the country is more divided or in a worse economic state then the rally effect is larger. This is because more people who are against the president before the rallying event switch to support him afterwards. When the country is divided before the rallying event there is a higher potential increase in support for the President after the rallying event.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baum|first=Matthew A.|date=2002-06-01|title=The Constituent Foundations of the Rally-Round-the-Flag Phenomenon|journal=International Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=263\u2013298|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00232|issn=1468-2478}}</ref>\n\nIn a study by Political Scientist Terrence L. Chapman and Dan Reiter, rallies in Presidential approval ratings were found to be bigger when there was U.N. Security Council supported Militarized interstate disputes (MIDs). Having U.N. Security Council support was found to increase the rally effect in presidential approval by 8 to 9 points compared to when there wasn't U.N. Security Council support.<ref name=\"Chapman\" />\n\nAccording to a 2019 study of ten countries in the period 1990\u20132014, there is evidence of a rally-around-the-flag effect early on in an intervention with military casualties (in at least the first year) but voters begin to punish the governing parties after 4.5 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuijpers|first=Dieuwertje|title=Rally around All the Flags: The Effect of Military Casualties on Incumbent Popularity in Ten Countries 1990\u20132014|journal=Foreign Policy Analysis|volume=15|issue=3|pages=392\u2013412|language=en|doi=10.1093/fpa/orz014|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n== Historical examples ==\nThe effect has been examined within the context of nearly every major foreign policy crisis since [[World War II]].

It May Not Last.|page=A6}}</ref>\n\n== Mueller's definition ==\nPolitical scientist [[John Mueller]] suggested the effect in 1970, in a landmark paper called \"Presidential Popularity from Truman to Johnson\". He defined it as coming from an event with three qualities:<ref name=\"Mueller\">{{cite journal |last=Mueller |first=John |title=Presidential Popularity from Truman to Johnson |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=18\u201334 |year=1970 |doi=10.2307/1955610 |jstor=1955610}}</ref>\n\n#\"Is international\"\n#\"Involves the United States and particularly the President directly\"\n#\"Specific, dramatic, and sharply focused\"\n\nIn addition, Mueller created five categories of rallies. These categories are considered dated by modern political scientists, as they rely heavily on [[Cold War]] events.<ref name=\"Hetherington\">{{Cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|last2=Nelson|first2=Michael|date=2003|title=Anatomy of a Rally Effect: George W. Bush and the War on Terrorism|jstor=3649343|journal=PS: Political Science and Politics|volume=36|issue=1|pages=37\u201342|doi=10.1017/S1049096503001665}}</ref> Mueller's five categories are:\n\n#\"Sudden US military intervention\" (e.g., [[Korean War]], [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]])\n#\"Major diplomatic actions\" (e.g., [[Truman Doctrine]])\n#\"Dramatic technological developments\" (e.g., [[Sputnik crisis|Sputnik]])\n#\"US-Soviet summit meetings\" (e.g., [[Potsdam Conference]])\n#\"Major military developments in ongoing wars\" (e.g., [[Tet Offensive]])\n\n== Causes and durations ==\nSince Mueller's original theories, two schools of thought have emerged to explain the causes of the effect. The first, \"The Patriotism School of Thought\" holds that in times of crisis, the American public sees the President as the embodiment of national unity. The second, \"The Opinion Leadership School\" believes that the rally emerges from a lack of criticism from members of the opposition party, most often in the [[United States Congress]]. If opposition party members appear to support the president, the media has no conflict to report, thus it appears to the public that all is well with the performance of the president.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=William D.|last2=Oneal|first2=John R.|date=2001|title=Patriotism or Opinion Leadership?: The Nature and Origins of the 'Rally 'Round the Flag' Effect|jstor=3176318|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=45|issue=5|pages=661\u2013687|doi=10.1177/0022002701045005006}}</ref> The two theories have both been criticized, but it is generally accepted that the Patriotism School of thought is better to explain causes of rallies, while the Opinion Leadership School of thought is better to explain duration of rallies.<ref name=\"Hetherington\"/> It is also believed that the lower the presidential approval rating before the crisis, the larger the increase will be in terms of percentage points because it leaves the president more room for improvement. For example, Franklin Roosevelt only had a 12% increase in approval from 72% to 84% following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], whereas George W. Bush had a 39% increase from 51% to 90% following the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=\"Chapman\">{{cite journal |last1=Chapman |first1=Terrence L. |last2=Reiter |first2=Dan |authorlink2=Dan Reiter |year=2004 |title=The United Nations Security Council and the Rally 'Round the Flag Effect |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=886\u2013909 |jstor=4149799 |doi=10.1177/0022002704269353}}</ref>\n\nAnother theory about the cause of the effect is believed to be embedded in the [[US Constitution]]. Unlike in other countries, the constitution makes the President both [[head of government]] and [[head of state]]. Because of this, the president receives a temporary boost in popularity because his Head of State role gives him symbolic importance to the American people. However, as time goes on his duties as Head of Government require partisan decisions that polarize opposition parties and diminish popularity. This theory falls in line more with the Opinion Leadership School.\n\nDue to the highly statistical nature of presidential polls, University of Alabama political scientist John O'Neal has approached the study of rally 'round the flag using mathematics. O'Neal has postulated that the Opinion Leadership School is the more accurate of the two using mathematical equations. These equations are based on quantified factors such as the number of headlines from the [[New York Times]] about the crisis, the presence of bipartisan support or hostility, and prior popularity of the president.<ref name=\"Lian\">{{cite journal |last1=Lian |first1=Bradley |first2=John R. |last2=O'Neal |title=Presidents, the Use of Military Force, and Public Opinion |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=277\u2013300 |year=1993 |jstor=174524 |doi=10.1177/0022002793037002003}}.</ref>\n\nPolitical Scientist from [[University of California, Los Angeles|The University of California Los Angeles]], Matthew A. Baum found that the source of a rally 'round the flag effect is from independents and members of the opposition party shifting their support behind the President after the rallying effect. Baum also found that when the country is more divided or in a worse economic state then the rally effect is larger. This is because more people who are against the president before the rallying event switch to support him afterwards. When the country is divided before the rallying event there is a higher potential increase in support for the President after the rallying event.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baum|first=Matthew A.|date=2002-06-01|title=The Constituent Foundations of the Rally-Round-the-Flag Phenomenon|journal=International Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=263\u2013298|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00232|issn=1468-2478}}</ref>\n\nIn a study by Political Scientist Terrence L. Chapman and Dan Reiter, rallies in Presidential approval ratings were found to be bigger when there was U.N. Security Council supported Militarized interstate disputes (MIDs). Having U.N. Security Council support was found to increase the rally effect in presidential approval by 8 to 9 points compared to when there wasn't U.N. Security Council support.<ref name=\"Chapman\" />\n\nAccording to a 2019 study of ten countries in the period 1990\u20132014, there is evidence of a rally-around-the-flag effect early on in an intervention with military casualties (in at least the first year) but voters begin to punish the governing parties after 4.5 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuijpers|first=Dieuwertje|title=Rally around All the Flags: The Effect of Military Casualties on Incumbent Popularity in Ten Countries 1990\u20132014|journal=Foreign Policy Analysis|volume=15|issue=3|pages=392\u2013412|language=en|doi=10.1093/fpa/orz014|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n== Historical examples ==\nThe effect has been examined within the context of nearly every major foreign policy crisis since [[World War II]].

Using the limited amount of materials available in the camp he took on the activity of painting, at the age of almost 30 and without any kind of academic reference.<ref>Barzini, Luigi, \"Rome: Where Art is Forever Italy\", The New York Times (22 December 1969). p.40</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Parola_di_Burri_I_pensieri_di_una_vita.html?id=s0fNDAEACAAJ&redir_esc=y Zorzi, Stefano (2016).

He moved to Rome as a guest of the violinist and composer Annibale Bucchi, his mother's cousin, who encouraged his activity as a painter.<ref>Carandente, Giovanni (2007). \"Burri: memories of a friendship, 1948\u20131988\".

However, Burri\u2019s artistic production flowed definitively into abstract forms before the end of the same year, the use of small format [[tempera]] resulting from the influence of such artists as [[Jean Dubuffet]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], whose studio was visited by Burri during a trip to Paris in the winter of 1948.<ref>Serafini, Giuliano (2015). ''Burri: matter first''. Milan: Giunti. p. 37</ref>\n\n==== Tars, Molds, Hunchbacks ====\nBurri's artistic research became personal in short time, between 1948 and 1950 he began experimenting with using unusual, 'unorthodox' materials such as [[tar]], [[sand]], [[zinc]], [[pumice]], and [[Aluminium]] dust as well as [[Polyvinyl chloride]] glue, this last material being elevated to the same importance as oil colors. During this artistic transition, the painter showed his sensitivity to the mixed-media type of abstraction of [[Enrico Prampolini]], a central figure in Italian [[Abstract art]]. Nonetheless Burri went one step further in his ''Catrami'' (Tars), presenting tar not as a simple [[collage]] material, but as an actual color which \u2013 by way of different lucid and opaque shades in monochrome black\u2013, blended itself with the totality of the painting.<ref>Brandi, Cesare (1963). ''Burri''. Rome: Editalia. p.22: \u201c''Burri did not begins with collage: the first pictures of '48 are all paintings. But in the earliest of them, the first Nero (Black) one, with a little blue square (and round and oval elements), the passage from shiny to opaque black acts not as a color but as material, like the right and wrong sides of a piece of satin''.\u201d</ref><ref>Serafini, Giuliano (2015). ''Burri: matter first''. Milan: Giunti. pp. 42\u201343: \u201c''Burri intuition was decisive. For centuries, art history has posited a kind of duality in which matter served as artist\u2019s tool, as the factor that, to become form, must necessarily be subjected to an operation of sublimation''.\u201d</ref><ref>Cor\u00e0, Bruno (2015). \"Burri, the First One Hundred Years of Greatness\".

In some artworks of the same period which he called ''Gobbi'' (Hunchbacks), Burri focused on the painting\u2019s spatial interaction, achieving another original outcome due to the incorporation of tree branches on the rear of the canvas which pushed two-dimensionality towards [[Three-dimensional space]].<ref name=\":1\">Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn (1997). \"Alberto Burri, The Surface at Risk\", in Tolomeo, Maria Grazia, Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn.

''Burri matter first''.

In a word, matter became the subject''.\"</ref>\n\nThe formal artistic elegance and the spatial balances obtained through aeroform steams, craters, rips, overlapping color layers and different forms, differentiated Burri\u2019s art, founded on attentive reflections and precise calculations, from the impulsive gestures that characterized [[Action painting]] during the same period.<ref>Tomassoni, Italo (2016). \"Burri, de Kooning, Pollock: Parallel Convergences\".

Exhibition catalogue. p. 7</ref>\n\n==== Combustions, Woods, Irons, Plastics ====\nThe procedure adopted for the ''Combustioni'' (Combustions) passed from paper to the ''Legni'' (Woods) around 1957, in thin sheets of wood veneer fastened to canvas and other supports.<ref>Nordland, Gerald (1977). ''Alberto Burri A retrospective view 1948\u20131977.'' Los Angeles: Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery Editions.

The best known application of this procedure was reached in the ''Plastiche'' (Plastics) during the Sixties, when a gradual critic openness towards Burri's art showed up in Italy as well.\n\nThe blowtorch was only apparently a destructive device. Indeed, the craters modeled by the flame on cellophane, black, red or transparent plastic or on the ''Bianchi Plastica'' (White Plastic) series, in which the transparent plastic is laid on a white or black support, were lightly directed by the painter's blowing. The balances of the matter were thus highlighted once again, in a sort of 'defiance' towards of flame's randomness on the one hand, and in a sort of attempt to 'dominate chance', intrinsic to Burri's philosophy, on the other.<ref>Pirovano, Carlo (1996). \"The Seasons of Fire\".

In Melandri, Luisa, with Duncan, Michael. ''Combustione, Alberto Burri and America''. Los Angeles: Santa Monica Museum of Art. Exhibition catalogue. p. 22</ref> During his recurrent trips to [[Death Valley National Park]], the artist found in the natural cracking of the desert the visual spur which led him, starting from 1973, to create ''Cretti'' (Cracks) developing the use of the crackled paint effect of his 1940's artworks.<ref>Melandri, Luisa (2010). Ibidem. p. 23: \"''The noun 'cretto' \u2013 from the verb crettare in rare old Tuscan Italian \u2013 refers to small cracks that appear in plaster walls. The wod was originally most often used to describe the cracks that might appear in the 'intonaco' of a fresco. The term is therefore not only descriptive but links Burri\u2019s works to the mural traditions of his native Italy \u2013 and to Renaissance art-making''.\"</ref>\n\nEmploying a special mixture of kaolin, resins and pigment, the painter dried its surface with the heat of an oven. Burri arrested the heating process at the desired moment using a PVA glue layer, thus obtaining greater and lesser cracking effects, which were always balanced thanks to the painter's extensive knowledge of chemistry.<ref>Tomassoni, Italo (2015): \"Alberto Burri: His Cretti (Cracks) and Their Roots in the History of Art\".

It is one of the largest works of art ever realized, extending over an area of approximately 85,000 square meters. Its white concrete covering expands over the town, following the old street map in long arterial roads and corridors, which are walkable, thus symbolically bringing the devastated town back to life.\n\n==== Cellotex and the large cycles of paintings ====\nDuring the Seventies Burri's art saw a gradual transition towards wider dimensions, while retrospectives followed one another around the world. The great solo exhibition crossing the United States in 1977\u201378 and ending at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York is one example.\n\nIn the 1979 cycle of paintings called ''Il Viaggio'' (The Journey) Burri retraced, through ten monumental compositions, the key moments of his artistic production.<ref>The artist polemically excluded the ''Sacchi'', which many critics were considering his major works, to emancipate his production from the \u2018''lazy crystallization of his expressive message''\u2019 (Pirovano, Carlo. 2015. \"Burri, the Investigation of Space\".

An example is the recurrent motif of the [[archivolt]], viewed in its plain form in painting and in perspective in such iron sculptures as ''Teatro Scultura'' \u2013 a work presented at 1984 Venice Biennale \u2013, and in the 1972 [[Ogive]] series in ''[[ceramics]]''.<ref>Duranti, Massimo (2011).\"From form to matter, to abstract form: the development of Alberto Burri\u2019s aesthetic devolution\".

Other sculptures on iron are permanently held in Citt\u00e0 di Castello museums, Ravenna, Celle (Pistoia), Perugia and Milan, where the rotating wings of the ''Teatro Continuo'' (Continuous Theatre) is both real scenic space and sculpture, employing the [[Sforza Castle]] park as natural backcloth.<ref>The work was built on the occasion of the 1973 Milan Triennale, then demolished in 1989 by the municipality.

''Il Teatro Continuo di Alberto Burri''. Mantova: Corraini. Italian/English. {{ISBN|9788875705091}}</ref>\n\n=== Theatre sets ===\nTheater had a privileged role in Burri's artistic production. Though in isolated interventions, the painter worked in the fields of prose, ballet and opera. In 1963 Burri designed the sets for ''Spirituals'', [[Morton Gould]]'s ballet at [[La Scala]], in Milan. The painter's ''Plastiche'' emphasized the dramatic force of such plays as the 1969 [[Ignazio Silone]] stage adaptation in San Miniato (Pisa) and [[Tristan and Iseult]], performed in 1975 at the Teatro Regio in Turin.\n\nIn 1973 Burri designed sets and costumes for ''November Steps'', conceived by his wife Minsa Craig, with a score by [[Toru Takemitsu]]. The ballet was interacting with an early example of visual art by a film clip depicting how the ''Cretti'' progressively came into being.\n\n== Graphic work ==\nBurri never considered graphic art of secondary importance to painting. He participated intensively in the experimentation of new printing techniques as the 1965 reproduction of the ''Combustioni'' \u2013 in which the brothers Valter and Eleonora Rossi perfectly succeeded in mimicking the effect of burning on paper \u2013, or the irregular ''Cretti'' cavities (1971) with the same printers.\n\nFurther innovative developments can be found in the silk screens ''Sestante'' (1987\u201389) \u2013 with the help of Burri's old friend and collaborator [[Nuvolo]] \u2013 to the ''Mixoblack'' series (1988), created in Los Angeles with printers Luis and Lea Remba on marble dust and sand in particular three-dimensional effects.<ref>Sarteanesi, Chiara (2015). \"Tradition and Innovation in Alberto Burri\u2019s Graphic Art\".

Brin and her husband, Gaspero del Corso founded the Obelisco Gallery, the first art gallery to open in Postwar Rome, featuring the 1952 solo exhibition ''Muffe e Neri'' (Molds and Blacks) and the first ''Combustions'' in 1957. The Burri's first exhibition with the ''Sacchi'' was presented by the poet [[Emilio Villa]] at the Origine Foundation in 1952, in confirmation of his increasingly original production. The ''Ferri'' (Irons) were held at Galleria Blu in Milan.\n\nFrom 1953 on, Burri regularly exhibited his works in the United States, at the Allan Frumkin Gallery (Chicago), the [[Stable Gallery]] and the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. In the same year, the director and curator of Guggenheim Museum [[James Johnson Sweeney]] included Burri in the landmark exhibition ''Younger European Painters: A Selection'' bringing his work to focus in the international community.\n\nBurri's initially seesawing relationship with the [[Venice Biennale]] marked its turning point in 1960, when he was offered his first solo area by [[Giulio Carlo Argan]]. In 1962 [[Cesare Brandi]] presented the ''Plastiche'' at the [[Marlborough Fine Art]] in Rome. The first anthological retrospectives were held around this time and in the following decade, as the solo exhibitions at the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris (1972), the one in [[Francis of Assisi]] Sacred Convent (1975) and the great traveling exhibit which started at the [[UCLA]]'s Frederick S. Wight Gallery in Los Angeles, moved to the Marion Koogler McNay Art Institute in San Antonio (Texas) and ended in 1978 at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]].\n\nFrom 1979 on, the ''Large Cycles'' of paintings on ''Cellotex'' dominated Burri's entire subsequent production, which was conceived for big spaces such as cathedrals (like the 1981 Cycle in Florence titled ''Gli Orti'') or former industrial complexes, like the Giudecca Isle's ex-boatyards in Venice, where he exhibited the chromatic series ''Sestante''. In 1994, Burri presented the cycle titled ''Burri The Athens Polyptych. Architecture with Cactus'' for the exhibit curated by Giuliano Serfafini at the [[National Gallery (Athens)]], and then at the Italian Institute of Culture in Madrid (1995).\n\nThe 1996 posthumous anthological exhibition at [[Palazzo delle Esposizioni]] (Rome) was successfully repeated at [[Lenbachhaus]] (Munich) and at the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]]. In 2015\u201316 the major retrospective exhibition ''The Trauma of Painting'' organized by Emily Braun at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York (later at the [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]], D\u00fcsseldorf in 2016) received much international attention to the painter's art.\n\nAt the conclusion of the centenary of Alberto Burri's birth, the exhibition titled ''Burri Lo spazio di materia tra Europa e USA'' curated by Bruno Cor\u00e0 established a comparison between the epigones of 20th century material art. The exhibit was held in Citt\u00e0 di Castello, in the exhibition space of the former tobacco drying sheds which, since 2017, house the painter's graphic collection.<ref>\"''The artworks of post-war artist Alberto Burri celebrated in his native town of Citt\u00e0 di Castello after exhibitions in New York and Dusseldorf''\".

However, Burri\u2019s artistic production flowed definitively into abstract forms before the end of the same year, the use of small format [[tempera]] resulting from the influence of such artists as [[Jean Dubuffet]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], whose studio was visited by Burri during a trip to Paris in the winter of 1948.<ref>Serafini, Giuliano (2015). ''Burri: matter first''. Milan: Giunti. p. 37</ref>\n\n==== Tars, Molds, Hunchbacks ====\nBurri's artistic research became personal in short time, between 1948 and 1950 he began experimenting with using unusual, 'unorthodox' materials such as [[tar]], [[sand]], [[zinc]], [[pumice]], and [[Aluminium]] dust as well as [[Polyvinyl chloride]] glue, this last material being elevated to the same importance as oil colors. During this artistic transition, the painter showed his sensitivity to the mixed-media type of abstraction of [[Enrico Prampolini]], a central figure in Italian [[Abstract art]]. Nonetheless Burri went one step further in his ''Catrami'' (Tars), presenting tar not as a simple [[collage]] material, but as an actual color which \u2013 by way of different lucid and opaque shades in monochrome black\u2013, blended itself with the totality of the painting.<ref>Brandi, Cesare (1963). ''Burri''. Rome: Editalia. p.22: \u201c''Burri did not begins with collage: the first pictures of '48 are all paintings. But in the earliest of them, the first Nero (Black) one, with a little blue square (and round and oval elements), the passage from shiny to opaque black acts not as a color but as material, like the right and wrong sides of a piece of satin''.\u201d</ref><ref>Serafini, Giuliano (2015). ''Burri: matter first''. Milan: Giunti. pp. 42\u201343: \u201c''Burri intuition was decisive. For centuries, art history has posited a kind of duality in which matter served as artist\u2019s tool, as the factor that, to become form, must necessarily be subjected to an operation of sublimation''.\u201d</ref><ref>Cor\u00e0, Bruno (2015). \"Burri, the First One Hundred Years of Greatness\".

In some artworks of the same period which he called ''Gobbi'' (Hunchbacks), Burri focused on the painting\u2019s spatial interaction, achieving another original outcome due to the incorporation of tree branches on the rear of the canvas which pushed two-dimensionality towards [[Three-dimensional space]].<ref name=\":1\">Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn (1997). \"Alberto Burri, The Surface at Risk\", in Tolomeo, Maria Grazia, Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn.

''Burri matter first''. Milan: Giunti. p.44: \"''Canvas, in the humble version of jute, the favorite support in every epoch, was no longer merely the material in which to paint, but the painting itself, the work. In a word, matter became the subject''.\"</ref>\n\nThe formal artistic elegance and the spatial balances obtained through aeroform steams, craters, rips, overlapping color layers and different forms, differentiated Burri\u2019s art, founded on attentive reflections and precise calculations, from the impulsive gestures that characterized [[Action painting]] during the same period.<ref>Tomassoni, Italo (2016). \"Burri, de Kooning, Pollock: Parallel Convergences\".

In Burri\u2019s case, however, there were no social or symbolic implications, the painting\u2019s formal and chromatic balance being the only real focus.<ref>Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn (1997). \"Alberto Burri, The Surface at Risk\", in Tolomeo, Maria Grazia, Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn.

In 1952, year of his first participation at the [[Venice Biennale]] exhibition, the Sacks titled ''Lo Strappo'' (The Rip) and ''Rattoppo'' (Patch) were rejected.<ref>Sarteanesi, Chiara (2016). \"The Seasons of Burri\".

Crespi, Stefano (1996). ''Pittura dell\u2019ultimo giorno, Scritti per Alberto Burri.''

''Burri 18 paintings 1953\u20131986''. New York: Di Laurenti Gallery. Exhibition catalogue. p. 7</ref>\n\n==== Combustions, Woods, Irons, Plastics ====\nThe procedure adopted for the ''Combustioni'' (Combustions) passed from paper to the ''Legni'' (Woods) around 1957, in thin sheets of wood veneer fastened to canvas and other supports.<ref>Nordland, Gerald (1977). ''Alberto Burri A retrospective view 1948\u20131977.'' Los Angeles: Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery Editions. Exhibition catalogue. p. 46: ''It must be noted that the Englishman Gwyther Irwin, came to adopt the legno procedure in 1961, and that the colorful French artist, Yves Klein also made his first fire paintings with a flame-thrower in the year 1961''.</ref>\n\nIn the same period Burri was also working on the ''Ferri'' (Irons), creations made out of metal sheets cut, and welded by [[Blow torch]], to aim the general balance of the elements. The best known application of this procedure was reached in the ''Plastiche'' (Plastics) during the Sixties, when a gradual critic openness towards Burri's art showed up in Italy as well.\n\nThe blowtorch was only apparently a destructive device. Indeed, the craters modeled by the flame on cellophane, black, red or transparent plastic or on the ''Bianchi Plastica'' (White Plastic) series, in which the transparent plastic is laid on a white or black support, were lightly directed by the painter's blowing. The balances of the matter were thus highlighted once again, in a sort of 'defiance' towards of flame's randomness on the one hand, and in a sort of attempt to 'dominate chance', intrinsic to Burri's philosophy, on the other.<ref>Pirovano, Carlo (1996). \"The Seasons of Fire\".

Exhibition Catalogue. pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\n=== From Cretto to Cellotex ===\nFrom 1963 on, Burri and his wife started spending their winters in Los Angeles. The painter progressively detached himself from the city's artistic community, deeply focusing on his own work.<ref>Melandri, Luisa (2010). \"Resident outsider\". In Melandri, Luisa, with Duncan, Michael. ''Combustione, Alberto Burri and America''. Los Angeles: Santa Monica Museum of Art. Exhibition catalogue. p. 22</ref> During his recurrent trips to [[Death Valley National Park]], the artist found in the natural cracking of the desert the visual spur which led him, starting from 1973, to create ''Cretti'' (Cracks) developing the use of the crackled paint effect of his 1940's artworks.<ref>Melandri, Luisa (2010). Ibidem. p. 23: \"''The noun 'cretto' \u2013 from the verb crettare in rare old Tuscan Italian \u2013 refers to small cracks that appear in plaster walls. The wod was originally most often used to describe the cracks that might appear in the 'intonaco' of a fresco. The term is therefore not only descriptive but links Burri\u2019s works to the mural traditions of his native Italy \u2013 and to Renaissance art-making''.\"</ref>\n\nEmploying a special mixture of kaolin, resins and pigment, the painter dried its surface with the heat of an oven. Burri arrested the heating process at the desired moment using a PVA glue layer, thus obtaining greater and lesser cracking effects, which were always balanced thanks to the painter's extensive knowledge of chemistry.<ref>Tomassoni, Italo (2015): \"Alberto Burri: His Cretti (Cracks) and Their Roots in the History of Art\". In ''Alberto Burri General Catalogue Vol. II Painting 1958\u20131978.'' Citt\u00e0 di Castello: Fondazione Palazzo Albizzini Collezione Burri. p.22: \"''Cretti therefore mark the start of the move away from the contemplative idea of the surface in favour of the structural, perceptive and dynamic blend of subterranean and potentially unlimited energies, which claime the need for design and limit.

It is one of the largest works of art ever realized, extending over an area of approximately 85,000 square meters. Its white concrete covering expands over the town, following the old street map in long arterial roads and corridors, which are walkable, thus symbolically bringing the devastated town back to life.\n\n==== Cellotex and the large cycles of paintings ====\nDuring the Seventies Burri's art saw a gradual transition towards wider dimensions, while retrospectives followed one another around the world. The great solo exhibition crossing the United States in 1977\u201378 and ending at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York is one example.\n\nIn the 1979 cycle of paintings called ''Il Viaggio'' (The Journey) Burri retraced, through ten monumental compositions, the key moments of his artistic production.<ref>The artist polemically excluded the ''Sacchi'', which many critics were considering his major works, to emancipate his production from the \u2018''lazy crystallization of his expressive message''\u2019 (Pirovano, Carlo. 2015. \"Burri, the Investigation of Space\".

An example is the recurrent motif of the [[archivolt]], viewed in its plain form in painting and in perspective in such iron sculptures as ''Teatro Scultura'' \u2013 a work presented at 1984 Venice Biennale \u2013, and in the 1972 [[Ogive]] series in ''[[ceramics]]''.<ref>Duranti, Massimo (2011).\"From form to matter, to abstract form: the development of Alberto Burri\u2019s aesthetic devolution\".

Other sculptures on iron are permanently held in Citt\u00e0 di Castello museums, Ravenna, Celle (Pistoia), Perugia and Milan, where the rotating wings of the ''Teatro Continuo'' (Continuous Theatre) is both real scenic space and sculpture, employing the [[Sforza Castle]] park as natural backcloth.<ref>The work was built on the occasion of the 1973 Milan Triennale, then demolished in 1989 by the municipality.

''Il Teatro Continuo di Alberto Burri''. Mantova: Corraini. Italian/English. {{ISBN|9788875705091}}</ref>\n\n=== Theatre sets ===\nTheater had a privileged role in Burri's artistic production. Though in isolated interventions, the painter worked in the fields of prose, ballet and opera. In 1963 Burri designed the sets for ''Spirituals'', [[Morton Gould]]'s ballet at [[La Scala]], in Milan. The painter's ''Plastiche'' emphasized the dramatic force of such plays as the 1969 [[Ignazio Silone]] stage adaptation in San Miniato (Pisa) and [[Tristan and Iseult]], performed in 1975 at the Teatro Regio in Turin.\n\nIn 1973 Burri designed sets and costumes for ''November Steps'', conceived by his wife Minsa Craig, with a score by [[Toru Takemitsu]]. The ballet was interacting with an early example of visual art by a film clip depicting how the ''Cretti'' progressively came into being.\n\n== Graphic work ==\nBurri never considered graphic art of secondary importance to painting. He participated intensively in the experimentation of new printing techniques as the 1965 reproduction of the ''Combustioni'' \u2013 in which the brothers Valter and Eleonora Rossi perfectly succeeded in mimicking the effect of burning on paper \u2013, or the irregular ''Cretti'' cavities (1971) with the same printers.\n\nFurther innovative developments can be found in the silk screens ''Sestante'' (1987\u201389) \u2013 with the help of Burri's old friend and collaborator [[Nuvolo]] \u2013 to the ''Mixoblack'' series (1988), created in Los Angeles with printers Luis and Lea Remba on marble dust and sand in particular three-dimensional effects.<ref>Sarteanesi, Chiara (2015). \"Tradition and Innovation in Alberto Burri\u2019s Graphic Art\".

October 2015. p.7.</ref>\n\nMore recently, Burri's position has been reevaluated thanks to the 2015 major retrospective exhibition ''Alberto Burri: The Trauma of Painting'' curated by Emily Braun for the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] and to the 2016 collective exhibition ''Burri Lo spazio di Materia tra Europa e USA'' edited by the current Foundation chairman Bruno Cor\u00e0, which foregrounded the radical change in traditional Western painting and modern collage brought about by Burri, while also focusing on his 'psychological' recovery of classical painting's formal balances alive.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alberto Burri: The Allure of Trauma |url=https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/alberto-burri-allure-trauma/3308 |website=Whitehot Magazine of Contemporary Art |accessdate=22 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAmong the many historical readings, [[Giulio Carlo Argan]]'s judgment (written in the 1960 [[Venice Biennale]] catalogue) remains emblematic: \"''For Burri we must speak for an overturned [[Trompe-l'\u0153il]], because it is no more painting to simulate reality, but it is reality to simulate painting''.\"<ref>Argan, Giulio Carlo (1960). ''Alberto Burri in XXX Biennale internazionale d\u2019arte di Venezia''. Venezia: stamperia di Venezia. Republished in \"Salvezza e caduta dell\u2019arte moderna\". Milan: Il Saggiatore. 1964. pp. 259\u2013263</ref>\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nBurri's career began in Rome with a first solo exhibition in 1947 at La Margherita bookshop, owned by [[Irene Brin]], where he presented his first abstract works the following year. Brin and her husband, Gaspero del Corso founded the Obelisco Gallery, the first art gallery to open in Postwar Rome, featuring the 1952 solo exhibition ''Muffe e Neri'' (Molds and Blacks) and the first ''Combustions'' in 1957. The Burri's first exhibition with the ''Sacchi'' was presented by the poet [[Emilio Villa]] at the Origine Foundation in 1952, in confirmation of his increasingly original production. The ''Ferri'' (Irons) were held at Galleria Blu in Milan.\n\nFrom 1953 on, Burri regularly exhibited his works in the United States, at the Allan Frumkin Gallery (Chicago), the [[Stable Gallery]] and the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. In the same year, the director and curator of Guggenheim Museum [[James Johnson Sweeney]] included Burri in the landmark exhibition ''Younger European Painters: A Selection'' bringing his work to focus in the international community.\n\nBurri's initially seesawing relationship with the [[Venice Biennale]] marked its turning point in 1960, when he was offered his first solo area by [[Giulio Carlo Argan]]. In 1962 [[Cesare Brandi]] presented the ''Plastiche'' at the [[Marlborough Fine Art]] in Rome. The first anthological retrospectives were held around this time and in the following decade, as the solo exhibitions at the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris (1972), the one in [[Francis of Assisi]] Sacred Convent (1975) and the great traveling exhibit which started at the [[UCLA]]'s Frederick S. Wight Gallery in Los Angeles, moved to the Marion Koogler McNay Art Institute in San Antonio (Texas) and ended in 1978 at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]].\n\nFrom 1979 on, the ''Large Cycles'' of paintings on ''Cellotex'' dominated Burri's entire subsequent production, which was conceived for big spaces such as cathedrals (like the 1981 Cycle in Florence titled ''Gli Orti'') or former industrial complexes, like the Giudecca Isle's ex-boatyards in Venice, where he exhibited the chromatic series ''Sestante''. In 1994, Burri presented the cycle titled ''Burri The Athens Polyptych. Architecture with Cactus'' for the exhibit curated by Giuliano Serfafini at the [[National Gallery (Athens)]], and then at the Italian Institute of Culture in Madrid (1995).\n\nThe 1996 posthumous anthological exhibition at [[Palazzo delle Esposizioni]] (Rome) was successfully repeated at [[Lenbachhaus]] (Munich) and at the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]]. In 2015\u201316 the major retrospective exhibition ''The Trauma of Painting'' organized by Emily Braun at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York (later at the [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]], D\u00fcsseldorf in 2016) received much international attention to the painter's art.\n\nAt the conclusion of the centenary of Alberto Burri's birth, the exhibition titled ''Burri Lo spazio di materia tra Europa e USA'' curated by Bruno Cor\u00e0 established a comparison between the epigones of 20th century material art. The exhibit was held in Citt\u00e0 di Castello, in the exhibition space of the former tobacco drying sheds which, since 2017, house the painter's graphic collection.<ref>\"''The artworks of post-war artist Alberto Burri celebrated in his native town of Citt\u00e0 di Castello after exhibitions in New York and Dusseldorf''\".

For the same festival the former tobacco drying sheds became the setting of a composition by [[Alvin Curran]] in 2002.<ref>[http://www.alvincurran.com/writings/brut%20beat.html Alvin Curran official website]</ref>\n\nThe ''Large Cretto'' at Gibellina has functioned several times as a set for the ''Orestiadi'' Festival and as set for a 2015 performance by artists [[Giancarlo Neri]] and [[Robert Del Naja]] ([[Massive Attack]]). The 1973 ballet ''November Steps'', with Burri's sets and costumes, was proposed again in 2015 by the Guggenheim Museum, New York. In 2016 choreographer Virgilio Sieni created the work ''Quintetti sul Nero'',<ref>[http://www.virgiliosieni.it/schede/quintetti-sul-nero/ Virgilio Sieni official website \"Quintetti sul nero\" ]</ref> inspired by the Umbrian master. In 2017 [[John Densmore]] ([[The Doors]]) performed in front of the ''Grande Nero Cretto'' (Large Black Crack) at [[ucla]], Los Angeles during the event ''Burri Prometheia''.<ref name=\"ucla-2017\" />\n\nThroughout the years, fashion designers have drawn inspiration from Burri, from [[Roberto Capucci]], with his 1969 item of clothing ''Omaggio a Burri'' which has asymmetric features recreating the ''Cretti'' effects, up to [[Laura Biagiotti]] for her (last) 2017 collection.\n\nIn 1987 Burri created the official [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] posters. The [[Umbria Jazz Festival]] used the ''Sestante'' series for the 2015 edition poster, celebrating the artist's centenary of birth.\n\n== Documentaries ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n* 1960 Carandente, Giovanni.

Inspired by these photographs, in 2015 the Geneva-based [[International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Ukraine|International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) launched a social media campaign under the tag #MigrantHeroes \"to invite people around the world to identify and tell the stories of migrant heroes.\"<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Loteria===\nDulce Pinz\u00f3n was inspired by the dualistic culture within Mexicans in New York. She demonstrated this concept of dualism in her project \"Loteria.\" By using images of the well known Mexican card game, she projected these images on the naked bodies of her New York friends and loved ones. This is also representative of Fernando Ortiz's concept of [[transculturation]]. By using the images of \"Loteria\" onto the human bodies of New York residents, she demonstrates how culture [[counter-flows]] through people's migration patterns, which is a form of [[cultural remittances]].\n\n== Awards ==\n2012 -

Go to the movies|page=C.3.}}</ref> To film ''Eating You Alive'', the production team flew around the nation to interview scientific researchers and physicians, as well as movie stars, gourmet cooks, and ordinary people.\n\n== Film summary ==\nThe documentary discusses the benefits of a proper diet to reduce millions of Americans' deaths each year due to chronic diseases. Each year millions of deaths worldwide are due to chronic diseases, Cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death at 17.3 million per year. \n\nThe film mainly focuses and address the continuous rise of chronic diseases in Americans as a result of diet habits, it criticizes Americans diet, and how a change in nutrition can reverse the effects of chronic diseases. The film advised tips and innovative ways of consuming products that can improve the well-being, where people that have switched from the traditional American diet to a whole-food, plant-based lifestyle have showed major improvement. Besides, it addressed certain flaws in the health care system concerning American's health and their diet as well as pollution consequences tied to the American's diet because of the animals being consumed because of the amount of methane produced by the livestock.\n\nThe film states that chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disabilities of Americans in the US, where chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are affecting \u00be of the adult American population and the direct causes can be traced to the food eaten in their daily diets. The documentary talks about the correlation of the American diet and its contribution, as physicians referred to in the film, to the most obese population in the history of the human race where 68.8 % of American adults are overweight or obese. Physicians and nutritionists in the documentary address how food in the American diet has certain chemical components that have \u201censlaved\u201d people into the vast consumption of these foods. These experts claim that the food consumed in the diets of Americans can lead to developing chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and believed that if foods cause diseases, they can also cure them.\n\nThe documentary exposes that the standard American diet, also known as the [[Western pattern diet]], is high on sugar, fats, and salts. The experts go on to say that in the last decade, Americans diet have increased dramatically the intake of sugar, meat, fat, and calories; claiming that these components trigger dopamine reward signals creating dependence and addiction of certain foods, and in the case of sugar, the ability to suppress the immune system.\nThe documentary addresses flaws in the health care system that contribute to the underlying causes of chronic diseases concerning American's diet and health. The film criticizes how the medical system is focused on treating the symptoms of diseases and no the causes and how to prevent them, where the American health care program is outstanding at managing cancer and illness signs but not the prevention. Throughout the film, various physicians express concern about medical school education and the lack of education towards nutrition. The physicians state that nutrition topics were not addressed as it should be and very minimalist. They emphasize that doctors are taught in the first place on how to treat diseases but not how to prevent them. The documentary discusses an issue of billions of dollars being spent on medical care, experimental medicines and revolutionary health-enhancing technologies, but still, more Americans are suffering from debilitating chronic illness.\n\nIn the film, the experts interviewed conclude that to the problem of chronic diseases, the remedy is better eating, especially a [[whole food]], [[plant-based diet]], where such conditions as high blood pressure,diabetes, and cancer could be mediated through dietary means instead of medication. The film's experts say that a whole diet focused on plants can not only eliminate a variety of diseases but can also reverse them. The film's experts, as well as witnesses who previously have been ill, express that plant-based nutrition can lower cholesterol levels, thus reversing cardiovascular illnesses. Physicians and nutritionists in the documentary state that giving up dairy, meat and processed food can lead to losing a variety of chronic diseases.\n\n==Reception==\n\nA reviewer for the ''[[Deseret News]]'' notes that the film is less an investigative documentary and more an advocacy film that presents a single cause and then a desired solution, but also states that the content of the film is useful and informative while not likely to persuade non-vegans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deseret.com/2017/3/17/20608441/eating-you-alive-trumpets-a-plant-based-solution-to-america-s-health-crisis|title='Eating You Alive' trumpets a plant-based solution to America's health crisis|last=Terry|first=Josh|date=2017-03-17|website=Deseret News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> [[Mayim Bialik]] praised the film on [[Twitter]].<ref name=\"cast\" /> The ''Portland Press Herald'' says the pro-vegan film is  thought-provoking.<ref name=\"maine\" /> During an interview about the film and plant-based/vegan diets hosted by [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] and [[Hoda Kotb]] in [[Today (American TV program)]], the director of ''Eating You Alive,'' Paul David Kennamer Jr. and [[NBC News]] medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar, spoke about the effects of following this diet habit.<ref name=\":0\" /> Paul David Kennamer Jr. openly discussed his journey of coping to live with a whole-food, plant-based diet.<ref name=\":0\" /> The director expressed he decided to change his diet to prevent chances of developing heart disease, which were traced back to all of his family members.<ref name=\":0\" /> After changing his diet, he experienced tremendous changes in his health, including higher energy levels, weight loss, and loss of joint pain.

Go to the movies|page=C.3.}}</ref> To film ''Eating You Alive'', the production team flew around the nation to interview scientific researchers and physicians, as well as movie stars, gourmet cooks, and ordinary people.\n\n== Film summary ==\nThe documentary discusses the benefits of a proper diet to reduce millions of Americans' deaths each year due to chronic diseases. Each year millions of deaths worldwide are due to chronic diseases, Cardiovascular disease being the leading cause of death at 17.3 million per year. \n\nThe film mainly focuses and address the continuous rise of chronic diseases in Americans as a result of diet habits, it criticizes Americans diet, and how a change in nutrition can reverse the effects of chronic diseases. The film advised tips and innovative ways of consuming products that can improve the well-being, where people that have switched from the traditional American diet to a whole-food, plant-based lifestyle have showed major improvement. Besides, it addressed certain flaws in the health care system concerning American's health and their diet as well as pollution consequences tied to the American's diet because of the animals being consumed because of the amount of methane produced by the livestock.\n\nThe film states that chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disabilities of Americans in the US, where chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes are affecting \u00be of the adult American population and the direct causes can be traced to the food eaten in their daily diets. The documentary talks about the correlation of the American diet and its contribution, as physicians referred to in the film, to the most obese population in the history of the human race where 68.8 % of American adults are overweight or obese. Physicians and nutritionists in the documentary address how food in the American diet has certain chemical components that have \u201censlaved\u201d people into the vast consumption of these foods. These experts claim that the food consumed in the diets of Americans can lead to developing chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and believed that if foods cause diseases, they can also cure them.\n\nThe documentary exposes that the standard American diet, also known as the [[Western pattern diet]], is high on sugar, fats, and salts. The experts go on to say that in the last decade, Americans diet have increased dramatically the intake of sugar, meat, fat, and calories; claiming that these components trigger dopamine reward signals creating dependence and addiction of certain foods, and in the case of sugar, the ability to suppress the immune system.\nThe documentary addresses flaws in the health care system that contribute to the underlying causes of chronic diseases concerning American's diet and health. The film criticizes how the medical system is focused on treating the symptoms of diseases and no the causes and how to prevent them, where the American health care program is outstanding at managing cancer and illness signs but not the prevention. Throughout the film, various physicians express concern about medical school education and the lack of education towards nutrition. The physicians state that nutrition topics were not addressed as it should be and very minimalist. They emphasize that doctors are taught in the first place on how to treat diseases but not how to prevent them. The documentary discusses an issue of billions of dollars being spent on medical care, experimental medicines and revolutionary health-enhancing technologies, but still, more Americans are suffering from debilitating chronic illness.\n\nIn the film, the experts interviewed conclude that to the problem of chronic diseases, the remedy is better eating, especially a [[whole food]], [[plant-based diet]], where such conditions as high blood pressure,diabetes, and cancer could be mediated through dietary means instead of medication. The film's experts say that a whole diet focused on plants can not only eliminate a variety of diseases but can also reverse them. The film's experts, as well as witnesses who previously have been ill, express that plant-based nutrition can lower cholesterol levels, thus reversing cardiovascular illnesses. Physicians and nutritionists in the documentary state that giving up dairy, meat and processed food can lead to losing a variety of chronic diseases.\n\n==Reception==\n\nA reviewer for the ''[[Deseret News]]'' notes that the film is less an investigative documentary and more an advocacy film that presents a single cause and then a desired solution, but also states that the content of the film is useful and informative while not likely to persuade non-vegans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deseret.com/2017/3/17/20608441/eating-you-alive-trumpets-a-plant-based-solution-to-america-s-health-crisis|title='Eating You Alive' trumpets a plant-based solution to America's health crisis|last=Terry|first=Josh|date=2017-03-17|website=Deseret News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> [[Mayim Bialik]] praised the film on [[Twitter]].<ref name=\"cast\" /> The ''Portland Press Herald'' says the pro-vegan film is  thought-provoking.<ref name=\"maine\" /> During an interview about the film and plant-based/vegan diets hosted by [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] and [[Hoda Kotb]] in [[Today (American TV program)]], the director of ''Eating You Alive,'' Paul David Kennamer Jr. and [[NBC News]] medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar spoke about the effects of following this diet habit.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.today.com/video/-eating-you-alive-new-film-claims-plant-based-foods-could-cure-your-ills-866651715810|title=\u2018Eating You Alive\u2019: New film claims plant-based foods could cure your ills|website=TODAY.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Paul David Kennamer Jr. openly discussed his journey of coping to live with a whole-food, plant-based diet.
