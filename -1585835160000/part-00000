Alongside these dinosaur remains were fossilized trees, suggesting that plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward. Other finds from the formation include [[tritylodonts]], [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[mammal|mammal-like]] [[reptile]]s and crow-sized [[pterosaur]]s. Surprisingly were the discovery of [[prosauropod]] remains, which were found commonly on other continents only until the Early Jurassic. However, the bone fragments found at the Hanson Formation were dated until the Middle Jurassic, millions of years later. In 2004, [[paleontologist]]s discovered partial remains of a large [[sauropod]] dinosaur that has not formally been described yet.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clearboth}}\n\n=== Invertebrate paleofauna ===\nThe insects ''[[Ademosynoides]]'' & ''[[Grahamelytron]]'' were claimed to be found on this formation, but they come from the Bajocian of a different formation.

Alongside these dinosaur remains were fossilized trees, suggesting that plant matter had once grown on Antarctica's surface before it drifted southward. Other finds from the formation include [[tritylodonts]], [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[mammal|mammal-like]] [[reptile]]s and crow-sized [[pterosaur]]s. Surprisingly were the discovery of [[prosauropod]] remains, which were found commonly on other continents only until the Early Jurassic. However, the bone fragments found at the Hanson Formation were dated until the Middle Jurassic, millions of years later. In 2004, [[paleontologist]]s discovered partial remains of a large [[sauropod]] dinosaur that has not formally been described yet.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clearboth}}\n\n=== Invertebrate paleofauna ===\nThe insects ''[[Ademosynoides]]'' & ''[[Grahamelytron]]'' were claimed to be found on this formation, but they come from the Bajocian of a different formation.

Proponents of these theories, such as [[Alfred Mitchell-Innes]], sometimes emphasize that money and credit/[[debt]] are the same thing, seen from different points of view.<ref>As [[Alfred Mitchell-Innes|Innes]] mentions in ''What is money?'' (1913), whenever he uses the word ''credit'' or ''debt'', \"the thing spoken of is precisely the same in both cases, the one or the other word being used according as the situation is being looked at from the point of view of the creditor or of the debtor.\"</ref> Proponents assert that the essential nature of money is credit (debt), at least in eras where money is not backed by a commodity such as gold.  Two common strands of thought within these theories are the idea that money originated as a unit of account for debt, and the position that [[money creation]] involves the simultaneous creation of debt. Some proponents of credit theories of money argue that money is best understood as debt even in systems often understood as using [[commodity money]].

The approach is tested empirically in a general-to-specific econometric time series model and found to be superior to alternative and traditional theories. According to Werner bank credit creation for GDP transactions [[Granger causality|Granger-causes]] nominal GDP growth, while credit creation for financial transactions explains asset prices and banking crises.<ref name = \"Werner\">Richard A.

Werner, 2005, New Paradigm in Macroeconomics, Palgrave Macmillan.</ref> Werner's approach is based on the scientific research methodology (the inductive method), not the axiomatic-hypothetical deductive approach commonly used in macroeconomics, which assumes away the existence of banks or market rationing. Hence in his approach markets are not expected to be in equilibrium, but the short side principle applies, which emphasises the power of banks in making decisions about the amount and allocation of credit created and distributed in the economy. Werner used the Quantity Theory of Credit (also known as the Quantity Theory of Disaggregated Credit) to develop a new monetary policy for post-crisis banking systems, which he called 'Quantitative Easing' (Werner, 1995, published in the Japanese financial newspaper, the Nikkei), a name later adopted by the Bank of Japan and Bank of England for related policies <ref> Richard A.

Exceptions where the relationship between money and debt was less clear occurred during periods where money has been backed by [[bullion]], as happens with a [[gold standard]]. Graeber echoes earlier theorists such as Innes by saying that during these eras population perception was that money derived its value from the precious metals of which the coins were made,<ref>This is the classic [[Metallism|Metallist]] view.</ref> but that even in these periods money is more accurately understood as debt. Graeber states that the three main functions of money are to act as: a  [[medium of exchange]]; a [[unit of account]]; and a [[store of value]]. Graeber writes that since [[Adam Smith]]'s time, economists have tended to emphasise money as a ''medium of exchange''.<ref>Polanyi goes as far as to say [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] \"indoctrinated\" economists into viewing money just as a  ''medium of exchange'' - see chapter 16 of [[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]].</ref> For Graeber, when money first appeared its primary purpose was to act as a ''unit of account'', to denominate debt. He writes that coins were originally created as [[token coin|tokens]] which represented a unit of account rather than being an amount of [[precious metal]] which could be bartered.<ref name = \"Graeber\">{{citation|title=Debt: The First 5000 Years |chapter= ''passim'', see especially chapter 2: The Myth of Barter |author=David Graeber |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-61219-181-2|title-link= Debt: The First 5000 Years }}</ref>\n\nEconomics commentator Philip Coggan holds that the world's current monetary system became debt-based after the [[Nixon Shock]], in which President Nixon suspended the link between money and [[gold]] in 1971. He writes that \"Modern money is debt and debt is money\".  Since the 1971 Nixon Shock, debt creation  and [[money creation|the creation of money]] increasingly took place at once. This simultaneous creation of money and debt occurs as a feature of [[fractional reserve banking]]. After a commercial bank approves a loan, it is able to create the corresponding amount of money, which is then acquired by the borrower along with a similar amount of debt.<ref>The new debt will generally soon exceed the newly created money due to added interest.</ref> \nCoggan goes on to say that debtors often prefer debt-based monetary systems such as [[fiat money]] over commodity-based systems like the gold standard, because the former tend to allow much higher volumes of money to circulate in the economy, and tend to be more expansive. This makes their debts easier to repay. Coggan refers to [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s 19th century [[Cross of Gold speech]] as one of the first great attempts to weaken the link between gold and money; he says the former US presidential candidate was trying to expand the [[monetary base]] in the interests of indebted farmers, who at the time were often being forced into bankruptcy.  However Coggan also says that the excessive debt which can be built up under a debt-based monetary system can end up hurting all sections of society, including debtors.<ref name = \"Promises\">\n{{cite book |author             = Philip Coggan\n |title              = Paper Promises: Money, Debt and the New World Order\n |chapter            = ''passim'', see esp Introduction\n |year               = 2011\n |isbn               = 978-1846145100\n |publisher          = Allen Lane\n |chapter-url-access = registration\n |chapter-url        = https://archive.org/details/paperpromisesmon0000cogg_z0h5\n |url-access         = registration\n |url                = https://archive.org/details/paperpromisesmon0000cogg_z0h5\n}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2012 paper, economic theorist [[Perry Mehrling]] notes that what is commonly regarded as money can often be viewed as debt.

A view held in common by most recent advocates, from all shades of political opinion, is that money can be equated with debt in the context of the contemporary monetary system.  The view that money is equivalent to debt even in systems based on [[commodity money]] tends to be held only by those to the left of the political spectrum. Regardless of any commonality in their understanding of credit theories of money, the actual reforms proposed by advocates of different political orientations are sometimes diametrically opposed.<ref name = \"Promises\"/>\n\n===Advocacy for a return to a gold standard or similar commodity based system.===\n[[File:Ronpaul1.jpg|thumb|250px|Former US presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]] has spoken out against ''fiat money'', partly on the grounds that it encourages the buildup of debt.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul125.html\n|title= Fiat Paper Money\n|publisher=LewRockwell.com\n|author=  Ron Paul\n|date = 12 Sep 2003\n|accessdate= 16 July 2012|author-link= Ron Paul\n}}\n</ref>\n]]\n\nAdvocates from an [[Austrian School]], [[right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] perspective often hold that money is equivalent to debt in our current  monetary system, but that it need not be in one where money has inherent value, such as a [[gold standard]].

Similar views are also occasionally expressed by [[conservatives]].

Exceptions include [[David Graeber]], who from a radical perspective, has used credit theories of money to argue against recent trends to strengthen the enforcement of debt collection, such as greater use of custodial sentences against debtors in the US.

According to Werner this can be done by establishing hundreds of not-for-profit community banks, modelled on Germany's local co-operative banks, Raiffeisenbanks and Sparkasse savings banks. These banks have been one of the drivers of the striking success for [[Mittelstand|German small firms]] over the past two centuries in delivering job creation, strong exports and constantly upgraded technology. Werner says that instead of further centralising the power of money creation in the hands of ever fewer people, as monetary reformers and central planners demand, this public privilege should be returned \"to the people to whom it belongs\", and this can only be done in a meaningful way with sufficient accountability by copying the traditional German community banks. <ref>Richard A.

From this main theory springs the sub-theory that the value of credit or money does not depend on the value of any metal or metals, but on the right which the creditor acquires to \"payment,\" that is to say, to satisfaction for the credit, and on the obligation of the debtor to \"pay\" his debt and conversely on the right of the debtor to release himself from his debt by the tender of an equivalent debt owed by the creditor, and the obligation of the creditor to accept this tender in satisfaction of his credit. }}\n\nInnes goes on to note that a major problem in getting the public to understand the extent to which monetary systems are debt based is the challenge in persuading them that  \"things are not the way they seem\".<ref name = \"Wray\">\n{{cite book \n|editor = Randy Wray \n|title=Credit & State Theories of Money \n|chapter= See esp Chpt 1 7 \n|year=2004\n|isbn=1843765136 \n|publisher= Edward Elgar \n}}</ref>\n\nA Quantity Theory of Credit was proposed in 1992 by [[Richard Werner]], whereby credit creation is disaggregated into credit for GDP and non-GDP (financial circulation). The approach is tested empirically in a general-to-specific econometric time series model and found to be superior to alternative and traditional theories. According to Werner bank credit creation for GDP transactions [[Granger causality|Granger-causes]] nominal GDP growth, while credit creation for financial transactions explains asset prices and banking crises.<ref name = \"Werner\">Richard A.

Werner, 2005, New Paradigm in Macroeconomics, Palgrave Macmillan.</ref> Werner's approach is based on the scientific research methodology (the inductive method), not the axiomatic-hypothetical deductive approach commonly used in macroeconomics, which assumes away the existence of banks or market rationing. Hence in his approach markets are not expected to be in equilibrium, but the short side principle applies, which emphasises the power of banks in making decisions about the amount and allocation of credit created and distributed in the economy. Werner used the Quantity Theory of Credit (also known as the Quantity Theory of Disaggregated Credit) to develop a new monetary policy for post-crisis banking systems, which he called 'Quantitative Easing' (Werner, 1995, published in the Japanese financial newspaper, the Nikkei), a name later adopted by the Bank of Japan and Bank of England for related policies <ref> Richard A.

Exceptions where the relationship between money and debt was less clear occurred during periods where money has been backed by [[bullion]], as happens with a [[gold standard]]. Graeber echoes earlier theorists such as Innes by saying that during these eras population perception was that money derived its value from the precious metals of which the coins were made,<ref>This is the classic [[Metallism|Metallist]] view.</ref> but that even in these periods money is more accurately understood as debt. Graeber states that the three main functions of money are to act as: a  [[medium of exchange]]; a [[unit of account]]; and a [[store of value]]. Graeber writes that since [[Adam Smith]]'s time, economists have tended to emphasise money as a ''medium of exchange''.<ref>Polanyi goes as far as to say [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] \"indoctrinated\" economists into viewing money just as a  ''medium of exchange'' - see chapter 16 of [[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]].</ref> For Graeber, when money first appeared its primary purpose was to act as a ''unit of account'', to denominate debt. He writes that coins were originally created as [[token coin|tokens]] which represented a unit of account rather than being an amount of [[precious metal]] which could be bartered.<ref name = \"Graeber\">{{citation|title=Debt: The First 5000 Years |chapter= ''passim'', see especially chapter 2: The Myth of Barter |author=David Graeber |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-61219-181-2|title-link= Debt: The First 5000 Years }}</ref>\n\nEconomics commentator Philip Coggan holds that the world's current monetary system became debt-based after the [[Nixon Shock]], in which President Nixon suspended the link between money and [[gold]] in 1971. He writes that \"Modern money is debt and debt is money\".  Since the 1971 Nixon Shock, debt creation  and [[money creation|the creation of money]] increasingly took place at once. This simultaneous creation of money and debt occurs as a feature of [[fractional reserve banking]]. After a commercial bank approves a loan, it is able to create the corresponding amount of money, which is then acquired by the borrower along with a similar amount of debt.<ref>The new debt will generally soon exceed the newly created money due to added interest.</ref> \nCoggan goes on to say that debtors often prefer debt-based monetary systems such as [[fiat money]] over commodity-based systems like the gold standard, because the former tend to allow much higher volumes of money to circulate in the economy, and tend to be more expansive. This makes their debts easier to repay. Coggan refers to [[William Jennings Bryan]]'s 19th century [[Cross of Gold speech]] as one of the first great attempts to weaken the link between gold and money; he says the former US presidential candidate was trying to expand the [[monetary base]] in the interests of indebted farmers, who at the time were often being forced into bankruptcy.  However Coggan also says that the excessive debt which can be built up under a debt-based monetary system can end up hurting all sections of society, including debtors.<ref name = \"Promises\">\n{{cite book |author             = Philip Coggan\n |title              = Paper Promises: Money, Debt and the New World Order\n |chapter            = ''passim'', see esp Introduction\n |year               = 2011\n |isbn               = 978-1846145100\n |publisher          = Allen Lane\n |chapter-url-access = registration\n |chapter-url        = https://archive.org/details/paperpromisesmon0000cogg_z0h5\n |url-access         = registration\n |url                = https://archive.org/details/paperpromisesmon0000cogg_z0h5\n}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2012 paper, economic theorist [[Perry Mehrling]] notes that what is commonly regarded as money can often be viewed as debt.

A view held in common by most recent advocates, from all shades of political opinion, is that money can be equated with debt in the context of the contemporary monetary system.  The view that money is equivalent to debt even in systems based on [[commodity money]] tends to be held only by those to the left of the political spectrum. Regardless of any commonality in their understanding of credit theories of money, the actual reforms proposed by advocates of different political orientations are sometimes diametrically opposed.<ref name = \"Promises\"/>\n\n===Advocacy for a return to a gold standard or similar commodity based system.===\n[[File:Ronpaul1.jpg|thumb|250px|Former US presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]] has spoken out against ''fiat money'', partly on the grounds that it encourages the buildup of debt.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul125.html\n|title= Fiat Paper Money\n|publisher=LewRockwell.com\n|author=  Ron Paul\n|date = 12 Sep 2003\n|accessdate= 16 July 2012|author-link= Ron Paul\n}}\n</ref>\n]]\n\nAdvocates from an [[Austrian School]], [[right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] perspective often hold that money is equivalent to debt in our current  monetary system, but that it need not be in one where money has inherent value, such as a [[gold standard]]. They have frequently used this view point to support arguments that it would be best to return to a gold standard, to other forms of commodity money, or at least to a monetary system where money has positive value. Similar views are also occasionally expressed by [[conservatives]]. As an example of the latter, former British minister of state  [[Malcolm Sinclair, 20th Earl of Caithness|The Earl of Caithness]] made a 1997 speech in [[The House of Lords]] where he stated that since the 1971 Nixon Shock, the British [[money supply]] had grown by  2145% and personal debt had risen by almost 3000%.

Exceptions include David Graeber, who from a radical perspective, has used credit theories of money to argue against recent trends to strengthen the enforcement of debt collection, such as greater use of custodial sentences against debtors in the US.

According to Werner this can be done by establishing hundreds of not-for-profit community banks, modelled on Germany's local co-operative banks, Raiffeisenbanks and Sparkasse savings banks. These banks have been one of the drivers of the striking success for [[Mittelstand|German small firms]] over the past two centuries in delivering job creation, strong exports and constantly upgraded technology. Werner says that instead of further centralising the power of money creation in the hands of ever fewer people, as monetary reformers and central planners demand, this public privilege should be returned \"to the people to whom it belongs\", and this can only be done in a meaningful way with sufficient accountability by copying the traditional German community banks. <ref>Richard A.

In the 1990s he was a full member of [[John Major]]'s [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] for almost three years, whilst serving as both [[Secretary of State for National Heritage]] and then [[Secretary of State for Health]] until the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. He was also a Patron of the [[Tory Reform Group]].\n\nSince 2014 he has been a consultant with the health and public service practice of [[KPMG]].\n\nIn the spring of 2019 he left the Conservative Party to join [[Change UK]] and was the lead candidate on the party's list in the [[West Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|West Midlands]] region at the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European Parliament election]]. After failing to be elected, he defected to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and was the unsuccessful Liberal Democrat candidate for [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]].\n\n==Early life and  education==\nDorrell was born in [[Worcester]] and educated at [[Uppingham School]], [[Rutland]] and [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], where he was awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. He was a member of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] for two years from 1971.\n\n==Political career==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2015}}\nDuring the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Dorrell acted as a personal assistant to Conservative minister [[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]]. Aged only 22, he contested the safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Kingston upon Hull East (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingston upon Hull East]] at the October 1974 general election, but was heavily defeated by the sitting MP (and later [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]]), [[John Prescott]], who was returned with a majority of 25,793 votes.\n\nAt the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], the Conservatives were returned to office under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Dorrell, then 27, was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for the marginal seat of [[Loughborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Loughborough]], ousting the veteran Labour MP [[John Desmond Cronin|John Cronin]] by 5,199 votes. He remained an MP until standing down from Parliament at the 2015 General Election.\n\nOn his election he was the ''[[Baby of the House of Commons]]'', an informal title for the youngest member.  He was succeeded as the ''Baby of the House'' on 9 April 1981 when [[Bobby Sands]] was elected at the [[April 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election]]; however, Sands died on 5 May 1981 whilst on [[1981 Irish hunger strike|hunger strike]] in [[Maze (HM Prison)|Long Kesh Prison]]. Dorrell again became the ''Baby of the House'' until 20 August 1981, when Sands' successor [[Owen Carron]] was elected at the [[August 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election]]. He nonetheless remained the youngest MP to take his seat in the House of Commons ([[Sinn Fein]] members do not take their seats) until the 1983 election, when [[Charles Kennedy]] succeeded him.\n\nFollowing his election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] in 1979 he was a member of the [[Department for Transport|Transport]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]]. After the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] he was appointed as the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to his old boss Peter Walker, who had now become the [[Secretary of State for Energy]].\n\n===In government===\nDorrell was promoted to government after the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 General Election]] by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] as an [[Whip (politics)|Assistant Government Whip]], and in 1988 became a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury 'full whip'. He was appointed as the [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]] at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] in 1990 under the premiership of [[John Major]]. After the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 General Election]] he became the [[Secretary to the Treasury#Financial Secretaries of the Treasury, 1852-present|Financial Secretary to the Treasury]].\n\nDorrell was promoted to the Major [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as the [[Secretary of State for National Heritage]] in 1994, and on appointment became a Member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. He  headhunted [[Jennifer Page (Millennium Dome)|Jennie Page]] for the job of [[Millennium Dome]] Chief Executive according to ''[[The Observer]]''.<ref name = \"domedreamsdashed\" >{{cite news|title=How Dome dreams were dashed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/feb/06/millennium.uk|accessdate=31 July 2008|work=[[The Observer]]|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe|date=5 February 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824035334/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/feb/06/millennium.uk|archive-date=24 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He was transferred to become the [[Secretary of State for Health]] in 1995, and remained in position until the end of the Conservative administration at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].\n\nDorrell was often deployed in the media as a spokesman for the Major government, as it was felt he conveyed an air of approachability and popular appeal. During one party conference season in the late 1990s he was followed by a camera crew from the BBC's Breakfast show, capturing the behind-the-scenes build-up to his conference speech. The actual speech was also shown, including his joke (at the height of tensions in the Conservative party over Europe) that he considered himself a 'bureausceptic'. Unfortunately the joke, a reference to trying to reduce the level of [[red tape]] in the Health Service, fell on deaf ears.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===After government===\nWhen constituency boundaries were revised for the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]], he moved with his key rural voters into the new [[Charnwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Charnwood]] constituency. He won the seat comfortably with a majority of 5,900, although Loughborough was lost to [[Andy Reed (politician)|Andy Reed]] of Labour.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nHe launched a bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 1997, but withdrew before the first ballot when it became clear his support amongst Conservative MPs was negligible. Instead he threw his support behind [[Kenneth Clarke]]'s bid. Under [[William Hague]] he became [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow]] [[Secretary of State for Education and Employment]], but left the shadow cabinet in 1998, and was a [[backbencher]] for the remainder of his parliamentary career.\n\n====Chairman of Health Select Committee and views on NHS reforms====\nIn June 2010, Dorrell was elected Chairman of the [[Health Select Committee]]. In June 2011, following concerns over the unpopularity of [[Andrew Lansley]]'s [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|NHS reforms]], Dorrell was tipped as a possible successor but stated that he wanted to continue as the committee chairman for the full parliament.<ref name=beebJH1>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13712255|title=Stephen Dorrell rules out return as Health Secretary|author=John Hess|date=9 June 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320044801/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13712255|archive-date=20 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> An alternate view was that David Cameron would not want any more \"Tory retreads\" from previous governments.<ref name=beebJH1/> Dorrell acknowledged that resources would become tighter but changes driven by new medicines and new expectations were inevitable and integration of health care and social care would be both better and more efficient.<ref name=beebJH1/>\n\nInterviewed in 2012, Dorrell stated that the 4% per year for four years efficiency targets, agreed before the 2010 election and described as \"a huge challenge\", were taking too long to achieve.<ref name=beebNHS>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16696197|title=Stephen Dorrell: NHS faces huge challenge|work=[[BBC News]]|date=24 January 2012|accessdate=1 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409202249/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16696197|archive-date=9 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Whilst the bill had good points, e.g. involving clinicians and local authorities, more independence for public health etc. savings required a change in the way care is delivered not just changes in management structure.<ref name=beebNHS/> The reforms were acting as a \"disruption and distraction\".<ref name=beebNHS/>  They were a secondary issue compared with the need to make efficiency savings of \u00a320bn, he added.<ref name=gard>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/mar/02/nhs-reform-reality-stephen-dorrell|title=NHS reform debate has lost touch with reality, says Stephen Dorrell|author=Clare Horton|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 March 2012|accessdate=2 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223105/http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/mar/02/nhs-reform-reality-stephen-dorrell|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDorrell resigned in June 2014 and was succeeded by [[Sarah Wollaston]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dr Sarah Wollaston elected as health committee chairwoman|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27911517|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|date=18 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701160020/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27911517|archive-date=1 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Expenses investigation over \"secret flat rent deal\" with care home owners====\nIn November 2012 Dorrell was reported to the [[Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority]] (IPSA) after arranging to sell his London flat to \u201cfriends\u201d who owned a chain of nursing homes, subsequently renting it back at \u00a31,400 a month, funded by the taxpayer. His impartiality as chairman was questioned as the Health Select Committee was investigating social care, and some of the chain's nursing homes had been criticised by the [[Care Quality Commission]].  Committee members were not aware of the financial connection. [[David Cameron]] refused to get involved, saying it was a matter for IPSA. IPSA said that the rules banned MPs from renting from family members, not from friends.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/9694228/MPs-expenses-Stephen-Dorrell-MP-reported-to-sleaze-watchdog-over-secret-flat-rent-deal.html|title=MPs' expenses: Stephen Dorrell MP reported to sleaze watchdog over secret flat rent deal|author=Christopher Hope|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 November 2012|accessdate=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025173926/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/9694228/MPs-expenses-Stephen-Dorrell-MP-reported-to-sleaze-watchdog-over-secret-flat-rent-deal.html|archive-date=25 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Standing down from Parliament===\nIn November 2014, he surprised local party members and staff by announcing his future retirement from the House to take a job with consultancy [[KPMG]] in \"a senior role supporting their health and public service practice...\". The role, he said, was \"incompatible with seeking re-election to the House of Commons\". Fellow Leicestershire Conservative MP [[Andrew Bridgen]] also expressed surprise, but said that the prestige of Parliament had fallen since the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|expenses scandal]], and a number of experienced MPs were leaving. Neighbouring Loughborough MP [[Nicky Morgan]] described him as \"a really important political figure in Leicestershire since 1979. He has been a great support to me\". She denied claims she would stand in Dorrell's Charnwood seat (rather than Loughborough) at the 2015 general election, saying that these were \"rumour-mongering\" by members of the Labour Party. (In May 2015 she held the Loughborough seat with an increased majority.)\n\nThe Labour candidate for Charnwood, Sean Kelly Walsh, paid tribute to Dorrell's long service and constituency work, as well as his roles as Secretary of State for Health and chairman of the Health Affairs Select Committee.<ref name=dan>{{cite news|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Conservative-Charnwood-MP-Stephen-Dorrell/story-24673441-detail/story.html|title=Conservative Charnwood MP Stephen Dorrell quitting Parliament to join KPMG|work=Leicester Mercury|author=danjmartin|date=25 November 2014|access-date=26 November 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219133226/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Conservative-Charnwood-MP-Stephen-Dorrell/story-24673441-detail/story.html|archive-date=19 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Resignation call over conflict of interest===\nIn December 2014, Dorrell was criticised for alleged conflict of interest when it became clear that he would be working both as an MP and KPMG consultant for six months until the election, and that KPMG were considering bidding for a \u00a31 billion NHS contract. Pointing out that Dorrell had previously admitted the two roles were incompatible, Dr Clive Peedell, co-leader of the [[National Health Action Party]], called for him to resign from one of the posts. Dorrell responded saying no issues were raised as he was not seeking re-election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11264425/Stephen-Dorrell-MP-faces-calls-to-resign-over-conflict-of-interest.html|title=Stephen Dorrell MP faces calls to resign over conflict of interest|work=Daily Telegraph|date=1 December 2014|accessdate=4 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203220517/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11264425/Stephen-Dorrell-MP-faces-calls-to-resign-over-conflict-of-interest.html|archive-date=3 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, a group of six pensioners, who called at Dorrell's offices in [[Thurmaston]] to hand in a 2,286 signature petition calling on him to resign, were told they were trespassing and the police would be called.

[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Loughborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Loughborough]] between 1979 and 1997 and then for [[Charnwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Charnwood]] from 1997 to 2015.\n\nDorrell most recently served for four years as Chairman of the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]] [[Health Select Committee]] from 2010 to 2014. In the 1990s he was a full member of [[John Major]]'s [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] for almost three years, whilst serving as both [[Secretary of State for National Heritage]] and then [[Secretary of State for Health]] until the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. He was also a Patron of the [[Tory Reform Group]].\n\nSince 2014 he has been a consultant with the health and public service practice of [[KPMG]].\n\nIn the spring of 2019 he left the Conservative Party to join [[Change UK]] and was the lead candidate on the party's list in the [[West Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|West Midlands]] region at the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European Parliament election]]. After failing to be elected, he defected to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and was the unsuccessful Liberal Democrat candidate for [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]].\n\n==Early life and  education==\nDorrell was born in [[Worcester]] and educated at [[Uppingham School]], [[Rutland]] and [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], where he was awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. He was a member of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] for two years from 1971.\n\n==Political career==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2015}}\nDuring the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Dorrell acted as a personal assistant to Conservative minister [[Peter Walker, Baron Walker of Worcester|Peter Walker]]. Aged only 22, he contested the safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Kingston upon Hull East (UK Parliament constituency)|Kingston upon Hull East]] at the October 1974 general election, but was heavily defeated by the sitting MP (and later [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]]), [[John Prescott]], who was returned with a majority of 25,793 votes.\n\nAt the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], the Conservatives were returned to office under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Dorrell, then 27, was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for the marginal seat of [[Loughborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Loughborough]], ousting the veteran Labour MP [[John Desmond Cronin|John Cronin]] by 5,199 votes. He remained an MP until standing down from Parliament at the 2015 General Election.\n\nOn his election he was the ''[[Baby of the House of Commons]]'', an informal title for the youngest member.  He was succeeded as the ''Baby of the House'' on 9 April 1981 when [[Bobby Sands]] was elected at the [[April 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election]]; however, Sands died on 5 May 1981 whilst on [[1981 Irish hunger strike|hunger strike]] in [[Maze (HM Prison)|Long Kesh Prison]]. Dorrell again became the ''Baby of the House'' until 20 August 1981, when Sands' successor [[Owen Carron]] was elected at the [[August 1981 Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election]]. He nonetheless remained the youngest MP to take his seat in the House of Commons ([[Sinn Fein]] members do not take their seats) until the 1983 election, when [[Charles Kennedy]] succeeded him.\n\nFollowing his election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]] in 1979 he was a member of the [[Department for Transport|Transport]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]]. After the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] he was appointed as the [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to his old boss Peter Walker, who had now become the [[Secretary of State for Energy]].\n\n===In government===\nDorrell was promoted to government after the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 General Election]] by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] as an [[Whip (politics)|Assistant Government Whip]], and in 1988 became a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury 'full whip'. He was appointed as the [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]] at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] in 1990 under the premiership of [[John Major]]. After the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 General Election]] he became the [[Secretary to the Treasury#Financial Secretaries of the Treasury, 1852-present|Financial Secretary to the Treasury]].\n\nDorrell was promoted to the Major [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as the [[Secretary of State for National Heritage]] in 1994, and on appointment became a Member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. He  headhunted [[Jennifer Page (Millennium Dome)|Jennie Page]] for the job of [[Millennium Dome]] Chief Executive according to ''[[The Observer]]''.<ref name = \"domedreamsdashed\" >{{cite news|title=How Dome dreams were dashed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/feb/06/millennium.uk|accessdate=31 July 2008|work=[[The Observer]]|first=Vanessa|last=Thorpe|date=5 February 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824035334/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/feb/06/millennium.uk|archive-date=24 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> He was transferred to become the [[Secretary of State for Health]] in 1995, and remained in position until the end of the Conservative administration at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].\n\nDorrell was often deployed in the media as a spokesman for the Major government, as it was felt he conveyed an air of approachability and popular appeal. During one party conference season in the late 1990s he was followed by a camera crew from the BBC's Breakfast show, capturing the behind-the-scenes build-up to his conference speech. The actual speech was also shown, including his joke (at the height of tensions in the Conservative party over Europe) that he considered himself a 'bureausceptic'. Unfortunately the joke, a reference to trying to reduce the level of [[red tape]] in the Health Service, fell on deaf ears.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===After government===\nWhen constituency boundaries were revised for the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]], he moved with his key rural voters into the new [[Charnwood (UK Parliament constituency)|Charnwood]] constituency. He won the seat comfortably with a majority of 5,900, although Loughborough was lost to [[Andy Reed (politician)|Andy Reed]] of Labour.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nHe launched a bid for the leadership of the Conservative Party in 1997, but withdrew before the first ballot when it became clear his support amongst Conservative MPs was negligible. Instead he threw his support behind [[Kenneth Clarke]]'s bid. Under [[William Hague]] he became [[Shadow Cabinet|shadow]] [[Secretary of State for Education and Employment]], but left the shadow cabinet in 1998, and was a [[backbencher]] for the remainder of his parliamentary career.\n\n====Chairman of Health Select Committee and views on NHS reforms====\nIn June 2010, Dorrell was elected Chairman of the [[Health Select Committee]]. In June 2011, following concerns over the unpopularity of [[Andrew Lansley]]'s [[Health and Social Care Act 2012|NHS reforms]], Dorrell was tipped as a possible successor but stated that he wanted to continue as the committee chairman for the full parliament.<ref name=beebJH1>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13712255|title=Stephen Dorrell rules out return as Health Secretary|author=John Hess|date=9 June 2011|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320044801/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-13712255|archive-date=20 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> An alternate view was that David Cameron would not want any more \"Tory retreads\" from previous governments.<ref name=beebJH1/> Dorrell acknowledged that resources would become tighter but changes driven by new medicines and new expectations were inevitable and integration of health care and social care would be both better and more efficient.<ref name=beebJH1/>\n\nInterviewed in 2012, Dorrell stated that the 4% per year for four years efficiency targets, agreed before the 2010 election and described as \"a huge challenge\", were taking too long to achieve.<ref name=beebNHS>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16696197|title=Stephen Dorrell: NHS faces huge challenge|work=[[BBC News]]|date=24 January 2012|accessdate=1 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409202249/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16696197|archive-date=9 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Whilst the bill had good points, e.g. involving clinicians and local authorities, more independence for public health etc. savings required a change in the way care is delivered not just changes in management structure.<ref name=beebNHS/> The reforms were acting as a \"disruption and distraction\".<ref name=beebNHS/>  They were a secondary issue compared with the need to make efficiency savings of \u00a320bn, he added.<ref name=gard>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/mar/02/nhs-reform-reality-stephen-dorrell|title=NHS reform debate has lost touch with reality, says Stephen Dorrell|author=Clare Horton|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2 March 2012|accessdate=2 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223105/http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2012/mar/02/nhs-reform-reality-stephen-dorrell|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDorrell resigned in June 2014 and was succeeded by [[Sarah Wollaston]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dr Sarah Wollaston elected as health committee chairwoman|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27911517|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|date=18 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701160020/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27911517|archive-date=1 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Expenses investigation over \"secret flat rent deal\" with care home owners====\nIn November 2012 Dorrell was reported to the [[Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority]] (IPSA) after arranging to sell his London flat to \u201cfriends\u201d who owned a chain of nursing homes, subsequently renting it back at \u00a31,400 a month, funded by the taxpayer. His impartiality as chairman was questioned as the Health Select Committee was investigating social care, and some of the chain's nursing homes had been criticised by the [[Care Quality Commission]].

The role, he said, was \"incompatible with seeking re-election to the House of Commons\". Fellow Leicestershire Conservative MP [[Andrew Bridgen]] also expressed surprise, but said that the prestige of Parliament had fallen since the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|expenses scandal]], and a number of experienced MPs were leaving. Neighbouring Loughborough MP [[Nicky Morgan]] described him as \"a really important political figure in Leicestershire since 1979. He has been a great support to me\". She denied claims she would stand in Dorrell's Charnwood seat (rather than Loughborough) at the 2015 general election, saying that these were \"rumour-mongering\" by members of the Labour Party. (In May 2015 she held the Loughborough seat with an increased majority.)\n\nThe Labour candidate for Charnwood, Sean Kelly Walsh, paid tribute to Dorrell's long service and constituency work, as well as his roles as Secretary of State for Health and chairman of the Health Affairs Select Committee.<ref name=dan>{{cite news|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Conservative-Charnwood-MP-Stephen-Dorrell/story-24673441-detail/story.html|title=Conservative Charnwood MP Stephen Dorrell quitting Parliament to join KPMG|work=Leicester Mercury|author=danjmartin|date=25 November 2014|access-date=26 November 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219133226/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Conservative-Charnwood-MP-Stephen-Dorrell/story-24673441-detail/story.html|archive-date=19 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Resignation call over conflict of interest===\nIn December 2014, Dorrell was criticised for alleged conflict of interest when it became clear that he would be working both as an MP and KPMG consultant for six months until the election, and that KPMG were considering bidding for a \u00a31 billion NHS contract. Pointing out that Dorrell had previously admitted the two roles were incompatible, Dr Clive Peedell, co-leader of the [[National Health Action Party]], called for him to resign from one of the posts. Dorrell responded saying no issues were raised as he was not seeking re-election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11264425/Stephen-Dorrell-MP-faces-calls-to-resign-over-conflict-of-interest.html|title=Stephen Dorrell MP faces calls to resign over conflict of interest|work=Daily Telegraph|date=1 December 2014|accessdate=4 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203220517/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11264425/Stephen-Dorrell-MP-faces-calls-to-resign-over-conflict-of-interest.html|archive-date=3 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2015, a group of six pensioners, who called at Dorrell's offices in [[Thurmaston]] to hand in a 2,286 signature petition calling on him to resign, were told they were trespassing and the police would be called.

It is visually identical to the GT-I9100, as well as having the same 1.2&nbsp;GHz processor speed and dual-core ARM Cortex A9 processor technology. However, the SoC is of a different design and the Mali-400 GPU has been replaced by a PowerVR SGX 540 GPU. This difference in the SoC makes this variant incompatible with custom [[Read-only memory|ROM]]<nowiki/>s intended for the I9100, but it has been steadily gaining its own aftermarket support (such as from [[CyanogenMod]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Samsung Galaxy S II G|url=http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II_G}}</ref>) due to the relative ease of development and the openness of the TI OMAP platform.\n\n===Australia===\n\n====Telstra and Vodafone Australia - Models GT-I9100T====\nThe Galaxy S II (Model GT-I9100T) sold by [[Telstra]], [[Vodafone Australia]] and some certain other carriers outside Australia is virtually identical to the I9100 and is functionally equivalent.\n\n====Telstra and Optus - Model GT-I9210T====\nIn Australia the Galaxy S II 4G (Model GT-I9210T) uses a Qualcomm processor and supports Telstra's and Optus' [[4G]] networks.

It is identical to the GT-I9100G, featuring the same Texas Instruments OMAP4430 SoC with a 1.2&nbsp;GHz dual-core ARM Cortex A9 processor and PowerVR SGX 540 graphics processor. However, the GT-I9108 has TD-SCDMA support in place of WCDMA support found in other variants. The GT-I9108 is a regional model and has few available custom ROMs.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S II (Model SCH-I929) was released in late 2011, and it is sold in China by China Telecom. It is based on the design of Galaxy S II LTE (GT-I9210), but supports CDMA2000 1x EVDO for use with the carrier.\n\n===Europe - Model GT-I9100P===\nThe Samsung Galaxy S II (Model GT-I9100P) was released in late 2011. It has the same hardware as GT-I9100 plus the NFC chip and battery (the battery is specific because it includes the antenna). To keep NFC enabled it is necessary to update the firmware using a P version. Any I9100 firmware can be used, but doing so will disable the NFC hardware.\n\n===India===\n\n====Model: GT-i9100====\n\nGT-i9100 is a sim-free model released on May 2, 2011. This supports 2G/3G only.\n\n===Japan===\n\n====KDDI AU - Model: ISW11SC====\nThe [[KDDI]] [[Au (mobile phone company)|Au]] Galaxy S II WiMAX (Model: ISW11SC) was first released on January 20, 2012 in the color Noble Black and was followed by a Ceramics White model on March 24, 2012 and a Shiny Magenta model on July 20, 2012. The ISW11SC currently runs Android 4.0.4 via an OTA update from the original 2.3.6 firmware. The ISW11SC uses the Samsung Exynos 4210 dual-core 1.4&nbsp;GHz main CPU and a Qualcomm QSC6085 Modem chipset running at 192&nbsp;MHz. It features 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of ROM (11&nbsp;GB available for user data storage) with support for up to 64&nbsp;GB additional storage via the internal microSD slot. An 1850mAh battery powers the device. The ISW11SC features a Samsung SUPER AMOLED HD 1280x720 screen measuring 4.7 inches. Connectivity includes CDMA 800&nbsp;MHz/2,100&nbsp;MHz; 3G EV-DO Rev A; 2.4&nbsp;GHz / 5&nbsp;GHz 802.11 a/b/g/n Wi-Fi; Bluetooth 3.0 and an integrated WiMAX modem with speeds up to 40Mbit/s down and 15.4Mbit/s up. Like most Japanese domestic model phones the ISW11SC includes many Japan-specific applications. This phone features NFC functionality which is technically compatible with FeliCa RFID (such as with PASMO and SUICA payment systems) however, the software doesn't support the Japanese \"Osaifu Keitai\" mobile wallet and thus the phone cannot be used to make transactions with NFC in Japan.\n\n====NTT DoCoMo - Model SC-02C====\n[[NTT DoCoMo]] introduced a variant of the Galaxy S II (Model [[:ja:SC-02C|SC-02C]]) on 23 June 2011 as the successor to the DoCoMo Galaxy S (Model [[:ja:SC-02B|SC-02B]]). The SC-02C includes [[1seg]] terrestrial television support, as well as [[i-mode]] software functions specific to DoCoMo handsets, such as i-channel, BeeTV, MelodyCall and DoCoMo map navigation. The SC-02C is powered by the Samsung Exynos 4210 Orion Dual-core 1.2&nbsp;GHz (S5PC210) processor.  The SC-02C uses the [[Wnn]] Japanese [[input method editor|input system]].\n\n===South Korea===\nAll of variants optimized for use with South Korean wireless carriers have Samsung's Korean input system for feature phones, a [[Dubeolsik]]-layout virtual keyboard and a [[T-DMB]] tuner in place of an [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] tuner.\n\n====KT - Model SHW-M250K====\nThe [[KT (telecommunication company)|KT]] variant, the Galaxy S II KT (Model SHW-M250K) uses KT's Wi-Fi CM{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} instead of Android's Wi-Fi CM to connect to Wi-Fi networks. Additional features for KT users are installed by default.\n\n====LG U+ - Model SHW-M250L====\nInstead of WCDMA and HSPA, [[LG U+]]'s variant of the Galaxy S II (Model SHW-M250L) uses EV-DO Rev.B (KPCS 1.8&nbsp;GHz) to accommodate the network technology deployed by LG U+. The SHW-M250L is slightly thicker (9.4&nbsp;mm) than SK Telecom and KT variants (8.89&nbsp;mm).
