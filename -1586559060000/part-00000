At higher levels, agricultural education is primarily undertaken to prepare students for employment in the [[Primary sector of the economy|agricultural sector]]. Classes taught in an agricultural education [[curriculum]] may include [[horticulture]], land management, turf grass management, [[agricultural science]], small animal care, machine and shop classes, health and nutrition, livestock management, and [[biology]].\n\nAgricultural education is common at the [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]] (including middle and high school in the United States), [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] (including vocational schools and universities), and [[Adult education|adult]] levels.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last=Phipps |last2=Osborne |last3=Dyer |last4=Ball |first=Lloyd |first2=Edward |first3=James |first4=Ann |title=Handbook on Agricultural Education in Public Schools Sixth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Delmar Learning|location=NY}}</ref> Elementary agriculture is often taught in both [[Public school (government funded)|public]] and [[private school]]s, and can cover such subjects as how [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s grow and how soil is farmed and conserved. Vocational agriculture trains people for jobs in such areas as production, [[marketing]], and conservation. College agriculture involves training of people to teach or conduct [[research]] in order to advance the fields of agriculture and [[food science]]. General education informs the public about food and agriculture.\n\nDisciplines closely tied to agricultural education include agricultural communications, agricultural leadership, and extension education.\n\n== In the United States ==\nThe chief sources of agriculture education in the United States are [[Secondary education in the United States|high schools]], [[Community colleges in the United States|community colleges]], four-year [[college]]s and [[University|universities]], youth organizations, and the 10x15 program.\n\n===History===\nThe rapid growth of agricultural education began during the late 19th century. In 1862, the [[United States Congress]] created the Department of Agriculture to gather and distribute agricultural information. The [[Morrill Act]], which provided the land-grant schools, became law that same year. The [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] of 1887 gave federal funds to establish agricultural experiment stations.  The first dairy school in the U.S. was created at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in 1890.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisc.edu/dysci/images/DairyScienceHistoryPoster.pdf|title=A Century of Excellence in Education and Discovery|author=L.H.

Olson|author4=W.T. Howard|author5=D.P. Dickson}}</ref>\n* \nGovernment support for agricultural education has increased during the 20th century. For example, the [[Smith-Lever Act]] of 1914 created what is now the Cooperative Extension System (1988). The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 and the George-Barden Act of 1946 financed high-school instruction in farming. [[Woodlawn High School (Woodlawn, Virginia)]] was the first public high school in the United States to offer agricultural education classes under the Smith-Hughes Act.<ref>Worrell, A.

This development led to the use of modern farming methods that required fewer farmworkers, resulting in larger, corporatized farms and ranches. This development increased the need for more agriculture science and education.\n\nOther legislation influenced the development of agricultural education into what the field is today. It has developed throughout the last century from various laws and pieces of legislation.\n\nThe Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 required all public schools to provide a free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. Under this provision, children with disabilities were now allowed to enroll in agricultural classes. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]], enacted in 1990, further required public schools to give students with disabilities equal opportunity for education to all other children in the country, and as a result, it increased opportunities for students with disabilities participate in agricultural classes.\n\nEducate America Act of 1994 raised benchmark standards for public education at the districts level, increasing curriculum and development requirements for all classes, including agricultural ones. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act, also of 1994, required teachers to teach students tasks and disciplines that would help their students prepare for employment once they graduated, of which practical education in agriculture was a major part. Finally, [[No Child Left Behind]] (Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2001) further raised standards for students in public schools and increased requirements of teachers in order to reach these standards, affecting agricultural education as part of the general curriculum of many schools.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Elementary school===\nIn 2006, [[Walton Rural Life Center]] in [[Walton, Kansas]] was the first public elementary school in the United States to base its curriculum around agriculture.<ref>U.

Agriculture in the Classroom soon became utilized in each state. Though Agriculture in the Classroom was the beginning of agriculture education in all fifty states, elementary instruction began in some schools possibly before the 1900s. After elementary agriculture education began to grow, twenty-one states began to require it by 1915. The required curriculum was evenly split between urban and rural schools. The states that required agricultural education at the elementary level were all midwestern states or southern states; both of which are rich in agriculture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jae-online.org/index.php/back-issues/52-volume-39-number-2-1998/510-agriculture-in-the-classroom-early-1900s-style|title=Agriculture In The Classroom: Early 1900s Style|last=John Hillison|website=www.jae-online.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n===High schools===\nAgricultural education at the high school level focuses on three main categories: classroom instruction, [[supervised agricultural experience]] (SAE), and active involvement in the [[National FFA Organization]] (Future Farmers of America).\n\nClassroom instruction of an agricultural class teaches the students the basic concepts of the particular course through hands on learning and experience. Students will be taught the information in the curriculum in order for them to understand and develop skills in the application and problem solving issues that would occur in an agricultural setting.<ref name=\"Agricultural Education Handbook\">{{cite book|last=Phipps |last2=Osborne |last3=Dyer |last4=Ball |first=Lloyd |first2=Edward |first3=James |first4=Ann |title=Handbook on Agricultural Education in the Public Schools Sixth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Delmar Learning|location=NY}}</ref>\n\nThe Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) portion of the agricultural curriculum is when a student must use the knowledge they have gained in the classroom instruction and use it in real life situations. Several topic choices are available for the student to choose between, whether it is on a farm setting, exploratory setting, entrepreneurship, agribusiness, or research projects. The student will choose a task from one of these topic areas and conduct a research experiment throughout the course of the agricultural class. The teacher is involved in the process and will help guide the student along the way. SAE programs give students the opportunity to take the information learned in the classroom setting and use it on an agricultural topic that interests them. This portion of an agricultural education will give students an idea of how it is working out in the real world and solving problems that will arise in the work field.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe FFA is a national organization that all agricultural classes at the high school level are involved in. The agricultural teacher is the leader of that particular schools FFA chapter, and will guide students\u2019 activities and programs held throughout the year. FFA is an educational program designed to teach students leadership skills in both agricultural settings and everyday life, encourages personal growth in students, boosts self-confidence, builds character, encourage healthy lifestyles, and give students opportunities to be a part of the agricultural economy. FFA chapters will volunteer in communities, conduct banquets for FFA members and their families, raise awareness of agriculture, compete in FFA competitions, and attend national FFA conventions.<ref>{{cite web|title=National FFA Organization- Agricultural Education|url=https://www.ffa.org/Pages/default.aspx|accessdate=2013-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227214230/https://www.ffa.org/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2013-02-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn some states, the agriculture teacher leads a local Young Farmers Association in monthly meetings. The group may comprise local farmers, citizens, and anyone interested in learning about agriculture and new farming methods. The Young Farmers Association is designed to aid the adoption of agricultural technologies, and it gives agriculture teachers the opportunity to meet local citizens and reach out to the community.<ref name=\"Agricultural Education Handbook\" />\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n[[Image:Gville UF Floyd03.jpg|thumb|upright|[[University of Florida College of Agricultural and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture at the University of Florida]]]]\n[[Land-grant university|Land-grant universities]] awarded more than three-quarters of all agricultural degrees in 1988. These state schools receive federal aid under legislation that followed the [[Morrill Act]] of 1862, which granted public lands to support agricultural or mechanical education. Land-grant universities have three chief functions: teaching, research, and outreach, or extension.\n\n==== Teaching ====\nA [[bachelor's degree]] in agricultural education generally leads to employment teaching agriculture up to the high school level or in the agricultural sector. Students are required to complete agriculture classes as well as education classes in order to become qualified to teach. A [[master's degree]] is required in order to teach at the college level. The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] (ACTE), the largest national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepares youth and adults for careers, provides [https://web.archive.org/web/20070715225838/http://www.acteonline.org/members/techniques/articlesbyagri.cfm resources for agricultural education].

Some career choices include [[food science]], [[veterinary science]], [[farming]], [[ranching]], [[teaching]], [[marketing]], [[agricultural communication]], [[management]], and [[social services]]. Colleges and universities awarded about 21,000 bachelor's degrees in agriculture per year in 1988, and about 6,000 master's or doctor's degrees.\n\n==== Research ====\nEach land-grant university has an agricultural experiment station equipped with laboratories and experimental farms. There, agricultural scientists work to develop better farming methods, solve the special problems of local farmers, and provide new technology. Research published in [[Academic journal|scholarly journals]] about agricultural safety is available from the [[NIOSH]]-supported [[National Agricultural Safety Database]]. The [[American Dairy Science Association]] provides research and education scholarships focused on the [[dairy]] farm and processing industries.\n\n====Extension service====\n\nThe [[Cooperative Extension System]] is a partnership of the federal, state, and county governments. This service distributes information gathered by the land-grant universities and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] to farmers, families, and young people. County extension agents, located in most countries (1988), train and support about 3 million (1988) volunteer leaders. Agents and volunteers carry out extension programs through meetings, workshops, [[newsletter]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], and visits.\n\n===Related Organizations===\n\nProfessional organizations in the United States related to agricultural education include the American Association for Agricultural Education (AAAE), the Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE), the National Association of Agricultural Educators (NAAE), and The National Council for Agricultural Education (The Council).\n\n4H Club is considered a youth development program that teaches children about sciences, leadership, research, etc. 4H club has over 6 million members nationwide and is the largest youth development organization in the United States. 4H members use hands on learning to reach goals and help in communities.<ref>{{cite web|title=4H youth development organization|url=http://www.4-h.org/about/youth-development-organization/|accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> Members of 4-H carry out group and individual projects dealing with [[conservation biology|conservation]], food and agriculture, [[health and safety]], and other subjects. The 4-H program in the United States is part of the Cooperative Extension service.\n\nSomewhat similarly, the FFA is a national organization that teaches students leadership skills and is designed to help members become more well rounded citizens in the agricultural field.<ref name=\"Phipps, Osborne, Dyer, Ball 2008\" /> The FFA is an integral part of the program of agricultural education in many high schools as a result of Public Law 740 in 1950 (Currently revised as Public Law 105-225 of the 105th Congress of the United States), with 649,355 FFA members (2016-2017). Local chapters participate in Career Development Events (individually and as a team), each student has a Supervised Agricultural Experience program (SAE), and participates in many conferences and conventions to develop leadership, citizenship, patriotism and excellence in agriculture.  The National FFA Organization is structured from the local chapter up, including local districts, areas, regions, state associations, and the national level.  The FFA Mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through agricultural education.\n\n==Outside the US==\n[[Image:Hurlstone dairy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurlstone Agricultural High School]] in Australia maintains a dairy with 42 head of cattle.]]\nThe history of agricultural education predates USA activities and derives from, the development of Scottish, Italian and German colleges. The land grant approach of the USA owes much to the Scottish system in particular. Changes in higher agricultural education around the world today are highlighting implicit approaches that have hampered development and exceptional advances that have fed the world. the process has been described in one text (below) which takes a global perspective.\n\nAgricultural education in other countries resembles that in the United States. Canada has its own 4-H program. [[Agriculture Canada]] distributes information on new farming methods and maintains experimental farms, research stations, and research institutions throughout the country. [[BC Agriculture in the Classroom Foundation]] operates in the province of [[British Columbia]]. In Australia, each state has several agricultural research stations and an extension service. Great Britain has a program of youth clubs called [[Young Farmer's Clubs]] that resemble 4-H. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations works to train people throughout the world in modern farming methods. The United States gives technical assistance to farmers in developing nations through its [[Agency for International Development]] (AID).\n\n=== Australia ===\n[[File:Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School.JPG|thumb|Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School]]\nAs of February 2015 [[Agriculture in Australia]] employs over 235,300 people in the agriculture, fishing and forestry and fishing industry. This industry alone equates to 12% share of the GDP earning close to  $155 billion a year. The farmers own a combined 135,997 farms covering approximately 61% of the land mass.\n\nGiven these figures the agricultural programs in place in school and universities in very important to the future of the county. Several high schools operate across the country specifying in agriculture education. Predominantly these high schools are set in the rural areas with access to land. On the majority of cases the students often travel 1000&nbsp;km to attend schools, taking up residence at the schools as boarders for the school term. The one of the biggest in Australia is [[Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School]] in central New South Wales.<br />\nThe Agriculture in Education programme launched by the Australian government in 2015 helps teachers better understand the products and processes associated with food and fibre production and gives students an opportunity to understand the importance of agriculture in the Australian economy. Topics covered by the materials include: designing and making a financial plan for a market garden, free range chicken farming, food security, and sustainable production practices in food and fibre.<ref>[http://ministers.education.gov.au/pyne/new-resources-boost-student-learning-agriculture], The Hon Christopher Pyne MP > New resources to boost student learning in agriculture\nMonday 18 May 2015 Media Release .</ref>\nThe agricultural environment has changed enormously over the past 15 years, with greater emphasis on product quality issues, vertical integration from production to consumer, diversity in demand options, and environmental namely drought, welfare and ethical issues.<ref>[file:http---www.aphref.aph.gov.au-house-committee-primind-ruralskills-subs-sub111.pdf], EDUCATION FOR AGRICULTURE\nA Discussion Paper\nPrepared by the Education Committee of the South Australian Division\nof the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science and Technology.</ref>\n\n==== Western Australia ====\nIn Western Australia, The Western Australian College of Agriculture is the primary provider of high schools in the state providing excellent educational opportunities at six campuses located near Cunderdin, Denmark, Esperance, Harvey, Morawa and Narrogin.<ref>[http://det.wa.edu.au/wacoa/detcms/navigation/general-information/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624235601/http://det.wa.edu.au/wacoa/detcms/navigation/general-information/ |date=2016-06-24 }}, retrieved from WA department Of Education on 17.05.16 http://det.wa.edu.au/wacoa/detcms/portal/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625041539/http://det.wa.edu.au/wacoa/detcms/portal/ |date=2016-06-25 }}.</ref><br />\nEach Campus has modern facilities on commercial sized farms and offers Year 10, 11 and 12 programs for male and female students.

Today agricultural education is positioned to contribute substantially in these arenas through a major national initiative.\nUnder the direction of The National Council for Agricultural Education, the \"10x15 Long Range Goal for Agricultural Education\" employs a comprehensive strategy engaging eight high-priority initiatives.  The focus of the unprecedented effort is twofold:  create new programs in communities not yet served by agricultural education and FFA, and ensure the quality and high performance of current programs providing personal, academic and career education in agriculture.  While the goal of \"10x15\" is to grow the number of agricultural education programs from 7,200 to 10,000 by the year 2015, the clear emphasis is on quality.\n\nSeveral factors make this effort timely and essential.  First, the public's expectations for higher student achievement are leading to dramatic increases in accountability, standards, rigor and relevance throughout education.  Especially critical is the need to raise math and science proficiency.  Second, the industry of agriculture, already concerned about meeting growing domestic and global demands for food and fiber, is eager to identify the future managers, leaders and workers who will ensure the future security and productivity of agriculture.  A forecasted shortage of well-educated workers is adding urgency to the issue.  Also, concerns about food safety, security and independence are registering at the highest levels of agribusiness and government.  Lastly, local communities are intent on cultivating leadership and securing effective participation from their citizens. Through the intra-curricular programs of agricultural education and the FFA, a half-million students are developing skills in leadership, communication, team building and civic engagement. They will be prepared to provide for the social, economic and cultural well-being of small communities and large urban centers alike.\n\nThe work of \"10x15\" is concentrated in eight national task forces operating over the next several years.  Their scope of work includes national program and content standards; teacher recruitment and preparation; alternative program design; [[data reporting]]; public advocacy; brand communication strategy; and program funding.  Driving the work of \"10x15\" are more than a hundred top leaders drawn from today's Team Ag Ed, including teachers, students, university educators, state education leaders, the National FFA Organization, alumni, business and industry, and key stakeholders\n\n== Agricultural educators ==\n* [[Otto Frederick Hunziker]], [[Purdue University]]\n* [[John Wrightson]], [[Downton Agricultural College]]\n* [[List of Iowa State University people#Raymond A.

At higher levels, agricultural education is primarily undertaken to prepare students for employment in the [[Primary sector of the economy|agricultural sector]]. Classes taught in an agricultural education [[curriculum]] may include [[horticulture]], land management, turf grass management, [[agricultural science]], small animal care, machine and shop classes, health and nutrition, livestock management, and [[biology]].\n\nAgricultural education is common at the [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]] (including middle and high school in the United States), [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] (including vocational schools and universities), and [[Adult education|adult]] levels.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last=Phipps |last2=Osborne |last3=Dyer |last4=Ball |first=Lloyd |first2=Edward |first3=James |first4=Ann |title=Handbook on Agricultural Education in Public Schools Sixth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Delmar Learning|location=NY}}</ref> Elementary agriculture is often taught in both [[Public school (government funded)|public]] and [[private school]]s, and can cover such subjects as how [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s grow and how soil is farmed and conserved. Vocational agriculture trains people for jobs in such areas as production, [[marketing]], and conservation. College agriculture involves training of people to teach or conduct [[research]] in order to advance the fields of agriculture and [[food science]]. General education informs the public about food and agriculture.\n\nDisciplines closely tied to agricultural education include agricultural communications, agricultural leadership, and extension education.\n\n== In the United States ==\nThe chief sources of agriculture education in the United States are [[Secondary education in the United States|high schools]], [[Community colleges in the United States|community colleges]], four-year [[college]]s and [[University|universities]], youth organizations, and the 10x15 program.\n\n===History===\nThe rapid growth of agricultural education began during the late 19th century. In 1862, the [[United States Congress]] created the Department of Agriculture to gather and distribute agricultural information. The [[Morrill Act]], which provided the land-grant schools, became law that same year. The [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] of 1887 gave federal funds to establish agricultural experiment stations.  The first dairy school in the U.S. was created at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in 1890.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisc.edu/dysci/images/DairyScienceHistoryPoster.pdf|title=A Century of Excellence in Education and Discovery|author=L.H.

Olson|author4=W.T. Howard|author5=D.P. Dickson}}</ref>\n* \nGovernment support for agricultural education has increased during the 20th century. For example, the [[Smith-Lever Act]] of 1914 created what is now the Cooperative Extension System (1988). The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 and the George-Barden Act of 1946 financed high-school instruction in farming. [[Woodlawn High School (Woodlawn, Virginia)]] was the first public high school in the United States to offer agricultural education classes under the Smith-Hughes Act.<ref>Worrell, A.

This development led to the use of modern farming methods that required fewer farmworkers, resulting in larger, corporatized farms and ranches. This development increased the need for more agriculture science and education.\n\nOther legislation influenced the development of agricultural education into what the field is today. It has developed throughout the last century from various laws and pieces of legislation.\n\nThe Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 required all public schools to provide a free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. Under this provision, children with disabilities were now allowed to enroll in agricultural classes. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]], enacted in 1990, further required public schools to give students with disabilities equal opportunity for education to all other children in the country, and as a result, it increased opportunities for students with disabilities participate in agricultural classes.\n\nEducate America Act of 1994 raised benchmark standards for public education at the districts level, increasing curriculum and development requirements for all classes, including agricultural ones. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act, also of 1994, required teachers to teach students tasks and disciplines that would help their students prepare for employment once they graduated, of which practical education in agriculture was a major part. Finally, [[No Child Left Behind]] (Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2001) further raised standards for students in public schools and increased requirements of teachers in order to reach these standards, affecting agricultural education as part of the general curriculum of many schools.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Elementary school===\nIn 2006, [[Walton Rural Life Center]] in [[Walton, Kansas]] was the first public elementary school in the United States to base its curriculum around agriculture.<ref>U.

Students will be taught the information in the curriculum in order for them to understand and develop skills in the application and problem solving issues that would occur in an agricultural setting.<ref name=\"Agricultural Education Handbook\">{{cite book|last=Phipps |last2=Osborne |last3=Dyer |last4=Ball |first=Lloyd |first2=Edward |first3=James |first4=Ann |title=Handbook on Agricultural Education in the Public Schools Sixth Edition|year=2008|publisher=Delmar Learning|location=NY}}</ref>\n\nThe Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) portion of the agricultural curriculum is when a student must use the knowledge they have gained in the classroom instruction and use it in real life situations. Several topic choices are available for the student to choose between, whether it is on a farm setting, exploratory setting, entrepreneurship, agribusiness, or research projects. The student will choose a task from one of these topic areas and conduct a research experiment throughout the course of the agricultural class. The teacher is involved in the process and will help guide the student along the way. SAE programs give students the opportunity to take the information learned in the classroom setting and use it on an agricultural topic that interests them. This portion of an agricultural education will give students an idea of how it is working out in the real world and solving problems that will arise in the work field.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe FFA is a national organization that all agricultural classes at the high school level are involved in. The agricultural teacher is the leader of that particular schools FFA chapter, and will guide students\u2019 activities and programs held throughout the year. FFA is an educational program designed to teach students leadership skills in both agricultural settings and everyday life, encourages personal growth in students, boosts self-confidence, builds character, encourage healthy lifestyles, and give students opportunities to be a part of the agricultural economy. FFA chapters will volunteer in communities, conduct banquets for FFA members and their families, raise awareness of agriculture, compete in FFA competitions, and attend national FFA conventions.<ref>{{cite web|title=National FFA Organization- Agricultural Education|url=https://www.ffa.org/Pages/default.aspx|accessdate=2013-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227214230/https://www.ffa.org/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2013-02-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn some states, the agriculture teacher leads a local Young Farmers Association in monthly meetings. The group may comprise local farmers, citizens, and anyone interested in learning about agriculture and new farming methods. The Young Farmers Association is designed to aid the adoption of agricultural technologies, and it gives agriculture teachers the opportunity to meet local citizens and reach out to the community.<ref name=\"Agricultural Education Handbook\" />\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n[[Image:Gville UF Floyd03.jpg|thumb|upright|[[University of Florida College of Agricultural and Life Sciences|College of Agriculture at the University of Florida]]]]\n[[Land-grant university|Land-grant universities]] awarded more than three-quarters of all agricultural degrees in 1988. These state schools receive federal aid under legislation that followed the [[Morrill Act]] of 1862, which granted public lands to support agricultural or mechanical education. Land-grant universities have three chief functions: teaching, research, and outreach, or extension.\n\n==== Teaching ====\nA [[bachelor's degree]] in agricultural education generally leads to employment teaching agriculture up to the high school level or in the agricultural sector. Students are required to complete agriculture classes as well as education classes in order to become qualified to teach. A [[master's degree]] is required in order to teach at the college level. The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] (ACTE), the largest national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepares youth and adults for careers, provides [https://web.archive.org/web/20070715225838/http://www.acteonline.org/members/techniques/articlesbyagri.cfm resources for agricultural education].

Some career choices include [[food science]], [[veterinary science]], [[farming]], [[ranching]], [[teaching]], [[marketing]], [[agricultural communication]], [[management]], and [[social services]]. Colleges and universities awarded about 21,000 bachelor's degrees in agriculture per year in 1988, and about 6,000 master's or doctor's degrees.\n\n==== Research ====\nEach land-grant university has an agricultural experiment station equipped with laboratories and experimental farms. There, agricultural scientists work to develop better farming methods, solve the special problems of local farmers, and provide new technology. Research published in [[Academic journal|scholarly journals]] about agricultural safety is available from the [[NIOSH]]-supported [[National Agricultural Safety Database]]. The [[American Dairy Science Association]] provides research and education scholarships focused on the [[dairy]] farm and processing industries.\n\n====Extension service====\n\nThe [[Cooperative Extension System]] is a partnership of the federal, state, and county governments. This service distributes information gathered by the land-grant universities and the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] to farmers, families, and young people. County extension agents, located in most countries (1988), train and support about 3 million (1988) volunteer leaders. Agents and volunteers carry out extension programs through meetings, workshops, [[newsletter]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], and visits.\n\n===Related Organizations===\n\nProfessional organizations in the United States related to agricultural education include the American Association for Agricultural Education (AAAE), the Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE), the National Association of Agricultural Educators (NAAE), and The National Council for Agricultural Education (The Council).\n\n4H Club is considered a youth development program that teaches children about sciences, leadership, research, etc. 4H club has over 6 million members nationwide and is the largest youth development organization in the United States. 4H members use hands on learning to reach goals and help in communities.<ref>{{cite web|title=4H youth development organization|url=http://www.4-h.org/about/youth-development-organization/|accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref> Members of 4-H carry out group and individual projects dealing with [[conservation biology|conservation]], food and agriculture, [[health and safety]], and other subjects.

Local chapters participate in Career Development Events (individually and as a team), each student has a Supervised Agricultural Experience program (SAE), and participates in many conferences and conventions to develop leadership, citizenship, patriotism and excellence in agriculture.  The National FFA Organization is structured from the local chapter up, including local districts, areas, regions, state associations, and the national level.  The FFA Mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through agricultural education.\n\n==Outside the US==\n[[Image:Hurlstone dairy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurlstone Agricultural High School]] in Australia maintains a dairy with 42 head of cattle.]]\nThe history of agricultural education predates USA activities and derives from, the development of Scottish, Italian and German colleges. The land grant approach of the USA owes much to the Scottish system in particular. Changes in higher agricultural education around the world today are highlighting implicit approaches that have hampered development and exceptional advances that have fed the world. the process has been described in one text (below) which takes a global perspective.\n\nAgricultural education in other countries resembles that in the United States. Canada has its own 4-H program. [[Agriculture Canada]] distributes information on new farming methods and maintains experimental farms, research stations, and research institutions throughout the country. [[BC Agriculture in the Classroom Foundation]] operates in the province of [[British Columbia]]. In Australia, each state has several agricultural research stations and an extension service. Great Britain has a program of youth clubs called [[Young Farmer's Clubs]] that resemble 4-H. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations works to train people throughout the world in modern farming methods. The United States gives technical assistance to farmers in developing nations through its [[Agency for International Development]] (AID).\n\n=== Australia ===\n[[File:Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School.JPG|thumb|Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School]]\nAs of February 2015 [[Agriculture in Australia]] employs over 235,300 people in the agriculture, fishing and forestry and fishing industry. This industry alone equates to 12% share of the GDP earning close to  $155 billion a year. The farmers own a combined 135,997 farms covering approximately 61% of the land mass.\n\nGiven these figures the agricultural programs in place in school and universities in very important to the future of the county. Several high schools operate across the country specifying in agriculture education. Predominantly these high schools are set in the rural areas with access to land. On the majority of cases the students often travel 1000&nbsp;km to attend schools, taking up residence at the schools as boarders for the school term. The one of the biggest in Australia is [[Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School]] in central New South Wales.<br />\nThe Agriculture in Education programme launched by the Australian government in 2015 helps teachers better understand the products and processes associated with food and fibre production and gives students an opportunity to understand the importance of agriculture in the Australian economy. Topics covered by the materials include: designing and making a financial plan for a market garden, free range chicken farming, food security, and sustainable production practices in food and fibre.<ref>[http://ministers.education.gov.au/pyne/new-resources-boost-student-learning-agriculture], The Hon Christopher Pyne MP > New resources to boost student learning in agriculture\nMonday 18 May 2015 Media Release .</ref>\nThe agricultural environment has changed enormously over the past 15 years, with greater emphasis on product quality issues, vertical integration from production to consumer, diversity in demand options, and environmental namely drought, welfare and ethical issues.<ref>[file:http---www.aphref.aph.gov.au-house-committee-primind-ruralskills-subs-sub111.pdf], EDUCATION FOR AGRICULTURE\nA Discussion Paper\nPrepared by the Education Committee of the South Australian Division\nof the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science and Technology.</ref>\n\n==== Western Australia ====\nIn Western Australia, The Western Australian College of Agriculture is the primary provider of high schools in the state providing excellent educational opportunities at six campuses located near Cunderdin, Denmark, Esperance, Harvey, Morawa and Narrogin.<ref>[http://det.wa.edu.au/wacoa/detcms/navigation/general-information/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624235601/http://det.wa.edu.au/wacoa/detcms/navigation/general-information/ |date=2016-06-24 }}, retrieved from WA department Of Education on 17.05.16 http://det.wa.edu.au/wacoa/detcms/portal/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625041539/http://det.wa.edu.au/wacoa/detcms/portal/ |date=2016-06-25 }}.</ref><br />\nEach Campus has modern facilities on commercial sized farms and offers Year 10, 11 and 12 programs for male and female students.

Further, all students will be members of the FFA and have a supervised agricultural experience that supports classroom and laboratory instruction.' .<ref>[http://aaaeonline.org/Resources/Documents/Paper%20Proceedings,%20North%20Central%202009.pdf], Lincoln, Nebraska 2009 American Association for Agricultural Education NORTH CENTRAL REGION CONFERENCE A Philosophical Examination of the Agricultural Education Model and Transformational\nLeadership for Secondary Agricultural Education Proceedings Monday, September 28, 2009  .</ref>-Team Ag Ed\n\n'''The Case for Growth and Quality in Agricultural Education'''\n\nOf the critical issues facing the nation, few are more compelling than improving the academic performance of public schools and ensuring a stable, safe and affordable food supply.  Today agricultural education is positioned to contribute substantially in these arenas through a major national initiative.\nUnder the direction of The National Council for Agricultural Education, the \"10x15 Long Range Goal for Agricultural Education\" employs a comprehensive strategy engaging eight high-priority initiatives.  The focus of the unprecedented effort is twofold:  create new programs in communities not yet served by agricultural education and FFA, and ensure the quality and high performance of current programs providing personal, academic and career education in agriculture.  While the goal of \"10x15\" is to grow the number of agricultural education programs from 7,200 to 10,000 by the year 2015, the clear emphasis is on quality.\n\nSeveral factors make this effort timely and essential.  First, the public's expectations for higher student achievement are leading to dramatic increases in accountability, standards, rigor and relevance throughout education.  Especially critical is the need to raise math and science proficiency.  Second, the industry of agriculture, already concerned about meeting growing domestic and global demands for food and fiber, is eager to identify the future managers, leaders and workers who will ensure the future security and productivity of agriculture.  A forecasted shortage of well-educated workers is adding urgency to the issue.  Also, concerns about food safety, security and independence are registering at the highest levels of agribusiness and government.  Lastly, local communities are intent on cultivating leadership and securing effective participation from their citizens. Through the intra-curricular programs of agricultural education and the FFA, a half-million students are developing skills in leadership, communication, team building and civic engagement. They will be prepared to provide for the social, economic and cultural well-being of small communities and large urban centers alike.\n\nThe work of \"10x15\" is concentrated in eight national task forces operating over the next several years.  Their scope of work includes national program and content standards; teacher recruitment and preparation; alternative program design; [[data reporting]]; public advocacy; brand communication strategy; and program funding.  Driving the work of \"10x15\" are more than a hundred top leaders drawn from today's Team Ag Ed, including teachers, students, university educators, state education leaders, the National FFA Organization, alumni, business and industry, and key stakeholders\n\n== Agricultural educators ==\n* [[Otto Frederick Hunziker]], [[Purdue University]]\n* [[John Wrightson]], [[Downton Agricultural College]]\n* [[List of Iowa State University people#Raymond A.
