His therapist recommends that he writes letters to himself detailing what will be good about each day. His mother, Heidi, suggests that he asks people to sign the cast on his arm to make friends. \n\nThe wealthy Murphy family consists of the parents, Cynthia and Larry, and their children Zoe and Connor. Cynthia struggles with the fact that her family is falling apart, and the two mothers wonder how to connect with their sons  (\"Anybody Have a Map?\").\n\nAt school, Evan meets Alana, a precocious but somewhat self-absorbed classmate, and Jared, his only family friend. Both Alana and Jared notice his broken arm, but neither signs his cast. Evan then runs into Connor, who interprets Evan's awkwardness as making fun of him, resulting in Connor's pushing Evan to the ground. Connor's sister Zoe, whom Evan has a crush on, feels obligated to apologize for her brother's behavior. Evan wonders if this is his destiny \u2014 to be ignored and an outcast \u2014 for the rest of his life (\"Waving Through a Window\").\n\nEvan writes a letter to himself, wondering whether anyone would notice if he were not there. All his hope is focused on Zoe, since his crush on her is the only thing that brings him happiness (\"Waving Through a Window (Reprise #1)\"). He encounters Connor again, who now offers to sign Evan's cast. Connor finds Evan's letter on the printer and reads it; he becomes furious at the mention of Zoe, thinking Evan intended for him to see the letter in order to make fun of him. He storms out, taking the letter with him.\n\nEvan is in an intense state of anxiety over what Connor might have done with the letter and tells Jared online about his assignment to write letters to himself (\"Waving Through a Window (Reprise #2)\"). Evan is called to the principal's office and is told by Connor's parents that Connor committed suicide days before, with Evan's letter found in his pocket, which they believe is a suicide note addressed to him.\n\nEvan goes to Connor's house for dinner. Jared had instructed him to \"nod and confirm\" to avoid making things worse, but Evan is awkward and uncomfortable and he lies, pretending he and Connor had been best friends, emailing each other from a secret account.  The Murphys don't question this because Mr. Murphy had been monitoring Connor's real account. Zoe and Cynthia get into an argument, and Evan jumps in, recounting a fictional version of the day he broke his arm at an abandoned apple orchard the Murphys had visited (\"For Forever\"). When Evan gets home, Heidi mentions hearing about Connor's death, but Evan tells her not to worry and that he didn't know Connor. After realizing he needs evidence of his supposed \"secret email account\", Evan enlists Jared's help in creating fake, backdated email conversations between himself and Connor (\"Sincerely, Me\").\n\nAfter Evan shows the Murphy family Connor's \"emails\", Cynthia is ecstatic that her son had a friend, but Larry is hurt that Connor took his family and his privileged life for granted. Cynthia tries to show Zoe the emails, but they argue again. Zoe still refuses to mourn Connor (\"Requiem\"). Despite this, after reading the \"suicide note\", Zoe notices that she is mentioned and asks Evan why Connor would say that about her. Evan, unable to tell her the truth, tells her all the reasons he loves her under the guise of Connor saying them (\"If I Could Tell Her\"). Overcome with emotion, he impulsively kisses Zoe, but she pulls away and tells him to leave.\n\nAt school, Evan and Alana notice that people are starting to forget about Connor, so Evan enlists Alana and Jared's help in founding \"The Connor Project\" to keep Connor's memory alive. The three pitch the idea to the Murphys, who agree to support the project (\"Disappear\"). Moved by his dedication, Cynthia gives Evan a necktie she had gotten for Connor that he had never worn and asks Evan to wear it when he speaks at Connor's memorial service. At the official launch of The Connor Project, Evan gives an inspiring speech about his loneliness and friendship with Connor, which goes viral. Zoe, overcome by the impact her brother and Evan have had, kisses him (\"You Will Be Found\").\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nEvan and Alana pitch a fundraising idea on The Connor Project's website, to raise $50,000 to reopen the abandoned apple orchard where Evan and Connor supposedly spent time. However, Evan becomes preoccupied with his new relationship with Zoe and his newfound family in the Murphys, and begins to neglect his mother, Jared, and The Connor Project (\"Sincerely, Me (Reprise)\").\n\nHeidi asks Evan why he did not tell her about The Connor Project or about his friendship with Connor. He angrily responds that he did not have the time because she is never around. Overcome with emotion, he rushes off to the Murphys, where Evan bonds with Larry Murphy and confides in him about his childhood. Larry offers him an old baseball glove of Connor's that was never used (\"To Break in a Glove\"). Later, when Evan begins to mention Connor, Zoe tells him that she does not want their relationship to be about Connor, but about the two of them (\"Only Us\").\n\nEvan goes to the Murphys, only to discover they invited Heidi for dinner. She is mortified to learn they want to give Connor's college fund to Evan. At home, Heidi and Evan fight over his secrecy and deception, with Evan confessing that he feels welcomed and accepted into the Murphy family because of Heidi's absence. Meanwhile, Alana begins to find inconsistencies in the fake emails. Evan asks Jared to help fix the inaccuracies, but Jared refuses and threatens to expose Evan, who counters that he could expose Jared's role. Heidi, Alana, and Jared converge in Evan's conscience, compounding his guilt and doubt over his decisions (\"Good for You\").\n\nEvan decides he has to confess to what he has done. Imaginary Connor attempts to talk him out of it, but Evan shouts that he needs the whole thing to be over. Connor tells him that if he tells the truth, all he has will be gone, and the only thing he will be left with is himself (\"For Forever (Reprise)\"). He disappears, leaving Evan alone.\n\nEvan apologizes to Alana, but she has given up on Evan's help with The Connor Project as she doubts the truth of his statements that he was Connor's best friend. Evan shows her the letter to himself that he wrote when he was giving up on having a good year, claiming it to be Connor's suicide note. Realizing that the letter is the key to fulfilling the fundraising goal, Alana posts it online where, to Evan's chagrin, it goes viral. As a result, many people begin to believe Connor's suicide was because of his uncaring, wealthy parents (\"You Will Be Found (Reprise)\").\n\nThe Murphys have become the targets of hateful comments because people believe they were responsible for Connor's death. Evan, distraught, walks in on the Murphys fighting about why Connor really killed himself.  Evan admits his fabrication, hopeful that he could forge a genuine bond with the Murphys out of the tragedy. As Zoe and her mother tearfully leave, Larry turns away from Evan in disgust. Alone once more, Evan absorbs his perceived brokenness as inescapable (\"Words Fail\").\n\nHeidi sees the letter online and knows that it was one of Evan's therapy assignments. She apologizes to Evan for not seeing how badly he had been hurting, though Evan denies her guilt due to his deception. He vaguely admits that his fall from the tree was a suicide attempt. Heidi recalls the day that his father moved out and did not know how she was going to make it by herself. In the end, she realized that she was not alone \u2013 she had Evan and knew that the two of them could survive anything so long as they were together. Tearfully, Heidi promises that she will always be there for him when he needs her (\"So Big/So Small\").\n\nA year later, Evan is still living at home and working at Pottery Barn to earn enough money to go to college the next semester. He contacts Zoe, whom he has not seen since she found out the truth, and asks her to meet him. She insists that they meet at the orchard that has been reopened in Connor's memory. He apologizes for the pain he caused by manipulating her family and admits that he has been reading Connor's ten favorite books in an attempt to connect with who he really was. He thanks her and her parents for keeping his secret and reveals that they never told anyone else that his friendship with Connor was a lie. She forgives him, saying the ordeal brought her family closer together because \"everyone needed it for something.\" Evan asks her why she wanted to meet at the orchard, and she replies that she wanted to be sure he saw it, and the two share a gentle moment before they part. Evan mentally writes himself one last letter reflecting on the impact he has had on his community and finally accepts himself (\"Finale\").\n\n==Roles and principal casts==\n===Cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n!

He is assigned by his therapist to write letters to himself about why each day will be good, which becomes the catalyst for the plot of the story (hence the name, Dear Evan Hansen). He has never had any friends and has had a crush on Zoe Murphy for a very long time. After Connor's death, he begins to tell lies of his being friends with Connor to the Murphy family because they may have found Evan's letter to himself folded up in Connor's pocket; they thought Connor wrote it to Evan. The first act centers on his outreach propelled by Connor's death, while the second act has him unleash his yearning towards the Murphys and his anger towards Heidi and Jared, whom he believes have used him for validation and ignored him when they didn't need him.\n* Heidi Hansen \u2013 Evan's mother, a nurse's aide who attends paralegal school at night, often leaving Evan on his own as a result. She tries to connect with Evan but struggles because she doesn't personally understand what he goes through on a daily basis. Having been left by her ex-husband years before raising Evan on her own, she exhibits possessive and jealous behavior once she learns of the Murphys' interest in securing Evan's future. However, she comes to see her failings and Evan's concealed sorrow as a wake-up-call not to hide from her son.\n* Zoe Murphy \u2013 Connor's younger sister and Evan's longtime crush. She was never close to Connor, even hated him and thought he was a monster, but wishes she had known him better and turns to Evan after he lies and says he was friends with Connor. She is initially mad at Evan when he comes clean about the lies, but eventually forgives him a year later.\n* Cynthia Murphy \u2013 Connor and Zoe's stay-at-home mother. She is constantly trying to keep her fragile family from falling apart but is often unsuccessful. She did all that she could to keep the family together and make Connor happy, but with Larry's controlling personality, it was rather difficult. The second act elaborates on her past attempts at coaxing Connor through expensive retreats, and her bitterness towards her husband's distance.\n* Larry Murphy \u2013 Connor and Zoe's busy and distant father. He chooses to do things the hard way because he believes it's the \"right way\" throughout the musical, which turns out is just the wrong thing. It only ends up hurting Connor, resulting in strain in the entire family. He seemed to also be very controlling towards his own wife, Cynthia Murphy. Larry displays fatherlike behavior towards Evan once he comes into their lives, often saying that he was better than Connor, and that Evan is \"the son he never had\".\n* Connor Murphy \u2013 A high school senior who, like Evan, is also a social outcast with no friends. He is a frequent drug user, getting high to cope with his aggressive and violent tendencies. He has a strained relationship with his sister, Zoe, who notes that Connor had threatened her life multiple times. He dies by suicide early on, but his image returns in Evan's imagination to guide him. Evan's imaginary version of Connor is likable, contributing to Evan's belief that they could have been friends. His death is the basis of the whole story.\n* Alana Beck \u2013 Evan's earnest but melodramatic classmate. She is constantly looking for academic and extracurricular activities to boost her collegiate chances. As Alana has it, \"Connor was one of my closest acquaintances\", but is greatly affected by his death and the concept of mortality, and quickly joins Evan in founding The Connor Project in order to keep Connor's memory alive.\n* Jared Kleinman \u2013 Evan's so-called \"family friend.\" Although Jared presents himself as an arrogant jerk, he is actually also insecure like the other seniors. He helps Evan and Alana found The Connor Project.\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Anybody Have a Map?\" \u2013 Heidi, Cynthia \n* \"Waving Through a Window\" \u2013 Evan\n* \"Waving Through a Window (Reprise #1)\"* \u2013 Evan\n* \"Waving Through a Window (Reprise #2)\"* \u2013 Alana\n* \"For Forever\" \u2013 Evan\n* \"Sincerely, Me\" \u2013 Connor, Evan, Jared\n* \"Requiem\" \u2013 Zoe, Cynthia, Larry\n* \"If I Could Tell Her\" \u2013 Evan, Zoe\n* \"Disappear\" \u2013 Connor, Evan, Alana, Jared, Larry, Cynthia, Zoe\n* \"You Will Be Found\" \u2013 Evan, Alana, Jared, Zoe, Company, VC (virtual community)\n{{col-break}}\n;Act 2\n* \"Sincerely, Me (Reprise)\"* \u2013 Connor, Jared\n* \"To Break in a Glove\" \u2013 Larry, Evan\n* \"Only Us\" \u2013 Zoe, Evan\n* \"Good for You\" \u2013 Heidi, Alana, Jared, Evan \n* \"For Forever (Reprise)\"* \u2013 Connor\n* \"You Will Be Found (Reprise)\"* \u2013 Alana, Jared, VC \n* \"Words Fail\" \u2013 Evan\n* \"So Big/So Small\" \u2013 Heidi\n* \"Finale\" \u2013 Evan, Company  \n{{col-end}}*Not included on the Original Broadway Cast Recording\n\n===Orchestration===\nThe show is orchestrated for a band of eight, including the music director.

Since the success of the musical depends entirely on whether Evan's solitary nature appears funny or weird, Evan's ability to laugh at himself and make the audience laugh is crucial. Platt is charming as he eternally twists his shirt tails and hangs his head... Although the themes of grief and loneliness are serious, the musical is anything but somber. It addresses challenging facts of life. But from start to finish, when Evan leaves his room and finds an authentic life outside it, ''Dear Evan Hansen'' contains far more joy than sadness.\"<ref>{{cite journal| author=Mackay, Barbara| url=http://www.theatermania.com/washington-dc-theater/reviews/dear-evan-hansen-arena-stage-review_73746.html| title=Reviews: 'Dear Evan Hansen'| journal=Theater Mania| date=August 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles Isherwood]], in his review of the Second Stage production for ''[[The New York Times]]'', noted: \"The songs, by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (''Dogfight'', ''A Christmas Story''), strike the same complex notes, with shapely, heartfelt lyrics that expose the tensions and conflicts that Connor\u2019s death and Evan\u2019s involvement cause in both families. The music, played by a small but excellent band on a platform upstage, is appealingly unstrident pop-rock, with generous doses of acoustic guitar, keyboards and strings. It's the finest, most emotionally resonant score yet from this promising young songwriting team.\"<ref>{{cite web| authorlink=Charles Isherwood| author=Isherwood, Charles| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/theater/review-dear-evan-hansen-puts-a-twist-on-teenage-angst.html| newspaper=The New York Times| title=Review: 'Dear Evan Hansen' Puts a Twist on Teenage Angst| date=May 2, 2016}}</ref> Susan Davidson, in her review of the Arena Stage production for ''CurtainUp'', noted: \"it helps to suspend the disbelief that sullen, anti-social teenagers can change quickly. Surely that's a process requiring time-released hormonal adjustments. It is hard to accept that a long-admired-from-afar girl can change Evan's outlook on life so rapidly or that Connor's teenage disequilibrium leads him to do what he does. Coming through loud and clear, however, is the fact that what starts as deceit can be blown totally out of proportion by the Internet where lies are disseminated with lightning speed leaving plenty of victims in their wake [...] The music is pleasant, not terribly original but good enough to get toes tapping. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul's ballads stand out, particularly Heidi's 'So Big/So Small,' Evan's 'Words Fail' and Zoe and Evan's young sweethearts duet 'Only Us.'\"<ref>{{cite web| author=Davidson, Susan| url=http://www.curtainup.com/dearevanhansendc15.html| title=CurtainUP Review. ''Dear Evan Hansen''|work=Curtain Up|date=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite widespread acclaim for the show, its story and music, the overall public reception was not without its criticism. Some reviews of the show claim that it romanticizes and sanitizes mental illness by not mentioning the name of the diagnosis Evan has (many claim it to be [[social anxiety disorder]] with features of [[Asperger syndrome]]) and glorifies suicide, leaving many to question how Connor kills himself and if Evan's suicide attempt was truly intentional (even Stacey Mindich, lead producer of the original Broadway production, claimed that she and the team did not want the show to be called a \"suicide musical\" in order to gain an audience).\n\n[[Jason Zinoman]] in a piece for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' argues that the musical \"employs many different tactics to prevent us from seeing Evan Hansen as a jerk, but its most audacious is to not allow anyone onstage to see him that way...The choice to give Evan Hansen no comeuppance doesn\u2019t make dramatic sense. But you don\u2019t need to be too cynical to see its commercial and emotional logic. Not giving voice to anger at Evan Hansen avoids the more unpleasant ramifications of his exploitation of a tragedy for his own personal gain, which might complicate the audience\u2019s reaction to him. ''Evan Hansen'' isn\u2019t as interested in these themes as it is in keeping the focus on the insecurity of the outsider, the nerd, the teenager yearning for acceptance. (To be fair, it is also interested in Evan\u2019s mother, who has one of the most moving songs in the show.)\"<ref>{{cite journal| last=Zinoman| first1=Jason| title=Dear Evan Hansen, You Are a Creep| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/theater/2017/06/the_dissembling_liar_at_the_center_of_broadway_hit_dear_evan_hansen.html| date=June 6, 2017| journal=Slate| accessdate=November 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHilton Als of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' was also critical, writing \"It would have been amazing if Levenson had continued to dig into Evan\u2019s awfulness. Instead, he takes side trips into tired knee-jerk liberalism and therapeutic healing. (One of the more uncomfortable moments in the show is when Alana, a black character, played by Kristolyn Lloyd as a P.C. bully, screams about ''her'' invisibility. Levenson and the others are trying to keep up with the times and diversify, but why does it have to feel so forced and tired?) Evan confesses his deceit and makes it clear that all he wanted, really, was to be loved, because of, well, that absent daddy, that inattentive mommy, and the nastiness of the world. With that false move, the show\u2019s creators risk destroying what\u2019s so spikily fascinating about Evan. Still, until the second act, and despite it, Platt gives a performance that binds us to him in the way that Holden Caulfield, that other teen with a voice, did\u2014especially when he said, 'It\u2019s funny. Don\u2019t ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.'\"<ref>{{cite journal| url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/19/pop-psychology-onstage-in-dear-evan-hansen| title=Pop Psychology Onstage in \"Dear Evan Hansen\"| first=Hilton| last=Als| date=December 12, 2016| accessdate=February 9, 2019| journal=New Yorker}}</ref>\n\nThe West End production received many four and five star reviews.

His therapist recommends that he writes letters to himself detailing what will be good about each day. His mother, Heidi, suggests that he asks people to sign the cast on his arm to make friends. \n\nThe wealthy Murphy family consists of the parents, Cynthia and Larry, and their children Zoe and Connor. Cynthia struggles with the fact that her family is falling apart, and the two mothers wonder how to connect with their sons  (\"Anybody Have a Map?\").\n\nAt school, Evan meets Alana, a precocious but somewhat self-absorbed classmate, and Jared, his only family friend. Both Alana and Jared notice his broken arm, but neither signs his cast. Evan then runs into Connor, who interprets Evan's awkwardness as making fun of him, resulting in Connor's pushing Evan to the ground. Connor's sister Zoe, whom Evan has a crush on, feels obligated to apologize for her brother's behavior. Evan wonders if this is his destiny \u2014 to be ignored and an outcast \u2014 for the rest of his life (\"Waving Through a Window\").\n\nEvan writes a letter to himself, wondering whether anyone would notice if he were not there. All his hope is focused on Zoe, since his crush on her is the only thing that brings him happiness (\"Waving Through a Window (Reprise #1)\"). He encounters Connor again, who now offers to sign Evan's cast. Connor finds Evan's letter on the printer and reads it; he becomes furious at the mention of Zoe, thinking Evan intended for him to see the letter in order to make fun of him. He storms out, taking the letter with him.\n\nEvan is in an intense state of anxiety over what Connor might have done with the letter and tells Jared online about his assignment to write letters to himself (\"Waving Through a Window (Reprise #2)\"). Evan is called to the principal's office and is told by Connor's parents that Connor committed suicide days before, with Evan's letter found in his pocket, which they believe is a suicide note addressed to him.\n\nEvan goes to Connor's house for dinner. Jared had instructed him to \"nod and confirm\" to avoid making things worse, but Evan is awkward and uncomfortable and he lies, pretending he and Connor had been best friends, emailing each other from a secret account.  The Murphys don't question this because Mr. Murphy had been monitoring Connor's real account. Zoe and Cynthia get into an argument, and Evan jumps in, recounting a fictional version of the day he broke his arm at an abandoned apple orchard the Murphys had visited (\"For Forever\"). When Evan gets home, Heidi mentions hearing about Connor's death, but Evan tells her not to worry and that he didn't know Connor. After realizing he needs evidence of his supposed \"secret email account\", Evan enlists Jared's help in creating fake, backdated email conversations between himself and Connor (\"Sincerely, Me\").\n\nAfter Evan shows the Murphy family Connor's \"emails\", Cynthia is ecstatic that her son had a friend, but Larry is hurt that Connor took his family and his privileged life for granted. Cynthia tries to show Zoe the emails, but they argue again. Zoe still refuses to mourn Connor (\"Requiem\"). Despite this, after reading the \"suicide note\", Zoe notices that she is mentioned and asks Evan why Connor would say that about her. Evan, unable to tell her the truth, tells her all the reasons he loves her under the guise of Connor saying them (\"If I Could Tell Her\"). Overcome with emotion, he impulsively kisses Zoe, but she pulls away and tells him to leave.\n\nAt school, Evan and Alana notice that people are starting to forget about Connor, so Evan enlists Alana and Jared's help in founding \"The Connor Project\" to keep Connor's memory alive. The three pitch the idea to the Murphys, who agree to support the project (\"Disappear\"). Moved by his dedication, Cynthia gives Evan a necktie she had gotten for Connor that he had never worn and asks Evan to wear it when he speaks at Connor's memorial service. At the official launch of The Connor Project, Evan gives an inspiring speech about his loneliness and friendship with Connor, which goes viral. Zoe, overcome by the impact her brother and Evan have had, kisses him (\"You Will Be Found\").\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nEvan and Alana pitch a fundraising idea on The Connor Project's website, to raise $50,000 to reopen the abandoned apple orchard where Evan and Connor supposedly spent time. However, Evan becomes preoccupied with his new relationship with Zoe and his newfound family in the Murphys, and begins to neglect his mother, Jared, and The Connor Project (\"Sincerely, Me (Reprise)\").\n\nHeidi asks Evan why he did not tell her about The Connor Project or about his friendship with Connor. He angrily responds that he did not have the time because she is never around. Overcome with emotion, he rushes off to the Murphys, where Evan bonds with Larry Murphy and confides in him about his childhood. Larry offers him an old baseball glove of Connor's that was never used (\"To Break in a Glove\"). Later, when Evan begins to mention Connor, Zoe tells him that she does not want their relationship to be about Connor, but about the two of them (\"Only Us\").\n\nEvan goes to the Murphys, only to discover they invited Heidi for dinner. She is mortified to learn they want to give Connor's college fund to Evan. At home, Heidi and Evan fight over his secrecy and deception, with Evan confessing that he feels welcomed and accepted into the Murphy family because of Heidi's absence. Meanwhile, Alana begins to find inconsistencies in the fake emails. Evan asks Jared to help fix the inaccuracies, but Jared refuses and threatens to expose Evan, who counters that he could expose Jared's role. Heidi, Alana, and Jared converge in Evan's conscience, compounding his guilt and doubt over his decisions (\"Good for You\").\n\nEvan decides he has to confess to what he has done. Imaginary Connor attempts to talk him out of it, but Evan shouts that he needs the whole thing to be over. Connor tells him that if he tells the truth, all he has will be gone, and the only thing he will be left with is himself (\"For Forever (Reprise)\"). He disappears, leaving Evan alone.\n\nEvan apologizes to Alana, but she has given up on Evan's help with The Connor Project as she doubts the truth of his statements that he was Connor's best friend. Evan shows her the letter to himself that he wrote when he was giving up on having a good year, claiming it to be Connor's suicide note. Realizing that the letter is the key to fulfilling the fundraising goal, Alana posts it online where, to Evan's chagrin, it goes viral. As a result, many people begin to believe Connor's suicide was because of his uncaring, wealthy parents (\"You Will Be Found (Reprise)\").\n\nThe Murphys have become the targets of hateful comments because people believe they were responsible for Connor's death. Evan, distraught, walks in on the Murphys fighting about why Connor really killed himself.  Evan admits his fabrication, hopeful that he could forge a genuine bond with the Murphys out of the tragedy. As Zoe and her mother tearfully leave, Larry turns away from Evan in disgust. Alone once more, Evan absorbs his perceived brokenness as inescapable (\"Words Fail\").\n\nHeidi sees the letter online and knows that it was one of Evan's therapy assignments. She apologizes to Evan for not seeing how badly he had been hurting, though Evan denies her guilt due to his deception. He vaguely admits that his fall from the tree was a suicide attempt. Heidi recalls the day that his father moved out and did not know how she was going to make it by herself. In the end, she realized that she was not alone \u2013 she had Evan and knew that the two of them could survive anything so long as they were together. Tearfully, Heidi promises that she will always be there for him when he needs her (\"So Big/So Small\").\n\nA year later, Evan is still living at home and working at Pottery Barn to earn enough money to go to college the next semester. He contacts Zoe, whom he has not seen since she found out the truth, and asks her to meet him. She insists that they meet at the orchard that has been reopened in Connor's memory. He apologizes for the pain he caused by manipulating her family and admits that he has been reading Connor's ten favorite books in an attempt to connect with who he really was. He thanks her and her parents for keeping his secret and reveals that they never told anyone else that his friendship with Connor was a lie. She forgives him, saying the ordeal brought her family closer together because \"everyone needed it for something.\" Evan asks her why she wanted to meet at the orchard, and she replies that she wanted to be sure he saw it, and the two share a gentle moment before they part. Evan mentally writes himself one last letter reflecting on the impact he has had on his community and finally accepts himself (\"Finale\").\n\n==Roles and principal casts==\n===Cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:1000;\"\n|-\n!

He is assigned by his therapist to write letters to himself about why each day will be good, which becomes the catalyst for the plot of the story (hence the name, Dear Evan Hansen). He has never had any friends and has had a crush on Zoe Murphy for a very long time. After Connor's death, he begins to tell lies of his being friends with Connor to the Murphy family because they may have found Evan's letter to himself folded up in Connor's pocket; they thought Connor wrote it to Evan. The first act centers on his outreach propelled by Connor's death, while the second act has him unleash his yearning towards the Murphys and his anger towards Heidi and Jared, whom he believes have used him for validation and ignored him when they didn't need him.\n* Heidi Hansen \u2013 Evan's mother, a nurse's aide who attends paralegal school at night, often leaving Evan on his own as a result. She tries to connect with Evan but struggles because she doesn't personally understand what he goes through on a daily basis. Having been left by her ex-husband years before raising Evan on her own, she exhibits possessive and jealous behavior once she learns of the Murphys' interest in securing Evan's future. However, she comes to see her failings and Evan's concealed sorrow as a wake-up-call not to hide from her son.\n* Zoe Murphy \u2013 Connor's younger sister and Evan's longtime crush. She was never close to Connor, even hated him and thought he was a monster, but wishes she had known him better and turns to Evan after he lies and says he was friends with Connor. She is initially mad at Evan when he comes clean about the lies, but eventually forgives him a year later.\n* Cynthia Murphy \u2013 Connor and Zoe's stay-at-home mother. She is constantly trying to keep her fragile family from falling apart but is often unsuccessful. She did all that she could to keep the family together and make Connor happy, but with Larry's controlling personality, it was rather difficult. The second act elaborates on her past attempts at coaxing Connor through expensive retreats, and her bitterness towards her husband's distance.\n* Larry Murphy \u2013 Connor and Zoe's busy and distant father. He chooses to do things the hard way because he believes it's the \"right way\" throughout the musical, which turns out is just the wrong thing. It only ends up hurting Connor, resulting in strain in the entire family. He seemed to also be very controlling towards his own wife, Cynthia Murphy. Larry displays fatherlike behavior towards Evan once he comes into their lives, often saying that he was better than Connor, and that Evan is \"the son he never had\".\n* Connor Murphy \u2013 A high school senior who, like Evan, is also a social outcast with no friends. He is a frequent drug user, getting high to cope with his aggressive and violent tendencies. He has a strained relationship with his sister, Zoe, who notes that Connor had threatened her life multiple times. He dies by suicide early on, but his image returns in Evan's imagination to guide him. Evan's imaginary version of Connor is likable, contributing to Evan's belief that they could have been friends. His death is the basis of the whole story.\n* Alana Beck \u2013 Evan's earnest but melodramatic classmate. She is constantly looking for academic and extracurricular activities to boost her collegiate chances. As Alana has it, \"Connor was one of my closest acquaintances\", but is greatly affected by his death and the concept of mortality, and quickly joins Evan in founding The Connor Project in order to keep Connor's memory alive.\n* Jared Kleinman \u2013 Evan's so-called \"family friend.\" Although Jared presents himself as an arrogant jerk, he is actually also insecure like the other seniors. He helps Evan and Alana found The Connor Project.\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act 1\n* \"Anybody Have a Map?\" \u2013 Heidi, Cynthia \n* \"Waving Through a Window\" \u2013 Evan\n* \"Waving Through a Window (Reprise #1)\"* \u2013 Evan\n* \"Waving Through a Window (Reprise #2)\"* \u2013 Alana\n* \"For Forever\" \u2013 Evan\n* \"Sincerely, Me\" \u2013 Connor, Evan, Jared\n* \"Requiem\" \u2013 Zoe, Cynthia, Larry\n* \"If I Could Tell Her\" \u2013 Evan, Zoe\n* \"Disappear\" \u2013 Connor, Evan, Alana, Jared, Larry, Cynthia, Zoe\n* \"You Will Be Found\" \u2013 Evan, Alana, Jared, Zoe, Company, VC (virtual community)\n{{col-break}}\n;Act 2\n* \"Sincerely, Me (Reprise)\"* \u2013 Connor, Jared\n* \"To Break in a Glove\" \u2013 Larry, Evan\n* \"Only Us\" \u2013 Zoe, Evan\n* \"Good for You\" \u2013 Heidi, Alana, Jared, Evan \n* \"For Forever (Reprise)\"* \u2013 Connor\n* \"You Will Be Found (Reprise)\"* \u2013 Alana, Jared, VC \n* \"Words Fail\" \u2013 Evan\n* \"So Big/So Small\" \u2013 Heidi\n* \"Finale\" \u2013 Evan, Company  \n{{col-end}}*Not included on the Original Broadway Cast Recording\n\n===Orchestration===\nThe show is orchestrated for a band of eight, including the music director.

The story has also provided and encouraged open dialogue about its themes of [[mental illness]] and [[youth suicide]]. ''Dear Evan Hansen'' is a recipient of the 2015 Edgerton Foundation New Play Award.<ref>[http://www.tcg.org/EdgertonFoundation/NewPlayAwards/2015Awards.aspx \"2015 Awards\"] tcg.org, accessed February 9, 2019</ref>\n\nDerek Mong, in his review of the musical at the Arena Stage, wrote that the \"inventive set design by David Korins...that transforms a small stage into a platform for the most intimate living room where a mother and son share a heart-to-heart to the physical abyss of internet cyberspace... book by Steven Levenson... lyrics and music by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul... heartfelt lyrics with universal appeal joined by the perfect, oftentimes acoustic, accompaniment that can change the mood from somber to celebratory to sinister in a single bar of music.\"<ref>{{cite news| last=Mong| first=Derek| url=http://dcmetrotheaterarts.com/2015/07/31/dear-evan-hansen-at-arena-stage/#|title='Dear Evan Hansen' at Arena Stage| journal=DC Metro Theater Arts|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> Barbara Mackay in reviewing the Arena Stage production for ''TheatreMania'' wrote: \"Levenson, Pasek, and Paul set themselves two high, untraditional bars in ''Evan Hansen'': exploring a community's grief and examining a lonely protagonist who desperately wants to connect with that community... Ben Platt is outstanding as Evan... Since the success of the musical depends entirely on whether Evan's solitary nature appears funny or weird, Evan's ability to laugh at himself and make the audience laugh is crucial. Platt is charming as he eternally twists his shirt tails and hangs his head... Although the themes of grief and loneliness are serious, the musical is anything but somber. It addresses challenging facts of life. But from start to finish, when Evan leaves his room and finds an authentic life outside it, ''Dear Evan Hansen'' contains far more joy than sadness.\"<ref>{{cite journal| author=Mackay, Barbara| url=http://www.theatermania.com/washington-dc-theater/reviews/dear-evan-hansen-arena-stage-review_73746.html| title=Reviews: 'Dear Evan Hansen'| journal=Theater Mania| date=August 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles Isherwood]], in his review of the Second Stage production for ''[[The New York Times]]'', noted: \"The songs, by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (''Dogfight'', ''A Christmas Story''), strike the same complex notes, with shapely, heartfelt lyrics that expose the tensions and conflicts that Connor\u2019s death and Evan\u2019s involvement cause in both families. The music, played by a small but excellent band on a platform upstage, is appealingly unstrident pop-rock, with generous doses of acoustic guitar, keyboards and strings. It's the finest, most emotionally resonant score yet from this promising young songwriting team.\"<ref>{{cite web| authorlink=Charles Isherwood| author=Isherwood, Charles| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/theater/review-dear-evan-hansen-puts-a-twist-on-teenage-angst.html| newspaper=The New York Times| title=Review: 'Dear Evan Hansen' Puts a Twist on Teenage Angst| date=May 2, 2016}}</ref> Susan Davidson, in her review of the Arena Stage production for ''CurtainUp'', noted: \"it helps to suspend the disbelief that sullen, anti-social teenagers can change quickly. Surely that's a process requiring time-released hormonal adjustments. It is hard to accept that a long-admired-from-afar girl can change Evan's outlook on life so rapidly or that Connor's teenage disequilibrium leads him to do what he does. Coming through loud and clear, however, is the fact that what starts as deceit can be blown totally out of proportion by the Internet where lies are disseminated with lightning speed leaving plenty of victims in their wake [...] The music is pleasant, not terribly original but good enough to get toes tapping. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul's ballads stand out, particularly Heidi's 'So Big/So Small,' Evan's 'Words Fail' and Zoe and Evan's young sweethearts duet 'Only Us.'\"<ref>{{cite web| author=Davidson, Susan| url=http://www.curtainup.com/dearevanhansendc15.html| title=CurtainUP Review. ''Dear Evan Hansen''|work=Curtain Up|date=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite widespread acclaim for the show, its story and music, the overall public reception was not without its criticism. Some reviews of the show claim that it romanticizes and sanitizes mental illness by not mentioning the name of the diagnosis Evan has (many claim it to be [[social anxiety disorder]] with features of [[Asperger syndrome]]) and glorifies suicide, leaving many to question how Connor kills himself and if Evan's suicide attempt was truly intentional (even Stacey Mindich, lead producer of the original Broadway production, claimed that she and the team did not want the show to be called a \"suicide musical\" in order to gain an audience).\n\n[[Jason Zinoman]] in a piece for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' argues that the musical \"employs many different tactics to prevent us from seeing Evan Hansen as a jerk, but its most audacious is to not allow anyone onstage to see him that way...The choice to give Evan Hansen no comeuppance doesn\u2019t make dramatic sense. But you don\u2019t need to be too cynical to see its commercial and emotional logic. Not giving voice to anger at Evan Hansen avoids the more unpleasant ramifications of his exploitation of a tragedy for his own personal gain, which might complicate the audience\u2019s reaction to him. ''Evan Hansen'' isn\u2019t as interested in these themes as it is in keeping the focus on the insecurity of the outsider, the nerd, the teenager yearning for acceptance. (To be fair, it is also interested in Evan\u2019s mother, who has one of the most moving songs in the show.)\"<ref>{{cite journal| last=Zinoman| first1=Jason| title=Dear Evan Hansen, You Are a Creep| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/theater/2017/06/the_dissembling_liar_at_the_center_of_broadway_hit_dear_evan_hansen.html| date=June 6, 2017| journal=Slate| accessdate=November 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHilton Als of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' was also critical, writing \"It would have been amazing if Levenson had continued to dig into Evan\u2019s awfulness. Instead, he takes side trips into tired knee-jerk liberalism and therapeutic healing. (One of the more uncomfortable moments in the show is when Alana, a black character, played by Kristolyn Lloyd as a P.C. bully, screams about ''her'' invisibility. Levenson and the others are trying to keep up with the times and diversify, but why does it have to feel so forced and tired?) Evan confesses his deceit and makes it clear that all he wanted, really, was to be loved, because of, well, that absent daddy, that inattentive mommy, and the nastiness of the world. With that false move, the show\u2019s creators risk destroying what\u2019s so spikily fascinating about Evan. Still, until the second act, and despite it, Platt gives a performance that binds us to him in the way that Holden Caulfield, that other teen with a voice, did\u2014especially when he said, 'It\u2019s funny. Don\u2019t ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.'\"<ref>{{cite journal| url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/19/pop-psychology-onstage-in-dear-evan-hansen| title=Pop Psychology Onstage in \"Dear Evan Hansen\"| first=Hilton| last=Als| date=December 12, 2016| accessdate=February 9, 2019| journal=New Yorker}}</ref>\n\nThe West End production received many four and five star reviews.

Retrieved: 5 October 2009.</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\nIn 1925, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] held a competition between [[Nakajima Aircraft Company|Nakajima]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Aerospace Company|Kawasaki]] to design a low-wing [[monoplane]] to replace the [[Kawasaki Ki-10]] (Army Type 95 Fighter) [[biplane]]. The new fighter was to have also a better performance than the experimental [[Mitsubishi Ki-18]].<ref>{{harvnb|Januszewski|2003|p=10.}}</ref>\n\nThe results were the Nakajima Ki-27, the [[Kawasaki Ki-28]], and the [[Mitsubishi Ki-33]] (a modification of the [[Mitsubishi A5M]] [[Aircraft carrier|carrier-based]] fighter).<ref>{{harvnb|Januszewski|2003|pp=10\u201311.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wieliczko and Szeremeta|2004|p=12.}}</ref> The Nakajima design was based on its earlier [[Nakajima Ki-11|Ki-11]] monoplane fighter which lost to the Ki-10 in the Type 95 Fighter competition. When the follow-up [[Nakajima Ki-12]] proposal with a liquid-cooled engine and retractable [[landing gear]] was deemed too complex by the Japanese officials, the Ki-27 was designed by [[Koyama Yasushi]] to have an air-cooled [[radial engine]] and fixed landing gear. The aircraft had the Nakajima trademark wing with a straight [[leading edge]] and tapered [[trailing edge]] which would reappear again on the [[Nakajima Ki-43|Ki-43]], [[Nakajima Ki-44|Ki-44]], and [[Nakajima Ki-84|Ki-84]].\n\nThe Ki-27 made its first flight on 15 October 1936.<ref>{{Harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=198.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wieliczko and Szeremeta|2004|p=16.}}</ref> Although it had a slower top speed and worse climb performance than its competitors,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wieliczko and Szeremeta|2004|pp=17\u201319.}}</ref> the Army chose the Nakajima design for its outstanding turning ability granted by its remarkably low [[wing loading]]. The Army ordered 10 pre-production samples (Ki-27a) for further testing, which featured an enclosed [[cockpit]] with sliding [[Aircraft canopy|canopy]] and larger wings.\n\nThe type was officially accepted into service in 1937 as the '''Army Type 97 Fighter'''. In addition to Nakajima, the Ki-27 was also manufactured by [[Tachikawa Aircraft Company Ltd]] and [[Manshukoku Hikoki Seizo KK]], with a total of 3,368 built before production ended in 1942.\n\n[[File:Ki-27 Shimada.jpg|thumb|Nakajima Ki-27b of Kenji Shimada, commander of the 1st Chutai of the 11th Sentai, [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Battle of Khalkhyn Gol]] June 1939]]\n\n==Operational history==\nThe Ki-27 was the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force's main fighter until the start of [[World War II]]. When placed into combat service over northern China in March 1938, the Ki-27 enjoyed [[air superiority]] until the introduction of the faster Soviet-built [[Polikarpov I-16]] fighters by the Chinese.\n\n[[File:Khalkhin Gol Japanese Ki 27 1939.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A Ki-27 as used in the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]].]]\n\nIn the 1939 [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] against the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in [[Mongolia]], the Ki-27 faced both [[Polikarpov I-15]] biplane and [[Polikarpov I-16]] monoplane fighters. In the initial phase of the conflict, its performance was a match for the early model I-16s, and was considerably superior to the I-15 biplane. With better trained Ki-27 pilots, the IJAAF gained aerial superiority. The Ki-27 was armed with two 7.7&nbsp;mm (.303&nbsp;in) [[Type 89 machine gun]]s and as with most aircraft of the period, lacked [[Vehicle armour|armor]] protection for the pilot and [[Self-sealing fuel tank|self-sealing]] or fire suppression in the [[fuel tank]]s.\n\nLater, the Soviet Air Force received improved I-16s. The faster, more heavily armed (with twin wing-mounted 20mm [[ShVAK cannon]]s) and armored I-16 now nullified the Ki-27's advantages and it could now escape from the Ki-27 in a dive. The VVS introduced new tactics consisting of flying in large tightly knit formations, attacking with altitude and/or speed advantage and hit-and-run (high-energy) tactics much as [[Claire Chennault]] would later formulate for the 1941-era [[1st American Volunteer Group|Flying Tigers]] (likewise to fly against Japanese forces).\n\n[[File:Nakajima Ki-27 at Nomonhan.jpg|thumb|Ki-27s at Nomonhan, 1939]]\n\nJapanese losses mounted but despite this they claimed 1,340 aircraft (six times the admitted Soviet losses and three times as many as Soviet aircraft admitted to being in the theatre).<ref name=Fr79>{{harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=200.}}</ref> Japanese losses numbered 120 (including Ki-10s) while the Russians claimed 215 vs. a peak Japanese strength of 200 fighters.<ref name=Fr79/> (Overclaiming remained commonplace through World War Two, despite [[gun camera]]s and expert intelligence assessments.{{cn|date=June 2017|reason=it's true, but I can't source it offhand...}}) Top scoring pilot of the incident and top scoring IJAAF pilot on the Ki-27 and overall World War II IJAAF ace was [[Warrant Officer]] [[Hiromichi Shinohara]], who claimed 58 Soviet planes (including an IJAAF record of 11 in one day) whilst flying Ki-27s, only to be shot down himself by a number of I-16s on 27 August 1939.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sakaida|1997|pp=16\u201317.}}</ref>\n\nThe preference of Japanese fighter pilots for the Ki-27's high rate of turn caused the Army to focus excessively on manoeuvrability, a decision which later handicapped the development of faster and more heavily armed fighters. The Ki-27 served until the beginning of World War II in the Pacific, escorting [[bomber]]s attacking [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Netherlands East Indies]], [[Burma]] and the [[Philippines]] (where it initially fared poorly against the [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Wieliczko and Szeremeta|2004|p=57.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nakajima Ki-27 replica, Tokorozawa Aviation Museum.jpg|thumb|Ki-27 replica at [[Tokorozawa Aviation Museum]]]]\n\nThe type also saw extensive action against the [[American Volunteer Group]] in the early months of the war.

The new fighter was to have also a better performance than the experimental [[Mitsubishi Ki-18]].<ref>{{harvnb|Januszewski|2003|p=10.}}</ref>\n\nThe results were the Nakajima Ki-27, the [[Kawasaki Ki-28]], and the [[Mitsubishi Ki-33]] (a modification of the [[Mitsubishi A5M]] [[Aircraft carrier|carrier-based]] fighter).<ref>{{harvnb|Januszewski|2003|pp=10\u201311.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wieliczko and Szeremeta|2004|p=12.}}</ref> The Nakajima design was based on its earlier [[Nakajima Ki-11|Ki-11]] monoplane fighter which lost to the Ki-10 in the Type 95 Fighter competition. When the follow-up [[Nakajima Ki-12]] proposal with a liquid-cooled engine and retractable [[landing gear]] was deemed too complex by the Japanese officials, the Ki-27 was designed by [[Koyama Yasushi]] to have an air-cooled [[radial engine]] and fixed landing gear. The aircraft had the Nakajima trademark wing with a straight [[leading edge]] and tapered [[trailing edge]] which would reappear again on the [[Nakajima Ki-43|Ki-43]], [[Nakajima Ki-44|Ki-44]], and [[Nakajima Ki-84|Ki-84]].\n\nThe Ki-27 made its first flight on 15 October 1936.<ref>{{Harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=198.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wieliczko and Szeremeta|2004|p=16.}}</ref> Although it had a slower top speed and worse climb performance than its competitors,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wieliczko and Szeremeta|2004|pp=17\u201319.}}</ref> the Army chose the Nakajima design for its outstanding turning ability granted by its remarkably low [[wing loading]]. The Army ordered 10 pre-production samples (Ki-27a) for further testing, which featured an enclosed [[cockpit]] with sliding [[Aircraft canopy|canopy]] and larger wings.\n\nThe type was officially accepted into service in 1937 as the '''Army Type 97 Fighter'''. In addition to Nakajima, the Ki-27 was also manufactured by [[Tachikawa Aircraft Company Ltd]] and [[Manshukoku Hikoki Seizo KK]], with a total of 3,368 built before production ended in 1942.\n\n[[File:Ki-27 Shimada.jpg|thumb|Nakajima Ki-27b of Kenji Shimada, commander of the 1st Chutai of the 11th Sentai, [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Battle of Khalkhyn Gol]] June 1939]]\n\n==Operational history==\nThe Ki-27 was the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force's main fighter until the start of [[World War II]]. When placed into combat service over northern China in March 1938, the Ki-27 enjoyed [[air superiority]] until the introduction of the faster Soviet-built [[Polikarpov I-16]] fighters by the Chinese.\n\n[[File:Khalkhin Gol Japanese Ki 27 1939.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A Ki-27 as used in the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]].]]\n\nIn the 1939 [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] against the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in [[Mongolia]], the Ki-27 faced both [[Polikarpov I-15]] biplane and [[Polikarpov I-16]] monoplane fighters. In the initial phase of the conflict, its performance was a match for the early model I-16s, and was considerably superior to the I-15 biplane. With better trained Ki-27 pilots, the IJAAF gained aerial superiority. The Ki-27 was armed with two 7.7&nbsp;mm (.303&nbsp;in) [[Type 89 machine gun]]s and as with most aircraft of the period, lacked [[Vehicle armour|armor]] protection for the pilot and [[Self-sealing fuel tank|self-sealing]] or fire suppression in the [[fuel tank]]s.\n\nLater, the Soviet Air Force received improved I-16s. The faster, more heavily armed (with twin wing-mounted 20mm [[ShVAK cannon]]s) and armored I-16 now nullified the Ki-27's advantages and it could now escape from the Ki-27 in a dive. The VVS introduced new tactics consisting of flying in large tightly knit formations, attacking with altitude and/or speed advantage and hit-and-run (high-energy) tactics much as [[Claire Chennault]] would later formulate for the 1941-era [[1st American Volunteer Group|Flying Tigers]] (likewise to fly against Japanese forces).\n\n[[File:Nakajima Ki-27 at Nomonhan.jpg|thumb|Ki-27s at Nomonhan, 1939]]\n\nJapanese losses mounted but despite this they claimed 1,340 aircraft (six times the admitted Soviet losses and three times as many as Soviet aircraft admitted to being in the theatre).<ref name=Fr79>{{harvnb|Francillon|1979|p=200.}}</ref> Japanese losses numbered 120 (including Ki-10s) while the Russians claimed 215 vs. a peak Japanese strength of 200 fighters.<ref name=Fr79/> (Overclaiming remained commonplace through World War Two, despite [[gun camera]]s and expert intelligence assessments.{{cn|date=June 2017|reason=it's true, but I can't source it offhand...}}) Top scoring pilot of the incident and top scoring IJAAF pilot on the Ki-27 and overall World War II IJAAF ace was [[Warrant Officer]] [[Hiromichi Shinohara]], who claimed 58 Soviet planes (including an IJAAF record of 11 in one day) whilst flying Ki-27s, only to be shot down himself by a number of I-16s on 27 August 1939.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sakaida|1997|pp=16\u201317.}}</ref>\n\nThe preference of Japanese fighter pilots for the Ki-27's high rate of turn caused the Army to focus excessively on manoeuvrability, a decision which later handicapped the development of faster and more heavily armed fighters. The Ki-27 served until the beginning of World War II in the Pacific, escorting [[bomber]]s attacking [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], [[Netherlands East Indies]], [[Burma]] and the [[Philippines]] (where it initially fared poorly against the [[Brewster F2A Buffalo]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Wieliczko and Szeremeta|2004|p=57.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nakajima Ki-27 replica, Tokorozawa Aviation Museum.jpg|thumb|Ki-27 replica at [[Tokorozawa Aviation Museum]]]]\n\nThe type also saw extensive action against the [[American Volunteer Group]] in the early months of the war. Soon outclassed by the American [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]]s, the Ki-27 was replaced in front line service by the [[Nakajima Ki-43]], while surviving examples continued to serve as a [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].\n\nThe Ki-27 was also exported for use with [[Manchukuo]] and [[Military of Thailand|Thai]] armed forces, seeing combat with both. In Thai service, Ki-27s reportedly damaged two [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s and shot down one [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]].<ref name=\"Wieliczko and Szeremeta 2004 81\">{{Harvnb|Wieliczko and Szeremeta|2004|p=81.}}</ref>\n\nIn the final months of the war, desperate lack of aircraft forced the Japanese to utilize all available machines and the Ki-27 and 79 were no exception. Some were equipped with up to {{convert|500|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} of explosives for ''[[kamikaze]]'' attacks, but some were redeployed as fighters, suffering terrible losses as on 16 February 1945 when the 39th Educational Flight Regiment scrambled 16 Ki-79 trainers from Yokoshiba Airfield to oppose a massive air raid from U.S. Task Force 58 carrier group, losing six aircraft with more damaged and five pilots killed, in return damaging at least one Hellcat and possibly downing a second.<ref>{{cite web | title =Cat Fight Over Chiba | publisher =Tailhook Magazine | date =1997 |url=http://www.tailhook.org/catfgt.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119061930/http://tailhook.net/catfgt.htm|archive-date=2013-01-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\nData from<ref>{{Harvnb|Bueschel|1970|p=rear cover.}}</ref>\n;Nakajima Army Type 97 Fighter\n:Long Army designation for the Ki-27\n\n[[File:Nakajima Ki-27 and Japanese personnel.jpg|thumb|Japanese army personnel and their Ki-27s]]\n\n; Nakajima Type PE\n: Private-venture experimental aircraft with Nakajima Ha.1a engine.\n; Nakajima Ki-27\n: Prototype version with armament in response to IJAAF specs, two aircraft built.\n; Nakajima Ki-27-Kai Prototype\n: Pre-production units with armament and heavier Ha.1b engine, 10 aircraft built.\n; Ki-27a\n: First production version.

The practice of manual reproduction was widespread, due to the fact that most [[typewriters]] and printing devices were [[inventory|inventorized]] and required permission to access. This [[grassroots]] practice to evade [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|official Soviet censorship]] was fraught with danger, as harsh punishments were meted out to people caught possessing or copying censored materials. [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] summarized it as follows: \"Samizdat: I write it myself, edit it myself, censor it myself, publish it myself, distribute it myself, and spend time in prison for it myself.\"{{sfn|Bukovsky|1979|p=141}}\n\n==Name origin and variations==\n[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the word ''samizdat'' derives from ''sam'' ({{lang-ru|\u0441\u0430\u043c}}, \"self, by oneself\") and ''izdat'' ({{lang-ru|\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442}}, an abbreviation of {{lang|ru|\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|izdatel'stvo}}, \"publishing house\"), and thus means \"self-published\". The [[Ukrainian language]] has a similar term: ''samvydav'' (\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0432), from ''sam'', \"self\", and ''vydavnytstvo'', \"publishing house\".{{sfn|Balan|1993}}\n\nThe Russian poet [[Nikolai Glazkov]] coined a version of the term as a [[pun]] in the 1940s when he typed copies of his poems and included the note ''Samsebyaizdat'' (\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, \"Myself by Myself Publishers\") on the [[wikt:front page|front page]].{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=598}}\n\n''Tamizdat'' refers to literature published abroad (\u0442\u0430\u043c, ''tam'', \"there\"), often from smuggled manuscripts.{{sfn|Kind-Kov\u00e1cs|Labov|2013|p=19 fn. 1}}\n\n==Techniques==\nAll Soviet-produced [[typewriters]] and printing devices were inventorized, with their typographic samples collected right at the factory and stored in the government directory. Because every typewriter has [[Microprinting|micro features]] which are individual as much as human [[fingerprints]], it allowed the [[KGB]] investigators to promptly identify the device which was used to type or print the text in question, and apprehend its user. However, certain [[East German]] and [[Eastern European]]-made Cyrillic typewriters, most notably the [[VEB Robotron#Robotron_computers_and_typewriters|Erika]], were purchased by Soviet citizens while travelling to nearby [[socialist countries]], skipped the sample collection procedure and therefore presented more difficulty to trace. Western-produced typewriters, purchased abroad and somehow brought or smuggled into the Soviet Union, were used to type [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic text]] via [[Latin characters]]. To prevent capture, regular [[bookbinding]] of ideologically-approved books have been used to conceal the forbidden texts within.\n\n{{Quote box|quote=<poem>\"\u042d\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\" \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0451\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438,\n\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0451!\n...\u0410 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e.\n\nThe \"Erika\" takes four copies,\nThat is all!\n...But that is enough.</poem>|source=\u2014&nbsp;[[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]] on the Erika typewriter commonly used for carbon copies in Russian samizdat production.{{sfn|Etkind|1992|p=597}}|align=right|width=220px}}Samizdat copies of texts, such as [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' or [[V\u00e1clav Havel]]'s essay ''[[The Power of the Powerless]]'' were passed around among trusted friends. The techniques used to reproduce these forbidden texts varied. Several copies might be made using [[carbon paper]], either by hand or on a [[typewriter]]; at the other end of the scale, [[mainframe computer]] printers were used during night shifts to make multiple copies, and books were at times printed on semiprofessional [[printing press]]es in much larger quantities. Before [[glasnost]], most of these methods were dangerous, because copy machines, printing presses, and even typewriters in offices were under control of the organisation's [[First Department]], i.e., the KGB: reference printouts from all of these machines were stored for subsequent identification purposes, should samizdat output be found.\n\n===Physical form===\n[[File:Samizdat seen in Museum of Genocide Victims Vilnius.jpg|thumb| Samizdat concealed within a book-binding; seen in the [[Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights]], Vilnius |293x293px]]\nSamizdat distinguishes itself not only by the ideas and debates that it helped spread to a wider audience but also by its physical form. The hand-typed, often blurry and wrinkled pages with numerous typographical errors and nondescript covers helped to separate and elevate Russian samizdat from Western literature.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|pp=608\u2013609}} The physical form of samizdat arose from a simple lack of resources and the necessity to be inconspicuous. In time, dissidents in the USSR began to admire these qualities for their own sake, the ragged appearance of samizdat contrasting sharply with the smooth, well-produced appearance of texts passed by the censor's office for publication by the State. The form samizdat took gained precedence over the ideas it expressed, and became a potent symbol of the resourcefulness and rebellious spirit of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=609}} In effect, the physical form of samizdat itself elevated the reading of samizdat to a prized clandestine act.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=605}}\n\n==Readership==\n[[File:Samizdat Pages Closeup 1.jpg|thumb|Closeup of typewritten samizdat, Moscow]]\nSamizdat originated from the dissident movement of the Russian [[intelligentsia]], and most samizdat directed itself to a readership of Russian elites. While circulation of samizdat was relatively low, at around 200,000 readers on average, many of these readers possessed positions of cultural power and authority.{{sfn|Stelmakh|2001|p=147}} Furthermore, because of the presence of \"[[Doublespeak|dual consciousness]]\" in the Soviet Union, the simultaneous censorship of information and necessity of absorbing information to know how to censor it, many government officials became readers of samizdat.{{sfn|Meerson-Aksenov|Shragin|1977|p=22}} Although the general public at times came into contact with samizdat, most of the public lacked access to the few expensive samizdat texts in circulation, and expressed discontent with the highly censored reading material made available by the state.{{sfn|Stelmakh|2001|p=149}}\n\nThe purpose and methods of samizdat may contrast with the purpose of the concept of [[copyright]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feldbrugge|1975|p=23}}: \"Another legal aspect of samizdat literature is the copyright problem. [...] It grew into an important issue when the Soviet government, in an apparent attempt to impede the publication of samizdat materials abroad, joined the Geneva Convention in 1973. [...] Well-known Soviet authors, such as Solzhenitsyn, whose works regularly appear in samizdat in the Soviet Union have never claimed that their copyright was infringed by the samizdat procedure.\"</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Self-publishing|Self-published]] and self-distributed literature has a long history in Russia. ''Samizdat'' is unique to the post-[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] USSR and other countries with similar systems. Faced with the [[police state]]'s powers of censorship, society turned to underground literature for self-analysis and self-expression.{{sfn|Alexeyeva|1987|p=12}}\n\n=== Samizdat books and editions ===\n\nThe first full-length book to be distributed as samizdat was [[Boris Pasternak]]'s 1957 novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=105}} Although the literary magazine ''[[Novy Mir]]'' had published ten poems from the book in 1954, a year later the full text was judged unsuitable for publication and entered samizdat circulation.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=105}} \n\nCertain works, though published legally by the State-controlled media, were practically impossible to find in bookshops and libraries, and found their way into samizdat: for example [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s novel ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' was widely distributed via samizdat.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=105}}<ref>November 1962 issue of the ''[[Novy Mir]]'' literary magazine</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] in the mid-1950s USSR [[poetry]] became very popular.  Writings of a wide variety of poets circulated among Soviet [[intelligentsia]]: known, prohibited, repressed writers as well as those young and unknown . A number of samizdat publications carried unofficial poetry, among them the Moscow magazine ''[[Sintaksis (Moscow)|Sintaksis]]'' (1959\u20131960) by writer [[Alexander Ginzburg]], [[Vladimir Osipov]]'s ''Boomerang'' (1960), and ''[[Phoenix (literary magazine)|Phoenix]]'' (1961), produced by [[Yuri Galanskov]] and [[Alexander Ginzburg]]. The editors of these magazines were regulars at [[Mayakovsky Square poetry readings|impromptu public poetry readings]] between 1958 and 1961 on Mayakovsky Square in Moscow. The gatherings did not last long, for soon the authorities began clamping down on them. In the summer of 1961, several meeting regulars were arrested and charged with \"[[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda]]\" (Article 70 of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] [[criminal code|Penal Code]]), putting an end to most of the magazines.\n\nNot everything published in samizdat had political overtones. In 1963, [[Joseph Brodsky]] was charged with \"[[Parasitism (social offense)|social parasitism]]\" and convicted for being nothing but a poet. His poems circulated in samizdat, with only four judged as suitable for official Soviet anthologies.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=107}} In the mid-1960s an unofficial literary group known as [[SMOG (literary group)|SMOG]] (a word meaning variously ''one was able'', ''I did it'', etc; as an acronym the name also bore a range of interpretations) issued an [[almanac]] titled ''The Sphinxes'' (''Sfinksy'') and collections of prose and poetry. Some of their writings were close to the [[Russian avant-garde]] of the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nThe 1965 [[ Sinyavsky\u2013Daniel trial |show trial]] of writers [[Yuli Daniel]] and [[Andrei Sinyavsky]], charged with anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda, and the subsequent increased repression, marked the demise of the Thaw and the beginning of harsher times for samizdat authors. The trial was carefully documented in a samizdat collection called ''The White Book'' (1966), compiled by [[Yuri Galanskov]] and [[Alexander Ginzburg]]. Both writers were among those later arrested and sentenced to prison in what was known as [[The Trial of the Four]].  In the following years some samizdat content became more politicized, and played an important role in the [[dissident movement in the Soviet Union]].\n\n===Samizdat periodicals===\n[[File:Samizdat Chronicle of Current Events No 22 Cover and pages.jpg|thumb|Typewritten copy of the Russian human rights periodical [[Chronicle of Current Events|''A Chronicle of Current Events'']], Moscow|alt=|left]]\n\nThe earliest samizdat periodicals were short-lived and mainly literary in focus: ''<nowiki/>[[Sintaksis (Moscow)|Sintaksis]]'' (1959\u20131960), ''Boomerang'' (1960), and ''[[Phoenix (literary magazine)|Phoenix]]'' (1961). From 1964 to 1970, communist historian [[Roy Medvedev]] regularly published ''The Political Journal'' (in Russian \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a, or political diary), which contained analytical materials that later appeared in the West.\n\nThe longest-running and best-known samizdat periodical was ''A [[Chronicle of Current Events]]'' (\u0425\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439).<ref>[http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/chr/index.htm ''A Chronicle of Current Events, 1968\u20131982'' (in Russian)] Archive at memo.ru.</ref> It was dedicated to defending [[human rights]] by providing accurate information about events in the USSR. Over 15 years, from April 1968 to December 1982, 65 issues were published, all but two appearing in English translation.<ref>[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/ ''A Chronicle of Current Events'' 1968\u20131983 (in English).] All 1968 and 1969 issues may be found in {{harvnb|Reddaway|1972}}</ref> The anonymous editors encouraged the readers to utilize the same distribution channels in order to send feedback and local information to be published in subsequent issues.\n\nThe ''Chronicle'' was distinguished by its dry, concise style and punctilious correction of even the smallest error. Its regular rubrics were \"Arrests, Searches, Interrogations\", \"[[Extrajudicial punishment|Extra-judicial Persecution]]\", \"In Prisons and [[Gulag|Camps]]\", \"Samizdat update\", \"News in brief\", and \"Persecution of Religion\". Over time, sections were added on the \"Persecution of the [[Crimean Tatars]]\", \"Persecution and Harassment in [[Ukraine]]\", \"[[Lithuania]]n Events\", and so on.\n\nThe ''Chronicle'' editors maintained that, according to the 1936 [[Soviet Constitution]], then in force, their publication was not illegal. The authorities did not accept the argument. Many people were harassed, arrested, imprisoned, or forced to leave the country for their involvement in the ''Chronicle''{{'}}s production and distribution. The periodical's typist and first editor [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] was arrested and put in a psychiatric hospital for taking part in the August [[1968 Red Square demonstration|1968 Red Square protest]] against the invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1974, two of the periodical's close associates (Pyotr Yakir and [[Victor Krasin]]) were persuaded to denounce their fellow editors and the ''Chronicle'' on Soviet television. This put an end to the periodical's activities, until [[Sergei Kovalev]], Tatyana Khodorovich and [[Tatyana Velikanova]] openly announced their readiness to resume publication. After being arrested and imprisoned, they were replaced, in turn, by others.\n\nAnother notable and long-running (about 20 issues in the period of 1972\u20131980) publication was the ''[[refusenik (Soviet Union)|refusenik]]'' political and literary magazine \"\u0415\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420\" (Yevrei v SSSR, ''Jews in the USSR''), founded and edited by Alexander Voronel and, after his imprisonment, by Mark Azbel and Alexander Luntz.\n\nThe late 1980s, which were marked by an increase in informal organizations, saw a renewed wave of samizdat periodicals in the Soviet Union. Publications that were active during that time included ''Glasnost'' (edited by [[Sergei Grigoryants]]), ''Ekspress-khronika'' (''Express-Chronicle,'' edited by [[Alexander Podrabinek]]), ''Svobodnoye slovo'' (\"Free word\", by the Democratic Union formed in May 1988), ''Levyi povorot'' (\"Left turn\", edited by [[Boris Kagarlitsky]]), ''Otkrytaya zona'' (\"Open zone\") of Club Perestroika, ''Merkurii'' (\"Mercury\", edited by Elena Zelinskaya) and ''Khronograph'' (\"Chronograph\", put out by a number of Moscow activists).{{sfn|Urban|Igrunov|Mitrokhin|1997|p=87}}\n\nNot all samizdat trends were liberal or clearly opposed to the Soviet regime and the literary establishment. \"The ''Russian Party''... was a very strange element of the political landscape of [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s era\u2014feeling themselves practically dissidents, members of the ''Russian Party'' with rare exceptions took quite prestigious official positions in the world of writers or journalists,\" wrote [[Oleg Kashin]] in 2009.{{sfn|Kashin|2009}}\n\n==Genres of samizdat==\nSamizdat covered a large range of topics, mainly including literature and works focused on religion, nationality, and politics.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=572}} The state censored a variety of materials such as detective novels, adventure stories, and science fiction in addition to dissident texts, resulting in the underground publication of samizdat covering a wide range of topics. Though most samizdat authors directed their works towards the intelligentsia, samizdat included lowbrow genres in addition to scholarly works.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=606}}\n\nHyung-Min Joo carried out a detailed analysis of an archive of samizdat (\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0432 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0430, ''Arkhiv Samizdata'' by ''[[Radio Liberty]]'', sponsored by the [[US Congress]] and launched in the 1960s, and reported that of its 6,607 items, 1% were literary, 17% nationalist, 20% religious, and 62% political, noting that as a rule, literary works were not collected there, so their 1%  (only 73 texts) are not representative of their real share of circulation. {{sfn|Joo|2004|p=572}}\n\n===Literary===\n[[File:Samizdat Vasily Grossmann Everything Flows Cover.jpg|thumb|Typewritten edition of ''Everything Flows'' by [[Vasily Grossman]], Moscow|alt=|left]]In its early years, samizdat defined itself as a primarily literary phenomenon that included the distribution of poetry, classic unpublished Russian literature, and famous 20th century foreign literature.{{sfn|Stelmakh|2001|p=148}} Literature played a key role in the existence of the samizdat phenomenon. For instance, the USSR's refusal to publish Boris Pasternak's epic novel, ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', due to its focus on individual characters rather than the welfare of the state, led to the novel's subsequent underground publication. The fact that ''Doctor Zhivago'' contained no overt messages of dissidence highlighted the clumsiness of the state's censorship process, which caused a shift of readership away from state-published material.{{sfn|Meerson-Aksenov|Shragin|1977|p=27}} Likewise, the circulation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's famous work about the gulag system, ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', promoted a samizdat revival during the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=575}} However, because samizdat by definition placed itself in opposition to the state, samizdat works became increasingly focused on the state's violation of human rights, before shifting towards politics.{{sfn|Meerson-Aksenov|Shragin|1977|p=30}}\n\n===Political===\nThe majority of samizdat texts were politically focused.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=572}} Most of the political texts were personal statements, appeals, protests, or information on arrests and trials.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=574}} Other political samizdat included analyses of various crises within the USSR, and suggested alternatives to the government's handling of events.\n\nNo unified political thought existed within samizdat; rather, authors debated from a variety of perspectives. Samizdat written from socialist, democratic and Slavophile perspectives dominated the debates.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=576}} Socialist authors compared the current state of the government to the [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals of socialism, and appealed to the state to fulfil its promises. Socialist samizdat writers hoped to give a \"human face\" to socialism by expressing dissatisfaction with the system of censorship.{{sfn|Meerson-Aksenov|Shragin|1977|p=47}} Many socialists put faith in the potential for reform in the Soviet Union, especially because of the political liberalization which occurred under [[Alexander Dub\u010dek|Dub\u010dek]] in Czechoslovakia. However, the Soviet Union invasion of a liberalizing Czechoslovakia, in the events of \"[[Prague Spring]]\", crushed hopes for reform and stymied the power of the socialist viewpoint.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=587}} Because the state proved itself unwilling to reform, samizdat began to focus on alternative political systems.[[File:Samizdat Zhores Medvedev International Scientific Cooperation Cover.jpg|thumb|Typewritten edition of ''National Frontiers and International Scientific Cooperation'' by [[Zhores Medvedev]].]]\n\nWithin samizdat, several works focused on the possibility of a [[democracy|democratic]] political system. Democratic samizdat possessed a revolutionary nature because of its claim that a fundamental shift in political structure was necessary to reform the state, unlike socialists, who hoped to work within the same basic political framework to achieve change. Despite the revolutionary nature of the democratic samizdat authors, most democrats advocated moderate strategies for change. Most democrats believed in an evolutionary approach to achieving democracy in the USSR, and they focused on advancing their cause along open, public routes, rather than underground routes.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=587\u2013588}}\n\nIn opposition to both democratic and socialist samizdat, [[Slavophile]] samizdat grouped democracy and socialism together as Western ideals that were unsuited to the Eastern European mentality. Slavophile samizdat brought a nationalistic Russian perspective to the political debate, and espoused the importance of cultural diversity and the uniqueness of Slavic cultures. Samizdat written from the Slavophile perspective attempted to unite the USSR under a vision of a shared glorious history of Russian autocracy and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]. Consequently, the fact that the USSR encompassed a diverse range of nationalities and lacked a singular Russian history hindered the Slavophile movement. By espousing frequently racist and anti-Semitic views of Russian superiority, through either purity of blood or the strength of Russian Orthodoxy, the Slavophile movement in samizdat alienated readers and created divisions within the opposition.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=588}}\n\n===Religious===\nPredominantly Orthodox, Baptist, Pentecostalist, Catholic, and Adventist groups authored religious samizdat texts. Though a diversity of religious samizdat circulated, including three Buddhist texts, no known Islamic samizdat texts exist. The lack of Islamic samizdat appears incongruous with the large percentage of Muslims who resided in the USSR.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=574}}\n\n===Nationalist===\nJewish samizdat importantly advocated for the end of repression of Jews in the USSR and expressed a desire for [[Aliyah|exodus]], the ability to leave Russia for an Israeli homeland. Jewish samizdat encouraged Zionism. The exodus movement also broached broader topics of human rights and freedoms of Soviet citizens.<ref>Meerson-Aksenov, \"The Jewish Question in the USSR \u2013 The Movement for Exodus,\" 385\u201386.</ref> However, a divide existed within Jewish samizdat between authors who advocated exodus, and those who argued that Jews should remain in the USSR to fight for their rights. \n\n[[Crimean Tatars]] and [[Volga Germans]] also created samizdat, protesting the state's refusal to allow them to return to their homelands following Stalin's death. \n\nUkrainian samvydav opposed the assumed superiority of Russian culture over [[Ukrainian culture]] and condemned the forced assimilation of [[Ukrainians]] to the [[Russian language]].{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=573\u2013574}} \n\nIn addition to samizdat focused on Jewish, Ukrainian, and Crimean Tartar concerns, authors also advocated the causes of a great many other nationalities.\n\n==Contraband audio==\n[[File:X ray record.jpg|thumb|Homemade \"bone record\"|alt=|right]]\n[[Ribs (recordings)|Ribs]], \"music on the ribs\", \"bone records\",{{sfn|NPR|2016}} or ''roentgenizdat'' (''roentgen-'' referring to X-ray, and ''-izdat'' implying samizdat) were [[production of gramophone records#Home recording|homemade]] [[gramophone record|phonograph records]], copied from forbidden recordings that were smuggled into the country. Their content was Western [[rock and roll]], [[jazz]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], and other music, and music by banned emigres. They were sold and traded on the [[black market]].\n\nEach disc is a thin, flexible plastic sheet recorded with a spiral groove on one side, playable on a normal [[phonograph]] turntable at 78 RPM. They were made from an inexpensive, available material: used X-ray film.

The practice of manual reproduction was widespread due to most [[typewriters]] and printing devices were [[inventory|inventorized]] and required permission to access. This [[grassroots]] practice to evade [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|official Soviet censorship]] was fraught with danger, as harsh punishments were meted out to people caught possessing or copying censored materials. [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] summarized it as follows: \"Samizdat: I write it myself, edit it myself, censor it myself, publish it myself, distribute it myself, and spend time in prison for it myself.\"{{sfn|Bukovsky|1979|p=141}}\n\n==Name origin and variations==\n[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the word ''samizdat'' derives from ''sam'' ({{lang-ru|\u0441\u0430\u043c}}, \"self, by oneself\") and ''izdat'' ({{lang-ru|\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442}}, an abbreviation of {{lang|ru|\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|izdatel'stvo}}, \"publishing house\"), and thus means \"self-published\". The [[Ukrainian language]] has a similar term: ''samvydav'' (\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0432), from ''sam'', \"self\", and ''vydavnytstvo'', \"publishing house\".{{sfn|Balan|1993}}\n\nThe Russian poet [[Nikolai Glazkov]] coined a version of the term as a [[pun]] in the 1940s when he typed copies of his poems and included the note ''Samsebyaizdat'' (\u0421\u0430\u043c\u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442, \"Myself by Myself Publishers\") on the [[wikt:front page|front page]].{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=598}}\n\n''Tamizdat'' refers to literature published abroad (\u0442\u0430\u043c, ''tam'', \"there\"), often from smuggled manuscripts.{{sfn|Kind-Kov\u00e1cs|Labov|2013|p=19 fn. 1}}\n\n==Techniques==\nAll Soviet-produced [[typewriters]] and printing devices were inventorized, with their typographic samples collected right at the factory and stored in the government directory. Because every typewriter has [[Microprinting|micro features]] which are individual as much as human [[fingerprints]], it allowed the [[KGB]] investigators to promptly identify the device which was used to type or print the text in question, and apprehend its user. However, certain [[East German]] and [[Eastern European]]-made Cyrillic typewriters, most notably the [[VEB Robotron#Robotron_computers_and_typewriters|Erika]], were purchased by Soviet citizens while travelling to nearby [[socialist countries]], skipped the sample collection procedure and therefore presented more difficulty to trace. Western-produced typewriters, purchased abroad and somehow brought or smuggled into the Soviet Union, were used to type [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic text]] via [[Latin characters]]. To prevent capture, regular [[bookbinding]] of ideologically-approved books have been used to conceal the forbidden texts within.\n\n{{Quote box|quote=<poem>\"\u042d\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\" \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0451\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438,\n\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0451!\n...\u0410 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e.\n\nThe \"Erika\" takes four copies,\nThat is all!\n...But that is enough.</poem>|source=\u2014&nbsp;[[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]] on the Erika typewriter commonly used for carbon copies in Russian samizdat production.{{sfn|Etkind|1992|p=597}}|align=right|width=220px}}Samizdat copies of texts, such as [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' or [[V\u00e1clav Havel]]'s essay ''[[The Power of the Powerless]]'' were passed around among trusted friends. The techniques used to reproduce these forbidden texts varied. Several copies might be made using [[carbon paper]], either by hand or on a [[typewriter]]; at the other end of the scale, [[mainframe computer]] printers were used during night shifts to make multiple copies, and books were at times printed on semiprofessional [[printing press]]es in much larger quantities. Before [[glasnost]], most of these methods were dangerous, because copy machines, printing presses, and even typewriters in offices were under control of the organisation's [[First Department]], i.e., the KGB: reference printouts from all of these machines were stored for subsequent identification purposes, should samizdat output be found.\n\n===Physical form===\n[[File:Samizdat seen in Museum of Genocide Victims Vilnius.jpg|thumb| Samizdat concealed within a book-binding; seen in the [[Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights]], Vilnius |293x293px]]\nSamizdat distinguishes itself not only by the ideas and debates that it helped spread to a wider audience but also by its physical form. The hand-typed, often blurry and wrinkled pages with numerous typographical errors and nondescript covers helped to separate and elevate Russian samizdat from Western literature.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|pp=608\u2013609}} The physical form of samizdat arose from a simple lack of resources and the necessity to be inconspicuous. In time, dissidents in the USSR began to admire these qualities for their own sake, the ragged appearance of samizdat contrasting sharply with the smooth, well-produced appearance of texts passed by the censor's office for publication by the State. The form samizdat took gained precedence over the ideas it expressed, and became a potent symbol of the resourcefulness and rebellious spirit of the inhabitants of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=609}} In effect, the physical form of samizdat itself elevated the reading of samizdat to a prized clandestine act.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=605}}\n\n==Readership==\n[[File:Samizdat Pages Closeup 1.jpg|thumb|Closeup of typewritten samizdat, Moscow]]\nSamizdat originated from the dissident movement of the Russian [[intelligentsia]], and most samizdat directed itself to a readership of Russian elites. While circulation of samizdat was relatively low, at around 200,000 readers on average, many of these readers possessed positions of cultural power and authority.{{sfn|Stelmakh|2001|p=147}} Furthermore, because of the presence of \"[[Doublespeak|dual consciousness]]\" in the Soviet Union, the simultaneous censorship of information and necessity of absorbing information to know how to censor it, many government officials became readers of samizdat.{{sfn|Meerson-Aksenov|Shragin|1977|p=22}} Although the general public at times came into contact with samizdat, most of the public lacked access to the few expensive samizdat texts in circulation, and expressed discontent with the highly censored reading material made available by the state.{{sfn|Stelmakh|2001|p=149}}\n\nThe purpose and methods of samizdat may contrast with the purpose of the concept of [[copyright]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feldbrugge|1975|p=23}}: \"Another legal aspect of samizdat literature is the copyright problem. [...] It grew into an important issue when the Soviet government, in an apparent attempt to impede the publication of samizdat materials abroad, joined the Geneva Convention in 1973. [...] Well-known Soviet authors, such as Solzhenitsyn, whose works regularly appear in samizdat in the Soviet Union have never claimed that their copyright was infringed by the samizdat procedure.\"</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Self-publishing|Self-published]] and self-distributed literature has a long history in Russia. ''Samizdat'' is unique to the post-[[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] USSR and other countries with similar systems. Faced with the [[police state]]'s powers of censorship, society turned to underground literature for self-analysis and self-expression.{{sfn|Alexeyeva|1987|p=12}}\n\n=== Samizdat books and editions ===\n\nThe first full-length book to be distributed as samizdat was [[Boris Pasternak]]'s 1957 novel ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=105}} Although the literary magazine ''[[Novy Mir]]'' had published ten poems from the book in 1954, a year later the full text was judged unsuitable for publication and entered samizdat circulation.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=105}} \n\nCertain works, though published legally by the State-controlled media, were practically impossible to find in bookshops and libraries, and found their way into samizdat: for example [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s novel ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' was widely distributed via samizdat.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=105}}<ref>November 1962 issue of the ''[[Novy Mir]]'' literary magazine</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] in the mid-1950s USSR [[poetry]] became very popular.  Writings of a wide variety of poets circulated among Soviet [[intelligentsia]]: known, prohibited, repressed writers as well as those young and unknown . A number of samizdat publications carried unofficial poetry, among them the Moscow magazine ''[[Sintaksis (Moscow)|Sintaksis]]'' (1959\u20131960) by writer [[Alexander Ginzburg]], [[Vladimir Osipov]]'s ''Boomerang'' (1960), and ''[[Phoenix (literary magazine)|Phoenix]]'' (1961), produced by [[Yuri Galanskov]] and [[Alexander Ginzburg]]. The editors of these magazines were regulars at [[Mayakovsky Square poetry readings|impromptu public poetry readings]] between 1958 and 1961 on Mayakovsky Square in Moscow. The gatherings did not last long, for soon the authorities began clamping down on them. In the summer of 1961, several meeting regulars were arrested and charged with \"[[Anti-Soviet agitation|anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda]]\" (Article 70 of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]] [[criminal code|Penal Code]]), putting an end to most of the magazines.\n\nNot everything published in samizdat had political overtones. In 1963, [[Joseph Brodsky]] was charged with \"[[Parasitism (social offense)|social parasitism]]\" and convicted for being nothing but a poet. His poems circulated in samizdat, with only four judged as suitable for official Soviet anthologies.{{sfn|Crump|2013|p=107}} In the mid-1960s an unofficial literary group known as [[SMOG (literary group)|SMOG]] (a word meaning variously ''one was able'', ''I did it'', etc; as an acronym the name also bore a range of interpretations) issued an [[almanac]] titled ''The Sphinxes'' (''Sfinksy'') and collections of prose and poetry. Some of their writings were close to the [[Russian avant-garde]] of the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nThe 1965 [[ Sinyavsky\u2013Daniel trial |show trial]] of writers [[Yuli Daniel]] and [[Andrei Sinyavsky]], charged with anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda, and the subsequent increased repression, marked the demise of the Thaw and the beginning of harsher times for samizdat authors. The trial was carefully documented in a samizdat collection called ''The White Book'' (1966), compiled by [[Yuri Galanskov]] and [[Alexander Ginzburg]]. Both writers were among those later arrested and sentenced to prison in what was known as [[The Trial of the Four]].  In the following years some samizdat content became more politicized, and played an important role in the [[dissident movement in the Soviet Union]].\n\n===Samizdat periodicals===\n[[File:Samizdat Chronicle of Current Events No 22 Cover and pages.jpg|thumb|Typewritten copy of the Russian human rights periodical [[Chronicle of Current Events|''A Chronicle of Current Events'']], Moscow|alt=|left]]\n\nThe earliest samizdat periodicals were short-lived and mainly literary in focus: ''<nowiki/>[[Sintaksis (Moscow)|Sintaksis]]'' (1959\u20131960), ''Boomerang'' (1960), and ''[[Phoenix (literary magazine)|Phoenix]]'' (1961). From 1964 to 1970, communist historian [[Roy Medvedev]] regularly published ''The Political Journal'' (in Russian \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a, or political diary), which contained analytical materials that later appeared in the West.\n\nThe longest-running and best-known samizdat periodical was ''A [[Chronicle of Current Events]]'' (\u0425\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0439).<ref>[http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/chr/index.htm ''A Chronicle of Current Events, 1968\u20131982'' (in Russian)] Archive at memo.ru.</ref> It was dedicated to defending [[human rights]] by providing accurate information about events in the USSR. Over 15 years, from April 1968 to December 1982, 65 issues were published, all but two appearing in English translation.<ref>[https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/ ''A Chronicle of Current Events'' 1968\u20131983 (in English).] All 1968 and 1969 issues may be found in {{harvnb|Reddaway|1972}}</ref> The anonymous editors encouraged the readers to utilize the same distribution channels in order to send feedback and local information to be published in subsequent issues.\n\nThe ''Chronicle'' was distinguished by its dry, concise style and punctilious correction of even the smallest error. Its regular rubrics were \"Arrests, Searches, Interrogations\", \"[[Extrajudicial punishment|Extra-judicial Persecution]]\", \"In Prisons and [[Gulag|Camps]]\", \"Samizdat update\", \"News in brief\", and \"Persecution of Religion\". Over time, sections were added on the \"Persecution of the [[Crimean Tatars]]\", \"Persecution and Harassment in [[Ukraine]]\", \"[[Lithuania]]n Events\", and so on.\n\nThe ''Chronicle'' editors maintained that, according to the 1936 [[Soviet Constitution]], then in force, their publication was not illegal. The authorities did not accept the argument. Many people were harassed, arrested, imprisoned, or forced to leave the country for their involvement in the ''Chronicle''{{'}}s production and distribution. The periodical's typist and first editor [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]] was arrested and put in a psychiatric hospital for taking part in the August [[1968 Red Square demonstration|1968 Red Square protest]] against the invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1974, two of the periodical's close associates (Pyotr Yakir and [[Victor Krasin]]) were persuaded to denounce their fellow editors and the ''Chronicle'' on Soviet television. This put an end to the periodical's activities, until [[Sergei Kovalev]], Tatyana Khodorovich and [[Tatyana Velikanova]] openly announced their readiness to resume publication. After being arrested and imprisoned, they were replaced, in turn, by others.\n\nAnother notable and long-running (about 20 issues in the period of 1972\u20131980) publication was the ''[[refusenik (Soviet Union)|refusenik]]'' political and literary magazine \"\u0415\u0432\u0440\u0435\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420\" (Yevrei v SSSR, ''Jews in the USSR''), founded and edited by Alexander Voronel and, after his imprisonment, by Mark Azbel and Alexander Luntz.\n\nThe late 1980s, which were marked by an increase in informal organizations, saw a renewed wave of samizdat periodicals in the Soviet Union. Publications that were active during that time included ''Glasnost'' (edited by [[Sergei Grigoryants]]), ''Ekspress-khronika'' (''Express-Chronicle,'' edited by [[Alexander Podrabinek]]), ''Svobodnoye slovo'' (\"Free word\", by the Democratic Union formed in May 1988), ''Levyi povorot'' (\"Left turn\", edited by [[Boris Kagarlitsky]]), ''Otkrytaya zona'' (\"Open zone\") of Club Perestroika, ''Merkurii'' (\"Mercury\", edited by Elena Zelinskaya) and ''Khronograph'' (\"Chronograph\", put out by a number of Moscow activists).{{sfn|Urban|Igrunov|Mitrokhin|1997|p=87}}\n\nNot all samizdat trends were liberal or clearly opposed to the Soviet regime and the literary establishment. \"The ''Russian Party''... was a very strange element of the political landscape of [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s era\u2014feeling themselves practically dissidents, members of the ''Russian Party'' with rare exceptions took quite prestigious official positions in the world of writers or journalists,\" wrote [[Oleg Kashin]] in 2009.{{sfn|Kashin|2009}}\n\n==Genres of samizdat==\nSamizdat covered a large range of topics, mainly including literature and works focused on religion, nationality, and politics.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=572}} The state censored a variety of materials such as detective novels, adventure stories, and science fiction in addition to dissident texts, resulting in the underground publication of samizdat covering a wide range of topics. Though most samizdat authors directed their works towards the intelligentsia, samizdat included lowbrow genres in addition to scholarly works.{{sfn|Komaromi|2004|p=606}}\n\nHyung-Min Joo carried out a detailed analysis of an archive of samizdat (\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0432 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0430, ''Arkhiv Samizdata'' by ''[[Radio Liberty]]'', sponsored by the [[US Congress]] and launched in the 1960s, and reported that of its 6,607 items, 1% were literary, 17% nationalist, 20% religious, and 62% political, noting that as a rule, literary works were not collected there, so their 1%  (only 73 texts) are not representative of their real share of circulation. {{sfn|Joo|2004|p=572}}\n\n===Literary===\n[[File:Samizdat Vasily Grossmann Everything Flows Cover.jpg|thumb|Typewritten edition of ''Everything Flows'' by [[Vasily Grossman]], Moscow|alt=|left]]In its early years, samizdat defined itself as a primarily literary phenomenon that included the distribution of poetry, classic unpublished Russian literature, and famous 20th century foreign literature.{{sfn|Stelmakh|2001|p=148}} Literature played a key role in the existence of the samizdat phenomenon. For instance, the USSR's refusal to publish Boris Pasternak's epic novel, ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', due to its focus on individual characters rather than the welfare of the state, led to the novel's subsequent underground publication. The fact that ''Doctor Zhivago'' contained no overt messages of dissidence highlighted the clumsiness of the state's censorship process, which caused a shift of readership away from state-published material.{{sfn|Meerson-Aksenov|Shragin|1977|p=27}} Likewise, the circulation of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's famous work about the gulag system, ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', promoted a samizdat revival during the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=575}} However, because samizdat by definition placed itself in opposition to the state, samizdat works became increasingly focused on the state's violation of human rights, before shifting towards politics.{{sfn|Meerson-Aksenov|Shragin|1977|p=30}}\n\n===Political===\nThe majority of samizdat texts were politically focused.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=572}} Most of the political texts were personal statements, appeals, protests, or information on arrests and trials.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=574}} Other political samizdat included analyses of various crises within the USSR, and suggested alternatives to the government's handling of events.\n\nNo unified political thought existed within samizdat; rather, authors debated from a variety of perspectives. Samizdat written from socialist, democratic and Slavophile perspectives dominated the debates.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=576}} Socialist authors compared the current state of the government to the [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideals of socialism, and appealed to the state to fulfil its promises. Socialist samizdat writers hoped to give a \"human face\" to socialism by expressing dissatisfaction with the system of censorship.{{sfn|Meerson-Aksenov|Shragin|1977|p=47}} Many socialists put faith in the potential for reform in the Soviet Union, especially because of the political liberalization which occurred under [[Alexander Dub\u010dek|Dub\u010dek]] in Czechoslovakia. However, the Soviet Union invasion of a liberalizing Czechoslovakia, in the events of \"[[Prague Spring]]\", crushed hopes for reform and stymied the power of the socialist viewpoint.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=587}} Because the state proved itself unwilling to reform, samizdat began to focus on alternative political systems.[[File:Samizdat Zhores Medvedev International Scientific Cooperation Cover.jpg|thumb|Typewritten edition of ''National Frontiers and International Scientific Cooperation'' by [[Zhores Medvedev]].]]\n\nWithin samizdat, several works focused on the possibility of a [[democracy|democratic]] political system. Democratic samizdat possessed a revolutionary nature because of its claim that a fundamental shift in political structure was necessary to reform the state, unlike socialists, who hoped to work within the same basic political framework to achieve change. Despite the revolutionary nature of the democratic samizdat authors, most democrats advocated moderate strategies for change. Most democrats believed in an evolutionary approach to achieving democracy in the USSR, and they focused on advancing their cause along open, public routes, rather than underground routes.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=587\u2013588}}\n\nIn opposition to both democratic and socialist samizdat, [[Slavophile]] samizdat grouped democracy and socialism together as Western ideals that were unsuited to the Eastern European mentality. Slavophile samizdat brought a nationalistic Russian perspective to the political debate, and espoused the importance of cultural diversity and the uniqueness of Slavic cultures. Samizdat written from the Slavophile perspective attempted to unite the USSR under a vision of a shared glorious history of Russian autocracy and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]]. Consequently, the fact that the USSR encompassed a diverse range of nationalities and lacked a singular Russian history hindered the Slavophile movement. By espousing frequently racist and anti-Semitic views of Russian superiority, through either purity of blood or the strength of Russian Orthodoxy, the Slavophile movement in samizdat alienated readers and created divisions within the opposition.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=588}}\n\n===Religious===\nPredominantly Orthodox, Baptist, Pentecostalist, Catholic, and Adventist groups authored religious samizdat texts. Though a diversity of religious samizdat circulated, including three Buddhist texts, no known Islamic samizdat texts exist. The lack of Islamic samizdat appears incongruous with the large percentage of Muslims who resided in the USSR.{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=574}}\n\n===Nationalist===\nJewish samizdat importantly advocated for the end of repression of Jews in the USSR and expressed a desire for [[Aliyah|exodus]], the ability to leave Russia for an Israeli homeland. Jewish samizdat encouraged Zionism. The exodus movement also broached broader topics of human rights and freedoms of Soviet citizens.<ref>Meerson-Aksenov, \"The Jewish Question in the USSR \u2013 The Movement for Exodus,\" 385\u201386.</ref> However, a divide existed within Jewish samizdat between authors who advocated exodus, and those who argued that Jews should remain in the USSR to fight for their rights. \n\n[[Crimean Tatars]] and [[Volga Germans]] also created samizdat, protesting the state's refusal to allow them to return to their homelands following Stalin's death. \n\nUkrainian samvydav opposed the assumed superiority of Russian culture over [[Ukrainian culture]] and condemned the forced assimilation of [[Ukrainians]] to the [[Russian language]].{{sfn|Joo|2004|p=573\u2013574}} \n\nIn addition to samizdat focused on Jewish, Ukrainian, and Crimean Tartar concerns, authors also advocated the causes of a great many other nationalities.\n\n==Contraband audio==\n[[File:X ray record.jpg|thumb|Homemade \"bone record\"|alt=|right]]\n[[Ribs (recordings)|Ribs]], \"music on the ribs\", \"bone records\",{{sfn|NPR|2016}} or ''roentgenizdat'' (''roentgen-'' referring to X-ray, and ''-izdat'' implying samizdat) were [[production of gramophone records#Home recording|homemade]] [[gramophone record|phonograph records]], copied from forbidden recordings that were smuggled into the country. Their content was Western [[rock and roll]], [[jazz]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], and other music, and music by banned emigres. They were sold and traded on the [[black market]].\n\nEach disc is a thin, flexible plastic sheet recorded with a spiral groove on one side, playable on a normal [[phonograph]] turntable at 78 RPM. They were made from an inexpensive, available material: used X-ray film. Each large rectangular sheet was trimmed into a circle and individually recorded using an improvised [[LP record#History|recording lathe]]. The discs and their limited sound quality resemble the mass-produced [[sound sheet|flexi disc]], and may have been inspired by it.\n\n''[[Magnitizdat]]'', less common, is the distribution of sound recordings on audio tape, often of underground music groups, [[Bard (Soviet Union)|bards]], or lectures (''magnit-'' referring to [[magnetic tape]]).\n\n==Further influence==\nAfter [[Bell Labs]] changed its [[UNIX]] licence in 1979 to make dissemination of the source code illegal, the 1976 [[Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition, with Source Code|Lions book]] which contained the source code had to be withdrawn, but illegal copies of it circulated for years. \n\nThe act of copying the Lions book was often referred to as samizdat.

At the start of the game, each player randomly receives a gameboard called a \"Wonder board\". Each board depicts one of [[Antipater of Sidon]]'s original [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. Players place cards representing various materials and structures around their Wonder boards. The boards are double-sided; the wonders on side A are generally easier to build, while those on side B grant more interesting benefits.<ref>Bauza, Antoine. ''7 Wonders Rulebook and Scorecard''. Repos Production, 2010, p. 9.</ref>\n\n''7 Wonders'' is played over three ages, known in the game as Ages I, II, and III, each using its own decks of cards. In each age, seven cards are randomly dealt to each player. The game uses a card-drafting mechanic in which, once per turn, each player selects a card to play from his or her hand, then passes the remaining cards (face-down) to the next player. This process is repeated until five out of the seven cards have been played. At this point, each player must choose to play one of his remaining two cards and discard the other.\n\nEach age card represents a structure, and playing a card is referred to as building a structure. To build a structure, a player must first pay the construction cost, in coins or in one or more of the seven resource types, then lay it down by his or her Wonder board. A player lacking the resources available may pay his direct neighbors to use their resources, normally at two coins per resource, if available.\n\nInstead of building a structure, a player may choose either to discard an Age card to earn three coins from the bank or to use the card to build a stage of his or her wonder. The Wonder boards have from two to four stages, shown at the bottom of the board. To build a wonder stage, a player must pay the resource cost listed on the stage, then put an age card underneath the wonder board in the appropriate place.\n\nThere are seven types of Age cards, representing different types of structures, which are determined by the color of their background:\n\n# Red cards (military structures) contain \"shield\" symbols; these are added together to give a player's military strength, which is used in conflict resolution at the end of each age.\n# Yellow cards (commercial structures) have several effects: they can grant coins, resources, and/or victory points or decrease the cost of buying resources from neighbors.\n# Green cards (scientific structures): each card has one of three symbols. Combinations of the symbols are worth victory points.\n# Blue cards (civic structures [mistranslated as \"civilian\" in the game rules]): all grant a fixed number of victory points.\n# Brown cards (raw materials) provide one or two of the four raw material resources used in the game (wood, ore, clay brick, and stone).\n# Grey cards (manufactured goods) provide one of the three manufactured goods used in the game (glass, papyrus, and textiles).\n# Purple cards (guilds) generally grant victory points based on the structures a player and/or his neighbors have built.\n\nBrown and grey cards only appear in the Age I and II decks; purple cards only appear in the Age III deck.\n\nAt the end of each age, military conflicts are resolved between neighbors. This is done by comparing the number of shield symbols on the players' red cards, and awarding victory points accordingly. Once all three decks have been played, players tally their scores in all the different developed areas (civil, scientific, commercial, etc.). The player with the most victory points wins.\n\nIn the base game, there are seven means of obtaining victory points:<ref>Bauza, Antoine. ''7 Wonders Rulebook and Scorecard''. Repos Production, 2010, p. 6.</ref>\n# Military victories \u2013 One point for each victory (having the most shields) during the first age, 3 for the second age, and 5 for the third age. Each defeat makes a player lose 1 victory point regardless of the age.\n# Gold coins \u2013 One point for every 3 coins a player possesses at the end of the game.\n# Wonder stages \u2013 Many of the wonder stages grant a fixed number of victory points.\n# Civic structures (blue cards) \u2013 Each structure grants a fixed number of victory points.\n# Commercial structures (yellow cards) \u2013 Age III commercial structures grant victory points based on certain structures a player has built.\n# Guilds (purple cards) \u2013 The guilds provide several means of gaining victory points, most of which are based on the types of structure a player and/or his/her neighbors have built.\n# Scientific structures (green cards) \u2013 Each green card has a symbol on it \u2013 tablet, compass, or gear. One card of a type grants one victory point, but two cards grant four; the number of points granted is equal to the number of symbols possessed squared. Additionally, each set of tablet, compass, and gear possessed is worth 7 points.\n\n==Expansions==\n\n===''7 Wonders: Leaders'' (2011)===\nThis expansion introduces the white-backed leader cards, which can be recruited to aid a player's city. The 36 leader cards are based on real historical figures, some of which are well-known, such as [[Caesar]] and [[Midas]], others less so. There is a brief biography of each leader in the rulebook.\n\nPlaying with the Leaders expansion changes the game mechanic, as the second thing done in the game after choosing a Wonder board is to choose leaders. Four leader cards are dealt to each player, and the cards are drafted. At the start of each Age, players may recruit one leader, paying its coin cost and putting it into play. To compensate for this extra expense, with the Leaders expansion, players start with six coins instead of three. As with the Age cards, instead of recruiting a leader, a player may choose to discard the card to gain three coins or build a Wonder stage with it.\n\nThe leaders grant various abilities, including additional means of gaining victory points, resources, or coins, resource cost reductions, commerce benefits, additional shields, and scientific symbols. For example, the \"Caesar\" card grants two shields and \"Midas\" grants one extra victory point per three coins held at the end of the game.\n\nThe expansion comes with four additional guild cards and one extra Wonder board \u2013 the [[Colosseum]] of [[Rome]], which, appropriately enough, grants abilities related to the new leader cards.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Cities'' (August 2012)===\nThe ''Cities'' expansion introduces nine city cards (with a black background) to each of the Age card decks. The number of city cards that are shuffled into each age's deck is equal to the number of players. This means that each age now consists of seven play of cards.\n\nThe city cards can have quite an impact on gameplay, as many of them are more powerful but expensive versions of existing cards; for example, the Age III \"Contingent\" card provides five shields as opposed to the three provided by Age III red cards. The cards also introduce some new concepts such as diplomacy, which allows a player to avoid military conflict for one Age, and monetary loss, which forces the player's opponents to either pay coins to the bank or lose victory points if they cannot or will not pay.\n\nThe addition of city cards takes the total number of cards playable in each age to 56. This means that eight-player games \u2013 or team games with four teams of two \u2013 are possible. In the team game, partners are allowed to see each other's cards and discuss which ones to play, and the effect of diplomacy is modified.\n\nThe Cities expansion also contains three new guild cards, six leader cards and two Wonder boards: the [[Hagia Sophia]] of [[Byzantium]] and [[Al Khazneh]] of [[Petra]]. Many of these new additions have abilities specific to city cards or to the new concepts introduced.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Wonder Pack'' (May 2013)===\nThis expansion adds four Wonder boards: [[Abu Simbel]], the [[Great Wall of China]], [[Stonehenge]], and the [[Manneken Pis]] of [[Brussels]] (the makers' home town). All four offer new abilities.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Babel'' (December 2014)===\n''Babel'' consists of two expansions that can be added separately or together. The first expansion is ''[[Tower of Babel]]'', in which players can choose to construct the tower. By discarding a card, players can place a tile on the tower that affects play (for example, taxing the construction of Wonders or granting a monetary bonus for building certain cards) until it is covered by a subsequent tile. Players score points for the number of tiles they play. The second expansion is ''Great Projects of Babel''. A building of a certain color is put into play. Whenever a player plays a card of the same color, they may choose to pay a cost to participate in the building of the Great Project. If the project succeeds, all players who participated get a reward, and non-participants get nothing. If the project fails, participants get nothing and non-participants receive a penalty.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Leaders Anniversary Pack'' & ''Cities Anniversary Pack'' (2017)===\nThese expansions add new Leaders cards and new Cities cards, with new effects.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Armada'' (October 2018)===\n''Armada'' adds a naval board for each player and four ships: red, blue, yellow, and green. When playing a card of one of these colors, players may pay an additional cost to advance the corresponding ship along the board. Advancing each ship grants different bonuses: the red ship grants naval strength, which is compared to all players at the end of the Age, not just neighbors; the yellow ship grants money; the blue ship grants victory points; and the green ship allows players to discover islands, which grant extra bonuses.\n\n===Promotional wonders===\n* [[Manneken Pis]] (Released at [[SPIEL]] in October 2010 and later included in the Wonder Pack)<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.spiele-check.de/10806-7_Wonders_Manneken_Pis.html\n| title      = 7 Wonders: Manneken Pis\n| accessdate = 24 September 2012\n}}</ref>\n* [[The Settlers of Catan|Catan]] (Released at [[SPIEL]] in October 2011)<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.boardgame.de/specials/messe/essen11/essen11.htm\n| title      = Kulkmann's G@mebox \u2013 SPIEL 2011 at Essen / Germany\n| accessdate =24 September 2012\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.spiele-check.de/12735-7_Wonders_Catan_Island.html\n| title      = 7 Wonders: Catan Island\n| accessdate =24 September 2012\n}}</ref>\n* [[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]] (Released at [[SPIEL]] in October 2018;

Each defeat makes a player lose 1 victory point regardless of the age. \n# Gold coins \u2013 One point for every 3 coins a player possesses at the end of the game.\n# Wonder stages \u2013 Many of the wonder stages grant a fixed number of victory points.\n# Civic structures (blue cards) \u2013 Each structure grants a fixed number of victory points.\n# Commercial Structures (yellow cards) \u2013 Age III commercial structures grant victory points based on certain structures a player has built.\n# Guilds (purple cards) \u2013 The guilds provide several means of gaining victory points, most of which are based on the types of structure a player and/or his neighbors have built.\n# Scientific structures (green cards) \u2013 Each green card has a symbol on it \u2013 tablet, compass or gear. One card of a type grants one victory point, but two cards grant four; the number of points granted is equal to the number of symbols possessed squared. Additionally, each set of tablet, compass and gear possessed is worth 7 points.\n\n==Expansions==\n\n===''7 Wonders: Leaders'' (2011)===\nThis expansion introduces the white-backed leader cards, which can be recruited to aid a player's city. The 36 leader cards are based on real historical figures, some of which are well-known, such as [[Caesar]] and [[Midas]], others less so. There is a brief biography of each leader in the rulebook.\n\nPlaying with the Leaders expansion changes the game mechanic, as the second thing done in the game after choosing a Wonder board is to choose leaders. Four leader cards are dealt to each player, and the cards are drafted. At the start of each Age, players may recruit one leader, paying its coin cost and putting it into play. To compensate for this extra expense, with the Leaders expansion, players start with six coins instead of three. As with the Age cards, instead of recruiting a leader, a player may choose to discard the card to gain three coins or build a Wonder stage with it.\n\nThe leaders grant various abilities, including additional means of gaining victory points, resources or coins, resource cost reductions, commerce benefits, additional shields and scientific symbols. For example, the 'Caesar' card grants two shields and 'Midas' grants one extra victory point per three coins held at the end of the game.\n\nThe expansion comes with four additional guild cards and one extra Wonder board \u2013 the [[Colosseum]] of [[Rome]], which, appropriately enough, grants abilities related to the new leader cards.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Cities'' (August 2012)===\nThe ''Cities'' expansion introduces nine city cards (with a black background) to each of the Age card decks. The number of city cards that are shuffled into each age's deck is equal to the number of players. This means that each age now consists of seven play of cards.\n\nThe city cards can have quite an impact on gameplay, as many of them are more powerful but expensive versions of existing cards; for example, the Age III 'Contingent' card provides five shields as opposed to the three provided by Age III red cards. The cards also introduce some new concepts such as diplomacy, which allows a player to avoid military conflict for one Age, and monetary loss, which forces the player's opponents to either pay coins to the bank or lose victory points if they cannot or will not pay.\n\nThe addition of city cards takes the total number of cards playable in each age to 56. This means that eight-player games \u2013 or team games with four teams of two \u2013 are possible. In the team game, partners are allowed to see each other's cards and discuss which ones to play, and the effect of diplomacy is modified.\n\nThe Cities expansion also contains three new guild cards, six leader cards and two Wonder boards: the [[Hagia Sophia]] of [[Byzantium]] and [[Al Khazneh]] of [[Petra]]. Many of these new additions have abilities specific to city cards or to the new concepts introduced.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Wonder Pack'' (May 2013)===\nThis expansion adds four Wonder boards: [[Abu Simbel]], the [[Great Wall of China]], [[Stonehenge]] and the [[Manneken Pis]] of [[Brussels]] (the makers' home town.) All four offer new abilities.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Babel'' (December 2014)===\n''Babel'' consists of two expansions that can be added separately or together. The first expansion is ''[[Tower of Babel]]'', in which players can choose to construct the tower. By discarding a card, players can place a tile on the tower that affects play (for example, taxing the construction of Wonders or granting a monetary bonus for building certain cards) until it is covered by a subsequent tile. Players score points for the number of tiles they play. The second expansion is ''Great Projects of Babel''. A building of a certain color is put into play. Whenever a player plays a card of the same color, they may choose to pay a cost to participate in the building of the Great Project. If the project succeeds, all players who participated get a reward, and non-participants get nothing. If the project fails, participants get nothing and non-participants receive a penalty.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Leaders Anniversary Pack'' & ''Cities Anniversary Pack'' (2017)===\nThese expansions add new Leaders cards and new Cities cards, with new effects.\n\n===''7 Wonders: Armada'' (October 2018)===\n''Armada'' adds a naval board for each player, and four ships: red, blue, yellow, and green. When playing a card of one of these colors, players may pay an additional cost to advance the corresponding ship along the board. Advancing each ship grants different bonuses: the red ship grants naval strength, which is compared to all players at the end of the Age, not just neighbors; the yellow ship grants money; the blue ship grants victory points; and the green ship allows players to discover islands, which grant extra bonuses.\n\n===Promotional wonders===\n* [[Manneken Pis]] (Released at [[SPIEL]] in October 2010 and later included in the Wonder Pack)<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.spiele-check.de/10806-7_Wonders_Manneken_Pis.html\n| title      = 7 Wonders: Manneken Pis\n| accessdate = 24 September 2012\n}}</ref>\n* [[The Settlers of Catan|Catan]] (Released at [[SPIEL]] in October 2011)<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.boardgame.de/specials/messe/essen11/essen11.htm\n| title      = Kulkmann's G@mebox \u2013 SPIEL 2011 at Essen / Germany\n| accessdate =24 September 2012\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.spiele-check.de/12735-7_Wonders_Catan_Island.html\n| title      = 7 Wonders: Catan Island\n| accessdate =24 September 2012\n}}</ref>\n* [[Syracuse, Sicily|Siracusa]] (Released at [[SPIEL]] in October 2018;
