Schleidt grew up in Vienna, Austria and \u2013 age 17 \u2013 was drafted into the German Army in 1944, hat his left hand crippled in an encounter with a soviet tank and \u2013 while recuperating in the Army hospital in Memmingen \u2013 survive the air raid of the US Air Force with a permanent hearing loss of 60 DB at 4&nbsp;kHz. The crippled hand disqualified him for medical school (his preferred academic institution), and he decided to study biology and anthropology, with special emphasis on sensory and behavioral physiology.<ref name=\"Sch\u00f6nberger2015\" />\n\nHis hearing loss around 4&nbsp;kHz increased his awareness of vocalizations of mice in the range between 10 and 20&nbsp;kHz. At that time, the technology for electronic sound recording and loudspeakers was limited to the range between 100&nbsp;Hz and 8&nbsp;kHz and, in order to provide a convincing proof of the use of ultrasound, Schleidt started to develop and build his own electronic gadgets and thus became a pioneer of bioacoustics and animal communication.<ref name=\"Schleidt1948\" /><ref>Schleidt, W.

Woodland Natives inhabited the area circa 1000 BCE &ndash; 1000 CE, followed by [[Iroquois]] and [[Mississaugas]] circa 1740 CE. Two of the more prominent sites surviving from this time are the [[petroglyph]]s at [[Petroglyphs Provincial Park]] and [[Serpent Mounds Park|Serpent Mounds]]. The petroglyphs are located northeast of Peterborough and are believed to have been carved by the [[Algonquin people]] between 900 and 1400 CE. The Serpent Mounds are located near [[Keene, Ontario|Keene]], approximately 30&nbsp;km southeast of Peterborough in [[Otonabee-South Monaghan, Ontario|Otonabee-South Monaghan]] township, in an area first inhabited sometime before 10 CE.<ref name=\"mounds\">{{cite web\n |title      = Serpent Mounds National Historic Site of Canada\n |work       = Parks Canada Directory of Federal Heritage Designations\n |publisher  = [[Government of Canada]]\n |date       = \n |url        = https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=511\n |accessdate = March 19, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1615, [[Samuel de Champlain]] traveled through the area, coming down from [[Lake Chemong]] and portaging down a trail, which is approximated by present-day Chemong Road, to the [[Otonabee River]]<ref name=\"champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |title=Peterborough and the Kawarthas |publisher=[[Trent University]] |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211014631/http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref> and stayed for a brief time near the present-day site of [[Bridgenorth, Ontario|Bridgenorth]], just north of Peterborough.\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1818, Adam Scott settled on the west shore of the [[Otonabee River]]. The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219.

He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish. to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character. but as Robinson traveled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming. I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they traveled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here. One school and one bank agency were operating.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometers north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) traveled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was

Trent's academic focus is on environmental, cultural and science studies. The main '''Symons Campus''' of Trent, located in the city's far north end, is approximately 14.6 square kilometres, over half of which is a part of Trent's Nature Areas, an ecologically diverse wild-life [[nature reserve]].\n\nTrent University operates largely through its colleges: Champlain, Lady Eaton, [[Catharine Parr Traill]], Otonabee, [[Peter Gzowski]] and Julian Blackburn. Each college has its own residence halls, dining room and student government, except for Catharine Parr Traill (which consists only of part-time students and is located near downtown Peterborough) and Julian Blackburn (which is mostly administrative).\n\n====Fleming College====\n{{Main|Fleming College}}\nEstablished in 1967, Fleming College (formerly Sir Sandford Fleming College), is a multidisciplinary institution with two primary campuses within the city of Peterborough:\n\n'''Sutherland Campus''' is located on Brealey Drive in the city's west end, and has recently undergone a massive expansion. The new St. Joseph's at Fleming is the first long-term care facility to be built on a college or university campus. In 2005, the Peterborough Sport & Wellness Centre was constructed to accommodate the college's athletic needs.\n\nMcRae Campus was located in a renovated [[textile]] mill located on McDonnel Street near Monaghan Road. Formerly the School of Continuing Education and Skilled Trades, the campus closed in 2014 when the Kawartha Trades and Technology Centre opened on the Sutherland Campus.\n\nThe college also operates satellite campuses in nearby [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], [[Cobourg]] and [[Dysart et al, Ontario|Haliburton]].\n\n====Kawartha Lakes Bible College====\n{{Main|Kawartha Lakes Bible College}}\nKawartha Lakes Bible College (KLBC) is a small evangelical Bible college affiliated with the [[Brethren Movement|Plymouth Brethren]].

Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|title=Film crew jumps around the city|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2006|website=mykawartha.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211000337/http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|archive-date=11 February 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]]. This is due in part to Peterborough's central location in a valley. Peterborough is also home to a single television station, [[CHEX-DT]], which is the local [[Global Television Network|Global]] O&O; as well as [[TVCogeco]], a local cable television channel operated by [[Cogeco]] Cable. Peterborough has two main newspapers, the ''[[Peterborough Examiner]]'', which publishes six days a week except Sunday; and ''[[Peterborough This Week]]'', which publishes every Wednesday and Friday.

Woodland Natives inhabited the area circa 1000 BCE &ndash; 1000 CE, followed by [[Iroquois]] and [[Mississaugas]] circa 1740 CE. Two of the more prominent sites surviving from this time are the [[petroglyph]]s at [[Petroglyphs Provincial Park]] and [[Serpent Mounds Park|Serpent Mounds]]. The petroglyphs are located northeast of Peterborough and are believed to have been carved by the [[Algonquin people]] between 900 and 1400 CE. The Serpent Mounds are located near [[Keene, Ontario|Keene]], approximately 30&nbsp;km southeast of Peterborough in [[Otonabee-South Monaghan, Ontario|Otonabee-South Monaghan]] township, in an area first inhabited sometime before 10 CE.<ref name=\"mounds\">{{cite web\n |title      = Serpent Mounds National Historic Site of Canada\n |work       = Parks Canada Directory of Federal Heritage Designations\n |publisher  = [[Government of Canada]]\n |date       = \n |url        = https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=511\n |accessdate = March 19, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1615, [[Samuel de Champlain]] travelled through the area, coming down from [[Lake Chemong]] and portaging down a trail, which is approximated by present-day Chemong Road, to the [[Otonabee River]]<ref name=\"champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |title=Peterborough and the Kawarthas |publisher=[[Trent University]] |date=September 26, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211014631/http://www.trentu.ca/academic/geography/PATKch7p101.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 }}</ref> and stayed for a brief time near the present-day site of [[Bridgenorth, Ontario|Bridgenorth]], just north of Peterborough.\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1818, Adam Scott settled on the west shore of the [[Otonabee River]]. The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219. Print</ref>\n\nRobinson was urged by landlords to remove the \"pauper and undesirables\". He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish. to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character. but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming. I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here. One school and one bank agency were operating.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was

Peterborough's crime severity index of 54.4 is a 14% reduction compared to the 2012 rate. Only Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, Barrie and Guelph had lower crime severity indexes, according to the survey. None of the census metropolitan areas had increases in crime severity in 2013. The crime severity index is calculated by Statistics Canada and takes into account both the volume and severity, based on average sentences for offenders, of police-reported crime in Canada. Nationally the CSI was down 9% in 2013 compared to 2012 and is 36% lower than 10 years ago.\n\nIn 2011, Peterborough had the highest rate of hate crimes reported in Canadian cities.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wedley |first1=Brendan |title=Peterborough had highest rate of reported hate crimes among cities in Canada in 2011: Statistics Canada |url=https://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/news-story/8201604-peterborough-had-highest-rate-of-reported-hate-crimes-among-cities-in-canada-in-2011-statistics-canada/ |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=Peterborough Examiner |publisher=Metroland Media Group Ltd. |date=July 12, 2013}}</ref> However, in recent years Peterborough has been found to have a relatively low crime rate.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In November 2015, Peterborough gained nationwide notoriety after an arson took place at the Masjid Al-Salaam mosque.

Provincial [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]], part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], connects to [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]] heading west and eventually to [[Ottawa]] heading east. Other [[Provincial highways in Ontario|Provincial Highways]] important to Peterborough are [[Ontario Highway 7A|Highway 7A]], which junctions onto Highway 115 just southwest of the city, and [[Ontario Highway 28|Highway 28]], which routes from Highway 7 just east of the city to Lakefield and on further north.\n\nThe area is also served by numerous [[County roads in Ontario#Peterborough|county roads]].\n\nThere are four road bridges that cross the Otonabee River within the city limits of Peterborough. The most northerly one is the Nassau Mills Road Bridge near Trent University. The next most northerly bridge is the Parkhill Road Bridge. The Hunter Street Bridge crosses the river just north of Little Lake, linking East City with the downtown core. The most southerly bridge is the Lansdowne Street Bridge. In addition, Highway 115 crosses the river near the southern edge of the city. There are also numerous other bridges which cross the Trent Canal (notably the crossing at the lift lock which actually passes under the canal), Jackson Creek and the other minor creeks in the city. There are also numerous other river crossings throughout the CMA, the longest of which is the [[James A. Gifford Causeway]], which crosses Chemong Lake linking Bridgenorth with Ennismore.\n\n[[Public transit]] in the city of Peterborough is currently run by [[Peterborough Transit]], providing a total of 12 regular and 5 express routes throughout the city. Peterborough Transit's hub is a central terminal located on Simcoe Street in the city's downtown core. It also serves as the regional terminus for [[Coach Canada]] (formerly Trentway Wagar) routes into the city. [[Greyhound Lines of Canada]] operates an inter-city terminal nearby at the corner of Simcoe and Aylmer Streets, with several daily commuter buses to and from [[Toronto]]. [[GO Transit]] established a bus service from Peterborough to Oshawa starting September 5, 2009.\n\n===Railways{{anchor|Peterborough, Ontario railway station}}===\n{{Infobox station\n| name                = Peterborough\n| style               =\n| image               = Former Canadian Pacific Railway Station, Peterborough.jpg\n| caption             = Heritage railway station building\n| address             = 175, George Street North \n| borough             = Peterborough, Ontario\n| country             = [[Canada]]\n| coordinates         = {{Coord|44|17|56|N|78|19|12|W|region:CA-ON_type:railwaystation|display=inline}}\n| owned               = \n| operator            = \n| line                = [[Kawartha Lakes Railway|Havelock Subdivision]]\n| distance            = \n| platforms           = \n| tracks              = \n| train_operators     = \n| connections         = \n| structure           =\n| parking             = \n| bicycle             = \n| disabled            = \n| architect           = Thomas Charles Sorby\n| architectural_style =\n| status              =\n| code                = \n| zone                = \n| website             = \n| opened              = {{Start date|1884|10|29}}\n| opening             =\n| closed              = {{End date|1990|01|01}}\n| rebuilt             =\n| former              =\n| original            =\n| services            = <!-- Only use S-rail/S-line Templates, without start or end -->\n| embedded            = {{Designation list|embed=yes | designation1= HRSC | designation1_offname=Peterborough CPR Station | designation1_date= 2006 | designation1_number = [http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=4400 4400]}}\n}}\nPeterborough is served by [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].

Trent's academic focus is on environmental, cultural and science studies. The main '''Symons Campus''' of Trent, located in the city's far north end, is approximately 14.6 square kilometres, over half of which is a part of Trent's Nature Areas, an ecologically diverse wild-life [[nature reserve]].\n\nTrent University operates largely through its colleges: Champlain, Lady Eaton, [[Catharine Parr Traill]], Otonabee, [[Peter Gzowski]] and Julian Blackburn. Each college has its own residence halls, dining room and student government, except for Catharine Parr Traill (which consists only of part-time students and is located near downtown Peterborough) and Julian Blackburn (which is mostly administrative).\n\n====Fleming College====\n{{Main|Fleming College}}\nEstablished in 1967, Fleming College (formerly Sir Sandford Fleming College), is a multidisciplinary institution with two primary campuses within the city of Peterborough:\n\n'''Sutherland Campus''' is located on Brealey Drive in the city's west end, and has recently undergone a massive expansion.

Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web|url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|title=Film crew jumps around the city|last=|first=|date=September 5, 2006|website=mykawartha.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211000337/http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128|archive-date=11 February 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]].

It was among the most powerful states in Europe and a [[great power]] since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. It was also an early [[French colonial empire|colonial power]], with possessions around the world.\n\nFrance originated as [[West Francia]] (''Francia Occidentalis''), the western half of the [[Carolingian Empire]], with the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843). A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987, when [[Hugh Capet]] was elected king and founded the [[Capetian dynasty]]. The territory remained known as ''Francia'' and its ruler as ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\") well into the [[High Middle Ages]]. The first king calling himself ''Roi de France'' (\"King of France\") was [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], in 1190. France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines\u2014the [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]\u2014until the monarchy was abolished in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]].\n\n[[France in the Middle Ages]] was a de-centralised, [[Feudalism|feudal]] monarchy. In [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] (now a part of Spain) the authority of the French king was barely felt. [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Provence]] were states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and not yet a part of France. Initially, West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates, but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture, which became codified in the [[Salic law]]. During the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Kings of England]] laid claim to the French throne, resulting in a series of conflicts known as the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453). Emerging victorious from said conflicts, France subsequently sought to extend its influence into Italy, but was defeated by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in the ensuing [[Italian Wars]] (1494\u20131559).\n\n[[Early modern France|France in the early modern era]] was increasingly centralised; the [[French language]] began to displace other languages from official use, and the monarch expanded his [[Absolute monarchy|absolute power]], albeit in an administrative system (the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'') complicated by historic and regional irregularities in taxation, legal, judicial, and ecclesiastic divisions, and local prerogatives. Religiously France became divided between the Catholic majority and a Protestant minority, the [[Huguenots]], which led to a series of civil wars, the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] (1562\u20131598). The Wars of Religion crippled France but triumph over [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the Thirty Years' War made France the most powerful nation on the continent once more as the kingdom became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under the [[Louis XIV|Sun King]].<ref>{{cite book |author=R.R.

Wars with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led to the loss of much of its [[New France|North American holdings]] by 1763. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolutionary War]] helped secure the independence of  the new United States of America but was costly and achieved little for France.\n\nThe Kingdom of France [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|adopted a written constitution]] in 1791, but the Kingdom was abolished a year later and replaced with the [[First French Republic]]. The [[Bourbon Restoration|monarchy was restored]] by the other great powers in 1814 and lasted (except for the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815) until the [[French Revolution of 1848]].\n\n==Political history==\n===West Francia===\n{{Main article|West Francia}}\n{{Further information|Carolingian Empire}}\n\nDuring the later years of the elderly [[Charlemagne]]'s rule, the [[Viking]]s made advances along the northern and western perimeters of the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. After Charlemagne's death in 814 his heirs were incapable of maintaining political unity and the empire began to crumble. The [[Treaty of Verdun]] of 843 divided the Carolingian Empire into three parts, with  [[Charles the Bald]] ruling over [[West Francia]], the nucleus of what would develop into the kingdom of France.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roger Price|title=A Concise History of France |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AYjB2-RnWUwC&pg=PA30 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=30 |isbn = 9780521844802 }}</ref>\nCharles the Bald was also crowned [[kingdom of Lotharingia|King of Lotharingia]] after the death of [[Lothair II]] in 869, but in the  [[Treaty of Meerssen]] (870) was forced to cede much of Lotharingia to his brothers, retaining the [[Rhone]] and [[Meuse]] basins (including [[Verdun]], [[Vienne]] and [[Besan\u00e7on]]) but leaving the [[Rhineland]] with [[Aachen]], [[Metz]] and [[Trier]] in [[East Francia]].\n\nViking advances were allowed to increase, and their dreaded [[longship]]s were sailing up the [[Loire]] and [[Seine]] rivers and other inland waterways, wreaking havoc and spreading terror. During the reign of [[Charles the Simple]] (898\u2013922), Normans under [[Rollo]] from [[Norway]], were settled in an area on either side of the River Seine, downstream from Paris, that was to become [[Normandy]].<ref>Jim Bradbury.

With its offshoots, the houses of [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], it was to rule France for more than 800 years.<ref>{{cite book|author=William W.

After defeating a [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174|revolt]] led by Eleanor and three of their four sons, Henry had Eleanor imprisoned, made the [[List of rulers of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] his vassal, and in effect ruled the western half of France as a greater power than the French throne. However, disputes among Henry's descendants over the division of his French territories, coupled with [[John of England]]'s lengthy quarrel with Philip II, allowed [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] to recover influence over most of this territory. After the French victory at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, the English monarchs maintained power only in southwestern Duchy of [[Guyenne]].<ref>Peter Shervey Lewis, ''Later medieval France: the polity'' (1968).</ref>\n\n===Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years' War===\n{{Main article|France in the Middle Ages|Hundred Years' War}}\n\nThe death of [[Charles IV of France]] in 1328 without male heirs ended the main Capetian line. Under [[Salic law]] the crown could not pass through a woman (Philip IV's daughter was Isabella, whose son was [[Edward III of England]]), so the throne passed to [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], son of [[Charles of Valois]]. This, in addition to a long-standing dispute over the rights to Gascony in the south of France, and the relationship between England and the Flemish cloth towns, led to the [[Hundred Years' War]] of 1337\u20131453. The following century was to see devastating warfare, peasant revolts (the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]] and the ''[[Jacquerie]]'' of 1358 in France) and the growth of nationalism in both countries.<ref>Alice Minerva Atkinson, ''A Brief History of the Hundred Years' War'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe losses of the century of war were enormous, particularly owing to the plague (the [[Black Death]], usually considered an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]]), which arrived from Italy in 1348, spreading rapidly up the Rhone valley and thence across most of the country: it is estimated that a population of some 18\u201320 million in modern-day France at the time of the 1328 [[hearth tax]] returns had been reduced 150 years later by 50 percent or more.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph P.

The prevailing style was [[classicism|classical]].<ref>Philip John Yarrow, ''A literary history of France: Renaissance France 1470\u20131589'' (1974)</ref><ref>Henri Zerner, ''Renaissance art in France: the invention of classicism'' (Flammarion, 2003)</ref>\n\nThe [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]] was signed into law by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1539.\nLargely the work of Chancellor [[Guillaume Poyet]], it  dealt with a number of government, judicial and ecclesiastical matters. Articles 110 and 111, the most famous, called for the use of the [[French language]] in all legal acts, notarised contracts and official legislation.\n\n====Italian Wars====\n{{Main article|Italian Wars}}\nAfter the Hundred Years' War, [[Charles VIII of France]] signed three additional treaties with [[Henry VII of England]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of Habsburg]], and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] respectively at [[Peace of Etaples|\u00c9taples]] (1492), [[Treaty of Senlis|Senlis]] (1493) and in [[Treaty of Barcelona|Barcelona]] (1493). These three treaties cleared the way for France to undertake the long [[Italian Wars]] (1494\u20131559), which marked the beginning of early modern France. French efforts to gain dominance resulted only in the increased power of the [[Habsburg]] house.\n\n====Wars of Religion====\n{{Main article|French Wars of Religion}}\n\nBarely were the Italian Wars over, when France was plunged into a domestic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Despite the conclusion of [[Concordat of Bologna|a Concordat]] between France and the Papacy (1516), granting the crown unrivalled power in senior ecclesiastical appointments, France was deeply affected by the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s attempt to break the hegemony of Catholic Europe. A growing urban-based Protestant minority (later dubbed ''[[Huguenots]]'') faced ever harsher repression under the rule of Francis I's son [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]]. After Henry II's death in a joust, the country was ruled by his widow [[Catherine de' Medici]] and her sons [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] and [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. Renewed Catholic reaction headed by the powerful dukes of [[Guise]] culminated in a massacre of Huguenots (1562), starting the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]], during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces. Opposed to absolute monarchy, the Huguenot [[Monarchomachs]] theorized during this time the [[right of rebellion]] and the legitimacy of [[tyrannicide]].<ref>Mack P. Holt, ''The French wars of religion, 1562\u20131629'' (2005).</ref>\n\nThe Wars of Religion culminated in the [[War of the Three Henrys (1584-1598)|War of the Three Henrys]] in which [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] assassinated [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry de Guise]], leader of the Spanish-backed [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic league]], and the king was murdered in return. After the assassination of both Henry of Guise (1588) and Henry III (1589), the conflict was ended by the accession of the Protestant king of [[Navarre]] as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (first king of the [[Bourbon dynasty]]) and his subsequent abandonment of Protestantism (Expedient of 1592) effective in 1593, his acceptance by most of the Catholic establishment (1594) and by the Pope (1595), and his issue of the toleration decree known as the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1598), which guaranteed freedom of private worship and civil equality.<ref>David Buisseret, ''Henry IV, King of France'' (1990).</ref>\n\n===Early Modern period===\n{{Main article|Early modern France}}\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg\n| image2 = Louis XIIIval grace.jpg\n| footer = [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (left), by [[Frans Pourbus the younger]] (1610), [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] (right), by [[Philippe de Champaigne]] (1647)\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n====Colonial France====\n{{Main article|New France}}\nFrance's pacification under [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] laid much of the ground for the beginnings of France's rise to European hegemony. France was expansive during all but the end of the seventeenth century: the French began trading in [[India]] and [[Madagascar]], founded [[Quebec City|Quebec]] and penetrated the North American [[Great Lakes]] and [[Mississippi]], established plantation economies in the [[West Indies]] and extended their trade contacts in the [[Levant]] and enlarged their [[merchant marine]].\n\n====Thirty Years' War====\nHenry IV's son [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and his minister (1624\u20131642) [[Cardinal Richelieu]], elaborated a policy against Spain and the Holy Roman Empire during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) which had broken out in Germany. After the death of both king and cardinal, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) secured universal acceptance of Germany's political and religious fragmentation, but the Regency of [[Anne of Austria]] and her minister [[Cardinal Mazarin]] experienced a civil uprising known as the [[Fronde]] (1648\u20131653) which expanded into a [[Fronde|Franco-Spanish War]] (1653\u201359). The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) formalised France's seizure (1642) of the Spanish territory of [[Roussillon]] after the crushing of the ephemeral [[Catalan Republic (1641)|Catalan Republic]] and ushered a short period of peace.<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years' War'' (2009).</ref>\n\n====Administrative structures====\n{{Main article|Ancien R\u00e9gime}}\n\nThe ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', a French term rendered in English as \"Old Rule\", or simply \"Former Regime\", refers primarily to the aristocratic, social and political system of early modern France under the [[Valois dynasty|late Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasties.  The administrative and social structures of the Ancien R\u00e9gime were the result of years of state-building, legislative acts (like the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]]), internal conflicts and civil wars, but they remained a confusing patchwork of local [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] and historic differences until the [[French Revolution]] brought about a radical suppression of administrative incoherence.\n\n====Louis XIV, the Sun King====\n{{Main article|Louis XIV of France}}\n\n[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], by [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], 1701]]\n\nFor most of the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1643\u20131715), (\"The Sun King\"), France was the dominant power in Europe, aided by the diplomacy of Cardinal Richelieu's successor as the King's chief minister, (1642\u201361) [[Cardinal Jules Mazarin]], (1602\u201361). Cardinal Mazarin oversaw the creation of a French Royal Navy that rivalled [[Royal Navy|England's]], expanding it from 25 ships to almost 200. The size of the Army was also considerably increased. Renewed wars (the [[War of Devolution]], 1667\u201368 and the [[Franco-Dutch War]], 1672\u201378) brought further territorial gains ([[Artois]] and western [[Flanders]] and the free [[county of Burgundy]], previously left to the Empire in 1482), but at the cost of the increasingly concerted opposition of rival royal powers, and a legacy of an increasingly enormous national debt. An adherent of the theory of the [[divine right of kings|\"Divine Right of Kings\"]], which advocates the divine origin of temporal power and any lack of earthly restraint of monarchical rule, Louis XIV continued his predecessors' work of creating a [[Centralized government|centralized state]] governed from the capital of Paris. He sought to eliminate the remnants of [[feudalism]] still persisting in parts of France and, by compelling the noble elite to regularly inhabit his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]], built on the outskirts of Paris, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the earlier \"[[Fronde]]\" rebellion during Louis' minority youth. By these means he consolidated a system of absolute monarchy in France that endured 150 years until the [[French Revolution]].<ref>William Beik, ''Louis XIV and Absolutism: A Brief Study with Documents'' (2000)</ref>  McCabe says critics used fiction to portray the degraded Turkish Court, using \"the harem, the Sultan court, oriental despotism, luxury, gems and spices, carpets, and silk cushions\" as an unfavorable analogy to the corruption of the French royal court.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism, and the Ancien R\u00e9gime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MmvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA134|year=2008|publisher=Berg|page=134|isbn=9781847884633}}</ref>\n\nThe king sought to impose total religious uniformity on the country, repealing the \"[[Edict of Nantes]]\" in 1685. The infamous practice of \"[[dragonnades]]\" was adopted, whereby intentionally rough soldiers were quartered in the homes of Protestant families and allowed to have their way with them \u2014 stealing, raping, torturing and killing adults and infants in their hovels. It is estimated that anywhere between 150,000 and 300,000 Protestants fled France during the wave of persecution that followed the repeal,<ref>[https://www.letemps.ch/monde/rome-protestante-face-aux-exiles-foi La Rome protestante face aux exil\u00e9s de la foi]</ref><ref>[http://books.openedition.org/pur/5650  Le Refuge protestant urbain au temps de la r\u00e9vocation de l\u2019\u00c9dit de Nantes]</ref> (following \"[[Huguenots]]\" beginning a hundred and fifty years earlier until the end of the 18th century) costing the country a great many intellectuals, artisans, and other valuable people. Persecution extended to unorthodox Roman Catholics like the [[Jansenists]], a group that denied free will and had already been condemned by the popes. Louis was no theologian and understood little of the complex doctrines of Jansenism, satisfying himself with the fact that they threatened the unity of the state. In this, he garnered the friendship of the papacy, which had previously been hostile to France because of its policy of putting all church property in the country under the jurisdiction of the state rather than that of Rome.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''Louis XIV'' (1974)</ref>\n\nIn November 1700, the Spanish king [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] died, ending the Habsburg line in that country. Louis had long waited for this moment, and now planned to put a Bourbon relative, [[Philip, Duke of Anjou]], (1683\u20131746), on the throne. Essentially, [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] was to become a perpetual ally and even obedient satellite of France, ruled by a king who would carry out orders from Versailles. Realizing how this would upset the balance of power, the other European rulers were outraged. However, most of the alternatives were equally undesirable. For example, putting another Habsburg on the throne would end up recreating the grand multi-national empire of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500\u201358), of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (German First Reich), [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]] which would also grossly upset the power balance. After nine years of exhausting war, the last thing Louis wanted was another conflict. However, the rest of Europe would not stand for his ambitions in Spain, and so the long [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began (1701\u201314), a mere three years after the [[War of the Grand Alliance]], (1688\u201397, aka \"War of the League of Augsburg\") had just concluded.<ref>Daniel Roche, France in the Enlightenment (1998)</ref>\n\n====Dissent and revolution====\n{{main article|French Revolution}}\n[[File:France anciennes provinces 1789.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Provinces in 1789]]\n\nThe reign (1715\u201374) of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] saw an initial return to peace and prosperity under the regency (1715\u201323) of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], whose policies were largely continued (1726\u20131743) by [[Cardinal Fleury]], prime minister in all but name. The exhaustion of Europe after two major wars resulted in a long period of peace, only interrupted by minor conflicts like the [[War of the Polish Succession]] from 1733\u201335. Large-scale warfare resumed with the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u201348). But alliance with the traditional Habsburg enemy (the \"[[Diplomatic Revolution]]\" of 1756) against the rising power of Britain and [[Prussia]] led to costly failure in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u201363) and the loss of France's North American colonies.<ref>Colin Jones, ''The Great Nation: France from Louis XV to Napoleon'' (2003)</ref>\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|image1=Louis XV by Maurice-Quentin de La Tour.jpg\n|image2=Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Callet - Louis XVI, roi de France et de Navarre (1754-1793), rev\u00eatu du grand costume royal en 1779 - Google Art Project.jpg\n|footer=[[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] (left), by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] (1748); [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (right), by [[Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Callet]] (1775)\n}}\nOn the whole, the 18th century saw growing discontent with the monarchy and the established order. Louis XV was a highly unpopular king for his sexual excesses, overall weakness, and for losing Canada to the British. A strong ruler like Louis XIV could enhance the position of the monarchy, while Louis XV weakened it. The writings of the [[philosophes]] such as [[Voltaire]] were a clear sign of discontent, but the king chose to ignore them. He died of [[smallpox]] in 1774, and the French people shed few tears at his passing. While France had not yet experienced the [[Industrial Revolution]] that was beginning in Britain, the rising middle class of the cities felt increasingly frustrated with a system and rulers that seemed silly, frivolous, aloof, and antiquated, even if true feudalism no longer existed in France.\n\nUpon Louis XV's death, his grandson [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] became king. Initially popular, he too came to be widely detested by the 1780s. He was married to an Austrian archduchess, [[Marie Antoinette]]. French intervention in the American War of Independence was also very expensive.<ref>William Doyle, ''The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction'' (2001)</ref>\n\nWith the country deeply in debt, Louis XVI permitted the radical reforms of [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Guillaume-Chr\u00e9tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], but noble disaffection led to Turgot's dismissal and Malesherbes' resignation in 1776. They were replaced by [[Jacques Necker]]. Necker had resigned in 1781 to be replaced by [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Calonne]] and [[\u00c9tienne Charles de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne|Brienne]], before being restored in 1788. A harsh winter that year led to widespread food shortages, and by then France was a powder keg ready to explode.<ref>Sylvia Neely, ''A Concise History of the French Revolution '' (2008)</ref>\nOn the eve of the [[French Revolution]] of July 1789, France was in a profound institutional and financial crisis, but the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had begun to permeate the educated classes of society.<ref>Daniel Roche, ''France in the Enlightenment'' (1998)</ref>\n\n=== Limited monarchy ===\nOn September 3, 1791, the absolute monarchy which had governed France for 948 years was forced to limit its power and become a provisional constitutional monarchy. However, this too would not last very long and on September 21, 1792 the French monarchy was effectively abolished by the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. The role of the King in France was finally ended with the execution of [[Louis XVI]] by [[guillotine]] on Monday, January 21, 1793, followed by the \"[[Reign of Terror]]\", mass executions and the provisional \"[[French Directory|Directory]]\" form of [[French First Republic|republican government]], and the eventual beginnings of twenty-five years of reform, upheaval, dictatorship, wars and renewal, with the various [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\n===Restoration===\n{{Main article|Bourbon Restoration}}\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|image1=G\u00e9rard - Louis XVIII of France in Coronation Robes.jpg\n|image2=Carlos X de Francia (Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard).jpg\n|footer=The two kings of the Restoration: [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] (left) by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1820s), [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (right) by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1825)\n}}\n\nThe monarchy was briefly restored following the successive events of the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399), and the [[First French Empire|First French Empire under Napoleon]] (1804\u20131814/15)&nbsp;\u2013 when a [[War of the Sixth Coalition|coalition of European powers]] restored by arms the monarchy to the heirs of the [[House of Bourbon]] in 1814. However the deposed Emperor [[Napoleon I]] returned triumphantly to Paris from his exile in [[Elba]] and ruled France for a short period known as the [[Hundred Days]].\n\nWhen a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh European Coalition]] deposed Napoleon after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, the Bourbon monarchy was once again restored. \nThe [[Count of Provence]], brother of Louis XVI, who was guillotined in 1793, was crowned as [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], nicknamed \"The Desired\". Louis XVIII tried to conciliate the legacies of the Revolution and Ancien R\u00e9gime both, also permitting the formation of a [[French Parliament|Parliament]] and [[Charter of 1814|constitutional Charter]], usually \"''Charte octroy\u00e9e''\" (\"Granted Charter\"). His reign was characterized by disagreements between the [[Doctrinaires]], liberal thinkers who supported the Charter and rising [[bourgeoisie]], and the [[Ultra-royalist]]s, aristocrats and clergymen who totally refused the Revolution's heritage. However, peace was maintained by statesmen like [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] and the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duke of Richelieu]], as well as the King's moderation and prudent intervention.<ref>Actes du congr\u00e8s \u2013 vol. 3, 1961, p.&nbsp;441.</ref><ref>Emmanuel de Waresquiel, 2003, pp.&nbsp;460\u2013461.</ref> In 1823, the liberal agitations in Spain led to a [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|French intervention]] on the royalist's side, who permitted to King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] to reject the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution]]. {{clarify|it's not clear if someone has been messing with the text, but at present the last two sentences are a bit incomprehensible|date=May 2018}}\n\nHowever, the work of Louis XVIII was frustrated when, after his death in 16 September 1824, his brother the [[Count of Artois]] became King under the name of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]. Charles X was a strong [[reactionary]] who supported ultra-royalists and [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]]. Under his reign, the censorship of newspapers was reinforced, the [[Anti-Sacrilege Act]] passed and compensations to [[French emigration (1789\u20131815)|French \u00c9migr\u00e9]] were increased. However, there were also the intervention in the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] and the first phase of the [[French conquest of Algeria|conquest of Algeria]].\n\nThe absolutist tendencies of the King were disliked by Doctrinaire majority in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]], that in 18 March 1830 [[Address of the 221|sent and cordial address]] to the King, remembering to him his vote on the Charter.

The opposition of the King was composed of [[Legitimists]], supporting the [[Henri, Count of Chambord|Count of Chambord]], Bourbon claimant to the Throne, and of [[Bonapartist]]s and [[Republicanism in France|Republicans]] who fought against royalty and supported the principles of democracy.\nThe King tried to suppress the opposition with censorship, but when the ''[[Campagne des banquets]]'' (\"Banquets' Campaign\") was repressed in February 1848,<ref>La France au xixe si\u00e8cle, p. 211 and 2012</ref> riots and seditions erupted in Paris and later all France, resulting in the [[French Revolution of 1848|February Revolution]].

in the north there were Viking incursions leading to the formation of the [[Duchy of Normandy]]; in the west, the [[counts of Anjou]] established themselves as powerful rivals of the king, by the late 11th century ruling over the \"[[Angevin Empire]]\", which included the [[kingdom of England]]. \nIt was only with [[Philip II of France]] that the bulk of the territory of Western Francia came under the rule of the Frankish kings, and Philip was consequently the first king to call himself \"king of France\" (1190). \nThe division of France between the Angevin (Plantagenet) kings of England and the Capetian kings of France would lead to the [[Hundred Years' War]], and France would regain control over these territories only by the mid 15th century.\nWhat is now eastern France (Lorraine,

France|early modern]] monarchy in [[Western Europe]]. It was among the most powerful states in Europe and a [[great power]] since the [[Late Middle Ages]]. It was also an early [[French colonial empire|colonial power]], with possessions around the world.\n\nFrance originated as [[West Francia]] (''Francia Occidentalis''), the western half of the [[Carolingian Empire]], with the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843). A branch of the Carolingian dynasty continued to rule until 987, when [[Hugh Capet]] was elected king and founded the [[Capetian dynasty]]. The territory remained known as ''Francia'' and its ruler as ''rex Francorum'' (\"king of the Franks\") well into the [[High Middle Ages]]. The first king calling himself ''Roi de France'' (\"King of France\") was [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], in 1190. France continued to be ruled by the Capetians and their cadet lines\u2014the [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]\u2014until the monarchy was abolished in 1792 during the [[French Revolution]].\n\n[[France in the Middle Ages]] was a de-centralised, [[Feudalism|feudal]] monarchy. In [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] (now a part of Spain) the authority of the French king was barely felt. [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Provence]] were states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and not yet a part of France. Initially, West Frankish kings were elected by the secular and ecclesiastic magnates, but the regular coronation of the eldest son of the reigning king during his father's lifetime established the principle of male primogeniture, which became codified in the [[Salic law]]. During the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Kings of England]] laid claim to the French throne, resulting in a series of conflicts known as the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337\u20131453). Emerging victorious from said conflicts, France subsequently sought to extend its influence into Italy, but was defeated by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in the ensuing [[Italian Wars]] (1494\u20131559).\n\n[[Early modern France|France in the early modern era]] was increasingly centralised; the [[French language]] began to displace other languages from official use, and the monarch expanded his [[Absolute monarchy|absolute power]], albeit in an administrative system (the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'') complicated by historic and regional irregularities in taxation, legal, judicial, and ecclesiastic divisions, and local prerogatives. Religiously France became divided between the Catholic majority and a Protestant minority, the [[Huguenots]], which led to a series of civil wars, the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] (1562\u20131598). The Wars of Religion crippled France but triumph over [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the Thirty Years' War made France the most powerful nation on the continent once more as the kingdom became Europe's dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under the [[Louis XIV|Sun King]].<ref>{{cite book |author=R.R.

Wars with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led to the loss of much of its [[New France|North American holdings]] by 1763. [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolutionary War]] helped secure the independence of  the new United States of America but was costly and achieved little for France.\n\nThe Kingdom of France [[Kingdom of France (1791\u201392)|adopted a written constitution]] in 1791, but the Kingdom was abolished a year later and replaced with the [[First French Republic]]. The [[Bourbon Restoration|monarchy was restored]] by the other great powers in 1814 and lasted (except for the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815) until the [[French Revolution of 1848]].\n\n==Political history==\n===West Francia===\n{{Main article|West Francia}}\n{{Further information|Carolingian Empire}}\n\nDuring the later years of the elderly [[Charlemagne]]'s rule, the [[Viking]]s made advances along the northern and western perimeters of the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. After Charlemagne's death in 814 his heirs were incapable of maintaining political unity and the empire began to crumble. The [[Treaty of Verdun]] of 843 divided the Carolingian Empire into three parts, with  [[Charles the Bald]] ruling over [[West Francia]], the nucleus of what would develop into the kingdom of France.<ref>{{cite book |author=Roger Price|title=A Concise History of France |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AYjB2-RnWUwC&pg=PA30 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=30 |isbn = 9780521844802 }}</ref>\nCharles the Bald was also crowned [[kingdom of Lotharingia|King of Lotharingia]] after the death of [[Lothair II]] in 869, but in the  [[Treaty of Meerssen]] (870) was forced to cede much of Lotharingia to his brothers, retaining the [[Rhone]] and [[Meuse]] basins (including [[Verdun]], [[Vienne]] and [[Besan\u00e7on]]) but leaving the [[Rhineland]] with [[Aachen]], [[Metz]] and [[Trier]] in [[East Francia]].\n\nViking advances were allowed to increase, and their dreaded [[longship]]s were sailing up the [[Loire]] and [[Seine]] rivers and other inland waterways, wreaking havoc and spreading terror. During the reign of [[Charles the Simple]] (898\u2013922), Normans under [[Rollo]] from [[Norway]], were settled in an area on either side of the River Seine, downstream from Paris, that was to become [[Normandy]].<ref>Jim Bradbury.

With its offshoots, the houses of [[House of Valois|Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], it was to rule France for more than 800 years.<ref>{{cite book|author=William W.

After defeating a [[Revolt of 1173\u20131174|revolt]] led by Eleanor and three of their four sons, Henry had Eleanor imprisoned, made the [[List of rulers of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] his vassal, and in effect ruled the western half of France as a greater power than the French throne. However, disputes among Henry's descendants over the division of his French territories, coupled with [[John of England]]'s lengthy quarrel with Philip II, allowed [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] to recover influence over most of this territory. After the French victory at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, the English monarchs maintained power only in southwestern Duchy of [[Guyenne]].<ref>Peter Shervey Lewis, ''Later medieval France: the polity'' (1968).</ref>\n\n===Late Middle Ages and the Hundred Years' War===\n{{Main article|France in the Middle Ages|Hundred Years' War}}\n\nThe death of [[Charles IV of France]] in 1328 without male heirs ended the main Capetian line. Under [[Salic law]] the crown could not pass through a woman (Philip IV's daughter was Isabella, whose son was [[Edward III of England]]), so the throne passed to [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], son of [[Charles of Valois]]. This, in addition to a long-standing dispute over the rights to Gascony in the south of France, and the relationship between England and the Flemish cloth towns, led to the [[Hundred Years' War]] of 1337\u20131453. The following century was to see devastating warfare, peasant revolts (the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381]] and the ''[[Jacquerie]]'' of 1358 in France) and the growth of nationalism in both countries.<ref>Alice Minerva Atkinson, ''A Brief History of the Hundred Years' War'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe losses of the century of war were enormous, particularly owing to the plague (the [[Black Death]], usually considered an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]]), which arrived from Italy in 1348, spreading rapidly up the Rhone valley and thence across most of the country: it is estimated that a population of some 18\u201320 million in modern-day France at the time of the 1328 [[hearth tax]] returns had been reduced 150 years later by 50 percent or more.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph P.

The prevailing style was [[classicism|classical]].<ref>Philip John Yarrow, ''A literary history of France: Renaissance France 1470\u20131589'' (1974)</ref><ref>Henri Zerner, ''Renaissance art in France: the invention of classicism'' (Flammarion, 2003)</ref>\n\nThe [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]] was signed into law by [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in 1539.\nLargely the work of Chancellor [[Guillaume Poyet]], it  dealt with a number of government, judicial and ecclesiastical matters. Articles 110 and 111, the most famous, called for the use of the [[French language]] in all legal acts, notarised contracts and official legislation.\n\n====Italian Wars====\n{{Main article|Italian Wars}}\nAfter the Hundred Years' War, [[Charles VIII of France]] signed three additional treaties with [[Henry VII of England]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of Habsburg]], and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] respectively at [[Peace of Etaples|\u00c9taples]] (1492), [[Treaty of Senlis|Senlis]] (1493) and in [[Treaty of Barcelona|Barcelona]] (1493). These three treaties cleared the way for France to undertake the long [[Italian Wars]] (1494\u20131559), which marked the beginning of early modern France. French efforts to gain dominance resulted only in the increased power of the [[Habsburg]] house.\n\n====Wars of Religion====\n{{Main article|French Wars of Religion}}\n\nBarely were the Italian Wars over, when France was plunged into a domestic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Despite the conclusion of [[Concordat of Bologna|a Concordat]] between France and the Papacy (1516), granting the crown unrivalled power in senior ecclesiastical appointments, France was deeply affected by the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s attempt to break the hegemony of Catholic Europe. A growing urban-based Protestant minority (later dubbed ''[[Huguenots]]'') faced ever harsher repression under the rule of Francis I's son [[Henry II of France|King Henry II]]. After Henry II's death in a joust, the country was ruled by his widow [[Catherine de' Medici]] and her sons [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] and [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. Renewed Catholic reaction headed by the powerful dukes of [[Guise]] culminated in a massacre of Huguenots (1562), starting the first of the [[French Wars of Religion]], during which English, German, and Spanish forces intervened on the side of rival Protestant and Catholic forces.

After the assassination of both Henry of Guise (1588) and Henry III (1589), the conflict was ended by the accession of the Protestant king of [[Navarre]] as [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (first king of the [[Bourbon dynasty]]) and his subsequent abandonment of Protestantism (Expedient of 1592) effective in 1593, his acceptance by most of the Catholic establishment (1594) and by the Pope (1595), and his issue of the toleration decree known as the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1598), which guaranteed freedom of private worship and civil equality.<ref>David Buisseret, ''Henry IV, King of France'' (1990).</ref>\n\n===Early Modern period===\n{{Main article|Early modern France}}\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Henry IV of france by pourbous younger.jpg\n| image2 = Louis XIIIval grace.jpg\n| footer = [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (left), by [[Frans Pourbus the younger]] (1610), [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] (right), by [[Philippe de Champaigne]] (1647)\n| align = right\n| direction = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n====Colonial France====\n{{Main article|New France}}\nFrance's pacification under [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] laid much of the ground for the beginnings of France's rise to European hegemony. France was expansive during all but the end of the seventeenth century: the French began trading in [[India]] and [[Madagascar]], founded [[Quebec City|Quebec]] and penetrated the North American [[Great Lakes]] and [[Mississippi]], established plantation economies in the [[West Indies]] and extended their trade contacts in the [[Levant]] and enlarged their [[merchant marine]].\n\n====Thirty Years' War====\nHenry IV's son [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and his minister (1624\u20131642) [[Cardinal Richelieu]], elaborated a policy against Spain and the Holy Roman Empire during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) which had broken out in Germany. After the death of both king and cardinal, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) secured universal acceptance of Germany's political and religious fragmentation, but the Regency of [[Anne of Austria]] and her minister [[Cardinal Mazarin]] experienced a civil uprising known as the [[Fronde]] (1648\u20131653) which expanded into a [[Fronde|Franco-Spanish War]] (1653\u201359). The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) formalised France's seizure (1642) of the Spanish territory of [[Roussillon]] after the crushing of the ephemeral [[Catalan Republic (1641)|Catalan Republic]] and ushered a short period of peace.<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years' War'' (2009).</ref>\n\n====Administrative structures====\n{{Main article|Ancien R\u00e9gime}}\n\nThe ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', a French term rendered in English as \"Old Rule\", or simply \"Former Regime\", refers primarily to the aristocratic, social and political system of early modern France under the [[Valois dynasty|late Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasties.  The administrative and social structures of the Ancien R\u00e9gime were the result of years of state-building, legislative acts (like the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]]), internal conflicts and civil wars, but they remained a confusing patchwork of local [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]] and historic differences until the [[French Revolution]] brought about a radical suppression of administrative incoherence.\n\n====Louis XIV, the Sun King====\n{{Main article|Louis XIV of France}}\n\n[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], by [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], 1701]]\n\nFor most of the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1643\u20131715), (\"The Sun King\"), France was the dominant power in Europe, aided by the diplomacy of Cardinal Richelieu's successor as the King's chief minister, (1642\u201361) [[Cardinal Jules Mazarin]], (1602\u201361). Cardinal Mazarin oversaw the creation of a French Royal Navy that rivalled [[Royal Navy|England's]], expanding it from 25 ships to almost 200. The size of the Army was also considerably increased. Renewed wars (the [[War of Devolution]], 1667\u201368 and the [[Franco-Dutch War]], 1672\u201378) brought further territorial gains ([[Artois]] and western [[Flanders]] and the free [[county of Burgundy]], previously left to the Empire in 1482), but at the cost of the increasingly concerted opposition of rival royal powers, and a legacy of an increasingly enormous national debt. An adherent of the theory of the [[divine right of kings|\"Divine Right of Kings\"]], which advocates the divine origin of temporal power and any lack of earthly restraint of monarchical rule, Louis XIV continued his predecessors' work of creating a [[Centralized government|centralized state]] governed from the capital of Paris. He sought to eliminate the remnants of [[feudalism]] still persisting in parts of France and, by compelling the noble elite to regularly inhabit his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]], built on the outskirts of Paris, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the earlier \"[[Fronde]]\" rebellion during Louis' minority youth. By these means he consolidated a system of absolute monarchy in France that endured 150 years until the [[French Revolution]].<ref>William Beik, ''Louis XIV and Absolutism: A Brief Study with Documents'' (2000)</ref>  McCabe says critics used fiction to portray the degraded Turkish Court, using \"the harem, the Sultan court, oriental despotism, luxury, gems and spices, carpets, and silk cushions\" as an unfavorable analogy to the corruption of the French royal court.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism, and the Ancien R\u00e9gime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MmvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA134|year=2008|publisher=Berg|page=134|isbn=9781847884633}}</ref>\n\nThe king sought to impose total religious uniformity on the country, repealing the \"[[Edict of Nantes]]\" in 1685. The infamous practice of \"[[dragonnades]]\" was adopted, whereby intentionally rough soldiers were quartered in the homes of Protestant families and allowed to have their way with them \u2014 stealing, raping, torturing and killing adults and infants in their hovels. It is estimated that anywhere between 150,000 and 300,000 Protestants fled France during the wave of persecution that followed the repeal,<ref>[https://www.letemps.ch/monde/rome-protestante-face-aux-exiles-foi La Rome protestante face aux exil\u00e9s de la foi]</ref><ref>[http://books.openedition.org/pur/5650  Le Refuge protestant urbain au temps de la r\u00e9vocation de l\u2019\u00c9dit de Nantes]</ref> (following \"[[Huguenots]]\" beginning a hundred and fifty years earlier until the end of the 18th century) costing the country a great many intellectuals, artisans, and other valuable people. Persecution extended to unorthodox Roman Catholics like the [[Jansenists]], a group that denied free will and had already been condemned by the popes. Louis was no theologian and understood little of the complex doctrines of Jansenism, satisfying himself with the fact that they threatened the unity of the state. In this, he garnered the friendship of the papacy, which had previously been hostile to France because of its policy of putting all church property in the country under the jurisdiction of the state rather than that of Rome.<ref>John B. Wolf, ''Louis XIV'' (1974)</ref>\n\nIn November 1700, the Spanish king [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] died, ending the Habsburg line in that country. Louis had long waited for this moment, and now planned to put a Bourbon relative, [[Philip, Duke of Anjou]], (1683\u20131746), on the throne. Essentially, [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]] was to become a perpetual ally and even obedient satellite of France, ruled by a king who would carry out orders from Versailles. Realizing how this would upset the balance of power, the other European rulers were outraged. However, most of the alternatives were equally undesirable. For example, putting another Habsburg on the throne would end up recreating the grand multi-national empire of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500\u201358), of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (German First Reich), [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]] which would also grossly upset the power balance. After nine years of exhausting war, the last thing Louis wanted was another conflict. However, the rest of Europe would not stand for his ambitions in Spain, and so the long [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began (1701\u201314), a mere three years after the [[War of the Grand Alliance]], (1688\u201397, aka \"War of the League of Augsburg\") had just concluded.<ref>Daniel Roche, France in the Enlightenment (1998)</ref>\n\n====Dissent and revolution====\n{{main article|French Revolution}}\n[[File:France anciennes provinces 1789.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Provinces in 1789]]\n\nThe reign (1715\u201374) of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] saw an initial return to peace and prosperity under the regency (1715\u201323) of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], whose policies were largely continued (1726\u20131743) by [[Cardinal Fleury]], prime minister in all but name. The exhaustion of Europe after two major wars resulted in a long period of peace, only interrupted by minor conflicts like the [[War of the Polish Succession]] from 1733\u201335. Large-scale warfare resumed with the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u201348). But alliance with the traditional Habsburg enemy (the \"[[Diplomatic Revolution]]\" of 1756) against the rising power of Britain and [[Prussia]] led to costly failure in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u201363) and the loss of France's North American colonies.<ref>Colin Jones, ''The Great Nation: France from Louis XV to Napoleon'' (2003)</ref>\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|image1=Louis XV by Maurice-Quentin de La Tour.jpg\n|image2=Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Callet - Louis XVI, roi de France et de Navarre (1754-1793), rev\u00eatu du grand costume royal en 1779 - Google Art Project.jpg\n|footer=[[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] (left), by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] (1748); [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (right), by [[Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Callet]] (1775)\n}}\nOn the whole, the 18th century saw growing discontent with the monarchy and the established order. Louis XV was a highly unpopular king for his sexual excesses, overall weakness, and for losing Canada to the British. A strong ruler like Louis XIV could enhance the position of the monarchy, while Louis XV weakened it. The writings of the [[philosophes]] such as [[Voltaire]] were a clear sign of discontent, but the king chose to ignore them. He died of [[smallpox]] in 1774, and the French people shed few tears at his passing. While France had not yet experienced the [[Industrial Revolution]] that was beginning in Britain, the rising middle class of the cities felt increasingly frustrated with a system and rulers that seemed silly, frivolous, aloof, and antiquated, even if true feudalism no longer existed in France.\n\nUpon Louis XV's death, his grandson [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] became king. Initially popular, he too came to be widely detested by the 1780s. He was married to an Austrian archduchess, [[Marie Antoinette]]. French intervention in the American War of Independence was also very expensive.<ref>William Doyle, ''The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction'' (2001)</ref>\n\nWith the country deeply in debt, Louis XVI permitted the radical reforms of [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Guillaume-Chr\u00e9tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]], but noble disaffection led to Turgot's dismissal and Malesherbes' resignation in 1776. They were replaced by [[Jacques Necker]]. Necker had resigned in 1781 to be replaced by [[Charles Alexandre de Calonne|Calonne]] and [[\u00c9tienne Charles de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne|Brienne]], before being restored in 1788. A harsh winter that year led to widespread food shortages, and by then France was a powder keg ready to explode.<ref>Sylvia Neely, ''A Concise History of the French Revolution '' (2008)</ref>\nOn the eve of the [[French Revolution]] of July 1789, France was in a profound institutional and financial crisis, but the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had begun to permeate the educated classes of society.<ref>Daniel Roche, ''France in the Enlightenment'' (1998)</ref>\n\n=== Limited monarchy ===\nOn September 3, 1791, the absolute monarchy which had governed France for 948 years was forced to limit its power and become a provisional constitutional monarchy. However, this too would not last very long and on September 21, 1792 the French monarchy was effectively abolished by the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. The role of the King in France was finally ended with the execution of [[Louis XVI]] by [[guillotine]] on Monday, January 21, 1793, followed by the \"[[Reign of Terror]]\", mass executions and the provisional \"[[French Directory|Directory]]\" form of [[French First Republic|republican government]], and the eventual beginnings of twenty-five years of reform, upheaval, dictatorship, wars and renewal, with the various [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\n===Restoration===\n{{Main article|Bourbon Restoration}}\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|image1=G\u00e9rard - Louis XVIII of France in Coronation Robes.jpg\n|image2=Carlos X de Francia (Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard).jpg\n|footer=The two kings of the Restoration: [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] (left) by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1820s), [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (right) by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1825)\n}}\n\nThe monarchy was briefly restored following the successive events of the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u201399), and the [[First French Empire|First French Empire under Napoleon]] (1804\u20131814/15)&nbsp;\u2013 when a [[War of the Sixth Coalition|coalition of European powers]] restored by arms the monarchy to the heirs of the [[House of Bourbon]] in 1814. However the deposed Emperor [[Napoleon I]] returned triumphantly to Paris from his exile in [[Elba]] and ruled France for a short period known as the [[Hundred Days]].\n\nWhen a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh European Coalition]] deposed Napoleon after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815, the Bourbon monarchy was once again restored. \nThe [[Count of Provence]], brother of Louis XVI, who was guillotined in 1793, was crowned as [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], nicknamed \"The Desired\". Louis XVIII tried to conciliate the legacies of the Revolution and Ancien R\u00e9gime both, also permitting the formation of a [[French Parliament|Parliament]] and [[Charter of 1814|constitutional Charter]], usually \"''Charte octroy\u00e9e''\" (\"Granted Charter\"). His reign was characterized by disagreements between the [[Doctrinaires]], liberal thinkers who supported the Charter and rising [[bourgeoisie]], and the [[Ultra-royalist]]s, aristocrats and clergymen who totally refused the Revolution's heritage. However, peace was maintained by statesmen like [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] and the [[Armand-Emmanuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu|Duke of Richelieu]], as well as the King's moderation and prudent intervention.<ref>Actes du congr\u00e8s \u2013 vol. 3, 1961, p.&nbsp;441.</ref><ref>Emmanuel de Waresquiel, 2003, pp.&nbsp;460\u2013461.</ref> In 1823, the liberal agitations in Spain led to a [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|French intervention]] on the royalist's side, who permitted to King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] to reject the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution]]. {{clarify|it's not clear if someone has been messing with the text, but at present the last two sentences are a bit incomprehensible|date=May 2018}}\n\nHowever, the work of Louis XVIII was frustrated when, after his death in 16 September 1824, his brother the [[Count of Artois]] became King under the name of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]. Charles X was a strong [[reactionary]] who supported ultra-royalists and [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]]. Under his reign, the censorship of newspapers was reinforced, the [[Anti-Sacrilege Act]] passed and compensations to [[French emigration (1789\u20131815)|French \u00c9migr\u00e9]] were increased. However, there were also the intervention in the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] and the first phase of the [[French conquest of Algeria|conquest of Algeria]].\n\nThe absolutist tendencies of the King were disliked by Doctrinaire majority in the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]], that in 18 March 1830 [[Address of the 221|sent and cordial address]] to the King, remembering to him his vote on the Charter.

The July Monarchy was beset by corruption scandals and financial crisis. The opposition of the King was composed of [[Legitimists]], supporting the [[Henri, Count of Chambord|Count of Chambord]], Bourbon claimant to the Throne, and of [[Bonapartist]]s and [[Republicanism in France|Republicans]] who fought against royalty and supported the principles of democracy.\nThe King tried to suppress the opposition with censorship, but when the ''[[Campagne des banquets]]'' (\"Banquets' Campaign\") was repressed in February 1848,<ref>La France au xixe si\u00e8cle, p. 211 and 2012</ref> riots and seditions erupted in Paris and later all France, resulting in the [[French Revolution of 1848|February Revolution]].

in the north there were Viking incursions leading to the formation of the [[Duchy of Normandy]]; in the west, the [[counts of Anjou]] established themselves as powerful rivals of the king, by the late 11th century ruling over the \"[[Angevin Empire]]\", which included the [[kingdom of England]]. \nIt was only with [[Philip II of France]] that the bulk of the territory of Western Francia came under the rule of the Frankish kings, and Philip was consequently the first king to call himself \"king of France\" (1190). \nThe division of France between the Angevin (Plantagenet) kings of England and the Capetian kings of France would lead to the [[Hundred Years' War]], and France would regain control over these territories only by the mid 15th century.\nWhat is now eastern France (Lorraine,

This led many even within the Asian American community at the time to view it either as a welcomed positive stereotype in contrast to years of negative stereotypes, or as a euphemistic stereotype that was no more than a mere annoyance. They did not foresee the negative repercussions to come from this stereotype. Many critics point out that there are more positives than negatives that come with this stereotype while many others believe that there are just as many negatives that come with this stereotype as there are positives and that no stereotype regardless of how positive they try to be or how positive their connotations are should be regarded as a good stereotype.

While 50 percent of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. have a bachelor's degree, only 5 percent of the population does in their native China.<ref name=\"YananWang\"/> Lastly, if Confucian culture played a vital part of Asian culture, Chinese immigrant children would perform consistently around the world, yet second-generation Chinese immigrants are the lowest academic achievers among immigrant groups in Spain, less than half are expected to graduate from middle school.<ref name=\"YananWang\"/>\n\n====Asian American status in affirmative action====\n{{See also|Affirmative action|Asian quota}}\n\nIn the 1980s, one [[Ivy League]] school found evidence it had limited admissions of Asian American students. Because of their high degree of success as a group and over-representation in many areas such as [[college admissions]], most Asian Americans are not granted preferential treatment by [[affirmative action]] policies as are other minority groups.<ref name=\"Asian over-representation Washington Post\"/>\n\nSome schools choose lower-scoring applicants from other [[Race (human classification)|racial]] groups over Asian Americans in an attempt to promote racial [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] and to maintain some [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]] to the society's racial [[Demographics of the United States|demographics]].<ref name=\"Asian over-representation Washington Post\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55160-2005Mar21.html|title=Learning to Stand Out Among the Standouts|work=The Washington Post|date=March 22, 2005|accessdate=December 10, 2010|first=Jay|last=Mathews}}</ref><ref name=\"asianstudies3\">{{Cite book|last=Ancheta|first=Angelo N.|authorlink=|title=Race, Rights, and the Asian American Experience|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2006|location=|pages=|url=|doi=|id=|isbn= 978-0-8135-3902-7\n}}</ref>{{rp|165}}\n\nIn 2014, American business schools began a process to sort candidates based on their country of origin and region of the world they come from.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stacyblackman.com/2014/11/14/separate-gmat-rankings-for-u-s-and-asian-applicants/|title=Separate GMAT Rankings for U.S. and Asian Applicants|website=Stacy Blackman Consulting - MBA Admissions Consulting|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref>\n\n===Effects of the stereotype ===\nAccording to Gordon H. Chang: The reference to Asian Americans as model minorities has to do with the work ethic, respect for elders, and high valuation of education, family and elders present in their culture. The model minority stereotype also comes with an underlying notion of their apoliticality. Such a label one-dimensionalizes Asian Americans as having only traits based around stereotypes and no other human qualities, such as vocal leadership, negative emotions (e.g. anger or sadness), sociopolitical activeness, risk taking, ability to learn from mistakes, desire for creative expression, intolerance towards oppression or being overlooked of their acknowledgements and successes. Asian Americans are labeled as model minorities because they have not been as much of a \"threat\" to the U.S. political establishment as blacks, due to a smaller population and less political advocacy. This label seeks to suppress potential political activism through euphemistic stereotyping.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Gordon |date=2002 |title=Asian Americans and Politics: Perspectives, Experiences, Prospects |url=https://archive.org/details/asianamericanspo00chan |url-access=registration |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804742016 }}</ref>\n\nAnother effect of the stereotype is that American society may tend to ignore the racism and discrimination Asian Americans still face. Complaints are dismissed with the claim that the racism which occurs to Asian Americans is less important than or not as bad as the racism faced by other minority races, thus establishing a systematic [[racial hierarchy]].  Believing that due to their success and that they possess so-called \"positive\" stereotypes, many{{who|date=June 2013}} assume they face no forms of racial discrimination or social issues in the greater American society, and that their community is fine, having \"gained\" social and economic equality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yellow Face: The documentary part 4 - Asian Americans do face racism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOYT4JTea4|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Asians, Blacks, Stereotypes and the Media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqShFjk6BoE|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|url=http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112140608/http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 January 2012|publisher=Psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nRacial discrimination can take subtle forms such as through [[microaggression]].

For instance, discrimination and model minority stereotyping are linked to Asian American students' lower valuing of school, lower self-esteem, and higher depressive symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kiang|first1=Lisa|title=Model Minority Stereotyping, Perceived Discrimination, and Adjustment Among Adolescents from Asian American Backgrounds.|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=2016|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1366\u20131379|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0336-7|pmid=26251100}}</ref> Furthermore, the psychological distress of failing to meet the model minority image, such as feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, shame, and embarrassment, is exacerbated due to the differential treatment associated with being stereotyped as a model minority and [[perpetual foreigner]].\n\nFurthermore, the model minority image can be a threat to underachieving Asian American students' academic experience and educational advancement. It promotes invisibility and disguises the academic barriers and psychological problems students may encounter. This is problematic because it creates a barrier for educators to better understand and assist struggling students' educational and mental health needs in order to optimize students' academic experience and social emotional development.\n\nAsian Americans may also be commonly stereotyped by the general public as being studious, intelligent, successful, elitist, brand name conscious, yet paradoxically passive. As a result, higher and unreasonable expectations are often associated with Asian Americans.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Also due to the model minority image, Asian American students are viewed as \"problem-free\" and academically competent students who can succeed with little support and without special services.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Guofang|title=Other People's Success: Impact of the \"Model Minority\" Myth on Underachieving Asian Students in North America|journal=KEDI Journal of Educational Policy|date=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=69\u201386}}</ref> This emphasis that Asian Americans are being denial by their racial reality because of the assumption that \"Asians are the new Whites\"; therefore, they are being dismissed by their intelligence and experiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/microaggressions-asians.pdf|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Thus, educators may overlook the instructional needs and psychological concerns of underachieving Asian American students. The model minority stereotype can also contribute to teachers' having a \"blaming the victims\" perspective. This means that teachers blame students, their culture, or their families for students' poor performance or misbehavior in school. This is problematic because it shifts responsibility away from schools and teachers and misdirects attention away from finding a solution to improve students' learning experience and alleviate the situation. Furthermore, the model minority stereotype has a negative impact on the home environment. Parents' expectations place high pressure on students to achieve, creating a stressful, school-like home environment. Parents' expressed worry and frustration can also place emotional burdens and psychological stress on students.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nSome educators hold Asian students to a higher standard.<ref name=\"asianamericanissues1\"/> This deprives those students with [[learning disabilities]] from being given attention that they need.

It is a threat to Asian American students' academic experience and can disguise students' educational and mental health needs. Psychological distress from model minority stereotyping is related to the stressors associated with the pressure to succeed, differential treatment, and embarrassment or shame to seek help. With this information, a recommendation for schools is to promote a more inclusive and less competitive learning environment, so students will not be ashamed and afraid to ask for help. Administrators can also improve school climate by monitoring incidents of racial harassment and discrimination. Additionally, to better address struggling students' educational and mental health needs, educators can regularly check in with students and engage in culturally responsive teaching, aimed to understand students' unique circumstances and educational needs.\n\n===Invisible model minority: Africans ===\n[[African immigration to the United States|African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants]] have been described as an \"Invisible Model Minority\" mainly due to their high degree of success in the United States, but due to misconceptions and stereotypes{{clarify|date=September 2015}} of them, their success has not been acknowledged by the greater American society and other Western societies and thus they are \"invisible\".<ref name=BlackModelMinority3>{{cite web|title=Black Immigrants, An Invisible 'Model Minority'|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/03/black_immigrants_an_invisible.html|publisher=Realclearpolitics.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref><ref name=BlackInvisibleModel4>{{cite web|title=Black African Migration to the United States| url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/africanmigrationus.pdf|publisher=Migrationpolicy.org|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>  The invisibility of the success of Africans was touched upon by Dr. Kefa M.

In 2007, 27 percent of the U.S. population aged 25 and older had a four-year degree or more; 10 percent had a master's, doctorate, or professional degree. Immigrants from several Anglophone African countries were among the best educated: a majority of Black Immigrants from Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe had at least a four-year degree. Immigrants from Egypt, where the official language is Arabic, were also among the best educated.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/> The overrepresentation of the highly skilled among U.S. immigrants is particularly striking for several of\nAfrica's largest source countries. The United States was the destination for 59 percent of Nigeria's highly skilled immigrants along with 47 percent of those from Ghana and 29 percent from Kenya.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/>\n\nThe average annual personal income of African immigrants is about $26,000, nearly $2,000 more than that of workers born in the U.S. This might be because 71 percent of the Africans 16 years and older are working, compared to 64 percent of Americans. This is believed to be due larger percentage of African immigrants have higher educational qualifications than Americans, which results in higher per capita incomes for African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants.<ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4/>\n\nOutside of educational success specific groups have found economic success and have made many contributions to American society such as [[Ugandan American]]s.

For example, it is claimed they often integrate into American society more successfully and at higher rates than other immigrants groups due to social factors. One being that many African immigrants have strong English skills even before entering the U.S., many African nations, particularly former [[British colonies]], use English as a [[lingua franca]].<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/> Because of this, many African immigrants to the U.S. are bilingual. Overall, 70 percent of Black African immigrants either speak English as their primary language or speak another language but are also fluent in English. Compare this to 48% ''proficiency'' in English for other immigrant groups.\n\nKefa M. Otiso has proposed another reason for the success of African immigrants, saying that they have a \"high work ethic, focus and a drive to succeed that is honed and crafted by the fact that there are limited socioeconomic opportunities in their native African countries,\" says Otiso.<ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4>{{cite web|title=Study Examines Success of African Immigrans|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/news/2008/news48744.html|publisher=Bgsu.edu|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Selective immigration====\nAnother possible cause of the higher performance of African immigrants as a group is that they represent a small population here in America so those who are chosen to come here often come from a selective group of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]]. The relative difficulty of emigrating and immigrating into the United States has created a selective nature of the process with the U.S. often choosing the wealthier and more educated out of those with less resources, motivation or ability to immigrate.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/>\n\n====Americans born to African immigrants====\nDespite African immigrants being highly educated many often find it hard to become employed in high level occupations. Most instead have to work in labor jobs to subsist and maintain a decent life. {{citation needed | reason = This claim requires evidence. | date = May 2016 }} Often it is left to their children to take up these higher positions. This desire to succeed is then transferred onto second generation African immigrants. These Americans often report that their families pushed them very hard to strive for [https://web.archive.org/web/20130726181401/http://success/ success] and overachieve in many aspects of society, especially education. African immigrants put a premium on education because of the limited socioeconomic opportunities they experienced in their native countries.

Indos formed the vast majority of the European legal class in the colony. When in the second half of the 20th century the independent [[Republic of Indonesia]] was established, the majority of Europeans, including the Indo-Europeans,<ref>{{cite book|author=Gouda, Frances |title=Dutch Culture Overseas: Colonial Practice in the Netherlands Indies 1900-1942.|publisher=Equinox|date=2008|isbn=978-979-3780-62-7|page=173|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nN6G-lMk_DEC|accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref> were expelled from the newly established country.\n\n===Repatriation===\nFrom 1945 to 1949 the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] turned the former Dutch East Indies into an increasingly hostile environment for Indo-Europeans. Violence aimed towards Indo-Europeans during its early [[Bersiap]] period (1945\u20131946) accumulated in almost 20,000 deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tongtong.nl/indische-school/contentdownloads/bussemaker_bersiap.pdf |title=Geschiedenis : Dr. H.

Even though most Indos had never set foot in the Netherlands before, this  emigration was named ''repatriation''.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Indos in the former colony of the Dutch East Indies were officially part of the European legal class and were formally considered to be Dutch nationals, the Dutch government practiced an official policy of discouragement with regard to the post-WWII repatriation of Indos to the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/speler.program.7028352.html |title=Spijtoptanten - NPO Geschiedenis |publisher=Geschiedenis24.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref> While Dutch policy was in fact aimed at stimulating Indos to give up Dutch citizenship and opt for Indonesian citizenship, simultaneously the young Indonesian Republic implemented policies increasingly intolerant towards anything remotely reminiscent of Dutch influence. Even though actual aggression against Indos decreased after the extreme violence of the [[Bersiap]] period, all Dutch (language) institutions, schools and businesses were gradually eliminated and public discrimination and racism against Indos in the Indonesian job market continued. In the end 98% of the original Indo community repatriated to their distant fatherland in Europe.<ref name=\"vanstockum.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanstockum.nl/product/12299438/Van-Pasar-Malam-tot-'I-love-Indo'.html |title=Van Pasar Malam tot I love Indo |publisher=Vanstockum.nl |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref>\n\n===Integration===\nIn the 1990s and early 21st century the Netherlands was confronted with ethnic tension in a now [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] society. Ethnic tensions, rooted in the perceived lack of social integration and rise of crime rates of several ethnic minorities, climaxed with the murders of politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] in 2002 and film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] in 2004. In 2006 statistics show that in [[Rotterdam]], the second largest city in the country, close to 50% of the inhabitants were of foreign descent. The Indo community however is considered the best integrated ethnic and cultural minority in the Netherlands. Statistical data compiled by the CBS shows that Indos belong to the group with the lowest crime rates in the country.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120805075827/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a741617440]</ref>\n\nA CBS study of 1999 reveals that of all foreign born groups living in the Netherlands, only the Indos have an average income similar to that of citizens born in the Netherlands. Job participation in government, education and health care is similar as well. Another recent CBS study, among foreign born citizens and their children living in the Netherlands in 2005, shows that on average, Indos own the largest number of independent enterprises. A 2007 CBS study shows that already over 50% of first-generation Indos have married a native born Dutch person.

Furthermore, the idea of the model minority pits minority groups against each other by implying that non-model groups are at fault for falling short of the model minority level of achievement and assimilation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Yoonsun|last2=Lahey|first2=Benjamin B.|date=2006-09-01|title=Testing the Model Minority Stereotype: Youth Behaviors across Racial and Ethnic Groups|journal=The Social Service Review|volume=80|issue=3|pages=419\u2013452|doi=10.1086/505288|issn=0037-7961|pmc=3093248|pmid=21572913}}</ref> \n\nThe concept has also been criticized by outlets such as NPR for potentially homogenizing the experiences of Asian Americans on one side and Hispanics and African Americans on the other, despite the different groups experiencing racism in different ways.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks|title='Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians And Blacks|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>Critics also argue that the idea perpetuates the belief that any minority has the capability to rise economically without assistance and ignores the differences between the history of Asian Americans and African Americans, and sometimes Hispanics, in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inheritancemag.com/article/the-model-minority-myth-and-the-wedge-between-black-and-white-america|title=The Model Minority Myth and the Wedge Between Black and White America [Updated] {{!}} Inheritance|work=Inheritance|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of \"model minority\" is heavily associated with U.S. culture and is not extensively used outside the U.S., though many European countries have concepts of classism that stereotype ethnic groups in a similar manner to model minority.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news18.com/news/india/sikhs-hindus-now-part-of-middle-class-britain-354653.html|title=Sikhs, Hindus now part of middle-class Britain|work=News18|access-date=2017-08-02}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nOne of the earliest uses of the term ''model minority'' was in the 9 January 1966 edition of ''The New York Times Magazine'' by sociologist William Petersen to describe Asian Americans as ethnic minorities who, despite [[marginalization]], have achieved success in the United States. In his essay called \"Success Story: Japanese American Style\", he wrote that the Japanese cultures have strong work ethics and family values. Furthermore, he wrote that those values prevent them from becoming a \"problem minority\".

This led many even within the Asian American community at the time to view it either as a welcomed positive stereotype in contrast to years of negative stereotypes, or as a euphemistic stereotype that was no more than a mere annoyance. They did not foresee the negative repercussions to come from this stereotype. Many critics point out that there are more positives than negatives that come with this stereotype while many others believe that there are just as many negatives that come with this stereotype as there are positives and that no stereotype regardless of how positive they try to be or how positive their connotations are should be regarded as a good stereotype.

Model Minorities are used as a tool to discriminate against Black people with the mantra \"If they can do it, why can't you?\". This argument is often viewed as logical, because at the surface, there doesn't seem to be a clear cut explanation for why Jews, Asians, and Irish people are able to thrive after experiencing racism, but Blacks still seem to be disenfranchised.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks|title='Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians And Blacks|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-11-06}}</ref> \u00a0What this argument often ignores, is the unique experience of Black people in America, namely, they are the only minority who had been enslaved on U.S. soil for centuries. Some scholars also explain the differing successes of Asian immigrants and Blacks on the specific types of racism they experience. Essentially racism in itself is not monolithic, and is perpetrated in different ways and different arenas of life, some arenas where anti-Black rhetoric exist prove to be more harmful to Black personhood than situations in which anti-Asian discrimination exists.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Media portrayal===\nMedia coverage of the increasing success of Asian Americans as a group began in the 1960s, reporting high average test scores and marks in school, winning national [[spelling bee]]s, and high levels of university attendance.\n\nIn 1988, the writer Philip K. Chiu identified the prevalence of the model minority stereotype in American media reports on Chinese Americans, and noted the contrast between that stereotype and what he observed as the reality of the Chinese American population, which was much more varied than the model minority stereotype in the media typically presented.<ref>Philip K. Chiu, \"ROSTRUM:  The myth of the model minority.\" U.S. News and World Report. May 16, 1988. p. 7.</ref>\n<blockquote>I am fed up with being stereotyped as either a subhuman or superhuman creature.

Many worked for low wages in the harshest conditions. Confucian values were not seen as a key to success.

While 50 percent of Chinese immigrants in the U.S. have a bachelor's degree, only 5 percent of the population does in their native China.<ref name=\"YananWang\"/> Lastly, if Confucian culture played a vital part of Asian culture, Chinese immigrant children would perform consistently around the world, yet second-generation Chinese immigrants are the lowest academic achievers among immigrant groups in Spain, less than half are expected to graduate from middle school.<ref name=\"YananWang\"/>\n\n====Asian American status in affirmative action====\n{{See also|Affirmative action|Asian quota}}\n\nIn the 1980s, one [[Ivy League]] school found evidence it had limited admissions of Asian American students.

Chang: The reference to Asian Americans as model minorities has to do with the work ethic, respect for elders, and high valuation of education, family and elders present in their culture. The model minority stereotype also comes with an underlying notion of their apoliticality. Such a label one-dimensionalizes Asian Americans as having only traits based around stereotypes and no other human qualities, such as vocal leadership, negative emotions (e.g. anger or sadness), sociopolitical activeness, risk taking, ability to learn from mistakes, desire for creative expression, intolerance towards oppression or being overlooked of their acknowledgements and successes. Asian Americans are labeled as model minorities because they have not been as much of a \"threat\" to the U.S. political establishment as blacks, due to a smaller population and less political advocacy. This label seeks to suppress potential political activism through euphemistic stereotyping.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Gordon |date=2002 |title=Asian Americans and Politics: Perspectives, Experiences, Prospects |url=https://archive.org/details/asianamericanspo00chan |url-access=registration |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804742016 }}</ref>\n\nAnother effect of the stereotype is that American society may tend to ignore the racism and discrimination Asian Americans still face. Complaints are dismissed with the claim that the racism which occurs to Asian Americans is less important than or not as bad as the racism faced by other minority races, thus establishing a systematic [[racial hierarchy]].  Believing that due to their success and that they possess so-called \"positive\" stereotypes, many{{who|date=June 2013}} assume they face no forms of racial discrimination or social issues in the greater American society, and that their community is fine, having \"gained\" social and economic equality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yellow Face: The documentary part 4 - Asian Americans do face racism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOYT4JTea4|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Asians, Blacks, Stereotypes and the Media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqShFjk6BoE|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=24 February 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|url=http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112140608/http://psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/Sue,+Bucerri+et+al.+2007.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 January 2012|publisher=Psy6129.alliant.wikispaces.net|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nRacial discrimination can take subtle forms such as through [[microaggression]].

For instance, discrimination and model minority stereotyping are linked to Asian American students' lower valuing of school, lower self-esteem, and higher depressive symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kiang|first1=Lisa|title=Model Minority Stereotyping, Perceived Discrimination, and Adjustment Among Adolescents from Asian American Backgrounds.|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=2016|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1366\u20131379|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0336-7|pmid=26251100}}</ref> Furthermore, the psychological distress of failing to meet the model minority image, such as feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, shame, and embarrassment, is exacerbated due to the differential treatment associated with being stereotyped as a model minority and [[perpetual foreigner]].\n\nFurthermore, the model minority image can be a threat to underachieving Asian American students' academic experience and educational advancement. It promotes invisibility and disguises the academic barriers and psychological problems students may encounter. This is problematic because it creates a barrier for educators to better understand and assist struggling students' educational and mental health needs in order to optimize students' academic experience and social emotional development.\n\nAsian Americans may also be commonly stereotyped by the general public as being studious, intelligent, successful, elitist, brand name conscious, yet paradoxically passive. As a result, higher and unreasonable expectations are often associated with Asian Americans.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Also due to the model minority image, Asian American students are viewed as \"problem-free\" and academically competent students who can succeed with little support and without special services.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Guofang|title=Other People's Success: Impact of the \"Model Minority\" Myth on Underachieving Asian Students in North America|journal=KEDI Journal of Educational Policy|date=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=69\u201386}}</ref> This emphasis that Asian Americans are being denial by their racial reality because of the assumption that \"Asians are the new Whites\"; therefore, they are being dismissed by their intelligence and experiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/microaggressions-asians.pdf|title=Racial Microaggressions and the Asian American Experience|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Thus, educators may overlook the instructional needs and psychological concerns of underachieving Asian American students. The model minority stereotype can also contribute to teachers' having a \"blaming the victims\" perspective. This means that teachers blame students, their culture, or their families for students' poor performance or misbehavior in school. This is problematic because it shifts responsibility away from schools and teachers and misdirects attention away from finding a solution to improve students' learning experience and alleviate the situation. Furthermore, the model minority stereotype has a negative impact on the home environment. Parents' expectations place high pressure on students to achieve, creating a stressful, school-like home environment. Parents' expressed worry and frustration can also place emotional burdens and psychological stress on students.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nSome educators hold Asian students to a higher standard.<ref name=\"asianamericanissues1\"/> This deprives those students with [[learning disabilities]] from being given attention that they need.

It is a threat to Asian American students' academic experience and can disguise students' educational and mental health needs. Psychological distress from model minority stereotyping is related to the stressors associated with the pressure to succeed, differential treatment, and embarrassment or shame to seek help. With this information, a recommendation for schools is to promote a more inclusive and less competitive learning environment, so students will not be ashamed and afraid to ask for help.

In 2007, 27 percent of the U.S. population aged 25 and older had a four-year degree or more; 10 percent had a master's, doctorate, or professional degree. Immigrants from several Anglophone African countries were among the best educated: a majority of Black Immigrants from Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe had at least a four-year degree. Immigrants from Egypt, where the official language is Arabic, were also among the best educated.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/> The overrepresentation of the highly skilled among U.S. immigrants is particularly striking for several of\nAfrica's largest source countries. The United States was the destination for 59 percent of Nigeria's highly skilled immigrants along with 47 percent of those from Ghana and 29 percent from Kenya.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/>\n\nThe average annual personal income of African immigrants is about $26,000, nearly $2,000 more than that of workers born in the U.S. This might be because 71 percent of the Africans 16 years and older are working, compared to 64 percent of Americans. This is believed to be due larger percentage of African immigrants have higher educational qualifications than Americans, which results in higher per capita incomes for African immigrants and Americans born to African immigrants.<ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4/>\n\nOutside of educational success specific groups have found economic success and have made many contributions to American society such as [[Ugandan American]]s. Recent statistics indicate that Ugandans have become one of the country's biggest contributors to the economy, their contribution, amounting to US$1 billion in annual remittances which are disproportionately large contributions despite a community and population of less than 13,000.<ref>{{cite news|author=Olivia Miller|date=November 26, 2008|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Sr-Z/Ugandan-Americans.html|title=Everyculture:A Countries and Their Cultures: Ugandan Americans|publisher= Everyculture: Countries and their cultures|accessdate= May 25, 2010 <!--to 23:00-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Total ancestry categories tallied for people with one or more ancestry categories reported 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150118121537/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 January 2015|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfrican immigrants like many other immigrant groups are likely to establish and find success in small businesses.

For example, it is claimed they often integrate into American society more successfully and at higher rates than other immigrants groups due to social factors. One being that many African immigrants have strong English skills even before entering the U.S., many African nations, particularly former [[British colonies]], use English as a [[lingua franca]].<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/> Because of this, many African immigrants to the U.S. are bilingual. Overall, 70 percent of Black African immigrants either speak English as their primary language or speak another language but are also fluent in English. Compare this to 48% ''proficiency'' in English for other immigrant groups.\n\nKefa M. Otiso has proposed another reason for the success of African immigrants, saying that they have a \"high work ethic, focus and a drive to succeed that is honed and crafted by the fact that there are limited socioeconomic opportunities in their native African countries,\" says Otiso.<ref name=AfricanImmigrantSuccess4>{{cite web|title=Study Examines Success of African Immigrans|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/news/2008/news48744.html|publisher=Bgsu.edu|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Selective immigration====\nAnother possible cause of the higher performance of African immigrants as a group is that they represent a small population here in America so those who are chosen to come here often come from a selective group of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]]. The relative difficulty of emigrating and immigrating into the United States has created a selective nature of the process with the U.S. often choosing the wealthier and more educated out of those with less resources, motivation or ability to immigrate.<ref name=BlackAfricanMigration2/>\n\n====Americans born to African immigrants====\nDespite African immigrants being highly educated many often find it hard to become employed in high level occupations. Most instead have to work in labor jobs to subsist and maintain a decent life. {{citation needed | reason = This claim requires evidence. | date = May 2016 }} Often it is left to their children to take up these higher positions. This desire to succeed is then transferred onto second generation African immigrants. These Americans often report that their families pushed them very hard to strive for [https://web.archive.org/web/20130726181401/http://success/ success] and overachieve in many aspects of society, especially education. African immigrants put a premium on education because of the limited socioeconomic opportunities they experienced in their native countries. Consequently, they often allocate more resources towards it.\n\nThis pushing of second generation African immigrants by their parents has proven to be the key factor in their success, and a combination of family support and the emphasis of family unit has given these citizens social and psychological stability which makes them strive even further for success in many aspects of their daily life and society.<ref name=AfricanAchieversUS7>{{cite web|title=Africans highest achievers in U.S. universities |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfZXZWF_kO8|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nMany of these American groups have thus transplanted high cultural emphasis on education and work ethic into their cultures which can be seen in the cultures<ref name=AfricanAchieversUS7/> of [[Algerian Americans]], [[Kenyan Americans]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Ha-La/Kenyan-Americans.html |title=Kenyan Americans - History, Modern era, Significant immigration waves, Acculturation and Assimilation |publisher=Everyculture.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref> [[Sierra Leonean American]]s,<ref>{{cite web |author=Francesca Hampton |year=2010 |url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Sierra-Leonean-Americans.html |title=Sierra Leonean Americans |website=Countries and Their Cultures }}</ref> [[Ghanaian Americans]], [[Malawian American]]s,<ref>Dixon, D.

Indos formed the vast majority of the European legal class in the colony.

Violence aimed towards Indo-Europeans during its early [[Bersiap]] period (1945\u20131946) accumulated in almost 20,000 deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tongtong.nl/indische-school/contentdownloads/bussemaker_bersiap.pdf |title=Geschiedenis : Dr. H.

Even though most Indos had never set foot in the Netherlands before, this  emigration was named ''repatriation''.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Indos in the former colony of the Dutch East Indies were officially part of the European legal class and were formally considered to be Dutch nationals, the Dutch government practiced an official policy of discouragement with regard to the post-WWII repatriation of Indos to the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/speler.program.7028352.html |title=Spijtoptanten - NPO Geschiedenis |publisher=Geschiedenis24.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref> While Dutch policy was in fact aimed at stimulating Indos to give up Dutch citizenship and opt for Indonesian citizenship, simultaneously the young Indonesian Republic implemented policies increasingly intolerant towards anything remotely reminiscent of Dutch influence. Even though actual aggression against Indos decreased after the extreme violence of the [[Bersiap]] period, all Dutch (language) institutions, schools and businesses were gradually eliminated and public discrimination and racism against Indos in the Indonesian job market continued. In the end 98% of the original Indo community repatriated to their distant fatherland in Europe.<ref name=\"vanstockum.nl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanstockum.nl/product/12299438/Van-Pasar-Malam-tot-'I-love-Indo'.html |title=Van Pasar Malam tot I love Indo |publisher=Vanstockum.nl |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}</ref>\n\n===Integration===\nIn the 1990s and early 21st century the Netherlands was confronted with ethnic tension in a now [[Multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] society. Ethnic tensions, rooted in the perceived lack of social integration and rise of crime rates of several ethnic minorities, climaxed with the murders of politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] in 2002 and film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] in 2004. In 2006 statistics show that in [[Rotterdam]], the second largest city in the country, close to 50% of the inhabitants were of foreign descent. The Indo community however is considered the best integrated ethnic and cultural minority in the Netherlands. Statistical data compiled by the CBS shows that Indos belong to the group with the lowest crime rates in the country.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120805075827/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a741617440]</ref>\n\nA CBS study of 1999 reveals that of all foreign born groups living in the Netherlands, only the Indos have an average income similar to that of citizens born in the Netherlands. Job participation in government, education and health care is similar as well. Another recent CBS study, among foreign born citizens and their children living in the Netherlands in 2005, shows that on average, Indos own the largest number of independent enterprises. A 2007 CBS study shows that already over 50% of first-generation Indos have married a native born Dutch person.

{"title_page": "Deformation theory", "text_new": "{{Short description|branch of mathematics}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''deformation theory''' is the study of ''infinitesimal conditions'' associated with varying a solution ''P'' of a problem to slightly different solutions ''P''<sub>\u03b5</sub>, where \u03b5 is a small number, or vector of small quantities. The infinitesimal conditions are therefore the result of applying the approach of [[differential calculus]] to solving a problem with [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. One might  think, in analogy, of a structure that is not completely rigid, and that deforms slightly to accommodate forces applied from the outside; this explains the name.\n\nSome characteristic phenomena are: the derivation of first-order equations by treating the \u03b5 quantities as having negligible squares; the possibility of ''isolated solutions'', in that varying a solution may not be possible, ''or'' does not bring anything new; and the question of whether the infinitesimal constraints actually 'integrate', so that their solution does provide small variations. In some form these considerations have a history of centuries in mathematics, but also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. For example, in the [[geometry of numbers]] a class of results called ''isolation theorems'' was recognised, with the topological interpretation of an ''open orbit'' (of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]) around a given solution. [[Perturbation theory]] also looks at deformations, in general of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s.\n\n==Deformations of complex manifolds==\nThe most salient deformation theory in mathematics has been that of [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic varieties]]. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]], after deformation techniques had received a great deal of more tentative application in the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the [[Zariski tangent space]] with a [[moduli space]]. The phenomena turn out to be rather subtle, though, in the general case.\n\nIn the case of [[Riemann surface]]s, one can explain that the complex structure on the [[Riemann sphere]] is isolated (no moduli). For genus 1, an [[elliptic curve]] has a one-parameter family of complex structures, as shown in [[elliptic function]] theory. The general Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory identifies as the key to the deformation theory the [[sheaf cohomology]] group\n\n: <math> H^1(\\Theta) \\, </math>\n\nwhere \u0398 is (the sheaf of [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] of sections of) the holomorphic [[tangent bundle]]. There is an obstruction in the ''H''<sup>2</sup> of the same sheaf; which is always zero in case of a curve, for general reasons of dimension. In the case of genus 0 the ''H''<sup>1</sup> vanishes, also. For genus 1 the dimension is the [[Hodge number]] ''h''<sup>1,0</sup> which is therefore 1.  It is known that all curves of genus one have equations of form ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''.  These obviously depend on two parameters, a and b, whereas the isomorphism classes of such curves have only one parameter.  Hence there must be an equation relating those a and b which describe isomorphic elliptic curves.  It turns out that curves for which ''b''<sup>2</sup>''a''<sup>\u22123</sup> has the same value, describe isomorphic curves.  I.e. varying a and b is one way to deform the structure of the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'', but not all variations of ''a,b'' actually change the isomorphism class of the curve.\n\nOne can go further with the case of genus ''g'' > 1, using [[Serre duality]] to relate the  ''H''<sup>1</sup> to\n\n: <math> H^0(\\Omega^{[2]}) </math>\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the holomorphic [[cotangent bundle]] and the notation \u03a9<sup>[2]</sup> means the ''tensor square'' (''not'' the second [[exterior power]]). In other words, deformations are regulated by holomorphic [[quadratic differential]]s on a Riemann surface, again something known classically. The dimension of the moduli space, called [[Teichm\u00fcller space]] in this case, is computed as 3''g'' &minus; 3, by the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]].\n\nThese examples are the beginning of a theory applying to holomorphic families of complex manifolds, of any dimension. Further developments included: the extension by Spencer of the techniques to other structures of [[differential geometry]]; the assimilation of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory into the abstract algebraic geometry of [[Grothendieck]], with a consequent substantive clarification of earlier work; and deformation theory of other structures, such as algebras.\n\n==Functorial description==\nAnother method for formalizing deformation theory is using functors on the category <math>\\text{Art}_k</math> of local Artin algebras over a field. A '''pre-deformation functor''' is defined as a functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Art}_k \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nsuch that <math>F(k)</math> is a point. The idea is that we want to study the infinitesimal structure of some [[moduli space]] around a point where lying above that point is the space of interest. It is typically the case that it is easier to describe the functor for a moduli problem instead of finding an actual space. For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree <math>d</math> in <math>\\mathbb{P}^n</math>, then we could consider the functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Sch} \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\nF(S) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\nS\n\\end{matrix}\n: \\text{ each fiber is a degree } d \\text{ hypersurface in }\\mathbb{P}^n\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nAlthough in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of [[groupoid|groupoids]] instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.\n\n===Technical remarks about infinitesimals===\nInfinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials <math>F(x,\\varepsilon)</math> with an infinitesimal <math>\\varepsilon</math>, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider\n:<math> F(x,\\varepsilon) \\equiv f(x) + \\varepsilon g(x) + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nA simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of [[monomial|monomials]] using infinitesimals:\n:<math> (x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nthe <math>\\varepsilon</math> term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring <math>k[y]/(y^2)</math> we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation <math>k[\\varepsilon] = k[y]/(y^2)</math>, which is called the [[Ring of dual numbers]]. \n\nMoreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras <math>k[y]/(y^k)</math>. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then\n:<math>(x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + 3x\\varepsilon^2 + \\varepsilon^3</math>\nRecall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as\n:<math>f(x) = f(0) + \\frac{f^{(1)}(x)}{1!} + \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!} + \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} + \\cdots </math>\nhence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of <math>x^3</math> is <math>6x</math>.\n\nIn general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.\n\n===Motivation===\nTo motivative the definition of a pre-deformation functor, consider the projective hypersurface over a field\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nIf we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{ \\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3][\\varepsilon]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + \\varepsilon  x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} x_3^{a_3}) } \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow\\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4</math>. Then, the space on the right hand corner is one example of an infinitesimal deformation: the extra scheme theoretic structure of the nilpotent elements in <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])</math> (which is topologically a point) allows us to organize this infinitesimal data. Since we want to consider all possible expansions, we will let our predeformation functor be defined on objects as\n:<math>\nF(A) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n</math>\nwhere <math>A</math> is a local Artin <math>k</math>-algebra.\n\n===Smooth pre-deformation functors===\nA pre-deformation functor is called '''smooth''' if for any surjection <math>A' \\to A</math> such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection\n:<math>F(A') \\to F(A)</math>\nThis is motivated by the following question: given a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\ndoes there exist an extension of this cartesian diagram to the cartesian diagrams\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}' \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A')\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthe name smooth comes from the lifting criterion of a smooth morphism of schemes.\n\n===Tangent space===\nRecall that the tangent space of a scheme <math>X</math> can be described as the <math>\\operatorname{Hom}</math>-set\n:<math>TX := \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\text{Sch}/k}(\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon]),X)</math>\n\nwhere the source is the ring of [[Dual number#Dual numbers over an arbitrary ring|dual numbers]]. Since we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre)-deformation functor as\n:<math>T_F := F(k[\\varepsilon])</math>\n\n== Applications of deformation theory ==\n\n=== Dimension of moduli of curves ===\nOne of the first properties of the [[moduli of algebraic curves]] <math>\\mathcal{M}_g</math> can be deduced using elementary deformation theory. Its dimension can be computed as<blockquote><math>\\dim(\\mathcal{M}_g) = \\dim H^1(C,T_C)</math></blockquote>for an arbitrary smooth curve of genus <math>g</math> because the deformation space is the tangent space of the moduli space. Using [[Serre duality]] the tangent space is isomorphic to<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nH^1(C,T_C) &\\cong H^0(C,T_C^* \\otimes \\omega_C)^\\vee \\\\\n&\\cong H^0(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^\\vee\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>Hence the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]] gives<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nh^0(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) - h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) &= 2(2g - 2) - g - 1 \\\\\n &= 3g - 3\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>For curves of genus <math>g \\geq 2</math> the <math>h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) = 0</math> because<blockquote><math>h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) = h^0(C, (\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^{\\vee}\\otimes \\omega_C)\n</math></blockquote>the degree is<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\text{deg}((\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^\\vee \\otimes \\omega_C) &= 4 - 4g + 2g - 2  \\\\\n&= 2 - 2g\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>and <math>h^0(L) = 0</math> for line bundles of negative degree. Therefore the dimension of the moduli space is <math>3g - 3</math>.\n\n=== Bend-and-break ===\nDeformation theory was famously applied in [[birational geometry]] by [[Shigefumi Mori]] to study the existence of [[rational curve]]s on [[algebraic variety|varieties]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Olivier|last = Debarre | author-link = Olivier Debarre|  title = Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry|year = 2001 | publisher= Springer| chapter = 3. Bend-and-Break Lemmas | series = Universitext}}</ref> For a [[Fano variety]] of positive dimension Mori showed that there is a rational curve passing through every point. The method of the proof later became known as '''Mori's bend-and-break'''. The rough idea is to start with some curve ''C'' through a chosen point and keep deforming it until it breaks into several [[irreducible component|components]]. Replacing ''C'' by one of the components has the effect of decreasing either the   [[genus of a curve|genus]] or the [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] of ''C''. So after several repetitions of the procedure, eventually we'll obtain a curve of genus 0, i.e. a rational curve. The existence and the properties of deformations of ''C'' require arguments from deformation theory and a reduction to [[positive characteristic]].\n\n===Arithmetic deformations===\nOne of the major applications of deformation theory is in arithmetic. It can be used to answer the following question: if we have a variety <math>X/\\mathbb{F}_p</math>, what are the possible extensions <math>\\mathfrak{X}/\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>? If our variety is a curve, then the vanishing <math>H^2</math> implies that every deformation induces a variety over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>; that is, if we have a smooth curve\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nand a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2))\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthen we can always extend it to a diagram of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_3 & \\to \\cdots \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow &  \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2)) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^3)) & \\to \\cdots\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\nThis implies that we can construct a [[formal scheme]] <math>\\mathfrak{X} = \\operatorname{Spet}(\\mathfrak{X}_\\bullet)</math> giving a curve over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.\n=== Deformations of abelian schemes ===\n\nThe [[Serre\u2013Tate theorem]] asserts, roughly speaking, that the deformations of [[abelian variety|abelian scheme]] ''A'' is controlled by deformations of the [[p-divisible group|''p''-divisible group]] <math>A[p^\\infty]</math> consisting of its ''p''-power torsion points.\n\n=== Galois deformations ===\nAnother application of deformation theory is with Galois deformations. It allows us to answer the question: If we have a Galois representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_p)</math>\nhow can we extend it to a representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z}_p) \\text{?}</math>\n\n==Relationship to string theory==\nThe so-called [[Deligne conjecture]] arising in the context of algebras (and [[Hochschild cohomology]]) stimulated much interest in deformation theory in relation to [[string theory]] (roughly speaking, to formalise the idea that a string theory can be regarded as a deformation of a point-particle theory). This is now accepted as proved, after some hitches with early announcements.

The infinitesimal conditions are therefore the result of applying the approach of [[differential calculus]] to solving a problem with [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. One might  think, in analogy, of a structure that is not completely rigid, and that deforms slightly to accommodate forces applied from the outside; this explains the name.\n\nSome characteristic phenomena are: the derivation of first-order equations by treating the \u03b5 quantities as having negligible squares; the possibility of ''isolated solutions'', in that varying a solution may not be possible, ''or'' does not bring anything new; and the question of whether the infinitesimal constraints actually 'integrate', so that their solution does provide small variations. In some form these considerations have a history of centuries in mathematics, but also in [[physics]] and [[engineering]]. For example, in the [[geometry of numbers]] a class of results called ''isolation theorems'' was recognised, with the topological interpretation of an ''open orbit'' (of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]) around a given solution. [[Perturbation theory]] also looks at deformations, in general of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s.\n\n==Deformations of complex manifolds==\nThe most salient deformation theory in mathematics has been that of [[complex manifold]]s and [[algebraic varieties]]. This was put on a firm basis by foundational work of [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]], after deformation techniques had received a great deal of more tentative application in the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. One expects, intuitively, that deformation theory of the first order should equate the [[Zariski tangent space]] with a [[moduli space]]. The phenomena turn out to be rather subtle, though, in the general case.\n\nIn the case of [[Riemann surface]]s, one can explain that the complex structure on the [[Riemann sphere]] is isolated (no moduli). For genus 1, an [[elliptic curve]] has a one-parameter family of complex structures, as shown in [[elliptic function]] theory. The general Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory identifies as the key to the deformation theory the [[sheaf cohomology]] group\n\n: <math> H^1(\\Theta) \\, </math>\n\nwhere \u0398 is (the sheaf of [[Germ (mathematics)|germs]] of sections of) the holomorphic [[tangent bundle]]. There is an obstruction in the ''H''<sup>2</sup> of the same sheaf; which is always zero in case of a curve, for general reasons of dimension. In the case of genus 0 the ''H''<sup>1</sup> vanishes, also. For genus 1 the dimension is the [[Hodge number]] ''h''<sup>1,0</sup> which is therefore 1.  It is known that all curves of genus one have equations of form ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''.  These obviously depend on two parameters, a and b, whereas the isomorphism classes of such curves have only one parameter.  Hence there must be an equation relating those a and b which describe isomorphic elliptic curves.  It turns out that curves for which ''b''<sup>2</sup>''a''<sup>\u22123</sup> has the same value, describe isomorphic curves.  I.e. varying a and b is one way to deform the structure of the curve ''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b'', but not all variations of ''a,b'' actually change the isomorphism class of the curve.\n\nOne can go further with the case of genus ''g'' > 1, using [[Serre duality]] to relate the  ''H''<sup>1</sup> to\n\n: <math> H^0(\\Omega^{[2]}) </math>\n\nwhere \u03a9 is the holomorphic [[cotangent bundle]] and the notation \u03a9<sup>[2]</sup> means the ''tensor square'' (''not'' the second [[exterior power]]). In other words, deformations are regulated by holomorphic [[quadratic differential]]s on a Riemann surface, again something known classically. The dimension of the moduli space, called [[Teichm\u00fcller space]] in this case, is computed as 3''g'' &minus; 3, by the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]].\n\nThese examples are the beginning of a theory applying to holomorphic families of complex manifolds, of any dimension. Further developments included: the extension by Spencer of the techniques to other structures of [[differential geometry]]; the assimilation of the Kodaira\u2013Spencer theory into the abstract algebraic geometry of [[Grothendieck]], with a consequent substantive clarification of earlier work; and deformation theory of other structures, such as algebras.\n\n==Functorial description==\nAnother method for formalizing deformation theory is using functors on the category <math>\\text{Art}_k</math> of local Artin algebras over a field. A '''pre-deformation functor''' is defined as a functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Art}_k \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nsuch that <math>F(k)</math> is a point. The idea is that we want to study the infinitesimal structure of some [[moduli space]] around a point where lying above that point is the space of interest. It is typically the case that it is easier to describe the functor for a moduli problem instead of finding an actual space. For example, if we want to consider the moduli-space of hypersurfaces of degree <math>d</math> in <math>\\mathbb{P}^n</math>, then we could consider the functor\n:<math>F: \\text{Sch} \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\nF(S) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\nS\n\\end{matrix}\n: \\text{ each fiber is a degree } d \\text{ hypersurface in }\\mathbb{P}^n\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nAlthough in general, it is more convenient/required to work with functors of [[groupoid|groupoids]] instead of sets. This is true for moduli of curves.\n\n===Technical remarks about infinitesimals===\nInfinitesimals have long been in use by mathematicians for non-rigorous arguments in calculus. The idea is that if we consider polynomials <math>F(x,\\varepsilon)</math> with an infinitesimal <math>\\varepsilon</math>, then only the first order terms really matter; that is, we can consider\n:<math> F(x,\\varepsilon) \\equiv f(x) + \\varepsilon g(x) + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nA simple application of this is that we can find the derivatives of [[monomial|monomials]] using infinitesimals:\n:<math> (x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + O(\\varepsilon^2)</math>\nthe <math>\\varepsilon</math> term contains the derivative of the monomial, demonstrating its use in calculus. We could also interpret this equation as the first two terms of the Taylor expansion of the monomial. Infinitesimals can be made rigorous using nilpotent elements in local artin algebras. In the ring <math>k[y]/(y^2)</math> we see that arguments with infinitesimals can work. This motivates the notation <math>k[\\varepsilon] = k[y]/(y^2)</math>, which is called the [[Ring of dual numbers]]. \n\nMoreover, if we want to consider higher-order terms of a taylor approximation then we could consider the artin algebras <math>k[y]/(y^k)</math>. For our monomial, suppose we want to write out the second order expansion, then\n:<math>(x+\\varepsilon)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2\\varepsilon + 3x\\varepsilon^2 + \\varepsilon^3</math>\nRecall that a Taylor expansion (at zero) can be written out as\n:<math>f(x) = f(0) + \\frac{f^{(1)}(x)}{1!} + \\frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!} + \\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!} + \\cdots </math>\nhence the previous two equations show that the second derivative of <math>x^3</math> is <math>6x</math>.\n\nIn general, since we want to consider arbitrary order Taylor expansions in any number of variables, we will consider the category of all local artin algebras over a field.\n\n===Motivation===\nTo motivative the definition of a pre-deformation functor, consider the projective hypersurface over a field\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nIf we want to consider an infinitesimal deformation of this space, then we could write down a Cartesian square\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{ \\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3][\\varepsilon]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4 + \\varepsilon  x_0^{a_0} x_1^{a_1} x_2^{a_2} x_3^{a_3}) } \\right) \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow\\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 4</math>. Then, the space on the right hand corner is one example of an infinitesimal deformation: the extra scheme theoretic structure of the nilpotent elements in <math>\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon])</math> (which is topologically a point) allows us to organize this infinitesimal data. Since we want to consider all possible expansions, we will let our predeformation functor be defined on objects as\n:<math>\nF(A) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\operatorname{Proj}\\left( \\dfrac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]}{(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)} \\right) & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right\\}\n</math>\nwhere <math>A</math> is a local Artin <math>k</math>-algebra.\n\n===Smooth pre-deformation functors===\nA pre-deformation functor is called '''smooth''' if for any surjection <math>A' \\to A</math> such that the square of any element in the kernel is zero, there is a surjection\n:<math>F(A') \\to F(A)</math>\nThis is motivated by the following question: given a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\ndoes there exist an extension of this cartesian diagram to the cartesian diagrams\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X} & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}' \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(k) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(A')\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthe name smooth comes from the lifting criterion of a smooth morphism of schemes.\n\n===Tangent space===\nRecall that the tangent space of a scheme <math>X</math> can be described as the <math>\\operatorname{Hom}</math>-set\n:<math>TX := \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\text{Sch}/k}(\\operatorname{Spec}(k[\\varepsilon]),X)</math>\n\nwhere the source is the ring of [[Dual number|dual numbers]]. Since we are considering the tangent space of a point of some moduli space, we can define the tangent space of our (pre)-deformation functor as\n:<math>T_F := F(k[\\varepsilon])</math>\n\n== Applications of deformation theory ==\n\n=== Dimension of moduli of curves ===\nOne of the first properties of the [[moduli of algebraic curves]] <math>\\mathcal{M}_g</math> can be deduced using elementary deformation theory. Its dimension can be computed as<blockquote><math>\\dim(\\mathcal{M}_g) = \\dim H^1(C,T_C)</math></blockquote>for an arbitrary smooth curve of genus <math>g</math> because the deformation space is the tangent space of the moduli space. Using [[Serre duality]] the tangent space is isomorphic to<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nH^1(C,T_C) &\\cong H^0(C,T_C^* \\otimes \\omega_C)^\\vee \\\\\n&\\cong H^0(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^\\vee\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>Hence the [[Riemann\u2013Roch theorem]] gives<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\nh^0(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) - h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) &= 2(2g - 2) - g - 1 \\\\\n &= 3g - 3\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>For curves of genus <math>g \\geq 2</math> the <math>h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) = 0</math> because<blockquote><math>h^1(C,\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2}) = h^0(C, (\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^{\\vee}\\otimes \\omega_C)\n</math></blockquote>the degree is<blockquote><math>\\begin{align}\n\\text{deg}((\\omega_C^{\\otimes 2})^\\vee \\otimes \\omega_C) &= 4 - 4g + 2g - 2  \\\\\n&= 2 - 2g\n\\end{align}</math></blockquote>and <math>h^0(L) = 0</math> for line bundles of negative degree. Therefore the dimension of the moduli space is <math>3g - 3</math>.\n\n=== Bend-and-break ===\nDeformation theory was famously applied in [[birational geometry]] by [[Shigefumi Mori]] to study the existence of [[rational curve]]s on [[algebraic variety|varieties]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Olivier|last = Debarre | author-link = Olivier Debarre|  title = Higher-Dimensional Algebraic Geometry|year = 2001 | publisher= Springer| chapter = 3. Bend-and-Break Lemmas | series = Universitext}}</ref> For a [[Fano variety]] of positive dimension Mori showed that there is a rational curve passing through every point. The method of the proof later became known as '''Mori's bend-and-break'''. The rough idea is to start with some curve ''C'' through a chosen point and keep deforming it until it breaks into several [[irreducible component|components]]. Replacing ''C'' by one of the components has the effect of decreasing either the   [[genus of a curve|genus]] or the [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] of ''C''. So after several repetitions of the procedure, eventually we'll obtain a curve of genus 0, i.e. a rational curve. The existence and the properties of deformations of ''C'' require arguments from deformation theory and a reduction to [[positive characteristic]].\n\n===Arithmetic deformations===\nOne of the major applications of deformation theory is in arithmetic. It can be used to answer the following question: if we have a variety <math>X/\\mathbb{F}_p</math>, what are the possible extensions <math>\\mathfrak{X}/\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>? If our variety is a curve, then the vanishing <math>H^2</math> implies that every deformation induces a variety over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>; that is, if we have a smooth curve\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nand a deformation\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2))\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\nthen we can always extend it to a diagram of the form\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nX & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_2 & \\to & \\mathfrak{X}_3 & \\to \\cdots \\\\\n\\downarrow & & \\downarrow & & \\downarrow &  \\\\\n\\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^2)) & \\to & \\operatorname{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^3)) & \\to \\cdots\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\nThis implies that we can construct a [[formal scheme]] <math>\\mathfrak{X} = \\operatorname{Spet}(\\mathfrak{X}_\\bullet)</math> giving a curve over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_p</math>.\n=== Deformations of abelian schemes ===\n\nThe [[Serre\u2013Tate theorem]] asserts, roughly speaking, that the deformations of [[abelian variety|abelian scheme]] ''A'' is controlled by deformations of the [[p-divisible group|''p''-divisible group]] <math>A[p^\\infty]</math> consisting of its ''p''-power torsion points.\n\n=== Galois deformations ===\nAnother application of deformation theory is with Galois deformations. It allows us to answer the question: If we have a Galois representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{F}_p)</math>\nhow can we extend it to a representation\n:<math>G \\to \\operatorname{GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z}_p) \\text{?}</math>\n\n==Relationship to string theory==\nThe so-called [[Deligne conjecture]] arising in the context of algebras (and [[Hochschild cohomology]]) stimulated much interest in deformation theory in relation to [[string theory]] (roughly speaking, to formalise the idea that a string theory can be regarded as a deformation of a point-particle theory). This is now accepted as proved, after some hitches with early announcements. [[Maxim Kontsevich]] is among those who have offered a generally accepted proof of this.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dual number]]\n*[[Exalcomm]]\n* [[Cotangent complex]]\n* [[Gromov\u2013Witten invariant]]\n* [[Moduli of algebraic curves]]\n* [[Degeneration (algebraic geometry)]]\n\n==References==\n===Pedagogical===\n*Palamodov, V.

Incumbent Democratic Senator [[Bill Nelson]] ran for re-election to a fourth term, but was very narrowly defeated by Republican Governor [[Rick Scott]], in one of the closest statewide elections in the state's history.\n\nThe results of the race were in dispute for 12 days following the election. The results showed that Nelson was narrowly trailing Scott, but the margin remained below 0.5%, triggering an [[Election recount|automatic recount]] under Florida law. A controversial recount ensued, with both campaigns claiming irregularities. Following the recount, Florida elections officials confirmed Scott's victory on November 18, 2018. Scott received 50.05% of the vote, while Nelson received 49.93%; the margin of victory was 10,033 votes out of 8.19 million votes cast. Both in terms of raw vote margin and by percentage of difference, this was the closest [[2018 United States Senate elections|Senate]] election in the [[2018 United States elections|2018 cycle]].
