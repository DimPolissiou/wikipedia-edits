It is the third<!-- Do NOT add \"and final\", that should be obvious for the third installment of a trilogy--> installment in the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]], the third film to be produced, and sixth film in the \"[[List of Star Wars films#Skywalker saga|Skywalker saga]]\".

Since the Emperor plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill the Emperor, effectively bringing an end to his hold over the galaxy. Meanwhile, [[Luke Skywalker]] struggles to bring his father [[Darth Vader]] back to the light side of [[the Force]].\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]], [[David Lynch]] and [[David Cronenberg]] were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow [[Industrial Light & Magic]] more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to {{Start date|1982|5}}. Strict secrecy surrounded the production.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, six years to the day of the release of the first film, receiving mostly positive reviews. It grossed $475 million worldwide, becoming the [[1983 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1983]]. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries in film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] are sent to crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace on [[Tatooine]] in a trade bargain made by [[Luke Skywalker]] to rescue [[Han Solo]]. Disguised as a [[bounty hunter]], [[Princess Leia]] infiltrates the palace under the pretense of collecting the bounty on [[Chewbacca]] and unfreezes Han, but is caught and enslaved. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by a [[rancor]]. After Luke kills the rancor, Jabba sentences him, Han, and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the [[Sarlacc]], a huge, [[carnivorous plant]]-like desert beast. Having hidden his new [[lightsaber]] inside {{nowrap|R2-D2}}, Luke frees himself and battles Jabba's guards while Leia uses her chains to strangle Jabba to death. As the others rendezvous with the [[Rebel Alliance]], Luke returns to [[Dagobah]] to complete his training with [[Yoda]], whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that [[Darth Vader]], once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]]. The [[Force ghost]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training <!--becoming a \"full-fledged Jedi Knight\" per A Guide to the Star Wars Universe--> and defeat the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]].\n\nThe Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a [[second Death Star]] under the supervision of [[Palpatine|the Emperor]] himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of [[Ewok]]s and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tries to convince his father to reject the dark side of the Force, to no avail.\n\nVader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intending to turn him to the dark side. The Emperor reveals that the Imperial forces are prepared for a Rebel assault on the shield generator and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On the forest moon of Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allow the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and [[Admiral Ackbar]] lead the rebel assault on the second Death Star only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waits for them. \n\nThe Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive superlaser, destroying one of the Rebel starships. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in another lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the dark side. Enraged, Luke severs Vader's [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi like his father before him. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with [[Force lightning]]. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft to his death<!-- Lucas, McDiarmid, and The Rise of Skywalker's opening crawl all confirm he died. --> but is mortally electrocuted in the process. At his father's last request, Luke removes Vader's mask, and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker dies in his son's arms.\n\nAfter the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''Executor'', Lando and [[X-wing fighter]] pilot [[Wedge Antilles]] destroy the Death Star's main reactor. As the ''Falcon'' escapes the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. On the Forest Moon of Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and she and Han kiss. Luke cremates his father's body on a [[pyre]] before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels and the galaxy celebrate the fall of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin watching over him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]], one of the last living [[Jedi]] Knights, trained by Obi-Wan and Yoda; Leia's twin brother, who is also a skilled [[X-wing fighter]] pilot allied with the Rebellion.\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]], a rogue smuggler aiding the Rebellion against the Empire, Luke\u2019s friend, and Leia's love interest.\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Leia Organa]], the former princess of the destroyed planet [[Alderaan]], who is part of the Rebellion; Luke's twin sister, and Han's love interest.\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Lando Calrissian]], the former Baron Administrator of Cloud City and one of Han's friends who aids the Rebellion.\n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]], a humanoid protocol droid in the service of the Rebellion.\n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]], a [[Wookiee]] who is Han's longtime friend and part of the Rebellion.\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as [[R2-D2]], an astromech droid, friend of Luke, and longtime companion of C-3PO.

Harrison, unlike Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill signed only a two picture contract. That is why he was frozen in carbonite in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. When I suggested to George we should bring him back, I distinctly remember him saying that Harrison would never return. I said what if I convinced him to return. George simply replied that we would then write him in to ''Jedi''. I had just recently negotiated his deal for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with Phil Gersh of the Gersh Agency. I called Phil who said he would speak with Harrison. When I called back again, Phil was on vacation. David, his son, took the call and we negotiated Harrison's deal.

Anthony Daniels returned as C-3PO, but [[Mark Hamill]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] did not reprise their roles as they had for the first two radio dramas. They were replaced by newcomer Joshua Fardon as [[Luke Skywalker]] and character actor [[Arye Gross]] as [[Lando Calrissian]]. [[John Lithgow]] voiced Yoda, whose voice actor in the films has always been [[Frank Oz]]. Bernard Behrens returned as [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Brock Peters]] reprised his role as [[Darth Vader]]. Veteran character actor [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] played [[Boba Fett]]. [[Edward Asner]] also guest-starred speaking only in grunts as the voice of Jabba the Hutt. The radio drama had a running time of three hours.<ref>{{cite web |work=HighBridge Audio |title=Return of the Jedi Produced by NPR |url=http://www.highbridgeaudio.com/returnofjedi.html |accessdate=March 6, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105043650/http://www.highbridgeaudio.com/returnofjedi.html| archive-date=November 5, 2006| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPrincipal production of the show was completed on February 11, 1996.

Since the Emperor plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill the Emperor, effectively bringing an end to his hold over the galaxy. Meanwhile, [[Luke Skywalker]] struggles to bring his father [[Darth Vader]] back to the light side of [[the Force]].\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]], [[David Lynch]] and [[David Cronenberg]] were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow [[Industrial Light & Magic]] more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to {{Start date|1982|5}}. Strict secrecy surrounded the production.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, six years to the day of the release of the first film, receiving mostly positive reviews. It grossed $475 million worldwide, becoming the [[1983 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1983]]. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries in film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] are sent to crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace on [[Tatooine]] in a trade bargain made by [[Luke Skywalker]] to rescue [[Han Solo]]. Disguised as a [[bounty hunter]], [[Princess Leia]] infiltrates the palace under the pretense of collecting the bounty on [[Chewbacca]] and unfreezes Han, but is caught and enslaved. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by a [[rancor]]. After Luke kills the rancor, Jabba sentences him, Han, and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the [[Sarlacc]], a huge, [[carnivorous plant]]-like desert beast. Having hidden his new [[lightsaber]] inside {{nowrap|R2-D2}}, Luke frees himself and battles Jabba's guards while Leia uses her chains to strangle Jabba to death. As the others rendezvous with the [[Rebel Alliance]], Luke returns to [[Dagobah]] to complete his training with [[Yoda]], whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that [[Darth Vader]], once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]]. The [[Force ghost]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training <!--becoming a \"full-fledged Jedi Knight\" per A Guide to the Star Wars Universe--> and defeat the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]].\n\nThe Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a [[second Death Star]] under the supervision of [[Palpatine|the Emperor]] himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of [[Ewok]]s and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tries to convince his father to reject the dark side of the Force, to no avail.\n\nVader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intending to turn him to the dark side. The Emperor reveals that the Imperial forces are prepared for a Rebel assault on the shield generator and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On the forest moon of Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allow the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and [[Admiral Ackbar]] lead the rebel assault on the second Death Star only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waits for them. \n\nThe Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive superlaser, destroying one of the Rebel starships. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in another lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the dark side. Enraged, Luke severs Vader's [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi like his father before him. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with [[Force lightning]]. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft to his death<!-- Lucas, McDiarmid, and The Rise of Skywalker's opening crawl all confirm he died. --> but is mortally electrocuted in the process. At his father's last request, Luke removes Vader's mask, and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker dies in his son's arms.\n\nAfter the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''Executor'', Lando and [[X-wing fighter]] pilot [[Wedge Antilles]] destroy the Death Star's main reactor. As the ''Falcon'' escapes the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. On the Forest Moon of Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and she and Han kiss. Luke cremates his father's body on a [[pyre]] before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels and the galaxy celebrate the fall of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin watching over him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]], one of the last living [[Jedi]] Knights, trained by Obi-Wan and Yoda; Leia's twin brother, who is also a skilled [[X-wing fighter]] pilot allied with the Rebellion.\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]], a rogue smuggler aiding the Rebellion against the Empire, Luke\u2019s friend, and Leia's love interest.\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Leia Organa]], the former princess of the destroyed planet [[Alderaan]], who is part of the Rebellion; Luke's twin sister, and Han's love interest.\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Lando Calrissian]], the former Baron Administrator of Cloud City and one of Han's friends who aids the Rebellion.\n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]], a humanoid protocol droid in the service of the Rebellion.\n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]], a [[Wookiee]] who is Han's longtime friend and part of the Rebellion.\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as [[R2-D2]], an astromech droid, friend of Luke, and longtime companion of C-3PO.

Unlike the other stars of the first film, Ford had not contracted to do two sequels, and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' had made him an even bigger star. ''Return of the Jedi'' producer [[Howard Kazanjian]] (who also produced ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'') convinced Ford to return: \n<blockquote>I played a very important part in bringing Harrison back for ''Return of the Jedi.'' Harrison, unlike Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill signed only a two picture contract. That is why he was frozen in carbonite in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. When I suggested to George we should bring him back, I distinctly remember him saying that Harrison would never return. I said what if I convinced him to return. George simply replied that we would then write him in to ''Jedi''. I had just recently negotiated his deal for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with Phil Gersh of the Gersh Agency. I called Phil who said he would speak with Harrison. When I called back again, Phil was on vacation. David, his son, took the call and we negotiated Harrison's deal. When Phil returned to the office several weeks later he called me back and said I had taken advantage of his son in the negotiations. I had not.

Producer [[Howard Kazanjian]] estimated that using ILM (owned wholly by Lucasfilm) for special effects saved the production approximately $18 million.<ref name=\"ProdDir1\"/> However, the fact that Lucasfilm was a non-union company made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' had been big hits.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/> The project was given the [[working title]] ''Blue Harvest'' with a tagline of \"Horror Beyond Imagination.\" This disguised what the production crew was really filming from fans and the press, and also prevented [[price gouging]] by service providers.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/>\n\nThe first stage of production started with 78 days at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in England,<ref name=\"ProdDir4\"/> where the film occupied all nine stages.

In the same year, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of ''Return of the Jedi'' along with the other two films in the trilogy. The set was released with the new artwork mirroring the first DVD release of the film.

The developer initially planned to restore the buildings and open a co-ed school.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Shortly after the production of Mr Headmistress, an ABC made-for-TV movie was made where various outdoor improvements were made to the building as well as restoration of ground work surrounding the structure. Nearly one month after production of the film, Royal Cambridge defaulted on the mortgage payments for the property. This caused the building to be for sale once again.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> A London development company led by Brian Squires purchased the College and developed plans to build a retirement community on the campus in 1998. Over the next 4 years he spent time preparing the site and arranging financing. At this point the school began to see a wave of vandalism due to general un-occupancy. By 2003 Squires applied for a demolition permit (suggested by the mayor and recorded) due to the fact that the Mayor at the time said the building could not be saved and the land is better suited for redevelopment. The Mayor commented the people of St.Thomas would eventually understand if the building was demolished.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Brian Squires  was devastated that the mayor would say such a thing after committing to help save it during the November elections. Brian Squires quickly filed for a demolition permit to prove the mayor was wrong in saying the people of St.Thomas would not be upset if such an  action was able to take place.. At the same time Brian Squires hired a structural engineer to confirm that it could be saved. The Mayors office was swamped with calls proving Brian Squires was right in saying the people of St.Thomas will care and they also want the building saved. This demolition permit was swiftly denied by the local municipality because of the structural report provided by Brian Squires.A demolition permit was never issued and the building was saved. Brian Squires continued to try and save the building putting all his resources into it. Shortly after that,  Brian Squires handed over control of the project to the Zubick family because of lack of interest from the family, municipality and bankers. The building was gutted; asbestos, general fixtures and walls were all removed leaving little but a timber frame inside the building. The ghostly innards were used for the film Silent Hill in 2005. Once again a demolition permit was issued for Alma college after more attempts to sell the building were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In 2006 the Municipal Heritage Committee recommended that the demolition permit be denied, that city council prescribe minimum standards for maintenance of the building under section 35.3 of the Ontario Heritage Act. They also recommended that the city seek further financial assistance from the provincial Ministry of Heritage. This report would subsequently be buried by the ministry of culture only to reappear under the freedom of information act two years later and after the buildings eventual demise.<ref>citation in next section</ref> the city denied the demolition permit and the building was placed on the National top ten endangered historic sites in Canada.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nBy 2006 an offer was made by the Alma College foundation, a group of alumnae, university academics and community leaders in the hopes of reopening as a liberal arts college. Their offer was 750,000 dollars but was rejected by the Zubick family. With the building being allowed to fall into further disrepair the city council developed new property standards by laws in order to establish minimum standards. This new bylaw was protested and ruled to be too specific in wording and was overturned by the Ontario Supreme Court{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. The city eventually agreed to offer a demolition permit on the condition that the front drive way be preserved and the front fa\u00e7ade,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> a sentiment that is still considered valid even though today the building was destroyed. In early 2008 The Ontario Municipal Board approved the demolition of Alma College. This would set off a rush to protect the building by many local activists. On May 28, 2008 a petition was set to be passed around at the Ontario Legislature to prevent the demolition of the building. In addition a rally to save the college was also planned that morning at the Main building of the school.\n\n==Fire and grounds destruction (2008\u2013present) ==\n[[Image:Alma building fire 1.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Fire at Alma College in May 2008.

Local response was swift to place blame on Ontario minister of Culture, [[Aileen Carroll]] at the time for not working hard enough to protect the building from demolition.<ref name=\"lfpress.ca\" /> Documentation released through the Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act a month after the fire. This indicated a report from the Ontario Heritage Trust board addressed to the Ministry of Culture. The report outlined that the ministry should ensure that should Alma fall under the threat of demolition or alteration that would compromise the heritage character, integrity and attributes of the property, that it would be appropriate for the minister to designate Alma College, using the powers prescribed under the Ontario heritage Act, to protect the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.builtheritagenews.ca/newsletter_archive/56.html#13 |title=St. Thomas Times: Ontario Heritage Trust Report on Alma |first=Ian |last=McCallum |publisher=Builtheritagenews.ca |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> At the time of the fire the building was completely open and exposed to numerous fire hazards.

The developer initially planned to restore the buildings and open a co-ed school.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Shortly after the production of Mr Headmistress, an ABC made-for-TV movie was made where various outdoor improvements were made to the building as well as restoration of ground work surrounding the structure. Nearly one month after production of the film, Royal Cambridge defaulted on the mortgage payments for the property. This caused the building to be for sale once again.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> A London development company led by Brian Squires purchased the College and developed plans to build a retirement community on the campus in 1998. Over the next 4 years he spent time preparing the site and arranging financing. At this point the school began to see a wave of vandalism due to general un-occupancy. By 2003 Squires applied for a demolition permit (suggested by the mayor and recorded) due to the fact that the Mayor at the time said the building could not be saved and the land is better suited for redevelopment. The Mayor commented the people of St.Thomas would eventually understand if the building was demolished.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> Brian Squires  was devastated that the mayor would say such a thing after committing to help save it during the November elections. Brian Squires quickly filed for a demolition permit to prove the mayor was wrong in saying the people of St.Thomas would not be upset if such an  action was able to take place.. At the same time Brian Squires hired a structural engineer to confirm that it could be saved. The Mayors office was swamped with calls proving Brian Squires was right in saying the people of St.Thomas will care and they also want the building saved. This demolition permit was swiftly denied by the local municipality because of the structural report provided by Brian Squires.A demolition permit was never issued and the building was saved. Brian Squires continued to try and save the building putting all his resources into it. Shortly after that,  Brian Squires handed over control of the project to the Zubick family because of lack of interest from the family, municipality and bankers. The building was gutted; asbestos, general fixtures and walls were all removed leaving little but a timber frame inside the building. The ghostly innards were used for the film Silent Hill in 2005. Once again a demolition permit was issued for Alma college after more attempts to sell the building were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In 2006 the Municipal Heritage Committee recommended that the demolition permit be denied, that city council prescribe minimum standards for maintenance of the building under section 35.3 of the Ontario Heritage Act. They also recommended that the city seek further financial assistance from the provincial Ministry of Heritage. This report would subsequently be buried by the ministry of culture only to reappear under the freedom of information act two years later and after the buildings eventual demise.<ref>citation in next section</ref> the city denied the demolition permit and the building was placed on the National top ten endangered historic sites in Canada.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nBy 2006 an offer was made by the Alma College foundation, a group of alumnae, university academics and community leaders in the hopes of reopening as a liberal arts college. Their offer was 750,000 dollars but was rejected by the Zubick family. With the building being allowed to fall into further disrepair the city council developed new property standards by laws in order to establish minimum standards. This new bylaw was protested and ruled to be too specific in wording and was overturned by the Ontario Supreme Court{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. The city eventually agreed to offer a demolition permit on the condition that the front drive way be preserved and the front fa\u00e7ade,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> a sentiment that is still considered valid even though today the building was destroyed. In early 2008 The Ontario Municipal Board approved the demolition of Alma College. This would set off a rush to protect the building by many local activists. On May 28, 2008 a petition was set to be passed around at the Ontario Legislature to prevent the demolition of the building. In addition a rally to save the college was also planned that morning at the Main building of the school.\n\n==Fire and grounds destruction (2008\u2013present) ==\n[[Image:Alma building fire 1.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Fire at Alma College in May 2008.

This indicated a report from the Ontario Heritage Trust board addressed to the Ministry of Culture.

It is located at the corner of [[Fourth Avenue (Brooklyn)|Fourth Avenue]] and Union Street in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], serving the communities of [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]], [[Gowanus, Brooklyn|Gowanus]] and [[Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn|Carroll Gardens]]. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times. The [[D (New York City Subway service)|D]] and [[N (New York City Subway service)|N]] trains also stop here during late nights, and some rush-hour [[W (New York City Subway service)|W]] trains stop here in the peak direction.\n\nThe Union Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905. Construction on the segment of the line that includes Union Street started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in September 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in 1970.

They complained about the national industry's declining share of Brazilian GDP.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn response to these concerns, Rousseff created the New Economic Matrix in an attempt to help the Brazilian industry become more competitive internationally. These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies which ultimately failed to stimulate industry.

These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies which ultimately failed to stimulate industry.

Later, the 1989-1992 crisis lasted 11 trimesters and the recovery time was the same: seven trimesters. This crisis, however, had a lower intensity, with an accumulated decrease in the GDP of 7.7%.<ref name=\"book\" />\n\nIn turn, the GDP after the 2014 crisis will only reach its pre-crisis level in 2022, according to an optimistic estimate, with 20 trimesters of recovery in total.
