The film is set in Los Angeles and stars [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[James Deen]], [[Nolan Gerard Funk|Nolan Funk]], [[Amanda Brooks]], and [[Gus Van Sant]]. It received a [[limited release]] on August 2, 2013 at the [[IFC Center]] in New York City, the [[Bell Lightbox]] in Toronto, and on [[video on demand]] platforms.<ref name = \"hr\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|section|date = November 2019}}\nChristian ([[James Deen]]) is a wealthy young man with ties to Los Angeles' independent film industry, financing low budget horror films. At the start of the film, he is having dinner with his girlfriend Tara ([[Lindsay Lohan]]) and his personal assistant Gina ([[Amanda Brooks]]) and her boyfriend Ryan ([[Nolan Gerard Funk|Nolan Funk]]). Christian recently got Ryan work as a lead in a film he is financing, a feat achieved by threatening to revoke funding for the project if Ryan was not hired. Christian also reveals that he and Tara have an open relationship, as he discusses using dating apps to find partners for the two to hook up with for group sex. Ryan asks if Christian ever gets jealous, but Christian claims that he doesn't, as he then outs Tara as bisexual. He also says that he trusts Tara never to fall in love with anyone he brings into their bed for casual sex. Ryan considers Christian and Tara's casual notions towards sex scandalous but refuses to condemn the two. \n\nWhen Christian and Tara arrive home, to prepare for arrival of their latest dating app selected romantic partner, Christian derides Ryan as a loser and that Gina could do much better in a boyfriend. Tara meanwhile is unhappy that Christian outed her as a bisexual, which leads her to demand Christian tell her about what he tells his shrink as quid pro quo. Christian refuses and the argument ends abruptly when the man from the dating app arrives. Christian orders him to get naked, recording the stripping on his phone and then places it on the couch to record the young man masturbating, while he watches Christian perform oral sex on Tara. Meanwhile, at their apartment, Ryan accuses Gina of wanting to have a four-way with Tara and Christian while sending a text on his phone to an unknown party for a meeting the next day. Gina denies wanting to have sex with Tara or her boss, and points out that Tara did not even talk to her at work until she found out about the movie project her friend was working on, which led to the two becoming friends and getting Christian to finance the film. \n\nThe text Ryan sent goes to Tara, who meets with him the next day. Through their conversation, it is revealed that the two are former lovers and that Ryan's naive behavior at dinner was an act. The two were struggling actors three years ago and madly in love; however, Tara grew tired of living hand to mouth and dumped Ryan. Since then, Tara has dated a string of wealthy men as she sacrificed her acting career and real love in favor of becoming a kept woman. Tara chides Ryan for texting her, as Christian has a habit of going through her phone's texts and call log to monitor her activities. Ryan, still bitter over their break-up, accuses Tara of degrading herself for a life of luxury and accuses Christian of forcing Tara to degrade herself sexually. Ryan presses Tara on the details of the polygamous lifestyle Christian has the two living, while Tara reminds Ryan that he is in a relationship with Gina and that she helped get the film financed (and Ryan the role as the lead) as a favor to her ex-boyfriend. Tara demands they not see each other again. \n\nChristian visits an actress named Cynthia for casual sex but the encounter nearly ends when he starts choking her. Christian confides that he thinks Tara is cheating on him, and that she has a mystery lunch date planned. As they get dressed, Christian is forced out the house by an upset Cynthia. Tara meanwhile has lunch with Gina, who informs her that she will not be accompanying her to New Mexico, where Ryan's film is being shot. Gina then gets a call from Christian, who is then told of Tara's decision to stay in Los Angeles. \n\nThe film then cuts to Ryan, who is seen doing a photoshoot in swim trunks and desperately looking to get extra hours tending bar in order to make money. When he talks to the manager about getting extra hours, the manager makes a pass at him before Ryan gets a text, which he uses as an excuse to leave his amorous boss. The text was sent by Tara, who has changed her mind about not wanting to see Ryan. Unfortunately Christian has followed Tara to the house where they are having sex. Christian goes straight to Gina's friend John, (who is the boyfriend of the film's producer), who is in charge of the CGI SFXs for the film. Christian orders him to pull a \"prank\" on Ryan: to call him and tell him that his boyfriend wants to fire him but that, if he sleeps with John, he would make sure that Ryan was not fired from the film. Christian offers to take the blame if the prank goes wrong, but threatens to fire his boyfriend if he refuses to go along with the \"prank\". \n\nReturning home, Christian grills Tara on her activities that afternoon and the subject of Gina and Ryan's attractiveness. Christian asks Tara if she would have sex with Ryan if she could. Tara denies this as well as previously knowing Ryan. Meanwhile, Ryan discovers Christian's daily schedule on Gina's computer, noticing that Christian has regular \"yoga sessions\" with Cynthia, who Ryan admits to knowing from acting school. Ryan gets a text to meet with John and propositions him per Christian's demand. Ryan shocks John by asking him if he wants to have sex then and there, pulling out his penis so John could perform oral sex on him then and there if he desires to. The film then cuts to Ryan leaving the building, with it ambiguous if they had sex or not. \n\nTara starts to receive texts, anonymously asking her about her relationship with Ryan and Christian. Tara announces her intention to go see a movie with a friend named Amber. Before she leaves, Tara takes a shower and Christian steals her phone while she is in the bathroom so he can find out what Tara has been up to. Before she leaves, Christian announces he intends to have a \"visitor\" come over later for sex. Tara visits Cynthia instead, who is revealed to have been Christian's girlfriend prior to his meeting Tara. Cynthia tells Tara that she needs to leave Christian, pointing out his controlling nature and twisted sexual desires. Cynthia reveals that she sent the texts to Tara and the event that led to her splitting with Christian. Christian drugged her and invited a group of strangers into their house to gangrape her and videotaped the entire thing. When she found out, he brutally assaulted her, sending her to the hospital; at which point Christian threatened to leak the gang rape online if she told anyone about it. Tara rejects Cynthia's warnings and implies she plans to \"hurt\" Christian. \n\nChristian has a friend hack into Ryan and Tara's Facebook pages and retrieve the texts the two sent from their phones. He then has his friend hack into Ryan's bank account to steal his savings, but pauses for a moment after noticing a photo on Ryan's Facebook page. Tara returns home, at which point she admits to lying to Christian and that she went to visit Cynthia instead. Christian acknowledges dating Cynthia but denies beating her or arranging her to be gang raped. Suddenly Christian's phone rings; his dating app friend is about to arrive. Christian offers to cancel but Tara insists they go through with it. The couple engages in an orgy with a couple who arrived at the house. During the orgy, the male guest forces himself onto Christian, which Tara eggs on as the male guest gives Christian a blow job while Tara watches. \n\nMeanwhile, it is revealed that Cynthia was put up to warning Tara by Ryan, with it implied that the two are also former lovers. While wandering through a record/movie store, Ryan realizes he is being stalked. Attacking the man following him, Ryan accuses him of working for Christian (which he denies) and destroys his phone. When Ryan attempts to get money out of his bank account, he finds himself broke and realizes Christian hacked his back account. The next morning, Tara calls Ryan while Christian is asleep but no one answers. When she tries to steal Christian's phone to make her call, she finds her cellphone with his. Christian wakes up and violently assaults Tara, as he reveals that he knows all about her and Ryan. \n\nGina, meanwhile, finds Ryan drinking and ask if anything is wrong. Ryan reveals that he has been through Gina's computer finding out about Christian (including his seeing a therapist) and then reveals the movie is not going to get made. More so, Ryan reveals that he has been sleeping with Tara behind Ryan and Gina's back. Ryan also reveals that the affair has been going on longer than previously implied; that they had been sleeping with each other for a month, ever since Ryan auditioned for the lead in the film. Gina dumps Ryan, who is unapologetic with his obsession with Tara and then announces she will do whatever it takes to keep Christian from killing the film and have Ryan fired and banned from the set. \n\nAt his therapist, Christian is focused solely on complaints over how Tara manipulated him into having homosexual relations the night before. Christian rants about his deep-seated need for control over everything in his life, especially Tara, and how his interactions with his therapist are not the \"real\" Christian. It's revealed that Christian's therapy sessions with Doctor Campbell ([[Gus Van Sant|Gus Van Saint]]) are not voluntary; that per the terms of the trust fund that Christian lives off of, he must see Doctor Campbell on a regular basis and not miss a single appointment, lest his father dissolve the trust fund and leave Christian financially destitute. \n\nThe film then cuts to Christian and Ryan, both in their cars driving through downtown Los Angeles as Christian leaves a message on Ryan's voicemail. Christian mocks Ryan's failed acting career and reveals the detailed information he has managed to obtain about Ryan's life and threatens him to leave town. Christian then forces his way into Cynthia's house, where he accuses Cynthia of lying about being drugged and gangraped. Christian also implies that Cynthia is only aiding Ryan in his pursuit of Tara, in order to break up Tara and Christian so she could get Christian back. Cynthia denies Christian's conspiracy theory, but is then promptly murdered by Christian with a knife he brought with him. After killing her, Christian picks up Cynthia's phone as Ryan calls her to warn her of Christian's threatening call. Christian mockingly accuses Ryan of causing Cynthia's murder as he rushes to her home, to find her dead body. Returning home, Christian finds Tara packed up and ready to leave Christian. Christian apologizes for brutalizing her and agrees to let her leave their relationship, on two conditions: 1. She must give him an alibi for his murder of Cynthia and 2. She must never have any contact with Ryan; if she refuses, he will murder Ryan and use his family's wealth and connections to get away with the crime. Tara agrees and is allowed to leave. \n\nThe film ends with a flash forward to several months in the future. Tara is living in Dubai and has a new boyfriend, and has lunch with a friend. The friend asks Tara about Gina's film and her involvement, as well as her relationship with Christian. Tara proclaims that she left the film project when she and Christian broke up. The friend brings up Cynthia's death and how no one was ever arrested for the murder, though it's implied by the friend that Christian planted the murder weapon in Gina's car in a failed attempt to frame her for the crime. Tara continues to feign that her relationship with Christian is still on good terms, as the unnamed friend leaves to use the restroom. Once alone, the friend calls someone on her cell phone and reports that Tara is doing well but clearly lying about her being friends with Christian as well as being happy with her life. The final scene shows who the unnamed friend is talking to; Ryan, who's all alone in an empty living room, still madly in love with Tara.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Tara\n* [[James Deen]] as Christian\n* [[Nolan Gerard Funk|Nolan Funk]] as Ryan\n* [[Amanda Brooks]] as Gina\n* Tenille Houston as Cynthia Grey\n* [[Gus Van Sant]] as Dr. Campbell\n* [[Danny Wylde|Chris Zeischegg]] as Reid\n* Victor of Aquitaine as Randall\n* [[Lauren Schacher]] as Caitlin\n* [[Jim Boeven]] as Jon\n* Philip Pavel as Erik\n\n==Development==\n\n===Production and marketing===\n[[Braxton Pope]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], and [[Paul Schrader]] were originally involved in a film project, ''Bait''.

A sex scene at the beginning of the film, which featured the characters of Tara, Christian and Reid (Danny Wylde), had to have cuts made to meet the content standards of [[iTunes]]. Thus the shots of Reid indulging in masturbation had to go, since they were unsimulated, unlike the other sexual content shown in the film.

The film is set in Los Angeles and stars [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[James Deen]], [[Nolan Gerard Funk|Nolan Funk]], [[Amanda Brooks]], and [[Gus Van Sant]]. It received a [[limited release]] on August 2, 2013 at the [[IFC Center]] in New York City, the [[Bell Lightbox]] in Toronto, and on [[video on demand]] platforms.<ref name = \"hr\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|section|date = November 2019}}\nChristian ([[James Deen]]) is a wealthy young man with ties to Los Angeles' independent film industry, financing low budget horror films. At the start of the film, he is having dinner with his girlfriend Tara ([[Lindsay Lohan]]) and his personal assistant Gina ([[Amanda Brooks]]) and her boyfriend Ryan ([[Nolan Gerard Funk|Nolan Funk]]). Christian recently got Ryan work as a lead in a film he is financing, a feat achieved by threatening to revoke funding for the project if Ryan was not hired. Christian also reveals that he and Tara have an open relationship, as he discusses using dating apps to find partners for the two to hook up with for group sex. Ryan asks if Christian ever gets jealous, but Christian claims that he doesn't, as he then outs Tara as bisexual. He also says that he trusts Tara never to fall in love with anyone he brings into their bed for casual sex. Ryan considers Christian and Tara's casual notions towards sex scandalous but refuses to condemn the two. \n\nWhen Christian and Tara arrive home, to prepare for arrival of their latest dating app selected romantic partner, Christian derides Ryan as a loser and that Gina could do much better in a boyfriend. Tara meanwhile is unhappy that Christian outed her as a bisexual, which leads her to demand Christian tell her about what he tells his shrink as quid pro quo. Christian refuses and the argument ends abruptly when the man from the dating app arrives. Christian orders him to get naked, recording the stripping on his phone and then places it on the couch to record the young man masturbating, while he watches Christian perform oral sex on Tara. Meanwhile, at their apartment, Ryan accuses Gina of wanting to have a four-way with Tara and Christian while sending a text on his phone to an unknown party for a meeting the next day. Gina denies wanting to have sex with Tara or her boss, and points out that Tara did not even talk to her at work until she found out about the movie project her friend was working on, which led to the two becoming friends and getting Christian to finance the film. \n\nThe text Ryan sent goes to Tara, who meets with him the next day. Through their conversation, it is revealed that the two are former lovers and that Ryan's naive behavior at dinner was an act. The two were struggling actors three years ago and madly in love; however, Tara grew tired of living hand to mouth and dumped Ryan. Since then, Tara has dated a string of wealthy men as she sacrificed her acting career and real love in favor of becoming a kept woman. Tara chides Ryan for texting her, as Christian has a habit of going through her phone's texts and call log to monitor her activities. Ryan, still bitter over their break-up, accuses Tara of degrading herself for a life of luxury and accuses Christian of forcing Tara to degrade herself sexually. Ryan presses Tara on the details of the polygamous lifestyle Christian has the two living, while Tara reminds Ryan that he is in a relationship with Gina and that she helped get the film financed (and Ryan the role as the lead) as a favor to her ex-boyfriend. Tara demands they not see each other again. \n\nChristian visits an actress named Cynthia for casual sex but the encounter nearly ends when he starts choking her. Christian confides that he thinks Tara is cheating on him, and that she has a mystery lunch date planned. As they get dressed, Christian is forced out the house by an upset Cynthia. Tara meanwhile has lunch with Gina, who informs her that she will not be accompanying her to New Mexico, where Ryan's film is being shot. Gina then gets a call from Christian, who is then told of Tara's decision to stay in Los Angeles. \n\nThe film then cuts to Ryan, who is seen doing a photoshoot in swim trunks and desperately looking to get extra hours tending bar in order to make money. When he talks to the manager about getting extra hours, the manager makes a pass at him before Ryan gets a text, which he uses as an excuse to leave his amorous boss. The text was sent by Tara, who has changed her mind about not wanting to see Ryan. Unfortunately Christian has followed Tara to the house where they are having sex. Christian goes straight to Gina's friend John, (who is the boyfriend of the film's producer), who is in charge of the CGI SFXs for the film. Christian orders him to pull a \"prank\" on Ryan: to call him and tell him that his boyfriend wants to fire him but that, if he sleeps with John, he would make sure that Ryan was not fired from the film. Christian offers to take the blame if the prank goes wrong, but threatens to fire his boyfriend if he refuses to go along with the \"prank\". \n\nReturning home, Christian grills Tara on her activities that afternoon and the subject of Gina and Ryan's attractiveness. Christian asks Tara if she would have sex with Ryan if she could. Tara denies this as well as previously knowing Ryan. Meanwhile, Ryan discovers Christian's daily schedule on Gina's computer, noticing that Christian has regular \"yoga sessions\" with Cynthia, who Ryan admits to knowing from acting school. Ryan gets a text to meet with John and propositions him per Christian's demand. Ryan shocks John by asking him if he wants to have sex then and there, pulling out his penis so John could perform oral sex on him then and there if he desires to. The film then cuts to Ryan leaving the building, with it ambiguous if they had sex or not. \n\nTara starts to receive texts, anonymously asking her about her relationship with Ryan and Christian. Tara announces her intention to go see a movie with a friend named Amber. Before she leaves, Tara takes a shower and Christian steals her phone while she is in the bathroom so he can find out what Tara has been up to. Before she leaves, Christian announces he intends to have a \"visitor\" come over later for sex. Tara visits Cynthia instead, who is revealed to have been Christian's girlfriend prior to his meeting Tara. Cynthia tells Tara that she needs to leave Christian, pointing out his controlling nature and twisted sexual desires. Cynthia reveals that she sent the texts to Tara and the event that led to her splitting with Christian. Christian drugged her and invited a group of strangers into their house to gangrape her and videotaped the entire thing. When she found out, he brutally assaulted her, sending her to the hospital; at which point Christian threatened to leak the gang rape online if she told anyone about it. Tara rejects Cynthia's warnings and implies she plans to \"hurt\" Christian. \n\nChristian has a friend hack into Ryan and Tara's Facebook pages and retrieve the texts the two sent from their phones. He then has his friend hack into Ryan's bank account to steal his savings, but pauses for a moment after noticing a photo on Ryan's Facebook page. Tara returns home, at which point she admits to lying to Christian and that she went to visit Cynthia instead. Christian acknowledges dating Cynthia but denies beating her or arranging her to be gang raped. Suddenly Christian's phone rings; his dating app friend is about to arrive. Christian offers to cancel but Tara insists they go through with it. The couple engages in an orgy with a couple who arrived at the house. During the orgy, the male guest forces himself onto Christian, which Tara eggs on as the male guest gives Christian a blow job while Tara watches. \n\nMeanwhile, it is revealed that Cynthia was put up to warning Tara by Ryan, with it implied that the two are also former lovers. While wandering through a record/movie store, Ryan realizes he is being stalked. Attacking the man following him, Ryan accuses him of working for Christian (which he denies) and destroys his phone. When Ryan attempts to get money out of his bank account, he finds himself broke and realizes Christian hacked his back account. The next morning, Tara calls Ryan while Christian is asleep but no one answers. When she tries to steal Christian's phone to make her call, she finds her cellphone with his. Christian wakes up and violently assaults Tara, as he reveals that he knows all about her and Ryan. \n\nGina, meanwhile, finds Ryan drinking and ask if anything is wrong. Ryan reveals that he has been through Gina's computer finding out about Christian (including his seeing a therapist) and then reveals the movie is not going to get made. More so, Ryan reveals that he has been sleeping with Tara behind Ryan and Gina's back. Ryan also reveals that the affair has been going on longer than previously implied; that they had been sleeping with each other for a month, ever since Ryan auditioned for the lead in the film. Gina dumps Ryan, who is unapologetic with his obsession with Tara and then announces she will do whatever it takes to keep Christian from killing the film and have Ryan fired and banned from the set. \n\nAt his therapist, Christian is focused solely on complaints over how Tara manipulated him into having homosexual relations the night before. Christian rants about his deep-seated need for control over everything in his life, especially Tara, and how his interactions with his therapist are not the \"real\" Christian. It's revealed that Christian's therapy sessions with Doctor Campbell ([[Gus Van Sant|Gus Van Saint]]) are not voluntary; that per the terms of the trust fund that Christian lives off of, he must see Doctor Campbell on a regular basis and not miss a single appointment, lest his father dissolve the trust fund and leave Christian financially destitute. \n\nThe film then cuts to Christian and Ryan, both in their cars driving through downtown Los Angeles as Christian leaves a message on Ryan's voicemail. Christian mocks Ryan's failed acting career and reveals the detailed information he has managed to obtain about Ryan's life and threatens him to leave town. Christian then forces his way into Cynthia's house, where he accuses Cynthia of lying about being drugged and gangraped. Christian also implies that Cynthia is only aiding Ryan in his pursuit of Tara, in order to break up Tara and Christian so she could get Christian back. Cynthia denies Christian's conspiracy theory, but is then promptly murdered by Christian with a knife he brought with him. After killing her, Christian picks up Cynthia's phone as Ryan calls her to warn her of Christian's threatening call. Christian mockingly accuses Ryan of causing Cynthia's murder as he rushes to her home, to find her dead body. Returning home, Christian finds Tara packed up and ready to leave Christian. Christian apologizes for brutalizing her and agrees to let her leave their relationship, on two conditions: 1. She must give him an alibi for his murder of Cynthia and 2. She must never have any contact with Ryan; if she refuses, he will murder Ryan and use his family's wealth and connections to get away with the crime. Tara agrees and is allowed to leave. \n\nThe film ends with a flash forward to several months in the future. Tara is living in Dubai and has a new boyfriend, and has lunch with a friend. The friend asks Tara about Gina's film and her involvement, as well as her relationship with Christian. Tara proclaims that she left the film project when she and Christian broke up. The friend brings up Cynthia's death and how no one was ever arrested for the murder, though it's implied by the friend that Christian planted the murder weapon in Gina's car in a failed attempt to frame her for the crime. Tara continues to feign that her relationship with Christian is still on good terms, as the unnamed friend leaves to use the restroom. Once alone, the friend calls someone on her cell phone and reports that Tara is doing well but clearly lying about her being friends with Christian as well as being happy with her life. The final scene shows who the unnamed friend is talking to; Ryan, who's all alone in an empty living room, still madly in love with Tara.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Lindsay Lohan]] as Tara\n* [[James Deen]] as Christian\n* [[Nolan Gerard Funk|Nolan Funk]] as Ryan\n* [[Amanda Brooks]] as Gina\n* Tenille Houston as Cynthia Grey\n* [[Gus Van Sant]] as Dr. Campbell\n* [[Danny Wylde|Chris Zeischegg]] as Reid\n* Victor of Aquitaine as Randall\n* [[Lauren Schacher]] as Caitlin\n* [[Jim Boeven]] as Jon\n* Philip Pavel as Erik\n\n==Development==\n\n===Production and marketing===\n[[Braxton Pope]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], and [[Paul Schrader]] were originally involved in a film project, ''Bait''.

We used Let It Cast and saw some amazing actors that we will definitely keep in mind for future projects. The way the entire cast came together so quickly was a thrill and everyone who landed their roles deserved them. Using social media as a way to help build a film is really like riding the wave into the future.\"  Pope said, \"Nothing about this film was orchestrated in a traditional way.

These quantities are derived from [[absorbed dose]], which in the CGS system has the unit [[rad (unit)|rad]]. There is no universally applicable conversion constant from rad to rem; the conversion depends on [[relative biological effectiveness]] (RBE).\n\nThe rem has been defined since 1976 as equal to 0.01&nbsp;[[sievert]], which is the more commonly used [[SI unit]] outside the United States. Earlier definitions going back to 1945 were derived from the [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen unit]], which was named after [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]], a German scientist who discovered [[X-ray]]s. The unit name is misleading, since 1 roentgen actually deposits about 0.96 rem in soft biological tissue, when all weighting factors equal unity. Older units of rem following other definitions are up to 17% smaller than the modern rem.\n\nOne rem carries with it a 0.05% chance of eventually developing cancer.<ref name=ICRP103 /> Doses greater than 100 rem received over a short time period are likely to cause [[acute radiation syndrome]] (ARS), possibly leading to death within weeks if left untreated. Note that the quantities that are measured in rem were not designed to be correlated to ARS symptoms. The [[absorbed dose]], measured in rad, is a better indicator of ARS.<ref name=\"remdef\">''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', Revised ed., US DOD 1962</ref>{{rp|592\u2013593}}\n\nA rem is a large dose of radiation, so the '''millirem''' ('''mrem'''), which is one thousandth of a rem, is often used for the dosages commonly encountered, such as the amount of radiation received from medical x-rays and [[background radiation|background]] sources.\n\n==Usage==\nThe rem and millirem are CGS units in widest use among the U.S. public, industry, and government.<ref name=EPA>{{cite web|title=Radiation: Risks and Realities|url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=000003JH.txt|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 May 2012|author1=Office of Air and Radiation |author2=Office of Radiation and Indoor Air|page=2|format=PDF|date=May 2007|quote=In the United States, we measure radiation doses in units called rem. Under the metric system, dose is measured in units called sieverts. One sievert is equal to 100 rem.}}</ref> SI units are the norm outside of the United States, and they are increasingly encountered within the U.S. in academic, scientific, and engineering environments.\n\nThe conventional units for dose rate is mrem/h. Regulatory limits and chronic doses are often given in units of mrem/yr or rem/yr, where they are understood to represent the total amount of radiation allowed (or received) over the entire year. In many occupational scenarios, the hourly dose rate might fluctuate to levels thousands of times higher for a brief period of time, without infringing on the annual total exposure limits. There is no exact conversion from hours to years because of leap years, but approximate conversions are:\n:1 mrem/h = 8,766 mrem/yr\n:0.1141 mrem/h = 1,000 mrem/yr\n\nThe [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) once adopted fixed conversion for occupational exposure, although these have not appeared in recent documents:<ref>{{cite book|title=Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and of the International Commission on Radiological Units|year=1950|publisher=US Department of Commerce|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2047.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2012|series=National Bureau of Standards Handbook|volume=47}}</ref>\n:8 h = 1 day\n:40 h = 1 week\n:50 week = 1 yr\nTherefore, for occupation exposures of that time period,\n:1 mrem/h = 2,000 mrem/yr\n:0.5 mrem/h = 1,000 mrem/yr\n\nThe U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) strongly discourages Americans from expressing doses in rem, in favor of recommending the SI unit.<ref name=NIST>{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N.|title=Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI)|year=2008|publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]|location=Gaithersburg, MD|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/pubs/sp811/index.cfm|edition=2008|access-date=28 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516081348/http://www.physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec05.html|id=SP811|page=10|archive-date=16 May 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The NIST recommends defining the rem in relation to the SI in every document where this unit is used.<ref name=\"fedreg63\">{{cite journal|last=Hebner|first=Robert E.|title=Metric System of Measurement: Interpretation of the International System of Units for the United States|journal=Federal Register|date=1998-07-28|volume=63|issue=144|page=40339|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1998-07-28/pdf/98-16965.pdf|accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref> \n\n== Health effects ==\nIonizing radiation has deterministic and stochastic effects on human health. The deterministic effects that can lead to [[acute radiation syndrome]] only occur in the case of high doses (>&nbsp;~10&nbsp;rad or >&nbsp;0.1&nbsp;Gy) and high dose rates (>&nbsp;~10&nbsp;rad/h or >&nbsp;0.1&nbsp;Gy/h). A model of deterministic risk would require different weighting factors (not yet established) than are used in the calculation of equivalent and effective dose.

These quantities are derived from [[absorbed dose]], which in the CGS system has the unit [[rad (unit)|rad]].

Earlier definitions going back to 1945 were derived from the [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen unit]], which was named after [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]], a German scientist who discovered [[X-ray]]s. The unit is misleading, since 1 roentgen actually deposits about 0.96 rem in soft biological tissue, when all weighting factors equal unity.

The culminating event is the [[St Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in 1572, during which mobs of armed Catholics hunted down and slaughtered thousands of their Protestant neighbours.

Captured by bandits who are about to hang him, he is rescued by his former pupil, the Prince of Montpensier. The two ride to the castle of the M\u00e9zi\u00e8res family, where the prince's father has been negotiating a bride for his son. This is Marie, who is on intimate terms with her childhood friend, the powerful Duke of Guise. When Guise is outraged to hear that Marie is to be given to Montpensier, Chabannes tries to reconcile the two fiery young men who have drawn swords.\n[[File:Henri duc de Guise.jpg|thumb|30em|Henri, duc de Guise]] \n\nAfter the marriage the newly-wed couple go with Chabannes to the Montpensier castle and, on the way, Chabannes confesses to Marie his disgust over the wars and his part in them. Montpensier then has to go with his parents to the royal court in Paris, leaving Marie in the care of Chabannes as her tutor. The lonely bride and the disillusioned count become very close, so much so that he admits to her that he loves her. \n\nMontpensier returns home for a while but is summoned again to Paris. Chabannes takes the letter into the bedroom where the couple are asleep naked, and Marie does not attempt to cover herself. Before Montpensier goes, Guise appears on their estate with his cousin the Duke of Anjou, heir to the childless and ailing King Charles IX.

Invited into the castle for dinner, there is tense conversation between the four men (Anjou, Guise, Montpensier and Chabannes), all now in love with Marie.[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|30em|Henri, duc d'Anjou]]\n\nAll go to Paris where, when Guise starts talking intimately to Marie, Montpensier surprises them and swords are drawn.

However, the man behind the mask is not Guise but Anjou, who immediately finds Guise and tells him to stay away from Marie. He then finds Marie and warns her against Guise. Her husband, furious at what is going on, puts her in the care of Chabannes, to be taken back to the country in the morning. That night, Guise puts a dagger to Chabannes' throat and demands to see Marie. Once admitted, he declares his love and warns her against Anjou but, hearing blows on the locked door, then escapes. Montpensier breaks in and, furious to find Chabannes in her bedroom, kicks him out and departs.

It stars [[M\u00e9lanie Thierry]] in the title role, alongside [[Gaspard Ulliel]], [[Gr\u00e9goire Leprince-Ringuet]], [[Lambert Wilson]] and [[Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz]]. \n\nThe film mixes fiction and history in the years of bloody conflict known as the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], which not only opposed [[Catholicism|Catholics]] with [[Protestantism| Protestants]] but also involved bitter power struggles between factions of the nobility and the royal family. The culminating event is the [[St Bartholomew's Day massacre]] in 1572, during which mobs of armed Catholics hunted down and slaughtered thousands of their Protestant neighbours.

Captured by bandits who are about to hang him, he is rescued by his former pupil, the Prince of Montpensier. The two ride to the castle of the M\u00e9zi\u00e8res family, where the prince's father has been negotiating a bride for his son. This is Marie, who is on intimate terms with her childhood friend, the powerful Duke of Guise. When Guise is outraged to hear that Marie is to be given to Montpensier, Chabannes tries to reconcile the two fiery young men who have drawn swords.\n[[File:Henri duc de Guise.jpg|thumb|30em|Henri, duc de Guise]] \n\nAfter the marriage the newly-wed couple go with Chabannes to the Montpensier castle and, on the way, Chabannes confesses to Marie his disgust over the wars and his part in them. Montpensier then has to go with his parents to the royal court in Paris, leaving Marie in the care of Chabannes as her tutor. The lonely bride and the disillusioned count become very close, so much so that he admits to her that he loves her. \n\nMontpensier returns home for a while but is summoned again to Paris. Chabannes takes the letter into the bedroom where the couple are asleep naked, and Marie does not attempt to cover herself. Before Montpensier goes, Guise appears on their estate with his cousin the Duke of Anjou, heir to the childless and ailing King Charles IX. The two see Marie in a boat on the river and Anjou too is struck by her beauty. Invited into the castle for dinner, there is tense conversation between the four men (Anjou, Guise, Montpensier and Chabannes), all now in love with Marie.[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb|30em|Henri, duc d'Anjou]]\n\nAll go to Paris where, when Guise starts talking intimately to Marie, Montpensier surprises them and swords are drawn.

She tells Chabannes, who advises her to keep well clear of Guise.\n\nShe still wants to see him, and at a masked ball asks him to meet her on the same staircase. However, the man behind the mask is not Guise but Anjou, who immediately finds Guise and tells him to stay away from Marie. He then finds Marie and warns her against Guise.
