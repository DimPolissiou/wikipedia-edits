The word \"nomad\" comes ultimately from the classical Greek word \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2 (''nom\u00e1s'', \"roaming, wandering, especially to find pasture\"), from Ancient Greek \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (''nom\u00f3s'', \"pasture\"). Most nomadic groups follow a fixed annual or seasonal pattern of movements and settlements. Nomadic peoples traditionally travel by animal or canoe or on foot. Today, some nomads travel by motor vehicle. Most{{quantify|date=June 2019}} nomads live in tents or other portable shelters.\n\nNomads keep moving for different reasons. Nomadic foragers move in search of game, edible plants, and water. Aboriginal Australians, [[Negrito]]s of Southeast Asia, and [[San people|San]] of Africa, for example, traditionally move from camp to camp to hunt and gather wild plants. Some tribes of the Americas followed this way of life. Pastoral nomads make their living raising livestock such as camels, cattle, goats, horses, sheep or yaks; the [[Gaddi]] tribe of [[Himachal Pradesh]] in India is one such tribe. These nomads travel to find more camels, goats and sheep{{cn|date=June 2019}} through the deserts of Arabia and northern Africa. The [[Fula people| Fulani]] and their cattle travel through the grasslands of [[Niger]] in western Africa. Some nomadic peoples, especially herders, may also move to raid settled communities or to avoid enemies. Nomadic craftworkers and merchants travel to find and serve customers. They include the [[Lohar]] blacksmiths of India, the [[Romani people| Romani]] traders, and the [[Irish Travellers]].\n\nMost nomads travel in groups of families, bands or [[tribes]]. These groups are based on kinship and marriage ties or on formal agreements of cooperation. A council of adult males makes most of the decisions, though some tribes have chiefs.\n\nIn the case of Mongolian nomads, a family moves twice a year. These two movements generally occur during the summer and winter. The winter destination is usually located near mountains in a valley and most families already have fixed winter locations. Their winter locations have shelter for animals and are not used by other families while they are out. In the summer they move to a more open area that the animals can graze. Most nomads usually move in the same region and don't travel very far to a totally different region. Since they usually circle around a large area, communities form and families generally know where the other ones are. Often, families do not have the resources to move from one province to another unless they are moving out of the area permanently. A family can move on its own or with others; if it moves alone, they are usually no more than a couple of kilometers from each other. Nowadays there are no tribes and decisions are made among family members, although elders consult with each other on usual matters. The geographical closeness of families is usually for mutual support. Pastoral nomad societies usually do not have large population. One such society, the [[Mongols]], gave rise to the largest land empire in history. The Mongols originally consisted of loosely organized nomadic tribes in Mongolia, Manchuria, and Siberia. In the late 12th century, [[Genghis Khan]] united them and other nomadic tribes to found the [[Mongol Empire]], which eventually stretched the length of Asia.\n\nThe nomadic way of life has become increasingly rare. Many governments dislike nomads because it is difficult to control their movement and to obtain taxes from them. Nomadic migration across international boundaries confuses capital-city bureaucrats. Many countries have converted pastures into cropland and forced nomadic peoples into permanent settlements.\n\nAlthough (or because) \"[t]he sedentary man envies the nomadic existence, the heck for green pastures [...]\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Adorno\n | first1 = Theodor W.\n | author-link1 = Theodor W.

The word \"nomad\" comes ultimately from the classical Greek word \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2 (''nom\u00e1s'', \"roaming, wandering, especially to find pasture\"), from Ancient Greek \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (''nom\u00f3s'', \"pasture\"). Most nomadic groups follow a fixed annual or seasonal pattern of movements and settlements. Nomadic peoples traditionally travel by animal or canoe or on foot. Today, some nomads travel by motor vehicle. Most{{quantify|date=June 2019}} nomads live in tents or other portable shelters.\n\nNomads keep moving for different reasons. Nomadic foragers move in search of game, edible plants, and water. Aboriginal Australians, [[Negrito]]s of Southeast Asia, and [[San people|San]] of Africa, for example, traditionally move from camp to camp to hunt and gather wild plants. Some tribes of the Americas followed this way of life. Pastoral nomads make their living raising livestock such as camels, cattle, goats, horses, sheep or yaks; the [[Gaddi]] tribe of [[Himachal Pradesh]] in India is one such tribe. These nomads travel to find more camels, goats and sheep{{cn|date=June 2019}} through the deserts of Arabia and northern Africa. The [[Fula people| Fulani]] and their cattle travel through the grasslands of [[Niger]] in western Africa. Some nomadic peoples, especially herders, may also move to raid settled communities or to avoid enemies. Nomadic craftworkers and merchants travel to find and serve customers. They include the [[Lohar]] blacksmiths of India, the [[Romani people| Romani]] traders, and the [[Irish Travellers]].\n\nMost nomads travel in groups of families, bands or [[tribes]]. These groups are based on kinship and marriage ties or on formal agreements of cooperation. A council of adult males makes most of the decisions, though some tribes have chiefs.\n\nIn the case of Mongolian nomads, a family moves twice a year. These two movements generally occur during the summer and winter. The winter destination is usually located near mountains in a valley and most families already have fixed winter locations. Their winter locations have shelter for animals and are not used by other families while they are out. In the summer they move to a more open area that the animals can graze. Most nomads usually move in the same region and don't travel very far to a totally different region. Since they usually circle around a large area, communities form and families generally know where the other ones are. Often, families do not have the resources to move from one province to another unless they are moving out of the area permanently. A family can move on its own or with others; if it moves alone, they are usually no more than a couple of kilometers from each other. Nowadays there are no tribes and decisions are made among family members, although elders consult with each other on usual matters. The geographical closeness of families is usually for mutual support. Pastoral nomad societies usually do not have large population. One such society, the [[Mongols]], gave rise to the largest land empire in history. The Mongols originally consisted of loosely organized nomadic tribes in Mongolia, Manchuria, and Siberia. In the late 12th century, [[Genghis Khan]] united them and other nomadic tribes to found the [[Mongol Empire]], which eventually stretched the length of Asia.\n\nThe nomadic way of life has become increasingly rare. Many governments dislike nomads because it is difficult to control their movement and to obtain taxes from them. Nomadic migration across international boundaries confuses capital-city bureaucrats. Many countries have converted pastures into cropland and forced nomadic peoples into permanent settlements.\n\nAlthough (or because) \"[t]he sedentary man envies the nomadic existence, the heck for green pastures [...]\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Adorno\n | first1 = Theodor W.\n | author-link1 = Theodor W.

The main staple of their diet is ''[[tsampa]]'' and they drink [[Tibetan cuisine|Tibetan]] style [[butter tea]]. Pala will eat heartier foods in the winter months to help keep warm. Some of the customary restrictions they explain as cultural saying only that ''drokha'' do not eat certain foods, even some that may be naturally abundant. Though they live near sources of [[fish as food|fish]] and [[fowl]] these do not play a significant role in their diet, and they do not eat [[carnivorous]] animals, [[rabbit]]s or the wild asses that are abundant in the environs, classifying the latter as [[horse]] due to their cloven hooves. Some families do not eat until after the morning milking, while others may have a light meal with butter tea and ''tsampa''. In the afternoon, after the morning milking, the families gather and share a communal meal of tea, ''tsampa'' and sometimes [[yogurt]]. During winter months the meal is more substantial and includes meat. [[Herder]]s will eat before leaving the camp and most do not eat again until they return to camp for the evening meal. The typical evening meal may include thin stew with ''tsampa'', animal fat and dried [[radish]]. Winter stew would include a lot of meat with either ''tsampa'' or boiled flour [[dumpling]]s.<ref name=\"goldstein\">{{cite book |last1=Goldstein |first1=Mervyll |title=Nomads of Western Tibet: The Survival of a Way of Life |date=1990 |publisher=University of California Press |page=114 |ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=igQiDpD66pwC&pg=PA114}}</ref>\n\nNomadic diets in [[Kazakhstan]] have not changed much over centuries.

Peddling and the sale of various goods was also practiced by men and women of various groups, such as the Jalali, the Pikraj, the Shadibaz, the Noristani, and the Vangawala. The latter and the Pikraj also worked as animal dealers. Some men among the Shadibaz and the Vangawala entertained as monkey or bear handlers and snake charmers; men and women among the Baluch were musicians and dancers. The Baluch men were warriors that were feared by neighboring tribes and often were used as mercenaries.

In East Asian culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one's elders, superiors, and especially the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship. In modern times, usage of the kowtow has been reduced.<ref>Xi Po, \"Bowing Out: Why Traditional Kowtowing Rituals Are Under Threat\", ''Sixth Tone: Fresh Voices from Today's China'' (5 Mar. 2019): http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1003623/bowing-out-why-traditional-kowtowing-rituals-are-under-threat#</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nAn alternative Chinese term is ''ketou''; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: ''kou'' ({{lang|zh|\u53e9}}) has the general meaning of ''knock'', whereas ''ke'' ({{lang|zh|\u78d5}}) has the general meaning of \"touch upon (a surface)\", ''tou'' ({{lang|zh|\u982d}}) meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime between the [[Spring and Autumn period]], or the [[Warring States period]] of China's history because it was a custom by the time of the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC \u2013 206 BC).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ge Feng|author2=Zhengming Du|title=Traditional Chinese Rites and Rituals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAz5DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110|year=2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=110|isbn=9781443887830}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional usage==\nIn [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial Chinese]] protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the solemnity of the situation different grades of kowtow would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor's subjects would undertake the ceremony of the \"three kneelings and nine kowtows\", the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. [[Immanuel C. Y. Hsu|Immanuel Hsu]] describes the \"full kowtow\" as \"three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The Rise of Modern China|url= https://archive.org/details/riseofmodernchin00hs|url-access= registration|edition= |last= Hsu|first= Immanuel|year= 1970|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|lccn= 78083022|page= [https://archive.org/details/riseofmodernchin00hs/page/152 152]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Three people 'kowtowing' to an altar, one woman crying, othe Wellcome V0015171.jpg|thumb|Kowtowing in China]]\nAs government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were also required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate would be required to kneel and kowtow. A commoner is then required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who has earned a degree in the [[Imperial examination]]s is permitted a seat.\n\nSince one is required by [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] to show great reverence to one's parents and grandparents, children may also be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.\n\n[[Confucius]] believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eva Kit Wah Man|title=Issues of Contemporary Art and Aesthetics in Chinese Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK1nCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|year=2015|publisher=Springer|page=32|isbn=9783662465103}}</ref> Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.\n\n==Modern Chinese usage==\n[[File:Annamese kowtowing to French soldiers.jpg|thumb|Annamese kowtowing to French soldiers]]\nThe kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing [[Bowing|bow]] has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may also kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xiaofei Kang|title=The Cult of the Fox: Power, Gender, and Popular Religion in Late Imperial and Modern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75Uoe_3IatkC&pg=PA103|year=2005|publisher=Columbia UP|page=103|isbn=9780231508223}}</ref>\n\nThe kowtow remains alive as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, [[Chinese martial arts]] schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Likewise, traditional performing arts often also require the kowtow.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Reinders|title=Buddhist and Christian Responses to the Kowtow Problem in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQuCBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA139|year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=139|isbn=9781474227292}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Prostration (Buddhism)}}\nProstration is a general practice in [[Buddhism]], and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead.

In East Asian culture, the kowtow is the highest sign of reverence. It was widely used to show reverence for one's elders, superiors, and especially the [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], as well as for religious and cultural objects of worship. In modern times, usage of the kowtow has been reduced.<ref>Xi Po, \"Bowing Out: Why Traditional Kowtowing Rituals Are Under Threat\", ''Sixth Tone: Fresh Voices from Today's China'' (5 Mar. 2019): http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1003623/bowing-out-why-traditional-kowtowing-rituals-are-under-threat#</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nAn alternative Chinese term is ''ketou''; however, the meaning is somewhat altered: ''kou'' ({{lang|zh|\u53e9}}) has the general meaning of ''knock'', whereas ''ke'' ({{lang|zh|\u78d5}}) has the general meaning of \"touch upon (a surface)\", ''tou'' ({{lang|zh|\u982d}}) meaning head. The date of this custom's origin is probably sometime between the [[Spring and Autumn period]], or the [[Warring States period]] of China's history because it was a custom by the time of the [[Qin dynasty]] (221 BC \u2013 206 BC).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ge Feng|author2=Zhengming Du|title=Traditional Chinese Rites and Rituals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAz5DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110|year=2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|page=110|isbn=9781443887830}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional usage==\nIn [[Imperial era of Chinese history|Imperial Chinese]] protocol, the kowtow was performed before the Emperor of China. Depending on the solemnity of the situation different grades of kowtow would be used. In the most solemn of ceremonies, for example at the coronation of a new Emperor, the Emperor's subjects would undertake the ceremony of the \"three kneelings and nine kowtows\", the so-called grand kowtow, which involves kneeling from a standing position three times, and each time, performing the kowtow three times while kneeling. [[Immanuel C. Y. Hsu|Immanuel Hsu]] describes the \"full kowtow\" as \"three kneelings and nine knockings of the head on the ground\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The Rise of Modern China|url= https://archive.org/details/riseofmodernchin00hs|url-access= registration|edition= |last= Hsu|first= Immanuel|year= 1970|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= New York|lccn= 78083022|page= [https://archive.org/details/riseofmodernchin00hs/page/152 152]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Three people 'kowtowing' to an altar, one woman crying, othe Wellcome V0015171.jpg|thumb|Kowtowing in China]]\nAs government officials represented the majesty of the Emperor while carrying out their duties, commoners were also required to kowtow to them in formal situations. For example, a commoner brought before a local magistrate would be required to kneel and kowtow. A commoner is then required to remain kneeling, whereas a person who has earned a degree in the [[Imperial examination]]s is permitted a seat.\n\nSince one is required by [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] to show great reverence to one's parents and grandparents, children may also be required to kowtow to their elderly ancestors, particularly on special occasions. For example, at a wedding, the marrying couple was traditionally required to kowtow to both sets of parents, as acknowledgement of the debt owed for their nurturing.\n\n[[Confucius]] believed there was a natural harmony between the body and mind and therefore, whatever actions were expressed through the body would be transferred over to the mind.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eva Kit Wah Man|title=Issues of Contemporary Art and Aesthetics in Chinese Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK1nCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|year=2015|publisher=Springer|page=32|isbn=9783662465103}}</ref> Because the body is placed in a low position in the kowtow, the idea is that one will naturally convert to his or her mind a feeling of respect. What one does to oneself influences the mind. Confucian philosophy held that respect was important for a society, making bowing an important ritual.\n\n==Modern Chinese usage==\n[[File:Annamese kowtowing to French soldiers.jpg|thumb|Annamese kowtowing to French soldiers]]\nThe kowtow, and other traditional forms of reverence, were much maligned after the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Today, only vestiges of the traditional usage of the kowtow remain. In many situations, the standing [[Bowing|bow]] has replaced the kowtow. For example, some, but not all, people would choose to kowtow before the grave of an ancestor, or while making traditional offerings to an ancestor. Direct descendants may also kowtow at the funeral of an ancestor, while others would simply bow. During a wedding, some couples may kowtow to their respective parents, though the standing bow is today more common. In extreme cases, the kowtow can be used to express profound gratitude, apology, or to beg for forgiveness.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xiaofei Kang|title=The Cult of the Fox: Power, Gender, and Popular Religion in Late Imperial and Modern China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75Uoe_3IatkC&pg=PA103|year=2005|publisher=Columbia UP|page=103|isbn=9780231508223}}</ref>\n\nThe kowtow remains alive as part of a formal induction ceremony in certain traditional trades that involve apprenticeship or discipleship. For example, [[Chinese martial arts]] schools often require a student to kowtow to a master. Likewise, traditional performing arts often also require the kowtow.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Reinders|title=Buddhist and Christian Responses to the Kowtow Problem in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQuCBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA139|year=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=139|isbn=9781474227292}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{Main|Prostration (Buddhism)}}\nProstration is a general practice in [[Buddhism]], and not restricted to China. The kowtow is often performed in groups of three before Buddhist statues and images or tombs of the dead. In Buddhism it is more commonly termed either \"worship with the crown (of the head)\" (\u9802\u79ae ding li) or \"casting the five limbs to the earth\" (\u4e94\u9ad4\u6295\u5730 wuti tou di)\u2014referring to the two arms, two legs and forehead. For example, in certain ceremonies, a person would perform a sequence of three sets of three kowtows\u2014stand up and kneel down again between each set\u2014as an extreme gesture of respect; hence the term ''three kneelings and nine head knockings'' ({{ill|\u4e09\u8dea\u4e5d\u53e9\u4e4b\u79ae|zh}}). Also, some Buddhist [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] would kowtow once for every three steps made during their long journeys, the number three referring to the [[Triple Gem]] of Buddhism, the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], the [[Dharma]], and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]. Prostration is widely practiced in India by Hindus to give utmost respect to their deities in temples and to parents and elders. Nowadays in modern times people show the regards to elders by bowing down and touching their feet.\n\n==Diplomacy==\nThe word \"kowtow\" came into English in the early 19th century to describe the bow itself, but its meaning soon shifted to describe any abject submission or groveling.

As was customary of all Asian envoys to Qing China, Joseon envoys kowtowed three times to the Qing emperor during their visits to China, continuing until 1896, when the Korean Empire withdrew its tributary status from Qing as a result of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].<ref>{{cite book|script-title=zh:\u4ec1\u7956 34\u5377, 15\u5e74 (1636) \u6b63\u670830\u65e5 |publisher=[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]]|language=Chinese|quote=\u9f8d\u80e1\u5165\u5831, \u51fa\u50b3\u6c57\u8a00\u66f0: \"\u524d\u65e5\u4e4b\u4e8b, \u6b32\u8a00\u5247\u9577\u77e3\u3002 \u4eca\u80fd\u52c7\u6c7a\u800c\u4f86, \u6df1\u7528\u559c\u5e78\u3002\" \u4e0a\u7b54\u66f0: \"\u5929\u6069\u7f54\u6975\u3002\" \u9f8d\u80e1\u7b49\u5f15\u5165, \u8a2d\u5e2d\u65bc\u58c7\u4e0b\u5317\u9762, \u8acb\u4e0a\u5c31\u5e2d, \u4f7f\u6df8\u4eba\u81da\u5531\u3002 \u4e0a\u884c'''\u4e09\u62dc\u4e5d\u53e9\u982d\u79ae'''\u3002}}</ref>\n\nThe King of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] also had to kneel three times on the ground and touch his head nine times to the ground ({{lang|zh|\u4e09\u62dc\u4e5d\u53e9\u982d\u79ae}}), to show his allegiance to the Chinese emperors.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/personal/tsuruta/sei0005.htm|title=\u91cd\u70b9\u9818\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u300c\u6c96\u7e04\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u60c5\u5831\u7814\u7a76 (History Study of Okinawa)|quote= \u2013 \u300c\u901a\u822a\u4e00\u89a7\u30fb\u7409\u7403\u56fd\u90e8 \u6b63\u7de8 \u5dfb\u4e4b\u4e8c\u5341\u4e09\u3000\u7409\u7403\u56fd\u90e8\u4e8c\u5341\u4e09\u3001\u5510\u56fd\u5f80\u6765\u300d\"|language=ja}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n*[[Chinese social relations]]\n*[[Culture of China]]\n*[[Yeongeunmun]]\n*Finger kowtow:\n**[[Chinese tea culture#Finger tapping|Finger tapping in Chinese tea culture]]\n**[[Yum cha#Customs and etiquette|Finger tapping in Yum Cha]]\n*[[Emoticon#Posture emoticons|Posture emoticons]]\n*[[Foot washing]], another act of extreme [[humility]]\n*[[Gadaw]], a Burmese form of obeisance akin to kowtow\n*[[John Moyse]]\n*[[Salute]]\n*[[Shuysky Tribute]] Eastern European version\n*[[Sifu]]\n*[[Sujud]], prostration to Allah\n*[[\u56e7rz|Orz]]\n*[[Dogeza]]\n*[[Proskynesis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Fairbank, John K., and Ssu-yu Teng. \"On the Ch'ing tributary system.\" ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 6.2 (1941): 135\u2013246.

For systems with low binding energies, this \"lost\" mass after binding may be fractionally small, whereas for systems with high binding energies, the missing mass may be an easily measurable fraction. This missing mass may be lost during the process of binding as energy in the form of heat or light, with the removed energy corresponding to the removed mass through Einstein's equation [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc<sup>2</sup>]]. In the process of binding, the constituents of the system might enter higher energy states of the nucleus/atom/molecule while retaining their mass, and because of this, it is necessary that they are removed from the system before its mass can decrease. Once the system cools to normal temperatures and returns to ground states regarding energy levels, it will contain less mass than when it first combined and was at high energy. This loss of heat represents the \"mass deficit,\" and the heat itself retains the mass that was lost (from the point of view of the initial system). This mass will appear in any other system that absorbs the heat and gains thermal energy.<ref>E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, ''Spacetime Physics'', W.H. Freeman and Co., NY. 1992. {{ISBN|0-7167-2327-1}}, see pp. 248-9 for discussion of mass remaining constant after detonation of nuclear bombs until heat is allowed to escape.</ref>\n\nFor example, if two objects are attracting each other in space through their [[gravitational field]], the attraction force accelerates the objects, increasing their velocity, which converts their potential energy (gravity) into kinetic energy. When the particles either pass through each other without interaction or elastically repel during the collision, the gained kinetic energy (related to speed) begins to revert into potential energy, driving the collided particles apart. The decelerating particles will return to the initial distance and beyond into infinity, or stop and repeat the collision (oscillation takes place). This shows that the system, which loses no energy, does not combine (bind) into a solid object, parts of which oscillate at short distances. Therefore, to bind the particles, the kinetic energy gained due to the attraction must be dissipated by resistive force. Complex objects in collision ordinarily undergo [[inelastic collision]], transforming some kinetic energy into internal energy (heat content, which is atomic movement), which is further radiated in the form of photons - the light and heat. Once the energy to escape the gravity is dissipated in the collision, the parts will oscillate at a closer, possibly atomic, distance, thus looking like one solid object. This lost energy, necessary to overcome the potential barrier to separate the objects, is the binding energy. If this binding energy were retained in the system as heat, its mass would not decrease, whereas binding energy lost from the system as heat radiation would itself have mass. It directly represents the \"mass deficit\" of the cold, bound system.\n\nClosely analogous considerations apply in chemical and nuclear reactions. Exothermic chemical reactions in closed systems do not change mass, but do become less massive once the heat of reaction is removed, though this mass change is too small to measure with standard equipment. In [[nuclear reaction]]s, the fraction of mass that may be removed as light or heat, i.e., binding energy, is often a much larger fraction of the system mass. It may thus be measured directly as a mass difference between [[rest mass]]es of reactants and (cooled) products. This is because nuclear forces are comparatively stronger than the Coulombic forces associated with the interactions between electrons and protons that generate heat in chemistry.\n\n===Mass change===\nMass change (decrease) in bound systems, particularly atomic nuclei, has also been termed ''mass defect'', ''mass deficit'', or mass ''packing fraction''.{{citation needed|reason=I've never heard of the term packing fraction used in this context|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe difference between the unbound system calculated mass and experimentally measured mass of nucleus (mass change) is denoted as \u0394''m''. It can be calculated as follows:\n:Mass change = (unbound system calculated mass) \u2212 (measured mass of system)\n:: i.e., (sum of masses of protons and neutrons) \u2212 (measured mass of nucleus)\n\nAfter a nuclear reaction occurs that results in an excited nucleus, the energy that must be [[radiation|radiated]] or otherwise removed as binding energy in order to decay to the unexcited state may be in one of several forms. This may be electromagnetic waves, such as [[gamma radiation]]; the kinetic energy of an ejected particle, such as an electron, in [[internal conversion]] decay; or partly as the rest mass of one or more emitted particles, such as the particles of [[beta decay]]. No mass deficit can appear, in theory, until this radiation or this energy has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.\n\nWhen nucleons bind together to form a nucleus, they must lose a small amount of mass, i.e., there is a change in mass to stay bound. This mass change must be released as various types of photon or other particle energy as above, according to the relation E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc<sup>2</sup>. Thus, after the binding energy has been removed, '''binding energy = mass change \u00d7 ''c''<sup>2</sup>'''. This energy is a measure of the forces that hold the nucleons together. It represents energy that must be resupplied from the environment for the nucleus to be broken up into individual nucleons.\n\nFor example, an atom of [[deuterium]] has a mass defect of 0.0023884 amu, and its binding energy is nearly equal to 2.23 MeV. This means that 2.23 MeV of energy are required to disintegrate an atom of deuterium.\n\nThe energy given off during either [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission]] is the difference of the binding energies of the \"fuel,\" i.e. the initial nuclide(s), from that of the fission or fusion products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, which uses previous measurements of the [[atomic mass]]es of known nuclides, which always have the same mass for each species. This mass difference appears once evolved heat and radiation have been removed, which is required for measuring the (rest) masses of the (non-excited) nuclides involved in such calculations.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bond energy]] and [[bond-dissociation energy]]\n*[[Gravitational binding energy]]\n*[[Ionization energy]] (binding energy of one electron)\n*[[Nuclear binding energy]]\n*[[Quantum chromodynamics binding energy]]\n*[[Semi-empirical mass formula]]\n*[[Separation energy]] (binding energy of one nucleon)\n*[[Virial mass]]\n*[[Prout's hypothesis]], an early model of the atom that did not account for [[mass defect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html Nuclear Binding Energy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070830110015/http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/nuctek/nuclideunstable.html Mass and Nuclide Stability]\n*[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/masses/mass.mas03 Experimental atomic mass data compiled Nov. 2003]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binding Energy}}\n[[Category:Binding energy| ]]\n[[Category:Energy (physics)]]\n[[Category:Mass spectrometry]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Forms of energy]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2014}}\n{{Nuclear physics}}\n\nIn physics, '''binding energy''' (also called separation energy) is the ''minimum'' [[energy]] required to disassemble a system of particles into separate parts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Physics from \u03b1 to Z\u00b0|last=Rohlf |first=James William |date=1994|publisher= John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0471572705|page=20}}</ref> \n\nA bound system is typically at a lower energy level than its unbound constituents. \u00abWhen a dispersed system [...] combines, [...] the total energy of the system must decrease by an amount <math>\\Delta E</math>, the ''binding energy'' [...].

It can be calculated as follows:\n:Mass change = (unbound system calculated mass) \u2212 (measured mass of system)\n:: i.e., (sum of masses of protons and neutrons) \u2212 (measured mass of nucleus)\n\nAfter a nuclear reaction occurs that results in an excited nucleus, the energy that must be [[radiation|radiated]] or otherwise removed as binding energy in order to decay to the unexcited state may be in one of several forms. This may be electromagnetic waves, such as [[gamma radiation]]; the kinetic energy of an ejected particle, such as an electron, in [[internal conversion]] decay; or partly as the rest mass of one or more emitted particles, such as the particles of [[beta decay]]. No mass deficit can appear, in theory, until this radiation or this energy has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.\n\nWhen nucleons bind together to form a nucleus, they must lose a small amount of mass, i.e., there is a change in mass to stay bound. This mass change must be released as various types of photon or other particle energy as above, according to the relation E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc<sup>2</sup>. Thus, after the binding energy has been removed, '''binding energy = mass change \u00d7 ''c''<sup>2</sup>'''. This energy is a measure of the forces that hold the nucleons together. It represents energy that must be resupplied from the environment for the nucleus to be broken up into individual nucleons.\n\nFor example, an atom of [[deuterium]] has a mass defect of 0.0023884 amu, and its binding energy is nearly equal to 2.23 MeV. This means that 2.23 MeV of energy are required to disintegrate an atom of deuterium.\n\nThe energy given off during either [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission]] is the difference of the binding energies of the \"fuel,\" i.e. the initial nuclide(s), from that of the fission or fusion products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, which uses previous measurements of the [[atomic mass]]es of known nuclides, which always have the same mass for each species. This mass difference appears once evolved heat and radiation have been removed, which is required for measuring the (rest) masses of the (non-excited) nuclides involved in such calculations.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bond energy]] and [[bond-dissociation energy]]\n*[[Gravitational binding energy]]\n*[[Ionization energy]] (binding energy of one electron)\n*[[Nuclear binding energy]]\n*[[Quantum chromodynamics binding energy]]\n*[[Semi-empirical mass formula]]\n*[[Separation energy]] (binding energy of one nucleon)\n*[[Virial mass]]\n*[[Prout's hypothesis]], an early model of the atom that did not account for [[mass defect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html Nuclear Binding Energy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070830110015/http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/nuctek/nuclideunstable.html Mass and Nuclide Stability]\n*[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/masses/mass.mas03 Experimental atomic mass data compiled Nov. 2003]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binding Energy}}\n[[Category:Binding energy| ]]\n[[Category:Energy (physics)]]\n[[Category:Mass spectrometry]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Forms of energy]]\n", "name_user": "Stiglich", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTypes of binding energy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy"}
