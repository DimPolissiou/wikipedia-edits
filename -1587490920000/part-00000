It is the largest sports facility in Venice. The stadium was first opened in 1913 and takes its name from [[World War I]] pilot Pierluigi Penzo.\n\nOriginally constructed from wood, the stadium was largely upgraded with a concrete main stand in the 1920s and further improvements were made in the decades that followed. The record attendance of 26,000 was for a 1966 [[Serie A]] match against [[A.C. Milan]].\n\nOn September 11, 1970 a tornado hit Venice and caused extensive damage to the stadium. Due to the club's decline the stadium was only partially reinstated, and the capacity was reduced to just over 5,000. The club rose back up to Serie A in 1998 and additional makeshift stands were added, bringing capacity back up to 13,400, but it has since been reduced again to the current capacity of 7,450.\n\nThe stadium is notable as it is primarily accessible by boat.\n\n==History==\n\nThe club was founded as ''Venezia Foot Ball Club'' on 14 December 1907,<ref name=\"history\">{{cite news|url=http://venicexplorer.net/tradizione/storiaveac.htm|publisher=Ombra.it|title=La Storia del Venezia|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> by members of two local [[sports club]]s coming together; ''Palestra Marziale'' and ''Costantino Reyer''. It was originally based at ''Campo San Bartolomeo'' in the city of [[Venice]]. Fifteen men including the first president Davide Fano were involved in the club's founding;.<ref name=\"history\"/> In 1919, the name was translated into Italian as ''Associazione Calcio Venezia''.\n[[File:Mazzola primo piano.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.20|A closeup of [[Valentino Mazzola]].]]\nThe most notable trophy success in Venezia's history is winning the [[Coppa Italia]] during the 1940\u201341 season. The Cup-winning Venezia team included some of the players who went on to form the [[Torino F.C.]] side of the 1940s who died in the [[Superga air disaster]] in 1949, such as [[Ezio Loik]] and [[Valentino Mazzola]].\n\nIn [[Serie A 1941-42|1941\u201342]], Venezia earned its highest ever [[Serie A]] position, finishing in third place in the league.\n\n===A.C. Venezia 1907===\n\nIn the summer 1990,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} the club was renamed '''Associazione Calcio Venezia 1907'''.\n\nVenezia has spent the majority of its history in [[Serie A]] and [[Serie B]], Italy's two top divisions. The club was last relegated from [[Serie A]] in 2002. This last season in Serie A began a period of decline for the club. Frustrated with the team and the inability to agree on plans for a larger stadium with the local council, then president [[Maurizio Zamparini]] decided to purchase [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo]], and he took with him a large portion of the squad.\n[[File:Alvaro Recoba.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|[[\u00c1lvaro Recoba]] played for Venezia.]]\nNotable recent former players include [[\u00c1lvaro Recoba]], [[Filippo Maniero]] and [[Christian Vieri]].\n\nIn 2002 the club was relegated to [[Serie B]] and declared insolvent because of bankruptcy.<ref>[[2001\u201302 Serie A#League table]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}}\n\n===S.S.C.

It is the largest sports facility in Venice. The stadium was first opened in 1913 and takes its name from [[World War I]] pilot Pierluigi Penzo.\n\nOriginally constructed from wood, the stadium was largely upgraded with a concrete main stand in the 1920s and further improvements were made in the decades that followed. The record attendance of 26,000 was for a 1966 [[Serie A]] match against [[A.C. Milan]].\n\nOn September 11, 1970 a tornado hit Venice and caused extensive damage to the stadium. Due to the club's decline the stadium was only partially reinstated, and the capacity was reduced to just over 5,000. The club rose back up to Serie A in 1998 and additional makeshift stands were added, bringing capacity back up to 13,400, but it has since been reduced again to the current capacity of 7,450.\n\nThe stadium is notable as it is primarily accessible by boat.\n\n==History==\n\nThe club was founded as ''Venezia Foot Ball Club'' on 14 December 1907,<ref name=\"history\">{{cite news|url=http://venicexplorer.net/tradizione/storiaveac.htm|publisher=Ombra.it|title=La Storia del Venezia|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> by members of two local [[sports club]]s coming together; ''Palestra Marziale'' and ''Costantino Reyer''. It was originally based at ''Campo San Bartolomeo'' in the city of [[Venice]]. Fifteen men including the first president Davide Fano were involved in the club's founding;.<ref name=\"history\"/> In 1919, the name was translated into Italian as ''Associazione Calcio Venezia''.\n[[File:Mazzola primo piano.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.20|A closeup of [[Valentino Mazzola]].]]\nThe most notable trophy success in Venezia's history is winning the [[Coppa Italia]] during the 1940\u201341 season. The Cup-winning Venezia team included some of the players who went on to form the [[Torino F.C.]] side of the 1940s who died in the [[Superga air disaster]] in 1949, such as [[Ezio Loik]] and [[Valentino Mazzola]].\n\nIn [[Serie A 1941-42|1941\u201342]], Venezia earned its highest ever [[Serie A]] position, finishing in third place in the league.\n\n===A.C. Venezia 1907===\n\nIn the summer 1990,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} the club was renamed '''Associazione Calcio Venezia 1907'''.\n\nVenezia has spent the majority of its history in [[Serie A]] and [[Serie B]], Italy's two top divisions. The club was last relegated from [[Serie A]] in 2002. This last season in Serie A began a period of decline for the club. Frustrated with the team and the inability to agree on plans for a larger stadium with the local council, then president [[Maurizio Zamparini]] decided to purchase [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo]], and he took with him a large portion of the squad.\n[[File:Alvaro Recoba.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|[[\u00c1lvaro Recoba]] played for Venezia.]]\nNotable recent former players include [[\u00c1lvaro Recoba]], [[Filippo Maniero]] and [[Christian Vieri]].\n\nIn 2002 the club was relegated to [[Serie B]] and declared insolvent because of bankruptcy.<ref>[[2001\u201302 Serie A#League table]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}}\n\n===S.S.C.

Five deep stations in Washington Heights, including the 190th Street station, were considered to be ideal for being used as bomb-proof shelters. The program was expected to cost $104 million. These shelters were expected to provide limited protection against conventional bombs, while providing protection against shock waves and air blast, as well as from the heat and radiation from an atomic bomb. To become suitable as shelters, the stations would require water-supply facilities, first-aid rooms, and additional bathrooms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/12/29/archives/subway-shelters-to-cost-104000000-proposed-for-city-board-would.html|title=Subway Shelters to Cost $104,000,000 Proposed for City \u2013 Board Would Build Havens in Present and Proposed Lines or Convert for Defense \u2013 Extent of U.S. Aid in Doubt \u2013 Most of Routes Would Provide Limited Safety 5 Stations Listed as 'Bomb-Proof'|last=Ronan|first=Thomas P.|date=December 29, 1950|page=1|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 3, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, researchers from [[New York University]] concluded that in the event of a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]], the 190th Street station would provide adequate [[Fallout shelter|shelter]] from [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]].

Though the elevators were intended for subway riders, local residents paid the subway fare to avoid climbing about eight stories up Fort Washington Hill. Bills were proposed in the New York State Legislature to put the elevators out of fare control, but these failed in committee. The NYCTA agreed once [[Joseph Zaretzki]], the local State Senator, requested the change.<ref name=\"nyt19570906\"/>\n\nIn 2004, the number of elevator attendants at the station was reduced to one per station as a result of budget cuts by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA). The agency had intended to remove all the attendants, but kept one in each station after many riders protested. The change saved $1.2 million a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/07/nyregion/mta-urged-not-to-cut-elevator-jobs-at-5-stations.html|title=M.T.A.

The force has its own training facility as an adjunct to the operational company at INS Abhimanyu, Mumbai,<ref name=sp.com /> later as the [[Naval Special Warfare Tactical Training Centre]]. For combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the [[Naval Diving School]] in Kochi.

The new facility will be modelled on the lines of CIJWS of the Indian Army in Mizoram.<ref name=\"no\" /><ref name=red />\n\n==Further capability development==\n\n=== Integrated Combat System ===\nTo strengthen the capabilities of MARCOS to carry out special operations, the Indian Navy will procure an advanced Integrated Combat System (ICS) that will ensure an effective command, control and information-sharing structure to enhance the MARCOS' capabilities while engaging targets.<ref name=\"jagran\">{{cite news|title=Navy to procure integrated combat system for Marine Commandos|url=http://post.jagran.com/Navy-to-procure-integrated-combat-system-for-Marine-Commandos-1320833728|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=Jagran Post|date=9 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ICS will provide enhanced capabilities such as tactical awareness and the ability to fight in hostile environments, and can enable Group Commanders to remotely monitor and control operations. It will help integrate an individual sailor's capability of surveillance, ballistic protection, communication and firepower through an integrated network at individual and group level. Initiating the procurement process through a [[Request for Information]] (RFI), Navy's Directorate of Special Operations and Diving has sought details from global vendors about the ICS.<ref name=jagran />\n\nThe individual ICS equipment required by the Navy includes lightweight helmets, head-mounted displays, tactical and soft [[ballistic vest]]s along with communication equipment. The group-level gear requirements include command and control and surveillance systems, and high-speed communication equipment. The devices would have a sight for the sniper, a laser rangefinder and a long-range thermal imager and near-IR laser pointer for a combat group to undertake surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting. The ICS would be compatible with assault rifles and close-quarter combat weapons.<ref name=jagran /> The Navy has recently started acquiring the Israeli [[IMI Tavor TAR-21]] for the MARCOS.<ref name=jagran />\n\n=== Midget submarines ===\nIn 2013, Vizag-based Hindustan Shipyards Ltd won the contract for building four 500-tonne mini-submarines, which were designed by [[Larsen & Toubro]].

Bain contributes [[vocals]] and plays [[guitar]], [[synthesizer]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] for her music. As a teenager, Bain decided to pursue a career in music, having been taught music from her father during childhood. She began writing music under the moniker ''The Japanese House'' in 2012, after being introduced to Matt Healy of [[The 1975]], who offered to help produce her music under the label [[Dirty Hit]]. She first rose to prominence after the release of her first single, \"Still\", which was a critical success and premiered on [[BBC Radio 1]] presented by [[Zane Lowe]].  \n\nBain's androgynous vocals, heavy use of production, and elusive media presence fuelled fan speculation about her gender and identity after her first few singles were released. In 2015, Bain released her debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Pools to Bathe In]]'' and the follow up EP [[Clean (The Japanese House EP)|''Clean'']]. These first two EPs were rooted in [[indie pop]] and [[synth-pop]], and included experimentation with genres such as [[dream pop]], [[folktronica]], and [[electropop]]. She toured with Dirty Hit labelmates The 1975 and [[Wolf Alice]] in 2015 and 2016 before headlining tours of her own. \n\nHer fourth EP, ''[[Swim Against the Tide]]'' (2016) was influenced by 80s synthpop and [[technopop]]. ''[[Saw You in a Dream]]'' (2017) saw her continued experimentation with different genres of [[electronica]] and rock. Bain co-produced her first full-length album ''[[Good at Falling]]'' (2019) with George Daniel and American record producer [[BJ Burton]]. Her fifth EP, [[The LA Sessions|''The LA Sessions'']] (2019), featured live recordings of reimagined tracks from ''Good at Falling'' and ''Saw You in a Dream''. \n\n== Early life ==\nBain is from [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5m5vp/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-japanese-house|title=10 things you need to know about the Japanese house|last=Dunn|first=Francesca|date=2015-10-28|website=i-D|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> As a child she was taught music by her father, who was also a musician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://first-avenue.com/performer/japanese-house|title=THE JAPANESE HOUSE First Avenue|website=first-avenue.com|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> She continued practicing and recording music throughout her childhood.

Bain contributes [[vocals]] and plays [[guitar]], [[synthesizer]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] for her music. As a teenager, Bain decided to pursue a career in music, having been taught music from her father during childhood. She began writing music under the moniker ''The Japanese House'' in 2012, after being introduced to Matt Healy of [[The 1975]], who offered to help produce her music under the label [[Dirty Hit]]. She first rose to prominence after the release of her first single, \"Still\", which was a critical success and premiered on [[BBC Radio 1]] presented by [[Zane Lowe]].  \n\nBain's androgynous vocals, heavy use of production, and elusive media presence fuelled fan speculation about her gender and identity after her first few singles were released. In 2015, Bain released her debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Pools to Bathe In]]'' and the follow up EP [[Clean (The Japanese House EP)|''Clean'']]. These first two EPs were rooted in [[indie pop]] and [[synth-pop]], and included experimentation with genres such as [[dream pop]], [[folktronica]], and [[electropop]]. She toured with Dirty Hit labelmates The 1975 and [[Wolf Alice]] in 2015 and 2016 before headlining tours of her own. \n\nHer fourth EP, ''[[Swim Against the Tide]]'' (2016) was influenced by 80s synthpop and [[technopop]]. ''[[Saw You in a Dream]]'' (2017) saw her continued experimentation with different genres of [[electronica]] and rock. Bain co-produced her first full-length album ''[[Good at Falling]]'' (2019) with George Daniel and American record producer [[BJ Burton]]. Her fifth EP, [[The LA Sessions|''The LA Sessions'']] (2019), featured live recordings of reimagined tracks from ''Good at Falling'' and ''Saw You in a Dream''. \n\n== Early life ==\nBain is from [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/j5m5vp/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-japanese-house|title=10 things you need to know about the Japanese house|last=Dunn|first=Francesca|date=2015-10-28|website=i-D|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-13}}</ref> As a child she was taught music by her father, who was also a musician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://first-avenue.com/performer/japanese-house|title=THE JAPANESE HOUSE First Avenue|website=first-avenue.com|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> She continued practicing and recording music throughout her childhood.
