Some shows ask questions both on specific subjects and on general knowledge, including ''[[Eggheads (TV series)|Eggheads]]'' and ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|''Mastermind'']]''.

The relationship between general knowledge and divergent thinking became non-significant when controlling for fluid intelligence.\n\n==Game shows and quizzes==\nMany [[game shows]] use general knowledge questions. Game shows such as ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' and ''[[Fifteen to One]]'' centre their questions on general knowledge, while others shows focus questions more on specific subjects. Some shows ask questions both on specific subjects and on general knowledge, including ''[[Eggheads (TV series)|Eggheads]]'' and ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|''Mastermind'']]''. In ''Mastermind'', contestants choose their own \"specialist subject\" before answering general knowledge questions, whereas in ''Eggheads'' the subjects are chosen at random.\n[[File:Trivialpursuit Token.jpg|thumb|Questions drawn from the game [[Trivial Pursuit]] have been utilised in a number of psychological experiments concerning general knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dijksterhuis |first=A. |author2=van Knippenberg, A. |title=The relation between perception and behavior, or how to win a game of trivial pursuit |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1998 |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=865\u201377 |pmid=9569649 |url=http://www.biz.colostate.edu/MPPCWorkshop/Documents/Readings/Campbell/Campbell_DijksterhuisVanKnippenbergJPSP1998.pdf |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.4.865 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614042321/http://www.biz.colostate.edu/MPPCWorkshop/Documents/Readings/Campbell/Campbell_DijksterhuisVanKnippenbergJPSP1998.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Dijksterhuis|first=A.|title=Seeing one thing and doing another: Contrast effects in automatic behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=October 1998|volume=75|issue=4|pages=862\u2013871|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.4.862}}</ref>]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[IQ]]\n* [[Intelligence]]\n* [[High culture]]\n* [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory]]\n* [[Cultural literacy]]\n* [[Core knowledge foundation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n                        | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Most retroviruses infect [[somatic cells]], but occasional infection of [[germline]] cells (cells that produce eggs and sperm) can also occur. Rarely, retroviral integration may occur in a germline cell that goes on to develop into a viable organism. This organism will carry the inserted retroviral genome as an integral part of its own genome\u2014an \"endogenous\" retrovirus (ERV) that may be [[heredity|inherited]] by its [[offspring]] as a novel [[allele]]. Many ERVs have persisted in the genome of their hosts for millions of years. However, most of these have acquired inactivating [[mutation]]s during host [[DNA replication]] and are no longer capable of producing the virus. ERVs can also be partially excised from the genome by a process known as recombinational deletion, in which [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between the identical sequences that flank newly integrated retroviruses results in deletion of the internal, [[protein]]-coding regions of the viral genome.\n\nThe general retrovirus genome consists of three genes vital for the invasion, replication, escape, and spreading of its viral genome. These three genes are gag (encodes for structural proteins for the viral core), pol (encodes for [[reverse transcriptase]], [[integrase]], and [[protease]]), and env (encodes for [[Viral coat protein|coat protein]]s for the virus's exterior). These viral proteins are encoded as [[polyproteins]]. In order to carry out their life cycle, the retrovirus relies heavily on the host cell's machinery. Protease degrades peptide bonds of the viral polyproteins, making the separate proteins functional. Reverse transcriptase functions to synthesize viral DNA from the viral RNA in the host cell's cytoplasm before it enters the nucleus. Integrase guides the integration of viral DNA into the host genome.<ref name=\"Johnson 10254\u201310260\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujiwara T, Mizuuchi K | title = Retroviral DNA integration: structure of an integration intermediate | journal = Cell | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 497\u2013504 | date = August 1988 | pmid = 3401925 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(88)90071-2 }}</ref>\n\nOver time, the genome of ERVs not only acquire point mutations, but also shuffle and recombine with other ERVs.<ref name=\"pmid26800882\"/> ERVs with the ''env'' coat decayed become more likely to spread.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Magiorkinis |first1=G |last2=Gifford |first2=RJ |last3=Katzourakis |first3=A |last4=De Ranter |first4=J |last5=Belshaw |first5=R |title=Env-less endogenous retroviruses are genomic superspreaders. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=8 May 2012 |volume=109 |issue=19 |pages=7385\u201390 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1200913109 |pmid=22529376|pmc=3358877 }}</ref>\n\n== Role in genome evolution ==\n[[File:Integration of viral DNA into host genome.png|thumb]]\n\nEndogenous retroviruses can play an active role in shaping genomes.

An immunosuppressed condition could potentially permit a more rapid and tenacious replication of viral DNA, and would later on have less difficulty adapting to human-to-human transmission. Although known infectious pathogens present in the donor organ/tissue can be eliminated by breeding pathogen-free herds, unknown retroviruses can be present in the donor. These retroviruses are often latent and asymptomatic in the donor, but can become active in the recipient. Some examples of endogenous viruses that can infect and multiply in human cells are from baboons (BaEV), cats (RD114), and mice.<ref name=Patience97 />\n\nThere are three different classes of PERVs, PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C. PERV-A and PERV-B are [[polytropic]] and can infect human cells in vitro, while PERV-C is [[ecotropic]] and does not replicate on human cells. The major differences between the classes is in the receptor binding domain of the ''env'' protein and the long terminal repeats (LTRs) that influence the replication of each class. PERV-A and PERV-B display LTRs that have repeats in the [[Small nucleolar RNA U3|U3]] region. However, PERV-A and PERV-C show repeatless LTRs. Researchers found that PERVs in culture actively adapted to the repeat structure of their LTR in order to match the best replication performance a host cell could perform. At the end of their study, researchers concluded that repeatless PERV LTR evolved from the repeat-harboring LTR. This was likely to have occurred from insertional mutation and was proven through use of data on LTR and ''env''/Env. It is thought that the generation of repeatless LTRs could be reflective of an adaptation process of the virus, changing from an exogenous to an endogenous lifestyle.<ref name=\"T\u00f6njes03\">{{cite journal | vauthors = T\u00f6njes RR, Niebert M | title = Relative age of proviral porcine endogenous retrovirus sequences in Sus scrofa based on the molecular clock hypothesis | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 77 | issue = 22 | pages = 12363\u20138 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14581574 | pmc = 254287 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.77.22.12363-12368.2003 }}</ref>\n\nA clinical trial study performed in 1999 sampled 160 patients who were treated with different living pig tissues and observed no evidence of a persistent PERV infection in 97% of the patients for whom a sufficient amount of DNA was available to PCR for amplification of PERV sequences.

Most retroviruses infect [[somatic cells]], but occasional infection of [[germline]] cells (cells that produce eggs and sperm) can also occur. Rarely, retroviral integration may occur in a germline cell that goes on to develop into a viable organism. This organism will carry the inserted retroviral genome as an integral part of its own genome\u2014an \"endogenous\" retrovirus (ERV) that may be [[heredity|inherited]] by its [[offspring]] as a novel [[allele]]. Many ERVs have persisted in the genome of their hosts for millions of years. However, most of these have acquired inactivating [[mutation]]s during host [[DNA replication]] and are no longer capable of producing the virus. ERVs can also be partially excised from the genome by a process known as recombinational deletion, in which [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between the identical sequences that flank newly integrated retroviruses results in deletion of the internal, [[protein]]-coding regions of the viral genome.\n\nThe general retrovirus genome consists of three genes vital for the invasion, replication, escape, and spreading of its viral genome. These three genes are gag (encodes for structural proteins for the viral core), pol (encodes for [[reverse transcriptase]], [[integrase]], and [[protease]]), and env (encodes for [[Viral coat protein|coat protein]]s for the virus's exterior). These viral proteins are encoded as [[polyproteins]]. In order to carry out their life cycle, the retrovirus relies heavily on the host cell's machinery. Protease degrades peptide bonds of the viral polyproteins, making the separate proteins functional. Reverse transcriptase functions to synthesize viral DNA from the viral RNA in the host cell's cytoplasm before it enters the nucleus.

An immunosuppressed condition could potentially permit a more rapid and tenacious replication of viral DNA, and would later on have less difficulty adapting to human-to-human transmission. Although known infectious pathogens present in the donor organ/tissue can be eliminated by breeding pathogen-free herds, unknown retroviruses can be present in the donor. These retroviruses are often latent and asymptomatic in the donor, but can become active in the recipient. Some examples of endogenous viruses that can infect and multiply in human cells are from baboons (BaEV), cats (RD114), and mice.<ref name=Patience97 />\n\nThere are three different classes of PERVs, PERV-A, PERV-B, and PERV-C. PERV-A and PERV-B are [[polytropic]] and can infect human cells in vitro, while PERV-C is [[ecotropic]] and does not replicate on human cells. The major differences between the classes is in the receptor binding domain of the ''env'' protein and the long terminal repeats (LTRs) that influence the replication of each class. PERV-A and PERV-B display LTRs that have repeats in the [[Small nucleolar RNA U3|U3]] region. However, PERV-A and PERV-C show repeatless LTRs. Researchers found that PERVs in culture actively adapted to the repeat structure of their LTR in order to match the best replication performance a host cell could perform. At the end of their study, researchers concluded that repeatless PERV LTR evolved from the repeat-harboring LTR. This was likely to have occurred from insertional mutation and was proven through use of data on LTR and ''env''/Env.

The observed number of nucleotide substitutions and among the different genome sequences helped researchers determine an estimate age that PERV-A-BM was integrated into its host genome, which was found to be of an evolutionary age earlier than the European-born pigs isolates.<ref name=Tang16 />\n\n=== Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) ===\nThis technique is used to find histone marks indicative of promoters and enhancers, which are binding sites for DNA proteins, and repressed regions and trimethylation.<ref name=\"Chuong 325\u2013329\"/> DNA methylation has been shown to be vital to maintain silencing of ERVs in mouse somatic cells, while histone marks are vital for the same purpose in [[embryonic stem cells]] (ESCs) and early embryogenesis.<ref name=Rebollo12>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rebollo R, Romanish MT, Mager DL | title = Transposable elements: an abundant and natural source of regulatory sequences for host genes | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 21\u201342 | date = 2012-01-01 | pmid = 22905872 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-genet-110711-155621 | url = http://prodinra.inra.fr/ft/870D25D1-14E8-4B13-BC39-25485DA9BA5F }}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Constructing phylogenies ===\nBecause most HERVs have no function, are selectively neutral, and are very abundant in primate genomes, they easily serve as phylogenetic markers for linkage analysis. They can be exploited by comparing the integration site polymorphisms or the evolving, proviral, nucleotide sequences of orthologs. To  estimate when integration occurred, researchers used distances from each phylogenetic tree to find the rate of molecular evolution at each particular locus.  It is also useful that ERVs are rich in many species genomes (i.e. plants, insects, mollusks, fish, rodents, domestic pets, and livestock) because its application can be used to answer a variety of phylogenetic questions.<ref name=\"Johnson 10254\u201310260\"/>\n\n=== Designating the age of provirus and the time points of species separation events ===\nThis is accomplished by comparing the different HERV from different evolutionary periods. For example, this study was done for different hominoids, which ranged from humans to apes and to monkeys. This is difficult to do with PERV because of the large diversity present.<ref name=\"T\u00f6njes03\" />\n\n== Further research ==\n\n=== Epigenetic variability ===\nResearchers could analyze individual epigenomes and [[transcriptomes]] to study the reactivation of dormant transposable elements through epigenetic release and their potential associations with human disease and exploring the specifics of gene regulatory networks.<ref name=Rebollo12 />\n\n=== Immunological problems of xenotransplantation ===\nLittle is known about an effective way to overcoming [[hyperacute rejection]] (HAR), which follows the activation of complement initiated by xenoreactive antibodies recognizing galactosyl-alpha1-3galatosyl (alpha-Gal) antigens on the donor epithelium.<ref name=Patience97 />\n\n=== Risk factors of HERVs in gene therapy ===\nBecause retroviruses are able to recombine with each other and with other endogenous DNA sequences, it would be beneficial for gene therapy to explore the potential risks HERVs can cause, if any. Also, this ability of HERVs to recombine can be manipulated for site-directed integration by including HERV sequences in retroviral vectors.<ref name=\"Belshaw2004\" />\n\n=== HERV gene expression ===\nResearchers believe that RNA and proteins encoded for by HERV genes should continue to be explored for putative function in cell physiology and in pathological conditions. This would make sense to examine in order to more deeply define the biological significance of the proteins synthesized.<ref name=\"Belshaw2004\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Viruses}}\n*[[Avian sarcoma leukosis virus]] (ASLV)\n*[[Endogenous viral element]]\n*[[ERV3]]\n*[[HERV-FRD]]\n*[[Horizontal gene transfer]]\n*[[Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus]] (JSRV)\n*[[Koala retrovirus]] (KoRV)\n*[[Mouse mammary tumor virus]] (MMTV)\n*[[Murine leukemia virus]] (MLV) and [[xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus]] (XMRV)\n*[[Paleovirology]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=L\u00f6wer R, L\u00f6wer J, Kurth R | title = The viruses in all of us: characteristics and biological significance of human endogenous retrovirus sequences | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 93 | issue = 11 | pages = 5177\u201384 |date=May 1996 | pmid = 8643549 | pmc = 39218 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.11.5177 |bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.5177L }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Mol\u00e8s JP, Tesniere A, Guilhou JJ | title = A new endogenous retroviral sequence is expressed in skin of patients with psoriasis | journal = Br J Dermatol | volume = 153 | issue = 1 | pages = 83\u201389 |date=Jul 2005 | pmid = 16029331 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06555.x }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Seifarth W, Frank O, Zeilfelder U, Spiess B, Greenwood AD, Hehlmann R, Leib-M\u00f6sch C | title = Comprehensive analysis of human endogenous retrovirus transcriptional activity in human tissues with a retrovirus-specific microarray | journal = J.

Each episode follows a year in the life of morbidly [[obese]] individuals, who begin the episode weighing at least {{convert|600|lb}}, and documents their attempts to reduce their weight to a healthy level. Update episodes, called \"Where Are They Now?\", feature one or more previous patients, picking up a year or more after their original episodes aired.\n\nPatients are placed under the care of Iranian-American [[Houston]] surgeon [[Younan Nowzaradan]] (often referred to as simply \"Dr. Now\"), who first has them attempt losing weight on their own by following a strict [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and then depending on the patient's progress may offer [[gastric bypass surgery]] or [[sleeve gastrectomy]] to further assist in [[weight loss]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://people.com/bodies/my-600-lb-life-dr-nowzaradan-why-difficult-patients-keep-weight-off/ | title=My 600-Lb.

Because of its popularity, new episodes were filmed, including a \"Where Are They Now?\" retrospective in Season 4 that follows up on previous patients to track their weight-loss journey months or years after [[bariatric surgery]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/27/my-600-lb-life-where-are-they-now-video_n_1381855.html|title=\u2018My 600-lb Life: Where are They Now?\u2019: Have They Kept The Weight Off?|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Season 1, patients were filmed over a period of seven years (2004\u20132011). Beginning with Season 2, patients were filmed for only one year. In Season 8, certain patients' stories were filmed for only six months. \n\nBeginning with Season 5, new episodes began filming as 2-hour episodes instead of 1-hour. This was previously done with Melissa's Story (split into two parts) and Lupe's Story. Recap episodes titled under \"Supersized\" and \"Extended\", which include additional facts and footage respectively, also aired during this season.\n\n==Subject outcomes==\nSeven patients have died since appearing on the show.\n\n* Henry Foots, who was featured in season one, died of an illness unrelated to his weight loss surgery on May 16, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|via=Legacy.com|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/henry-foots-obituary?pid=1000000164888383|title=Henry Foots Obituary|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n* Sean Milliken, who was chronicled on the fourth season of the show, died on February 17, 2019, from an infection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/health/my-600-lb-life-sean-milliken-dead/|title=My 600-Lb.

Riverview was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1923 and became a city in 1959.\n\n==History==\nThe August 9, 1812 [[Battle of Monguagon]] between Americans and a British-Indian coalition took place in today's Riverview. Native Americans were led by the famous Shawnee warrior Tecumseh, who was wounded in the engagement. The Americans gained a tactical victory at Monguagon but suffered a strategic defeat when US forces returned to Detroit after the fight without reopening their supply line to Ohio. Much of the location remains undeveloped in a green area bounded by Pennsylvania Road to the north, Colvin Street to the south, Electric Avenue to the east, and Vreeland Park to the west, which is also part of the battlefield.\n\nIn 1950, Riverview only stretched as far west as the western end of [[Trenton, Michigan|Trenton's]] two northern boundaries.  The rest of what is today Riverview was still part of the unincorporated [[Monguagon Township, Michigan|Monguagon Township]] at that point.<ref>1950 Census.

It was placed on display in the park that now occupies the site in July 1980, though this site was never converted from the [[Nike Ajax]] missile to the Hercules missile.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.48|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|4.39|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.09|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Roads and transportation==\n===Main roads===\n[[File:Riverview_MI (Dec 2019).jpg|left|thumb|250px|Looking north along [[M-85 (Michigan highway)|Fort Street]]]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Pennsylvania Road - an important east\u2013west road on the north side of the city that also forms the boundary between Riverview and Southgate, as well as Wyandotte.

Riverview was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1923 and became a city in 1959.\n\n==History==\nThe August 9, 1812 [[Battle of Monguagon]] between Americans and a British-Indian coalition took place in today's Riverview. Native Americans were led by the famous Shawnee warrior Tecumseh, who was wounded in the engagement. The Americans gained a tactical victory at Monguagon but suffered a strategic defeat when US forces returned to Detroit after the fight without reopening their supply line to Ohio. Much of the location remains undeveloped in a green area bounded by Pennsylvania Road to the north, Colvin Street to the south, Electric Avenue to the east, and Vreeland Park to the west, which is also part of the battlefield.\n\nIn 1950, Riverview only stretched as far west as the western end of [[Trenton, Michigan|Trenton's]] two northern boundaries.  The rest of what is today Riverview was still part of the unincorporated [[Monguagon Township, Michigan|Monguagon Township]] at that point.<ref>1950 Census.
