An Opus stream can support up to 255 [[Channel (communications)|audio channels]], and it allows [[joint encoding|channel coupling]] between channels in groups of two using mid-side coding.\n\nOpus has very short [[Latency (audio)|latency]] (26.5&nbsp;ms using the default 20&nbsp;ms frames and default application setting), which makes it suitable for [[real-time computing|real-time applications]] such as [[telephony]], [[Voice over IP]] and [[videoconferencing]]; research by [[Xiph.Org Foundation|Xiph]] led to the [[CELT]] codec, which allows the highest quality while maintaining low delay. In any Opus stream, the bitrate, bandwidth, and delay can be continually varied without introducing any distortion or discontinuity; even mixing packets from different streams will cause a smooth change, rather than the distortion common in other codecs. Unlike Vorbis, Opus does not require large [[Codebook#Data compression|codebooks]] for each individual file, making it more efficient for short clips of audio and more resilient.\n\nAs an open standard, the algorithms are openly documented, and a [[reference implementation]] (including the [[source code]]) is published.

In Opus, both were modified to support more frame sizes, as well as further algorithmic improvements and integration, such as using CELT's [[range encoding|range encoder]] for both types. To minimize overhead at low bitrates, if latency is not as pressing, SILK has support for packing multiple 20&nbsp;ms frames together, sharing context and headers; SILK also allows Low Bit-Rate Redundancy (LBRR) frames, allowing low-quality packet loss recovery. CELT includes both spectral replication and noise generation, similar to AAC's SBR and PNS, and can further save bits by filtering out all harmonics of tonal sounds entirely, then replicating them in the decoder.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/celt/demo.html |title=next generation audio: CELT update 20101223 |date=December 23, 2010 |first=Christopher |last=Montgomery |authorlink=Chris Montgomery}}</ref> Better tone detection is an ongoing project to improve quality.\n\nThe format has three different modes: speech, hybrid, and CELT. When compressing speech, SILK is used for audio frequencies up to 8&nbsp;kHz. If wider bandwidth is desired, a hybrid mode uses CELT to encode the frequency range above 8&nbsp;kHz. The third mode is pure-CELT, designed for general audio. SILK is inherently VBR and cannot hit a bitrate target, while CELT can always be encoded to any specific number of bytes, enabling hybrid and CELT mode when CBR is required.\n\nSILK supports frame sizes of 10, 20, 40 and 60&nbsp;ms. CELT supports frame sizes of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20&nbsp;ms. Thus, hybrid mode only supports frame sizes of 10 and 20&nbsp;ms; frames shorter than 10&nbsp;ms will always use CELT mode. A typical Opus packet contains a single frame, but packets of up to 120&nbsp;ms are produced by combining multiple frames per packet. Opus can transparently switch between modes, frame sizes, bandwidths, and channel counts on a per-packet basis, although specific applications may choose to limit this.\n\nThe reference implementation is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and compiles on hardware architectures with or without a [[floating-point unit]], although floating-point is currently required for audio bandwidth detection (dynamic switching between SILK, CELT, and hybrid encoding) and most speed optimizations.\n\n===Containers===\nOpus packets are not self-delimiting, but are designed to be used inside a [[Container file format|container]] of some sort which supplies the decoder with each packet's length. Opus was originally specified for encapsulation in [[Ogg]] containers, specified as <code>audio/ogg; codecs=opus</code>, and for Ogg Opus files the <code>.opus</code> filename extension is recommended.<ref name=\"Ogg\" /> Opus streams are also supported in [[Matroska]],<ref name=\"Matroska\">{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.matroska.org/pipermail/matroska-users/2013-September/006883.html |title=MKVToolNix v6.4.0 released |first=Moritz |last=Bunkus |mailinglist=Matroska users |date=2013-09-16 |accessdate=2013-12-24}}</ref> [[WebM]],<ref name=webm-guidelines>{{cite web|title=WebM Container Guidelines|url=http://www.webmproject.org/docs/container/|website=The WebM Project|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> [[MPEG-TS]],<ref name=\"mpeg-ts\">{{cite web |url=https://smpte-ra.org/registered-mpeg-ts-ids |title=List of Registered MPEG TS Identifiers \u2013 SMPTE Registration Authority, LLC |date=2019-01-05 |publisher=SMPTE |accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref> and [[MP4]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vfrmaniac.fushizen.eu/contents/opus_in_isobmff.html |title=Encapsulation of Opus in ISO Base Media File Format |date=2018-08-28 |accessdate=2019-01-05}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, each Opus packet may be wrapped in a [[network packet]] which supplies the packet length.

It is based on two initially separate standard proposals from the Xiph.Org Foundation and Skype Technologies S.A. (now [[Microsoft]]). Its main developers are Jean-Marc Valin (Xiph.Org, Octasic, [[Mozilla Corporation]]), Koen Vos (Skype), and Timothy B. Terriberry (Xiph.Org, Mozilla Corporation). Among others, Juin-Hwey (Raymond) Chen ([[Broadcom]]), Gregory Maxwell (Xiph.Org, [[Wikimedia community|Wikimedia]]), and [[Christopher Montgomery]] (Xiph.Org) were also involved.\n\nThe development of the CELT part of the format goes back to thoughts on a successor for [[Vorbis]] under the working name ''Ghost''. As a newer speech codec from the Xiph.Org Foundation, Opus replaces Xiph's older speech codec [[Speex]], an earlier project of Jean-Marc Valin. CELT has been worked on since November 2007.\n\nThe SILK part has been under development at Skype since January 2007 as the successor of their [[SVOPC]], an internal project to make the company independent from third-party codecs like [[internet Speech Audio Codec|iSAC]] and [[internet Low Bitrate Codec|iLBC]] and respective license payments.\n\nIn March 2009, Skype suggested the development and standardization of a wideband audio format within the IETF. Nearly a year passed with much debate on the formation of an appropriate [[working group]].<ref name=\"WGformation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/IETF-working-towards-royalty-free-audio-codec-859394.html|title=IETF working towards royalty-free audio codec |publisher=H-online.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2016-04-07}}</ref> Representatives of several companies which were taking part in the standardization of patent-encumbered competing formats stated objections against the start of the standardization process for a royalty-free format: representatives of [[Polycom]] and [[Ericsson]]\u2014the creators and licensors of [[G.719]]\u2014as well as [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9com]], [[Huawei]] and the [[Orange Labs]] (department of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com), which were involved in the creation of [[G.718]]. The working group finally formed in February 2010, and even the corresponding Study Group 16 from the ITU-T pledged to support its work.\n\nIn July 2010, a prototype of a hybrid format was presented that combined the two proposed format candidates SILK and CELT. In September 2010, Opus was submitted to the IETF as proposal for standardization.

An Opus stream can support up to 255 [[Channel (communications)|audio channels]], and it allows [[joint encoding|channel coupling]] between channels in groups of two using mid-side coding.\n\nOpus has very short [[Latency (audio)|latency]] (26.5&nbsp;ms using the default 20&nbsp;ms frames and default application setting), which makes it suitable for [[real-time computing|real-time applications]] such as [[telephony]], [[Voice over IP]] and [[videoconferencing]]; research by [[Xiph.Org Foundation|Xiph]] led to the [[CELT]] codec, which allows the highest quality while maintaining low delay. In any Opus stream, the bitrate, bandwidth, and delay can be continually varied without introducing any distortion or discontinuity; even mixing packets from different streams will cause a smooth change, rather than the distortion common in other codecs. Unlike Vorbis, Opus does not require large [[Codebook#Data compression|codebooks]] for each individual file, making it more efficient for short clips of audio and more resilient.\n\nAs an open standard, the algorithms are openly documented, and a [[reference implementation]] (including the [[source code]]) is published. [[Broadcom]] and the Xiph.Org Foundation own [[software patent]]s on some of the CELT algorithms, and [[Skype Technologies]]/Microsoft own some on the SILK algorithms; each offers a royalty-free perpetual for use with Opus, reserving only the right to make use of their patents to defend against infringement suits of third parties. [[Qualcomm]], [[Huawei]], [[France Telecom]], and [[Ericsson]] have claimed that their patents may apply, which Xiph's legal counsel denies, and none have pursued any legal action.<ref name=\"OpusLicense\">{{cite web |url=https://www.opus-codec.org/license/ |title=Opus Codec License |publisher=Xiph.org |accessdate=2015-12-22}}</ref><ref name=\"osnews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.osnews.com/story/26892/Nokia_s_VP8_patent_claims_we_ve_been_here_before |title=Nokia's VP8 patent claims: we've been here before |publisher=OSNews |date=2013-05-25 |accessdate=2014-07-17}}</ref> The Opus license automatically and retroactively terminates for any entity that attempts to file a patent suit.\n\n[[File:FSsongmetal2-Opus-exp7.20120823-sweep.png|thumb|400px|right|[[Spectrogram]] of Opus-encoded audio as bitrate rises (~32 to ~160&nbsp;kbit/s) clearly shows lowpass behavior and better preservation of the band energy with CELT (compare [[Commons:Opus#Spectrograms in comparison|original, Vorbis, MP3, AAC]]).]]\n\nThe Opus format is based on a combination of the full-bandwidth [[CELT]] format and the speech-oriented [[SILK]] format, both heavily modified: CELT is based on the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) that most music codecs use, using [[Code-excited linear prediction|CELP]] techniques in the frequency domain for better prediction, while SILK uses [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC) and an optional Long-Term Prediction filter to model speech. In Opus, both were modified to support more frame sizes, as well as further algorithmic improvements and integration, such as using CELT's [[range encoding|range encoder]] for both types. To minimize overhead at low bitrates, if latency is not as pressing, SILK has support for packing multiple 20&nbsp;ms frames together, sharing context and headers; SILK also allows Low Bit-Rate Redundancy (LBRR) frames, allowing low-quality packet loss recovery. CELT includes both spectral replication and noise generation, similar to AAC's SBR and PNS, and can further save bits by filtering out all harmonics of tonal sounds entirely, then replicating them in the decoder.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/celt/demo.html |title=next generation audio: CELT update 20101223 |date=December 23, 2010 |first=Christopher |last=Montgomery |authorlink=Chris Montgomery}}</ref> Better tone detection is an ongoing project to improve quality.\n\nThe format has three different modes: speech, hybrid, and CELT. When compressing speech, SILK is used for audio frequencies up to 8&nbsp;kHz. If wider bandwidth is desired, a hybrid mode uses CELT to encode the frequency range above 8&nbsp;kHz. The third mode is pure-CELT, designed for general audio. SILK is inherently VBR and cannot hit a bitrate target, while CELT can always be encoded to any specific number of bytes, enabling hybrid and CELT mode when CBR is required.\n\nSILK supports frame sizes of 10, 20, 40 and 60&nbsp;ms. CELT supports frame sizes of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20&nbsp;ms. Thus, hybrid mode only supports frame sizes of 10 and 20&nbsp;ms; frames shorter than 10&nbsp;ms will always use CELT mode. A typical Opus packet contains a single frame, but packets of up to 120&nbsp;ms are produced by combining multiple frames per packet. Opus can transparently switch between modes, frame sizes, bandwidths, and channel counts on a per-packet basis, although specific applications may choose to limit this.\n\nThe reference implementation is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and compiles on hardware architectures with or without a [[floating-point unit]], although floating-point is currently required for audio bandwidth detection (dynamic switching between SILK, CELT, and hybrid encoding) and most speed optimizations.\n\n===Containers===\nOpus packets are not self-delimiting, but are designed to be used inside a [[Container file format|container]] of some sort which supplies the decoder with each packet's length.

It is based on two initially separate standard proposals from the Xiph.Org Foundation and Skype Technologies S.A. (now [[Microsoft]]). Its main developers are Jean-Marc Valin (Xiph.Org, Octasic, [[Mozilla Corporation]]), Koen Vos (Skype), and Timothy B. Terriberry (Xiph.Org, Mozilla Corporation). Among others, Juin-Hwey (Raymond) Chen ([[Broadcom]]), Gregory Maxwell (Xiph.Org, [[Wikimedia community|Wikimedia]]), and [[Christopher Montgomery]] (Xiph.Org) were also involved.\n\nThe development of the CELT part of the format goes back to thoughts on a successor for [[Vorbis]] under the working name ''Ghost''. As a newer speech codec from the Xiph.Org Foundation, Opus replaces Xiph's older speech codec [[Speex]], an earlier project of Jean-Marc Valin. CELT has been worked on since November 2007.\n\nThe SILK part has been under development at Skype since January 2007 as the successor of their [[SVOPC]], an internal project to make the company independent from third-party codecs like [[internet Speech Audio Codec|iSAC]] and [[internet Low Bitrate Codec|iLBC]] and respective license payments.\n\nIn March 2009, Skype suggested the development and standardization of a wideband audio format within the IETF. Nearly a year passed with much debate on the formation of an appropriate [[working group]].<ref name=\"WGformation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/IETF-working-towards-royalty-free-audio-codec-859394.html|title=IETF working towards royalty-free audio codec |publisher=H-online.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2016-04-07}}</ref> Representatives of several companies which were taking part in the standardization of patent-encumbered competing formats stated objections against the start of the standardization process for a royalty-free format: representatives of [[Polycom]] and [[Ericsson]]\u2014the creators and licensors of [[G.719]]\u2014as well as [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9com]], [[Huawei]] and the [[Orange Labs]] (department of France T\u00e9l\u00e9com), which were involved in the creation of [[G.718]]. The working group finally formed in February 2010, and even the corresponding Study Group 16 from the ITU-T pledged to support its work.\n\nIn July 2010, a prototype of a hybrid format was presented that combined the two proposed format candidates SILK and CELT. In September 2010, Opus was submitted to the IETF as proposal for standardization.

Xiph's reference implementation is called ''libopus'' and a package called ''opus-tools'' provides command-line encoder and decoder utilities. It is published under the terms of a [[BSD licenses|BSD-like license]]. It is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and can be compiled for hardware architectures with or without a [[floating-point unit]]. The accompanying diagnostic tool ''opusinfo'' reports detailed technical information about Opus files, including information on the standard compliance of the bitstream format. It is based on ''ogginfo'' from the ''vorbis-tools'' and therefore&nbsp;\u2014 unlike the encoder and decoder&nbsp;\u2014 is available under the terms of version 2 of the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].\n\n===Implementations===\n{{IETF RFC|6716}} contains a complete source code for the reference implementation written in C.

From their homelands near the [[Aral Sea]], the Seljuks advanced first into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and then into mainland [[Persia]], before eventually capturing [[Baghdad]] and conquering eastern Anatolia. Here the Seljuks won the [[battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the [[Byzantine Empire]], which became one of the reasons for the [[first crusade]] (1095-1099). From c. 1150-1250, the Seljuk empire declined, and was invaded by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] around 1260. The Mongols divided Anatolia into [[emirate]]s. Eventually one of these, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], would conquer the rest.\n\n[[Seljuk (warlord)|Seljuk]] gave his name to both the empire and the [[Seljuk dynasty]].

The Seljuk rulers, to be sure, who were in contact with not only Muslim Persian civilization, but also with the Arab civilizations in al-jazlra and Syria\u2014indeed, with all Muslim peoples as far as India\u2014also had connections with {various} Byzantine courts. Some of these rulers, like the great 'Ala' al-Dln Kai-Qubad I himself, who married Byzantine princesses and thus strengthened relations with their neighbors to the west, lived for many years in Byzantium and became very familiar with the customs and ceremonial at the Byzantine court. Still, this close contact with the ancient Greco-Roman and Christian traditions only resulted in their adoption of a policy of tolerance toward art, aesthetic life, painting, music, independent thought\u2014in short, toward those things that were frowned upon by the narrow and piously ascetic views {of their subjects}. The contact of the common people with the Greeks and Armenians had basically the same result. [Before coming to Anatolia,] the Turkmens had been in contact with many nations and had long shown their ability to synthesize the artistic elements that thev had adopted from these nations. When they settled in Anatolia, they encountered peoples with whom they had not yet been in contact and immediately established relations with them as well. Ala al-Din Kai-Qubad I established ties with the Genoese and, especially, the Venetians at the ports of Sinop and Antalya, which belonged to him, and granted them commercial and legal concessions. Meanwhile, the Mongol invasion, which caused a great number of scholars and artisans to flee from Turkmenistan, Iran, and Khwarazm and settle within the Empire of the Seljuks of Anatolia, resulted in a reinforcing of Persian influence on the Anatolian Turks. Indeed, despite all claims to the contrary, there is no question that Persian influence was paramount among the Seljuks of Anatolia. This is clearly revealed by the fact that the sultans who ascended the throne after Ghiyath al-Din Kai-Khusraw I assumed titles taken from ancient Persian mythology, like Kai-Khusraw, Kai-Ka us, and Kai-Qubad; and that. Ala' al-Din Kai-Qubad I had some passages from the Shahname inscribed on the walls of Konya and Sivas. When we take into consideration domestic life in the Konya courts and the sincerity of the favor and attachment of the rulers to Persian poets and Persian literature, then this fact [i.e., the importance of Persian influence] is undeniable. With regard to the private lives of the rulers, their amusements, and palace ceremonial, the most definite influence was also that of Iran, mixed with the early Turkish traditions, and not that of Byzantium.\"\n* Stephen P.

Golden. Otto Harrasowitz, 1992). pg 386: \"Turkic penetration probably began in the Hunnic era and its aftermath. Steady pressure from Turkic nomads was typical of the Khazar era, although there are no unambiguous references to permanent settlements. These most certainly occurred with the arrival of the Oguz in the 11th century. The Turkicization of much of Azarbayjan, according to Soviet scholars, was completed largely during the Ilxanid period if not by late Seljuk times. Sumer, placing a slightly different emphasis on the data (more correct in my view), posts three periods which Turkicization took place: Seljuk, Mongol and Post-Mongol (Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu and Safavid). In the first two, Oguz Turkic tribes advanced or were driven to the western frontiers (Anatolia) and Northern Azarbaijan (Arran, the Mugan steppe). In the last period, the Turkic elements in Iran (derived from Oguz, with lesser admixture of Uygur, Qipchaq, Qaluq and other Turks brought to Iran during the Chinggisid era, as well as Turkicized Mongols) were joined now by Anatolian Turks migrating back to Iran. This marked the final stage of Turkicization. Although there is some evidence for the presence of Qipchaqs among the Turkic tribes coming to this region, there is little doubt that the critical mass which brought about this linguistic shift was provided by the same Oguz-Turkmen tribes that had come to Anatolia. The Azeris of today are an overwhelmingly sedentary, detribalized people. Anthropologically, they are little distinguished from the Iranian neighbors.\"\n* John Perry: \"We should distinguish two complementary ways in which the advent of the Turks affected the language map of Iran. First, since the Turkish-speaking rulers of most Iranian polities from the Ghaznavids and Seljuks onward were already Iranized and patronized Persian literature in their domains, the expansion of Turk-ruled empires served to expand the territorial domain of written Persian into the conquered areas, notably Anatolia and Central and South Asia. Secondly, the influx of massive Turkish-speaking populations (culminating with the rank and file of the Mongol armies) and their settlement in large areas of Iran (particularly in Azerbaijan and the northwest), progressively turkicized local speakers of Persian, Kurdish and other Iranian languages\"\n(John Perry. \"The Historical Role of Turkish in Relation to Persian of Iran\". ''Iran & the Caucasus'', Vol. 5, (2001), pp. 193\u2013200.)\n* According to C.E. Bosworth:\n\"The eastern Caucasus came under Saljuq control in the middle years of the 5th/11th century, and in c. 468/1075-56 Sultan Alp Arsl\u0101n sent his slave commander \u02bfEm\u0101d-al-d\u012bn Savtigin as governor of Azerbaijan and Arr\u0101n, displacing the last Shaddadids. From this period begins the increasing Turkicization of Arr\u0101n, under the Saljuqs and then under the line of Eldig\u00fczid or Ilde\u00f1izid Atabegs, who had to defend eastern Transcaucasia against the attacks of the resurgent Georgian kings. The influx of Oghuz and other T\u00fcrkmens was accentuated by the Mongol invasions. Barda\u02bfa had never revived fully after the R\u016bs sacking, and is little mentioned in the sources.\"\n(C.E. Bsowrth, Arran in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica'')\n* According to Fridrik Thordarson:\n\"Iranian influence on Caucasian languages. There is general agreement that Iranian languages predominated in Azerbaijan from the 1st millennium b.c. until the advent of the Turks in a.d. the 11th century (see Menges, pp. 41\u201342; Camb. Hist. Iran IV, pp. 226\u2013228, and VI, pp. 950\u2013952).

Maliksh\u0101h I was succeeded in Anatolia by [[Kilij Arslan I]], who founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]], and in [[Syria]] by his brother [[Tutush I]]. In [[Persia]] he was succeeded by his son [[Nasir ad-Din Mahmud I|Mahmud I]], whose reign was contested by his other three brothers [[Barkiyaruq]] in [[Iraq]], Muhammad I in [[Baghdad]], and [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. When Tutush I died, his sons [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan]] and [[Duqaq (Seljuk ruler of Damascus)|Duqaq]] inherited [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] respectively and contested with each other as well, further dividing Syria amongst emirs antagonistic towards each other.\n\nIn 1118, the third son [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar]] took over the empire. His nephew, the son of Muhammad I, did not recognize his claim to the throne, and [[Mahmud II of Seljuq|Mahmud II]] proclaimed himself Sultan and established a capital in Baghdad, until 1131 when he was finally officially deposed by Ahmad Sanjar.\n\nElsewhere in nominal Seljuq territory were the [[Artuqids]] in northeastern Syria and northern [[Mesopotamia]]; they controlled [[Jerusalem]] until 1098. The [[Danishmend|D\u0101ni\u0161mand]] dynasty founded a state in eastern Anatolia and northern Syria and contested land with the [[Sultanate of Rum]], and [[Kerbogha]] exercised independence as the [[atabeg]] of [[Mosul]].\n\n== First Crusade (1095-1099) ==\n{{Main|First Crusade|Georgian\u2013Seljuk wars}}\n\nDuring the [[First Crusade]], the fractured states of the Seljuqs were generally more concerned with consolidating their own territories and gaining control of their neighbours than with cooperating against the [[crusade]]rs. The Seljuqs easily defeated the [[People's Crusade]] arriving in 1096, but they could not stop the progress of the army of the subsequent [[Princes' Crusade]], which took important cities such as [[Nicaea]] ([[\u0130znik]]), [[Iconium]] ([[Konya]]), [[Caesarea Mazaca]] ([[Kayseri]]), and [[Antioch]] ([[Antakya]]) on its march to [[Jerusalem]] ([[Al-Quds]]). In 1099 the crusaders finally captured the [[Holy Land]] and set up the first [[Crusader states]]. The Seljuqs had already lost [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to the [[Fatimid]]s, who had recaptured it just before its capture by the crusaders.\n\n\n\nAfter pillaging the [[County of Edessa]], Seljuqid commander [[Ilghazi]] made peace with the Crusaders. In 1121 he went north towards Georgia and with supposedly up to 250 000 - 350 000 troops, including men led by his son-in-law Sadaqah and Sultan Malik of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], he invaded the [[Kingdom of Georgia]].<ref name=\"armchairgeneral.com\">{{cite web |url = http://www.armchairgeneral.com/miraculous-victory-battle-of-didgori-1121.htm/2 |title='Miraculous Victory:' Battle of Didgori, 1121 |last=Mikaberidze|first=Alexander|date=|publisher=Armchair General|access-date=2012-10-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=AOyJtA0dYVUC |page=47 }}|title=Nomads in the Sedentary World|author=Anatol Khazanov|date=|access-date=2012-10-20 }}</ref> [[David IV of Georgia]] gathered 40,000 Georgian warriors, including 5,000 [[monaspa]] guards, 15,000 [[Kipchaks]], 300 Alans and 100 French Crusaders to fight against [[Ilghazi]]'s vast army. The [[Battle of Didgori]] was fought between the armies of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and the Seljuk Empire, on August 12, 1121. As a result, the Seljuks were routed and fled from the battlefield, being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. The Didgori battle helped the Crusader states, which had been under the pressure of Ilghazi's armies. The weakening of the main enemy of the Latin principalities was beneficial for the Kingdom of Jerusalem under King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]].\n\n== Second Crusade (1147-1149) ==\n{{See also|Second Crusade|Zengid dynasty|Nur ad-Din Zangi}}\nDuring this time conflict with the [[Crusader states]] was also intermittent, and after the First Crusade increasingly independent atabegs would frequently ally with the Crusader states against other atabegs as they vied with each other for territory. At Mosul, [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]] succeeded [[Kerbogha]] as atabeg and successfully began the process of consolidating the atabegs of Syria. In 1144 Zengi captured [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|Edessa]], as the [[County of Edessa]] had allied itself with the [[Artuqids]] against him. This event triggered the launch of the Second Crusade. [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], one of Zengi's sons who succeeded him as atabeg of [[Aleppo]], created an alliance in the region to oppose the Second Crusade, which landed in 1147.\n\n== Decline ==\n[[Ahmad Sanjar]] fought to contain the revolts by the [[Kara-Khanid]]s in [[Transoxiana]], [[Ghurid]]s in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Qarluk]]s in modern [[Kyrghyzstan]], as well as the nomadic invasion of the [[Kara-Khitai]]s in the east. The advancing Kara-Khitais first defeated the Eastern Kara-Khanids, then followed up by crushing the Western Kara-Khanids, who were vassals of the Seljuqs at [[Khujand]]. The Kara-Khanids turned to their overlord the Seljuqs for assistance, to which Sanjar responded by personally leading an army against the Kara-Khitai. However, Sanjar's army was decisively defeated by the host of [[Yelu Dashi]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] on September 9, 1141. While Sanjar managed to escape with his life, many of his close kin including his wife were taken captive in the battle's aftermath. As a result of Sanjar's failure to deal with the encroaching threat from the east, the Seljuq Empire lost all its eastern provinces up to the river [[Syr Darya]], and vassalage of the Western Kara-Khanids was usurped by the Kara-Khitai, otherwise known as the Western Liao in Chinese historiography.<ref>Biran, Michel, ''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History'', (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 44.</ref>\n\n== Conquest by Khwarezm and the Ayyubids ==\n{{See also|Saladin|Ayyubids|Khwarezmid Empire}}\nIn 1153, the [[Ghuzz]] (Oghuz Turks) rebelled and captured Sanjar. He managed to escape after three years but died a year later. The atabegs, such as [[Zengids]] and [[Artuqids]], were only nominally under the Seljuk Sultan, and generally controlled Syria independently. When [[Ahmad Sanjar]] died in 1157, this fractured the empire even further and rendered the atabegs effectively independent.\n\n# Khorasani Seljuqs in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and Transoxiana.

In time, Saladin rebelled against [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], and, upon his death, Saladin married his widow and captured most of Syria and created the [[Ayyubid]] dynasty.\n\nOn other fronts, the [[Georgia (country)#Antiquity|Kingdom of Georgia]] began to become a regional power and extended its borders at the expense of Great Seljuk. The same was true during the revival of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] under [[Leo II of Armenia]] in Anatolia. The [[Abbasid]] caliph [[An-Nasir]] also began to reassert the authority of the caliph and allied himself with the Khwarezmshah [[Takash]].\n\nFor a brief period, [[Toghrul III of Seljuq|Togrul III]] was the Sultan of all Seljuq except for Anatolia. In 1194, however, Togrul was defeated by [[Takash]], the Shah of [[Khwarezmid Empire]], and the Seljuq Empire finally collapsed. Of the former Seljuq Empire, only the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] in [[Anatolia]] remained.\n\nAs the dynasty declined in the middle of the thirteenth century, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] invaded [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|Anatolia]] in the 1260s and divided it into small [[emirate]]s called the [[Anatolian beyliks]]. Eventually one of these, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], would rise to power and conquer the rest.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Seljuqs were educated in the service of Muslim courts as slaves or mercenaries. The dynasty brought revival, energy, and reunion to the Islamic civilization hitherto dominated by Arabs and Persians.\n\nThe Seljuqs founded universities and were also patrons of art and literature. Their reign is characterized by [[Persian people|Persian]] astronomers such as [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]], and the [[Persian people|Persian]] philosopher [[al-Ghazali]]. Under the Seljuqs, [[New Persian]] became the language for historical recording, while the center of Arabic language culture shifted from Baghdad to [[Cairo]].<ref>Andre Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of

From their homelands near the [[Aral Sea]], the Seljuks advanced first into [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and then into mainland [[Persia]], before eventually capturing [[Baghdad]] and conquering eastern Anatolia. Here the Seljuks won the [[battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the [[Byzantine Empire]], which became one of the reasons for the [[first crusade]] (1095-1099). From c. 1150-1250, the Seljuk empire declined, and was invaded by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] around 1260. The Mongols divided Anatolia into [[emirate]]s. Eventually one of these, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], would conquer the rest.\n\n[[Seljuk (warlord)|Seljuk]] gave his name to both the empire and the [[Seljuk dynasty]]. The Seljuks united the fractured political landscape of the eastern [[Islamic world]] and played a key role in the first and [[Second Crusade|second]] crusades.

The process of Persianization accelerated in the thirteenth century with the presence in Konya of two of the most distinguished refugees fleeing before the Mongols, Bah\u0101' al-D\u012bn Walad and his son Mawl\u0101n\u0101 Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b, whose ''Mathnaw\u012b'', composed in Konya, constitutes one of the crowning glories of classical Persian literature.\"\n* Mehmed Fuad K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, \"Early Mystics in Turkish Literature\", Translated by Gary Leiser and Robert Dankoff, Routledge, 2006, p. 149: \"If we wish to sketch, in broad outline, the civilization created by the Seljuks of Anatolia, we must recognize that the local\u2014i.e., non-Muslim, element was fairly insignificant compared to the Turkish and Arab-Persian elements, and that the Persian element was paramount. The Seljuk rulers, to be sure, who were in contact with not only Muslim Persian civilization, but also with the Arab civilizations in al-jazlra and Syria\u2014indeed, with all Muslim peoples as far as India\u2014also had connections with {various} Byzantine courts. Some of these rulers, like the great 'Ala' al-Dln Kai-Qubad I himself, who married Byzantine princesses and thus strengthened relations with their neighbors to the west, lived for many years in Byzantium and became very familiar with the customs and ceremonial at the Byzantine court. Still, this close contact with the ancient Greco-Roman and Christian traditions only resulted in their adoption of a policy of tolerance toward art, aesthetic life, painting, music, independent thought\u2014in short, toward those things that were frowned upon by the narrow and piously ascetic views {of their subjects}. The contact of the common people with the Greeks and Armenians had basically the same result. [Before coming to Anatolia,] the Turkmens had been in contact with many nations and had long shown their ability to synthesize the artistic elements that thev had adopted from these nations. When they settled in Anatolia, they encountered peoples with whom they had not yet been in contact and immediately established relations with them as well. Ala al-Din Kai-Qubad I established ties with the Genoese and, especially, the Venetians at the ports of Sinop and Antalya, which belonged to him, and granted them commercial and legal concessions. Meanwhile, the Mongol invasion, which caused a great number of scholars and artisans to flee from Turkmenistan, Iran, and Khwarazm and settle within the Empire of the Seljuks of Anatolia, resulted in a reinforcing of Persian influence on the Anatolian Turks. Indeed, despite all claims to the contrary, there is no question that Persian influence was paramount among the Seljuks of Anatolia. This is clearly revealed by the fact that the sultans who ascended the throne after Ghiyath al-Din Kai-Khusraw I assumed titles taken from ancient Persian mythology, like Kai-Khusraw, Kai-Ka us, and Kai-Qubad; and that. Ala' al-Din Kai-Qubad I had some passages from the Shahname inscribed on the walls of Konya and Sivas. When we take into consideration domestic life in the Konya courts and the sincerity of the favor and attachment of the rulers to Persian poets and Persian literature, then this fact [i.e., the importance of Persian influence] is undeniable. With regard to the private lives of the rulers, their amusements, and palace ceremonial, the most definite influence was also that of Iran, mixed with the early Turkish traditions, and not that of Byzantium.\"\n* Stephen P.

Golden. Otto Harrasowitz, 1992). pg 386: \"Turkic penetration probably began in the Hunnic era and its aftermath. Steady pressure from Turkic nomads was typical of the Khazar era, although there are no unambiguous references to permanent settlements. These most certainly occurred with the arrival of the Oguz in the 11th century. The Turkicization of much of Azarbayjan, according to Soviet scholars, was completed largely during the Ilxanid period if not by late Seljuk times. Sumer, placing a slightly different emphasis on the data (more correct in my view), posts three periods which Turkicization took place: Seljuk, Mongol and Post-Mongol (Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu and Safavid). In the first two, Oguz Turkic tribes advanced or were driven to the western frontiers (Anatolia) and Northern Azarbaijan (Arran, the Mugan steppe). In the last period, the Turkic elements in Iran (derived from Oguz, with lesser admixture of Uygur, Qipchaq, Qaluq and other Turks brought to Iran during the Chinggisid era, as well as Turkicized Mongols) were joined now by Anatolian Turks migrating back to Iran. This marked the final stage of Turkicization. Although there is some evidence for the presence of Qipchaqs among the Turkic tribes coming to this region, there is little doubt that the critical mass which brought about this linguistic shift was provided by the same Oguz-Turkmen tribes that had come to Anatolia. The Azeris of today are an overwhelmingly sedentary, detribalized people. Anthropologically, they are little distinguished from the Iranian neighbors.\"\n* John Perry: \"We should distinguish two complementary ways in which the advent of the Turks affected the language map of Iran. First, since the Turkish-speaking rulers of most Iranian polities from the Ghaznavids and Seljuks onward were already Iranized and patronized Persian literature in their domains, the expansion of Turk-ruled empires served to expand the territorial domain of written Persian into the conquered areas, notably Anatolia and Central and South Asia. Secondly, the influx of massive Turkish-speaking populations (culminating with the rank and file of the Mongol armies) and their settlement in large areas of Iran (particularly in Azerbaijan and the northwest), progressively turkicized local speakers of Persian, Kurdish and other Iranian languages\"\n(John Perry. \"The Historical Role of Turkish in Relation to Persian of Iran\". ''Iran & the Caucasus'', Vol. 5, (2001), pp. 193\u2013200.)\n* According to C.E. Bosworth:\n\"The eastern Caucasus came under Saljuq control in the middle years of the 5th/11th century, and in c. 468/1075-56 Sultan Alp Arsl\u0101n sent his slave commander \u02bfEm\u0101d-al-d\u012bn Savtigin as governor of Azerbaijan and Arr\u0101n, displacing the last Shaddadids. From this period begins the increasing Turkicization of Arr\u0101n, under the Saljuqs and then under the line of Eldig\u00fczid or Ilde\u00f1izid Atabegs, who had to defend eastern Transcaucasia against the attacks of the resurgent Georgian kings. The influx of Oghuz and other T\u00fcrkmens was accentuated by the Mongol invasions. Barda\u02bfa had never revived fully after the R\u016bs sacking, and is little mentioned in the sources.\"\n(C.E. Bsowrth, Arran in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica'')\n* According to Fridrik Thordarson:\n\"Iranian influence on Caucasian languages. There is general agreement that Iranian languages predominated in Azerbaijan from the 1st millennium b.c. until the advent of the Turks in a.d. the 11th century (see Menges, pp. 41\u201342; Camb. Hist. Iran IV, pp. 226\u2013228, and VI, pp. 950\u2013952).

When Tutush I died, his sons [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan|Radwan]] and [[Duqaq (Seljuk ruler of Damascus)|Duqaq]] inherited [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] respectively and contested with each other as well, further dividing Syria amongst emirs antagonistic towards each other.\n\nIn 1118, the third son [[Ahmed Sanjar|Ahmad Sanjar]] took over the empire. His nephew, the son of Muhammad I, did not recognize his claim to the throne, and [[Mahmud II of Seljuq|Mahmud II]] proclaimed himself Sultan and established a capital in Baghdad, until 1131 when he was finally officially deposed by Ahmad Sanjar.\n\nElsewhere in nominal Seljuq territory were the [[Artuqids]] in northeastern Syria and northern [[Mesopotamia]]; they controlled [[Jerusalem]] until 1098. The [[Danishmend|D\u0101ni\u0161mand]] dynasty founded a state in eastern Anatolia and northern Syria and contested land with the [[Sultanate of Rum]], and [[Kerbogha]] exercised independence as the [[atabeg]] of [[Mosul]].\n\n== First Crusade (1095-1099) ==\n{{Main|First Crusade|Georgian\u2013Seljuk wars}}\n\nDuring the [[First Crusade]], the fractured states of the Seljuqs were generally more concerned with consolidating their own territories and gaining control of their neighbours than with cooperating against the [[crusade]]rs. The Seljuqs easily defeated the [[People's Crusade]] arriving in 1096, but they could not stop the progress of the army of the subsequent [[Princes' Crusade]], which took important cities such as [[Nicaea]] ([[\u0130znik]]), [[Iconium]] ([[Konya]]), [[Caesarea Mazaca]] ([[Kayseri]]), and [[Antioch]] ([[Antakya]]) on its march to [[Jerusalem]] ([[Al-Quds]]).

The [[Battle of Didgori]] was fought between the armies of the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] and the Seljuk Empire, on August 12, 1121. As a result, the Seljuks were routed and fled from the battlefield, being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. The Didgori battle helped the Crusader states, which had been under the pressure of Ilghazi's armies. The weakening of the main enemy of the Latin principalities was beneficial for the Kingdom of Jerusalem under King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]].\n\n== Second Crusade (1147-1149) ==\n{{See also|Second Crusade|Zengid dynasty|Nur ad-Din Zangi}}\nDuring this time conflict with the [[Crusader states]] was also intermittent, and after the First Crusade increasingly independent atabegs would frequently ally with the Crusader states against other atabegs as they vied with each other for territory. At Mosul, [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]] succeeded [[Kerbogha]] as atabeg and successfully began the process of consolidating the atabegs of Syria. In 1144 Zengi captured [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|Edessa]], as the [[County of Edessa]] had allied itself with the [[Artuqids]] against him. This event triggered the launch of the Second Crusade. [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], one of Zengi's sons who succeeded him as atabeg of [[Aleppo]], created an alliance in the region to oppose the Second Crusade, which landed in 1147.\n\n== Decline ==\n[[Ahmad Sanjar]] fought to contain the revolts by the [[Kara-Khanid]]s in [[Transoxiana]], [[Ghurid]]s in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Qarluk]]s in modern [[Kyrghyzstan]], as well as the nomadic invasion of the [[Kara-Khitai]]s in the east. The advancing Kara-Khitais first defeated the Eastern Kara-Khanids, then followed up by crushing the Western Kara-Khanids, who were vassals of the Seljuqs at [[Khujand]]. The Kara-Khanids turned to their overlord the Seljuqs for assistance, to which Sanjar responded by personally leading an army against the Kara-Khitai. However, Sanjar's army was decisively defeated by the host of [[Yelu Dashi]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] on September 9, 1141. While Sanjar managed to escape with his life, many of his close kin including his wife were taken captive in the battle's aftermath. As a result of Sanjar's failure to deal with the encroaching threat from the east, the Seljuq Empire lost all its eastern provinces up to the river [[Syr Darya]], and vassalage of the Western Kara-Khanids was usurped by the Kara-Khitai, otherwise known as the Western Liao in Chinese historiography.<ref>Biran, Michel, ''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History'', (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 44.</ref>\n\n== Conquest by Khwarezm and the Ayyubids ==\n{{See also|Saladin|Ayyubids|Khwarezmid Empire}}\nIn 1153, the [[Ghuzz]] (Oghuz Turks) rebelled and captured Sanjar. He managed to escape after three years but died a year later. The atabegs, such as [[Zengids]] and [[Artuqids]], were only nominally under the Seljuk Sultan, and generally controlled Syria independently. When [[Ahmad Sanjar]] died in 1157, this fractured the empire even further and rendered the atabegs effectively independent.\n\n# Khorasani Seljuqs in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and Transoxiana.

In time, Saladin rebelled against [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]], and, upon his death, Saladin married his widow and captured most of Syria and created the [[Ayyubid]] dynasty.\n\nOn other fronts, the [[Georgia (country)#Antiquity|Kingdom of Georgia]] began to become a regional power and extended its borders at the expense of Great Seljuk. The same was true during the revival of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] under [[Leo II of Armenia]] in Anatolia. The [[Abbasid]] caliph [[An-Nasir]] also began to reassert the authority of the caliph and allied himself with the Khwarezmshah [[Takash]].\n\nFor a brief period, [[Toghrul III of Seljuq|Togrul III]] was the Sultan of all Seljuq except for Anatolia. In 1194, however, Togrul was defeated by [[Takash]], the Shah of [[Khwarezmid Empire]], and the Seljuq Empire finally collapsed. Of the former Seljuq Empire, only the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] in [[Anatolia]] remained.\n\nAs the dynasty declined in the middle of the thirteenth century, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] invaded [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|Anatolia]] in the 1260s and divided it into small [[emirate]]s called the [[Anatolian beyliks]]. Eventually one of these, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], would rise to power and conquer the rest.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Seljuqs were educated in the service of Muslim courts as slaves or mercenaries. The dynasty brought revival, energy, and reunion to the Islamic civilization hitherto dominated by Arabs and Persians.\n\nThe Seljuqs founded universities and were also patrons of art and literature. Their reign is characterized by [[Persian people|Persian]] astronomers such as [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]], and the [[Persian people|Persian]] philosopher [[al-Ghazali]]. Under the Seljuqs, [[New Persian]] became the language for historical recording, while the center of Arabic language culture shifted from Baghdad to [[Cairo]].<ref>Andre Wink, ''Al-Hind: The Making of

plants for agricultural purposes in Africa occurred in the [[Sahel]] region circa 5000 BCE, when [[sorghum]] and [[Oryza glaberrima|African Rice]] (''Oryza glaberrima'') began to be cultivated. Around this time, and in the same region, [[Fonio]] and the small [[guineafowl]] were domesticated.\n\nAround 4000 BCE the climate of the Sahara and the Sahel started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace. This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more humid climate of West Africa.<ref>O'Brien, Patrick K.

[[Khat]], [[ensete]], [[noog]], [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] were also domesticated in the Ethiopian highlands. Crops domesticated in the Sahel region include [[sorghum]] and [[pearl millet]]. The [[kola nut]], extracts from which became an ingredient in [[Coca-Cola]], was first domesticated in West Africa.

There was ''[[Kokanee salmon|kokanee]]'', a freshwater fish in the [[Lake Washington]] and [[Lake Sammamish]] watersheds.  [[Shellfish]] were abundant.  [[Butter clams]], [[horse clams]], and [[Lolium temulentum|cockles]] were dried for trade.\n\nHunting was specialized; professions were probably sea hunters, land hunters, and fowlers.  Water fowl were captured on moonless nights using strategic flares.\n\nThe managed [[grassland]]s not only provided game habitat, but vegetable sprouts, roots, bulbs, berries, and nuts were foraged from them as well as found wild.  The most important were probably [[bracken]] and [[Camassia|camas]], and [[Sagittaria|wapato]] especially for the [[Duwamish (tribe)|Duwamish]].  Many, many varieties of berries were foraged; some were harvested with comblike devices not reportedly used elsewhere.  [[Acorn]]s were relished but were not widely available.

Around this time, and in the same region, [[Fonio]] and the small [[guineafowl]] were domesticated.\n\nAround 4000 BCE the climate of the Sahara and the Sahel started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace. This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more humid climate of West Africa.<ref>O'Brien, Patrick K.

It portrayed slavery as more benevolent than cruel, alleging that it taught [[Christianity]] and \"civilization.\" Stories of happy slaves were often used as propaganda in an effort to defend slavery; the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] had a \"Faithful Slave Memorial Committee,\" and erected the [[Heyward Shepherd monument]] in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]]. These stories would be used to explain slavery to Northerners. Many times they also portrayed slave owners being kind to their slaves.

Pollard]], ''The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates''.<ref>Ulbrich, p. 1221.</ref> Pollard promotes many of the aforementioned themes of the Lost Cause. In particular, he dismisses the role of slavery in starting the war and understates the cruelty of American slavery, even promoting it as a way of improving the lives of Africans:\n\n{{quote|We shall not enter upon the discussion of the moral question of slavery. But we may suggest a doubt here whether that odious term \"slavery\" which has been so long imposed, by the exaggeration of Northern writers, upon the judgement and sympathies of the world, is properly applied to that system of servitude in the South, which was really the mildest in the world; which did not rest on acts of debasement and disenfranchisement, but elevated the African, and was in the interest of human improvement; and which, by the law of the land, protected the negro in life and limb, and in many personal rights, and, by the practice of the system, bestowed upon him a sum of individual indulgences, which made him altogether the most striking type in the world of cheerfulness and contentment.<ref>Edward A.

The 1881 publication of ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]'' by [[Jefferson Davis]], a two-volume defense of the Southern cause, provided another important text in the history of the Lost Cause. Davis blamed the enemy for \"whatever of bloodshed, of devastation, or shock to republican government has resulted from the war\".

Lee]]. When Lee published his farewell order to the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], he consoled his soldiers by speaking of the \"overwhelming resources and numbers\" that the Confederate army had fought against. In a letter to Early, Lee requested information about enemy strengths from May 1864 to April 1865, the period in which his army was engaged against Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (the [[Overland Campaign]] and the [[Siege of Petersburg]]). Lee wrote: \"My only object is to transmit, if possible, the truth to posterity, and do justice to our brave Soldiers.\"<ref name=\"Gal12\">Gallagher, p. 12.</ref> In another letter, Lee wanted all \"statistics as regards numbers, destruction of private property by the Federal troops, &c.\" because he intended to demonstrate the discrepancy in strength between the two armies and believed it would \"be difficult to get the world to understand the odds against which we fought\". Referring to newspaper accounts that accused him of culpability in the loss, he wrote, \"I have not thought proper to notice, or even to correct misrepresentations of my words & acts. We shall have to be patient, & suffer for awhile at least.&nbsp;... At present the public mind is not prepared to receive the truth.\"<ref name=\"Gal12\" /> All of these were themes made prominent by Early and the Lost Cause writers in the nineteenth century; they continued to play an important role throughout the twentieth.<ref>Gallagher and Nolan p. 43.</ref>\n\nIn a November 1868 report, U.S. Army general [[George Henry Thomas]], a Virginian who had fought for the Union in the war, noted efforts made by former Confederates to paint the Confederacy in a positive light, stating:\n\n{{quote|[T]he greatest efforts made by the defeated insurgents since the close of the war have been to promulgate the idea that the cause of liberty, justice, humanity, equality, and all the calendar of the virtues of freedom, suffered violence and wrong when the effort for southern independence failed.

In the 1890s, Confederate memories no longer dwelled as much on mourning or explaining defeat; they offered a set of conservative traditions by which the entire country could gird itself against racial, political, and industrial disorder.

Hillyer states that the [[Confederate Memorial Literary Society]] (CMLS), founded by \u00e9lite white women in Richmond, Virginia, in the 1890s, exemplifies this solution. The CMLS founded the [[Museum of the Confederacy| Confederate Museum]] to document and defend the Confederate cause and to recall the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781\u20131860) |antebellum]] mores that the new South's business ethos was thought to be displacing. By focusing on military sacrifice, rather than grievances regarding the North, the Confederate Museum aided the process of sectional reconciliation, according to Hillyer. By depicting [[Slavery in the United States| slavery]] as benevolent, the museum's exhibits reinforced the notion that [[Jim Crow | Jim-Crow]] laws were a proper solution to racial tensions that had escalated during Reconstruction. Lastly, by glorifying the common soldier and portraying the South as \"solid\", the museum promoted acceptance of industrial capitalism. Thus the Confederate Museum both critiqued and eased the economic transformations of the New South, and enabled Richmond to reconcile its memory of the past with its hopes for the future, leaving the past behind as it developed new industrial and financial roles.<ref>Reiko Hillyer, \"Relics of Reconciliation: The Confederate Museum and Civil War Memory in the New South,\" ''Public Historian'', Nov 2011, Vol. 33 Issue 4, pp. 35\u201362,</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Jacquelyn Dowd Hall]] states that the Lost-Cause theme was fully developed around 1900 in a mood not of despair but of triumphalism for the New South. Much was left out of the Lost Cause:\n\n{{quote|[N]either the trauma of slavery for African Americans nor their heroic, heartbreaking freedom struggle found a place in that story.

Men typically hurried by the role women played during the war, noting their total loyalty to the cause. Women, however, developed a much different approach that emphasized female activism, initiative, and leadership. They explained that when all the men left, the women took command, found substitute foods, rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable, and ran all the farm or plantation operations. They faced apparent danger without having men in the traditional role of their protectors.<ref>Gaines M.

More than half a century before women's history and public history emerged as fields of inquiry and action, the UDC, with other women's associations, strove to etch women's accomplishments into the historical record and to take history to the people, from the nursery and the fireside to the schoolhouse and the public square.<ref>Hall, \"'You must remember this': Autobiography as social critique.\" p. 450</ref>}}\n\nIndeed, there is even some evidence suggesting that there was a link between the publication of Lost Cause books and the creation of the confederate memorials: Lizzie Cary Daniel's \"Confederate Scrap-book\" makes clear in the preface and on the title page that it was specifically published to fund the erection of two (implied Confederate) memorials.<ref>Lizzie Cary Daniel (1893). \"Confederate Scrap-book: Copied from a Scrap-book Kept by a Young Girl During and Immediately After the War\".</ref> The book therefore plays the dual roles of glorifying the Confederates in songs, poems and other war memorabilia, while also paying for their more enduring and public memorialization.\n\nThe Southern states set up their own pension system for veterans and their dependents, especially widows.

Comparable men, on the other hand, were much less interested in historical organizations, and devoted their energies to secret fraternal societies, while they emphasized athletic, political and financial exploits to prove their manhood.

The South was fighting for its independence. Many still want it.\n* The North was not attacking the South out of a pure, though misguided motive: to end slavery. Its motives were economic and venal.\n* Slavery was not only a benign institution but a \"positive good\". It was not based on economic greed, and slaves were happy and loyal to their kind masters (see: [[Heyward Shepherd]]). Slavery was good for the slaves, whose lives were much better than they would be in Africa, or what they would have as free blacks in the North, where there were numerous anti-black riots. (Blacks were perceived as foreigners, immigrants taking jobs away from whites by working for less, and also as dangerously sexual.) It was not characterized by racism, rape, barbarous working conditions, brutality, whipping, forced separation of families, and humiliation.<ref>Gallagher and Nolan p. 16. Nolan writes, \"Given the central role of African Americans in the sectional conflict, it is surely not surprising that Southern rationalizations have extended to characterizations of the persons of these people.

It especially appeared in studies of [[Guerrilla warfare in the American Civil War|Confederate partisans]] who fought behind Union lines, such as [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], [[Turner Ashby]], [[John Singleton Mosby]], and [[John Hunt Morgan]].

Battlefield losses were also sometimes the result of betrayal and incompetence on the part of certain subordinates of General Lee, such as General [[James Longstreet]], who was reviled for doubting Lee at Gettysburg.\n* The Lost Cause focuses mainly on Lee and the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] of operations, in northern Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. It usually takes Gettysburg as the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], ignoring the Union victories in Tennessee and Mississippi, and that nothing could stop the Union army's humiliating advance through [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Georgia]], South Carolina, and North Carolina, ending with the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]'s surrender at [[Old Appomattox Court House|Appomatox]].\n* General Sherman destroyed property out of meanness. Burning [[Columbia, South Carolina]], before the war a hotbed of secession, served no military purpose. It was intended only to humiliate and impoverish.\n* [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Giving the vote to the newly freed slaves]] was a political disaster. They were incapable of voting intelligently and were easily bribed or misled. [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] was a disaster, only benefitting Northern scoundrels ([[scalawags]]).

Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, and [[Pickett's Charge]]. David Ulbrich wrote, \"Already revered during the war, Robert E. Lee acquired a divine mystique within Southern culture after it. Remembered as a leader whose soldiers would loyally follow him into every fight no matter how desperate, Lee emerged from the conflict to become an icon of the Lost Cause and the ideal of the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781\u20131860)|antebellum]] Southern [[gentleman]], an honorable and pious man who selflessly served Virginia and the Confederacy. Lee's tactical brilliance at [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] took on legendary status, and despite his accepting full responsibility for the defeat at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], Lee remained largely infallible for Southerners and was spared criticism even from historians until recent times.\" Victor Davis Hansen points out that Albert Sidney Johnston was the first officer to be appointed a full general by [[Jefferson Davis]] and to lead Confederate forces in the Western Theater. His death during the first day of the battle at [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] arguably led to the Confederacy's defeat in that conflict.<ref name=\"Ul1222\" />\n\nIn terms of Lee's subordinates, the key villain in Jubal Early's view was General Longstreet. Despite the fact that General Lee took all responsibility for the defeats (in particular the one at Gettysburg), Early's writings place the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg squarely on Longstreet's shoulders, accusing him of failing to attack early in the morning of July 2, 1863, as instructed by Lee. In fact, however, Lee never expressed dissatisfaction with the second-day actions of his \"Old War Horse\". Longstreet was widely disparaged by Southern veterans because of his post-war cooperation with President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (with whom he had shared a close friendship before the war) and for joining the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Grant, in rejecting the Lost Cause arguments, said in an 1878 interview that he rejected the notion that the South had simply been overwhelmed by numbers. Grant wrote that \"This is the way public opinion was made during the war and this is the way history is made now. We never overwhelmed the South ... What we won from the South we won by hard fighting.\" He further noted that when comparing resources the \"4,000,000 of negroes\" who \"kept the farms, protected the families, supported the armies, and were really a reserve force\" were not treated as a southern asset.<ref>{{cite book |author=David W.

His anger towards former slaveholders is intensified after the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], when he vows revenge on the South. His programs strip away the land owned by whites, giving it to former slaves. (See [[Forty acres and a mule]].)

Finally, the former slaves are taught that they are superior to their former owners and should rise up against them.

Like the novel, it was a great commercial success; there were multiple touring companies presenting the play simultaneously in different cities. Sometimes it was banned. ''Birth of a Nation'' is actually based on the play, unpublished until 2007,{{clarify|date=July 2019}} rather than directly on the novel.\n\n===''The Birth of a Nation''===\nAnother prominent and influential popularizer of the Lost Cause perspective was [[D. W. Griffith]]'s highly successful ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), based on Dixon's novel just mentioned. Noting that Dixon and Griffith collaborated on ''Birth of a Nation'', Blight wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Dixon's vicious version of the idea that blacks had caused the Civil War by their very presence, and that Northern radicalism during Reconstruction failed to understand that freedom had ushered blacks as a race into barbarism, neatly framed the story of the rise of heroic vigilantism in the South. Reluctantly, Klansmen\u2014white men\u2014had to take the law into their own hands in order to save Southern white womanhood from the sexual brutality of black men. Dixon's vision captured the attitude of thousands and forged in story form a collective memory of how the war may have been lost but Reconstruction was won\u2014by the South and a reconciled nation.

It has spoken eloquently\u2014albeit from an [[elitism|elitist]] perspective\u2014of the grand themes (war, love, death, conflicts of race, class, gender, and generation) that have crossed continents and cultures.<ref>{{cite book |author=Helen Taylor |chapter=''Gone with the Wind'' and its Influence |pages=258\u201367 |editor-first=Carolyn |editor-last=Perry |editor-first2=Mary |editor-last2= Weaks-Baxter |title=The History of Southern Women's Literature |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uQSYeomI_CAC&pg=PA266 |year=2002 |publisher=LSU Press |isbn=978-0-8071-2753-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBlight wrote:\n<blockquote>From this combination of Lost Cause voices, a reunited America arose pure, guiltless, and assured that the deep conflicts in its past had been imposed upon it by otherworldly forces.

Woodworth]] derided the movie as a modern day telling of Lost Cause mythology.<ref name=\"Film Review: Gods and Generals\"/> Woodworth called the movie \"the most pro-Confederate film since ''Birth of a Nation'', a veritable celluloid celebration of slavery and treason\". He summed up his reasons for disliking the movie by saying:\n\n{{quote|Gods and Generals'' brings to the big screen the major themes of Lost Cause mythology that professional historians have been working for half a century to combat. In the world of Gods and Generals, slavery has nothing to do with the Confederate cause. Instead, the Confederates are nobly fighting for, rather than against, freedom, as viewers are reminded again and again by one white southern character after another.<ref name=\"Film Review: Gods and Generals\"/>}}\n\nWoodworth criticized the portrayal of slaves as being \"generally happy\" with their condition. He also criticizes the relative lack of attention given to the motivations of Union soldiers fighting in the war. He excoriates the film for allegedly implying, in agreement with Lost Cause mythology, that the South was more \"sincerely Christian\". Woodworth concludes that the film, through \"judicial omission,\" presents \"a distorted view of the Civil War\".<ref name=\"Film Review: Gods and Generals\"/>\n\nHistorian William B. Feis similarly criticized the director's decision \"to champion the more simplistic-and sanitized-interpretations found in post-war \"Lost Cause\" mythology\".<ref name=\"Movie Review: Gods and Generals\"/> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] described the movie as \"a Civil War movie that [[Trent Lott]] might enjoy\" and said of its Lost Cause themes, \"If World War II were handled this way, there'd be hell to pay.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=Gods and Generals: Movie Review |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/gods-and-generals-2003/ |accessdate=7 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe consensus of film critics for this movie was that it had a firm \"pro-confederate slant\".<ref name=\"GODS AND GENERALS (2003)\"/>\n\n==Later use==\nProfessor Gallagher contends that [[Douglas Southall Freeman]]'s definitive four-volume biography of Lee, published in 1934, \"cemented in American letters an interpretation of Lee very close to Early's utterly heroic figure\".<ref name=\"Gal2425\">Gallagher, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> In this work, Lee's subordinates were primarily to blame for errors that lost battles. While Longstreet was the most common target of such attacks, others came under fire as well. [[Richard Ewell]], [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]], [[J. E. B. Stuart]], [[A. P. Hill]], [[George Pickett]], and many others were frequently attacked and blamed by Southerners in an attempt to deflect criticism from Lee.\n\n[[Hudson Strode]] wrote a widely read scholarly three-volume biography of Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]]. A leading scholarly journal reviewed it stressing Strode's political biases:\n<blockquote>His [Jefferson Davis's] enemies are devils, and his friends, like Davis himself, have been canonized. Strode not only attempts to sanctify Davis but also the Confederate point of view, and this study should be relished by those vigorously sympathetic with the Lost Cause.<ref>LeRoy H.

There were numerous causes for secession, but preservation and expansion of slavery was easily the most important of them. The confusion may come from blending the causes of secession with the causes of the war\u2014which are separate but related issues. (Lincoln did not enter a military conflict to free the slaves but to put down a rebellion, or as he put it, to preserve the Union.) According to historian [[Kenneth M. Stampp]], each side supported states' rights or federal power only when it was convenient to do so.<ref>Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, page 59</ref> Stampp also cited Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]]'s ''A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States'' as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the \"[[Cornerstone Speech|cornerstone of the Confederacy]]\" when the war began and then said that the war was not about slavery but states' rights after Southern defeat. According to Stampp, Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the 'Lost Cause' theory.<ref>Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'', pp.&nbsp;63\u201365</ref>\n\nSimilarly, historian William C. Davis explained the Confederate Constitution's protection of slavery at the national level as follows:\n\n<blockquote>To the old Union they had said that the Federal power had no authority to interfere with slavery issues in a state. To their new nation they would declare that the state had no power to interfere with a federal protection of slavery. Of all the many testimonials to the fact that slavery, and not states' rights, really lay at the heart of their movement, this was the most eloquent of all.<ref>William C. Davis, ''Look Away'', pp.&nbsp;97\u201398</ref></blockquote>\n\nDavis further notes that, \"Causes and effects of the war have been manipulated and mythologized to suit political and social agendas, past and present.\"<ref>Davis, ''The Cause Lost'' p.&nbsp;''x''</ref> Historian David Blight says that \"its use of white supremacy as both means and ends\" has been a key characteristic of the Lost Cause.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Historian Allan Nolan writes:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;the Lost Cause legacy to history is a caricature of the truth. The caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter. Surely it is time to start again in our understanding of this decisive element of our past and to do so from the premises of history unadulterated by the distortions, falsehoods, and romantic sentimentality of the Myth of the Lost Cause.<ref>Gallager and Nolan, p.&nbsp;29</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian William C. Davis labels many of the myths surrounding the war as \"frivolous\" and included attempts to rename the war by \"Confederate partisans\" which continue to this day. He states that names such as the [[War of Northern Aggression]] and the expression coined by Alexander Stephens, [[War Between the States]], were just attempts to deny that the Civil War was an actual civil war.<ref>Davis, ''The Cause Lost'', p.&nbsp;178</ref>\n\nHistorian A. Cash Koiniger has theorized that Gary Gallagher has mischaracterized films that depict the Lost Cause. He writes that Gallagher\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;concedes that \"Lost Cause themes\" (with the important exception of minimizing the importance of slavery) are based on historical truths (p.&nbsp;46). Confederate soldiers were often outnumbered, ragged, and hungry; southern civilians did endure much material deprivation and a disproportionate amount of bereavement; U.S. forces did wreck ''{{sic}}'' havoc on southern infrastructure and private property and the like, yet whenever these points appear in films Gallagher considers them motifs \"celebratory\" of the Confederacy (p.&nbsp;81).<ref>A.

They believe that any state had the right to secede, a point strongly denied by the North. The Lost Cause portrayed the South as more adherent to [[Christian values]] than the allegedly greedy North. It portrayed slavery as more benevolent than cruel, alleging that it taught [[Christianity]] and \"civilization.\" Stories of happy slaves were often used as propaganda in an effort to defend slavery; the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] had a \"Faithful Slave Memorial Committee,\" and erected the [[Heyward Shepherd monument]] in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]]. These stories would be used to explain slavery to Northerners. Many times they also portrayed slave owners being kind to their slaves. In explaining Confederate defeat, the Lost Cause says that the main factor was not qualitative inferiority in leadership or fighting ability but the massive quantitative superiority of the Yankee industrial machine.<ref>{{cite book|author1=William J.

Pollard]], ''The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates''.<ref>Ulbrich, p. 1221.</ref> Pollard promotes many of the aforementioned themes of the Lost Cause. In particular, he dismisses the role of slavery in starting the war and understates the cruelty of American slavery, even promoting it as a way of improving the lives of Africans:\n\n{{quote|We shall not enter upon the discussion of the moral question of slavery. But we may suggest a doubt here whether that odious term \"slavery\" which has been so long imposed, by the exaggeration of Northern writers, upon the judgement and sympathies of the world, is properly applied to that system of servitude in the South, which was really the mildest in the world; which did not rest on acts of debasement and disenfranchisement, but elevated the African, and was in the interest of human improvement; and which, by the law of the land, protected the negro in life and limb, and in many personal rights, and, by the practice of the system, bestowed upon him a sum of individual indulgences, which made him altogether the most striking type in the world of cheerfulness and contentment.<ref>Edward A.

Early]] in the 1870s for the [[Southern Historical Society]] that firmly established the Lost Cause as a long-lasting literary and cultural phenomenon. The 1881 publication of ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]'' by [[Jefferson Davis]], a two-volume defense of the Southern cause, provided another important text in the history of the Lost Cause. Davis blamed the enemy for \"whatever of bloodshed, of devastation, or shock to republican government has resulted from the war\". He charged that the Yankees fought \"with a ferocity that disregarded all the laws of civilized warfare\". The book remained in print and often served to justify the Southern position and to distance it from slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author= Gaines M.

Lee]]. When Lee published his farewell order to the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], he consoled his soldiers by speaking of the \"overwhelming resources and numbers\" that the Confederate army had fought against. In a letter to Early, Lee requested information about enemy strengths from May 1864 to April 1865, the period in which his army was engaged against Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (the [[Overland Campaign]] and the [[Siege of Petersburg]]). Lee wrote: \"My only object is to transmit, if possible, the truth to posterity, and do justice to our brave Soldiers.\"<ref name=\"Gal12\">Gallagher, p. 12.</ref> In another letter, Lee wanted all \"statistics as regards numbers, destruction of private property by the Federal troops, &c.\" because he intended to demonstrate the discrepancy in strength between the two armies and believed it would \"be difficult to get the world to understand the odds against which we fought\". Referring to newspaper accounts that accused him of culpability in the loss, he wrote, \"I have not thought proper to notice, or even to correct misrepresentations of my words & acts. We shall have to be patient, & suffer for awhile at least.&nbsp;...

Hillyer states that the [[Confederate Memorial Literary Society]] (CMLS), founded by \u00e9lite white women in Richmond, Virginia, in the 1890s, exemplifies this solution. The CMLS founded the [[Museum of the Confederacy| Confederate Museum]] to document and defend the Confederate cause and to recall the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781\u20131860) |antebellum]] mores that the new South's business ethos was thought to be displacing. By focusing on military sacrifice, rather than grievances regarding the North, the Confederate Museum aided the process of sectional reconciliation, according to Hillyer. By depicting [[Slavery in the United States| slavery]] as benevolent, the museum's exhibits reinforced the notion that [[Jim Crow | Jim-Crow]] laws were a proper solution to racial tensions that had escalated during Reconstruction. Lastly, by glorifying the common soldier and portraying the South as \"solid\", the museum promoted acceptance of industrial capitalism. Thus the Confederate Museum both critiqued and eased the economic transformations of the New South, and enabled Richmond to reconcile its memory of the past with its hopes for the future, leaving the past behind as it developed new industrial and financial roles.<ref>Reiko Hillyer, \"Relics of Reconciliation: The Confederate Museum and Civil War Memory in the New South,\" ''Public Historian'', Nov 2011, Vol. 33 Issue 4, pp. 35\u201362,</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Jacquelyn Dowd Hall]] states that the Lost-Cause theme was fully developed around 1900 in a mood not of despair but of triumphalism for the New South.

But the Lost Cause narrative also suppressed the memories of many white southerners. Memories of how, under slavery, power bred cruelty. Memories of the bloody, unbearable realities of war.

Historian John Coski noted that the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] (SCV), the \"most visible, active, and effective defender of the flag\", \"carried forward into the twenty-first century, virtually unchanged, the Lost Cause historical interpretations and ideological vision formulated at the turn of the twentieth\".<ref>Coski pp.&nbsp;192\u201393</ref> Coski wrote concerning \"the flag wars of the late twentieth century\":\n\n{{quote|From the&nbsp;... early 1950s, SCV officials defended the integrity of the battle flag against trivialization and against those who insisted that its display was unpatriotic or racist. SCV spokesmen reiterated the consistent argument that the South fought a legitimate war for independence, not a war to defend slavery, and that the ascendant \"Yankee\" view of history falsely vilified the South and led people to misinterpret the battle flag.<ref>Coski p.&nbsp;193. Coski (p.&nbsp;62) also wrote:<blockquote>Just as the battle flag became during the war the most important emblem of Confederate nationalism, so did it become during the memorial period [the late 19th Century through the 1920s] the symbolic embodiment of the Lost Cause.</blockquote></ref>}}\n\nThe Confederate States of America used [[flags of the Confederate States of America | several flags]] during its existence from 1861 to 1865. Since the end of the American Civil War, personal and official use of Confederate flags, and of flags derived from these, has continued under considerable controversy. The current [[flag of Mississippi |state flag of Mississippi]], adopted in 1894 after the state's so-called \"[[Redeemers|Redemption]]\", includes the [[Confederate battle flag]].\n\nOn March 23, 2015, a Confederate-flag-related case reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

Men typically hurried by the role women played during the war, noting their total loyalty to the cause. Women, however, developed a much different approach that emphasized female activism, initiative, and leadership. They explained that when all the men left, the women took command, found substitute foods, rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable, and ran all the farm or plantation operations. They faced apparent danger without having men in the traditional role of their protectors.<ref>Gaines M.

''Monuments to the Lost Cause: Women, Art, and the Landscapes of Southern Memory'' (U. of Tennessee Press, 2003)</ref> The UDC was especially influential in the early twentieth century across the South, where its main role was to preserve and uphold the memory of the Confederate veterans, especially those husbands, sons, fathers and brothers who died in the war. Its long-term impact was to promote the Lost Cause image of the antebellum plantation South as an idealized society crushed by the forces of Yankee modernization which undermined traditional gender roles.<ref>Karen L.

This they did by lobbying for state archives and museums, national historic sites, and historic highways; compiling genealogies; interviewing former soldiers; writing history textbooks; and erecting monuments, which now moved triumphantly from cemeteries into town centers. More than half a century before women's history and public history emerged as fields of inquiry and action, the UDC, with other women's associations, strove to etch women's accomplishments into the historical record and to take history to the people, from the nursery and the fireside to the schoolhouse and the public square.<ref>Hall, \"'You must remember this': Autobiography as social critique.\" p. 450</ref>}}\n\nIndeed, there is even some evidence suggesting that there was a link between the publication of Lost Cause books and the creation of the confederate memorials: Lizzie Cary Daniel's \"Confederate Scrap-book\" makes clear in the preface and on the title page that it was specifically published to fund the erection of two (implied Confederate) memorials.<ref>Lizzie Cary Daniel (1893). \"Confederate Scrap-book: Copied from a Scrap-book Kept by a Young Girl During and Immediately After the War\".</ref> The book therefore plays the dual roles of glorifying the Confederates in songs, poems and other war memorabilia, while also paying for their more enduring and public memorialization.\n\nThe Southern states set up their own pension system for veterans and their dependents, especially widows. They were not eligible for the Federal pension system. The pensions were designed to honor the Lost Cause, and help reduce the severe poverty prevalent in the region. Male applicants for pensions had to demonstrate their continued loyalty to the \"lost cause\". Female applicants were rejected if their moral reputation was in question.<ref>Elna C.

However elite white women were central in establishing memorials such as the Civil War Monument dedicated on Memorial Day 1890. The Lost Cause enabled women noncombatants to lay a claim to the central event in their redefinition of Southern history.<ref>Melody Kubassek, \"Ask Us Not to Forget: The Lost Cause in Natchez, Mississippi\". ''Southern Studies'', 1992, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp. 155\u201370.</ref>\n\nThe UDC was quite prominent, but not at all unique, in its appeal to upscale white Southern women.  \"The number of women's clubs devoted to filiopietism and history was staggering,\" says historian [[W. Fitzhugh Brundage]]. He notes two typical club women in Texas and Mississippi, who between them belonged to the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]], [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], [[Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities]], [[Daughters of the Pilgrims]], [[Daughters of the War of 1812]], [[Daughters of Colonial Governors]], and [[Daughters of the Founders and Patriots of America]], [[Order of the First Families of Virginia]], and the [[Colonial Dames of America]], as well as a few other historically oriented societies. Comparable men, on the other hand, were much less interested in historical organizations, and devoted their energies to secret fraternal societies, while they emphasized athletic, political and financial exploits to prove their manhood.  Brundage notes that after U.S. [[women's suffrage]] came in 1920, the historical role of the women's organizations eroded.<ref>W.

Its motives were economic and venal.\n* Slavery was not only a benign institution but a \"positive good\". It was not based on economic greed, and slaves were happy and loyal to their kind masters (see: [[Heyward Shepherd]]). Slavery was good for the slaves, whose lives were much better than they would be in Africa, or what they would have as free blacks in the North, where there were numerous anti-black riots.

Battlefield losses were also sometimes the result of betrayal and incompetence on the part of certain subordinates of General Lee, such as General [[James Longstreet]], who was reviled for doubting Lee at Gettysburg.\n* The Lost Cause focuses mainly on Lee and the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]] of operations, in northern Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. It usually takes Gettysburg as the [[turning point of the American Civil War|turning point of the war]], ignoring the Union victories in Tennessee and Mississippi, and that nothing could stop the Union army's humiliating advance through [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Georgia]], South Carolina, and North Carolina, ending with the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]'s surrender at [[Old Appomattox Court House|Appomatox]].\n* General Sherman destroyed property out of meanness. Burning [[Columbia, South Carolina]], before the war a hotbed of secession, served no military purpose. It was intended only to humiliate and impoverish.\n* [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Giving the vote to the newly freed slaves]] was a political disaster. They were incapable of voting intelligently and were easily bribed or misled. [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] was a disaster, only benefitting Northern scoundrels ([[scalawags]]). It took great effort by chivalrous Southern gentlemen to reestablish white dominance, which was, among other things, what God wanted.\n\n==Symbols==\n===Confederate generals===\n[[File:Confederate Reunion Parade Richmond.jpg|thumb|300px|[[George Washington Custis Lee|G.W.

Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, and [[Pickett's Charge]]. David Ulbrich wrote, \"Already revered during the war, Robert E. Lee acquired a divine mystique within Southern culture after it. Remembered as a leader whose soldiers would loyally follow him into every fight no matter how desperate, Lee emerged from the conflict to become an icon of the Lost Cause and the ideal of the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781\u20131860)|antebellum]] Southern [[gentleman]], an honorable and pious man who selflessly served Virginia and the Confederacy. Lee's tactical brilliance at [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] took on legendary status, and despite his accepting full responsibility for the defeat at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], Lee remained largely infallible for Southerners and was spared criticism even from historians until recent times.\" Victor Davis Hansen points out that Albert Sidney Johnston was the first officer to be appointed a full general by [[Jefferson Davis]] and to lead Confederate forces in the Western Theater. His death during the first day of the battle at [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] arguably led to the Confederacy's defeat in that conflict.<ref name=\"Ul1222\" />\n\nIn terms of Lee's subordinates, the key villain in Jubal Early's view was General Longstreet. Despite the fact that General Lee took all responsibility for the defeats (in particular the one at Gettysburg), Early's writings place the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg squarely on Longstreet's shoulders, accusing him of failing to attack early in the morning of July 2, 1863, as instructed by Lee. In fact, however, Lee never expressed dissatisfaction with the second-day actions of his \"Old War Horse\". Longstreet was widely disparaged by Southern veterans because of his post-war cooperation with President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (with whom he had shared a close friendship before the war) and for joining the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Grant, in rejecting the Lost Cause arguments, said in an 1878 interview that he rejected the notion that the South had simply been overwhelmed by numbers. Grant wrote that \"This is the way public opinion was made during the war and this is the way history is made now. We never overwhelmed the South ... What we won from the South we won by hard fighting.\" He further noted that when comparing resources the \"4,000,000 of negroes\" who \"kept the farms, protected the families, supported the armies, and were really a reserve force\" were not treated as a southern asset.<ref>{{cite book |author=David W.

This is exemplified in \"Force or Consent as the Basis of American Government\" by Mary Scrugham, in which she presents frivolous arguments against the legality of Lincoln's presidency.<ref>Scrugham, Mary, and William H.

Stoneman's hatred for President Johnson stems from Johnson's refusal to disenfranchise Southern whites. His anger towards former slaveholders is intensified after the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]], when he vows revenge on the South. His programs strip away the land owned by whites, giving it to former slaves. (See [[Forty acres and a mule]].) Men claiming to represent the government confiscate the material wealth of the South, destroying plantation-owning families. Finally, the former slaves are taught that they are superior to their former owners and should rise up against them.

Like the novel, it was a great commercial success; there were multiple touring companies presenting the play simultaneously in different cities. Sometimes it was banned. ''Birth of a Nation'' is actually based on the play, unpublished until 2007,{{clarify|date=July 2019}} rather than directly on the novel.\n\n===''The Birth of a Nation''===\nAnother prominent and influential popularizer of the Lost Cause perspective was [[D. W. Griffith]]'s highly successful ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), based on Dixon's novel just mentioned. Noting that Dixon and Griffith collaborated on ''Birth of a Nation'', Blight wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Dixon's vicious version of the idea that blacks had caused the Civil War by their very presence, and that Northern radicalism during Reconstruction failed to understand that freedom had ushered blacks as a race into barbarism, neatly framed the story of the rise of heroic vigilantism in the South. Reluctantly, Klansmen\u2014white men\u2014had to take the law into their own hands in order to save Southern white womanhood from the sexual brutality of black men. Dixon's vision captured the attitude of thousands and forged in story form a collective memory of how the war may have been lost but Reconstruction was won\u2014by the South and a reconciled nation.

Dixon's narrative was so readily adopted that the film is credited with the revival of the Klan in the 1910s and 1920s.

There were numerous causes for secession, but preservation and expansion of slavery was easily the most important of them. The confusion may come from blending the causes of secession with the causes of the war\u2014which are separate but related issues. (Lincoln did not enter a military conflict to free the slaves but to put down a rebellion, or as he put it, to preserve the Union.) According to historian [[Kenneth M. Stampp]], each side supported states' rights or federal power only when it was convenient to do so.<ref>Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, page 59</ref> Stampp also cited Confederate Vice President [[Alexander Stephens]]'s ''A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States'' as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the \"[[Cornerstone Speech|cornerstone of the Confederacy]]\" when the war began and then said that the war was not about slavery but states' rights after Southern defeat. According to Stampp, Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the 'Lost Cause' theory.<ref>Stampp, ''The Causes of the Civil War'', pp.&nbsp;63\u201365</ref>\n\nSimilarly, historian William C. Davis explained the Confederate Constitution's protection of slavery at the national level as follows:\n\n<blockquote>To the old Union they had said that the Federal power had no authority to interfere with slavery issues in a state. To their new nation they would declare that the state had no power to interfere with a federal protection of slavery. Of all the many testimonials to the fact that slavery, and not states' rights, really lay at the heart of their movement, this was the most eloquent of all.<ref>William C. Davis, ''Look Away'', pp.&nbsp;97\u201398</ref></blockquote>\n\nDavis further notes that, \"Causes and effects of the war have been manipulated and mythologized to suit political and social agendas, past and present.\"<ref>Davis, ''The Cause Lost'' p.&nbsp;''x''</ref> Historian David Blight says that \"its use of white supremacy as both means and ends\" has been a key characteristic of the Lost Cause.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Historian Allan Nolan writes:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;the Lost Cause legacy to history is a caricature of the truth. The caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter. Surely it is time to start again in our understanding of this decisive element of our past and to do so from the premises of history unadulterated by the distortions, falsehoods, and romantic sentimentality of the Myth of the Lost Cause.<ref>Gallager and Nolan, p.&nbsp;29</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian William C. Davis labels many of the myths surrounding the war as \"frivolous\" and included attempts to rename the war by \"Confederate partisans\" which continue to this day. He states that names such as the [[War of Northern Aggression]] and the expression coined by Alexander Stephens, [[War Between the States]], were just attempts to deny that the Civil War was an actual civil war.<ref>Davis, ''The Cause Lost'', p.&nbsp;178</ref>\n\nHistorian A. Cash Koiniger has theorized that Gary Gallagher has mischaracterized films that depict the Lost Cause. He writes that Gallagher\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;concedes that \"Lost Cause themes\" (with the important exception of minimizing the importance of slavery) are based on historical truths (p.&nbsp;46).
