Veer wishes to continue his father's legacy by leading a movement of Pindaris against the British in order to free both the [[Rajasthani people|Rajasthani]] Kingdom of Madhavghar and the rest of India from the great colonial power. Veer receives the help of his younger brother, Punya Singh ([[Sohail Khan]]) in gathering an army. However Veer finds opposition from the King of Madhavghar, Gyanendra Singh ([[Jackie Shroff]]), who sees Veer as a threat to Madhavghar and his rule and orders for Veer to be killed. Veer and Punya along with their supporters go into hiding within the [[Thar Desert]] of Rajasthan, while Singh makes an alliance with the British Governor of Rajasthan, James Fraser ([[Tim James Lawrence]]), saying that Madhavghar will support the British in crushing the Pindari movement and eliminating Veer.\n\nTo keep stakes high, the Pindaris kidnap Singh's daughter Princess Yashodhara ([[Zareen Khan]]), who Veer finds himself in love with. The Pindaris then make a failed attempt to take down Singh's palace by surprise. However Singh's spies discover the plan and thousands of Pindari warriors are slaughtered. Veer fails to get his revenge on the corrupt King but knows that Punya has been captured by Yashodhara's brother Gajendra ([[Puru Raaj Kumar]]) as Veer runs in to save his brother and kills Gajendra's men but Gajendra is killed to when he gets punched by Veer and lands on a sword which Gyanendra seeks revenge for his son. In the meantime, Lady Angela Fraser ([[Lisa Lazarus]]), wife of James Fraser, begins to question her husband's actions as he supports the evil king in slaughtering members of the Pindari movement. Fraser refuses to back down from his campaign of crushing the movement.\n\nAfter Veer promises his father that he will finish Singh, he gatecrashes Yashodhara's [[Swayamvara]]. As he takes the princess away from the fort, Gyanendra Singh sees a vast army of Pindaris has surrounded his fort. He asks the British to help him but they refuse and make the Pindaris their ally in a bid to escape from Madhavghar. Before the British leave a battle follows in which the Governor and Gyanendra Singh are killed. Veer, wounded from a gunshot, falls unconscious in the arms of his father. Years later it is shown that Veer's son and Prithvi are having a friendly fight.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Salman Khan]] as Veer Pratap Singh/Veera (Duel role)\n* [[Zareen Khan]] as Princess Yashodhara\n* [[Mithun Chakraborty]] as Prithvi Singh, Veer's Father\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Gyanendra Singh, King of Madhavghar and Father of Yashodhara\n* [[Sohail Khan]] as Punya Pratap Singh, Veer's Brother\n* Raj Premi as one of the villains\n* Rishabh Jain as Radhurath, Veer's friend\n* [[Puru Raaj Kumar]] as Gajendra Singh, the prince of Madhavghar, brother to Yashodhara and son to Gyanendra.\n* [[Lisa Lazarus]] as Lady Angela Fraser, wife of Governor James Fraser\n* [[Tim Lawrence]] as James Fraser, Governor General of [[Rajasthan]]\n*[[Karmveer Choudhary]] as Mantri of Jackie Shroff\n* [[Khurram Tejrar]]\n* [[Gita Soto]]\n* [[Neena Gupta]] as Veer's mother\n* [[Aryan Vaid]]\n* [[Bharat Dabholkar]]\n* [[Bunny Anand]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/news/2009/salman-saved-bunny-231109.html |title= Salman saved Bunny Anand's life |author= Subhadeep Bhattacharjee |date= 23 November 2009|publisher=One India.com |accessdate=11 February 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Shahbaz Khan (actor)|Shahbaz Khan]] as Naunihal\n* [[Militza Radmilovic]]\n* [[Charissa Glidden]] as the Governess\n* [[Roy Bronsgeest]] as Rhino<ref>Manohar Charla.

Veer wishes to continue his father's legacy by leading a movement of Pindaris against the British in order to free both the [[Rajasthani people|Rajasthani]] Kingdom of Madhavghar and the rest of India from the great colonial power. Veer receives the help of his younger brother, Punya Singh ([[Sohail Khan]]) in gathering an army. However Veer finds opposition from the King of Madhavghar, Gyanendra Singh ([[Jackie Shroff]]), who sees Veer as a threat to Madhavghar and his rule and orders for Veer to be killed. Veer and Punya along with their supporters go into hiding within the [[Thar Desert]] of Rajasthan, while Singh makes an alliance with the British Governor of Rajasthan, James Fraser ([[Tim James Lawrence]]), saying that Madhavghar will support the British in crushing the Pindari movement and eliminating Veer.\n\nTo keep stakes high, the Pindaris kidnap Singh's daughter Princess Yashodhara ([[Zareen Khan]]), who Veer finds himself in love with. The Pindaris then make a failed attempt to take down Singh's palace by surprise. However Singh's spies discover the plan and thousands of Pindari warriors are slaughtered. Veer fails to get his revenge on the corrupt King but knows that Punya has been captured by Yashodhara's brother Gajendra ([[Puru Raaj Kumar]]) as Veer runs in to save his brother and kills Gajendra's men but Gajendra is killed to when he gets punched by Veer and lands on a sword which Gyanendra seeks revenge for his son. In the meantime, Lady Angela Fraser ([[Lisa Lazarus]]), wife of James Fraser, begins to question her husband's actions as he supports the evil king in slaughtering members of the Pindari movement. Fraser refuses to back down from his campaign of crushing the movement.\n\nAfter Veer promises his father that he will finish Singh, he gatecrashes Yashodhara's [[Swayamvara]]. As he takes the princess away from the fort, Gyanendra Singh sees a vast army of Pindaris has surrounded his fort. He asks the British to help him but they refuse and make the Pindaris their ally in a bid to escape from Madhavghar. Before the British leave a battle follows in which the Governor and Gyanendra Singh are killed. Veer, wounded from a gunshot, falls unconscious in the arms of his father. Years later it is shown that Veer's son and Prithvi are having a friendly fight.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Salman Khan]] as Veer Pratap Singh/Veera(Duel role)\n* [[Zareen Khan]] as Princess Yashodhara\n* [[Mithun Chakraborty]] as Prithvi Singh, Veer's Father\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Gyanendra Singh, King of Madhavghar and Father of Yashodhara\n* [[Sohail Khan]] as Punya Pratap Singh, Veer's Brother\n* Raj Premi as one of the villains\n* Rishabh Jain as Radhurath, Veer's friend\n* [[Puru Raaj Kumar]] as Gajendra Singh, the prince of Madhavghar, brother to Yashodhara and son to Gyanendra.\n* [[Lisa Lazarus]] as Lady Angela Fraser, wife of Governor James Fraser\n* [[Tim Lawrence]] as James Fraser, Governor General of [[Rajasthan]]\n*[[Karmveer Choudhary]] as Mantri of Jackie Shroff\n* [[Khurram Tejrar]]\n* [[Gita Soto]]\n* [[Neena Gupta]] as Veer's mother\n* [[Aryan Vaid]]\n* [[Bharat Dabholkar]]\n* [[Bunny Anand]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/news/2009/salman-saved-bunny-231109.html |title= Salman saved Bunny Anand's life |author= Subhadeep Bhattacharjee |date= 23 November 2009|publisher=One India.com |accessdate=11 February 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Shahbaz Khan (actor)|Shahbaz Khan]] as Naunihal\n* [[Militza Radmilovic]]\n* [[Charissa Glidden]] as the Governess\n* [[Roy Bronsgeest]] as Rhino<ref>Manohar Charla.

They are the world's second-heaviest lizard, after the [[Komodo dragon]].<ref name=\"Shine_1996\"/> Their bodies are muscular, with long, powerful, laterally compressed tails. The scales in this species are keeled; scales found on top of the head have been noted to be  larger than those located on the back. Water monitors are often defined by their dark brown or blackish coloration with yellow spots found on their underside- these yellow markings have a tendency to disappear gradually with age. This species is also denoted by the blackish band with yellow edges extending back from each eye. These monitors have very long necks and an elongated snout. They use their powerful jaws, serrated teeth and sharp claws for both predation and defense. In captivity, Asian water monitors' life expectancy has been determined to be anywhere between 11\u201325 years depending on conditions, in the wild it is considerably shorter.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://wildlife-facts.weebly.com/asian-water-monitor.html|title=Asian Water Monitor|website=Wildlife Facts|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vitalexotics.com/water-monitor-black-dragon-care-sheet/|title=Water Monitor Care Sheet {{!}} Black Dragon Care Sheet {{!}} Varanus salvator Care Sheet {{!}} Vital Exotics|website=www.vitalexotics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202203120/http://www.vitalexotics.com/water-monitor-black-dragon-care-sheet/|archive-date=2017-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Water monitor showing split tongue .jpg|thumb|Showing its split tongue]]\nThe Asian water monitor is widely distributed from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, the Chinese [[Guangxi]] and [[Hainan]] provinces, Malaysia, Singapore to the [[Sunda islands]] [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi]].

It has been noted that these monitors are not deterred from living in areas of human disturbance. In fact, they have been known to adapt and thrive in agricultural areas as well as cities with canal systems (such as in Sri Lanka, where they are not hunted or persecuted by humans). This species does not thrive in habitats with extensive loss of natural vegetation and aquatic resources. Habitats that are considered to be most important to this species are mangrove vegetation, swamps, wetlands, and altitudes below 1000 meters.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\n[[File:Varanus salvator (illustration).jpg|thumb|Water monitors robbing eggs from a nest.

Previously, venom was thought to be unique to [[Serpentes]] (snakes) and ''[[Heloderma]]'' (venomous lizards). The aftereffects of a ''Varanus'' bite were thought to be due to oral [[bacteria]] alone, but recent studies have shown [[venom]] glands are likely to be present in the mouths of several, if not all, of the species. The venom may be used as a defensive mechanism to fend off predators, to help digest food, to sustain oral hygiene, and possibly to help in capturing and killing prey.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Arbuckle, K. |url=http://www.varanidae.org/Vol3_No2_Arbuckle.pdf |title=Ecological Function of Venom in ''Varanus'', with a Compilation of Dietary Records from the Literature|journal=Biowak |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=46\u221256 |year=2009}}</ref><ref>Yong, Ed.

The scales in this species are keeled; scales found on top of the head have been noted to be  larger than those located on the back. Water monitors are often defined by their dark brown or blackish coloration with yellow spots found on their underside- these yellow markings have a tendency to disappear gradually with age. This species is also denoted by the blackish band with yellow edges extending back from each eye. These monitors have very long necks and an elongated snout. They use their powerful jaws, serrated teeth and sharp claws for both predation and defense. In captivity, Asian water monitors' life expectancy has been determined to be anywhere between 11\u201325 years depending on conditions, in the wild it is considerably shorter.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://wildlife-facts.weebly.com/asian-water-monitor.html|title=Asian Water Monitor|website=Wildlife Facts|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vitalexotics.com/water-monitor-black-dragon-care-sheet/|title=Water Monitor Care Sheet {{!}} Black Dragon Care Sheet {{!}} Varanus salvator Care Sheet {{!}} Vital Exotics|website=www.vitalexotics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202203120/http://www.vitalexotics.com/water-monitor-black-dragon-care-sheet/|archive-date=2017-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Water monitor showing split tongue .jpg|thumb|Showing its split tongue]]\nThe Asian water monitor is widely distributed from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, the Chinese [[Guangxi]] and [[Hainan]] provinces, Malaysia, Singapore to the [[Sunda islands]] [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi]].

The word is also thought to bring bad luck, so some people prefer to call the animals 'silver-and-gold' ({{lang|th|\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e07\u0e34\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07}}) to avoid the jinx.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\nThe origin of this offensive meaning can be traced back to a time when more people lived in rural areas in close proximity to monitor lizards.  Traditionally, Thai villagers lived in two-story houses; the top floor was for living, while the ground floor was designed to be a space for domestic animals such as pigs, chickens, and dogs. Water monitors entered the ground floor and eat or maim the domestic animals, also hence the other name ''dtua gin gai'' ({{lang|th|\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e01\u0e48 }} \u2018chicken eater\u2019) or ''nong chorakae'' ({{lang|th|\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e08\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e02\u0e49}} \u2018younger brother of crocodile\u2019, \u2018little crocodile\u2019) and even sometimes called ''ta kuat'' ({{lang|th|\u0e15\u0e30\u0e01\u0e27\u0e14}}), which in fact refers to a [[Bengal monitor]] (''V. bengalensis''), a different species.<ref name=lao>{{cite web |publisher=[[Pantip.com]]|title=\u0e04\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e22\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e32\u0e22\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e40\u0e23\u0e34\u0e48\u0e21\u0e21\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a |accessdate=July 28, 2016 |date=2009 |url=http://topicstock.pantip.com/wahkor/topicstock/2009/11/X8498655/X8498655.html |first= |last= |language=Thai}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Bahasa Indonesia]] and [[Malay language]], the Asian water monitor is called ''biawak air''.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2016 |title=Studi Histokimia Sebaran Karbohidrat Usus Biawak Air (''Varanus salvator'') |journal=Acta Veterinaria Indonesiana |volume=3 |issue=2 |authors=Wahyuni, S., Jalaluddin, M. and Adnyane, I.

Although the nail is a structure produced by the skin and is a [[skin appendage]], nail diseases have a distinct classification as they have their own signs and symptoms which may relate to other medical conditions.

[[eponychium]]; H. free margin.]]\n\n*''Onychia'' is an [[inflammation]] of the nail folds (surrounding tissue of the nail plate) of the nail with formation of [[pus]] and shedding of the nail.  Onychia results from the introduction of microscopic [[pathogen]]s through small wounds.\n*''[[Ingrown nail|Onychocryptosis]]'', commonly known as \"ingrown nails\" (''unguis incarnatus''), can affect either the fingers or the toes.  In this condition, the nail cuts into one or both sides of the [[nail (anatomy)#nail bed|nail bed]], resulting in [[inflammation]] and possibly [[infection]]. The relative rarity of this condition in the fingers suggests that [[pressure]] from the ground or shoe against the toe is a prime factor. The movements involved in [[walking]] or other physical disturbances can contribute to the problem.  Mild [[onychocryptosis]], particularly in the absence of infection, can be treated by trimming and rounding the nail.  More advanced cases, which usually include [[infection]], are treated by [[surgically]] excising the ingrowing portion of the nail down to its bony origin and [[thermally]] or [[chemically]] [[cauterizing]] the matrix, or 'root', to prevent recurrence.  This surgery is called [[matrixectomy]]. The best results are achieved by cauterizing the matrix with [[phenol]]. The [[Ingrown nail|Vandenbos Procedure]] is a highly effective method that focuses on excision of excessive nail fold tissue without affecting the healthy nail and nail matrix. The Vandenbos procedure is showing high success rates in eliminating Onychocryptosis without altering the normal nail.

It can include [[discoloration]] of the nail, or [[dyschromia]].\n*''[[Onychogryposis]]'', also called \"ram's-horn nail\", is a thickening and increase in [[curvature]] of the nail.  It is usually the result of injury to the matrix.  It may be partially [[hereditary]] and can also occur as a result of long-term neglect.  It is most commonly seen in the great [[toe]] but may be seen in other toes as well as the fingernails.  An affected nail has many grooves and ridges, is brownish in color, and grows more quickly on one side than on the other.  The thick curved nail is difficult to cut, and often remains untrimmed, exacerbating the problem.\n[[File:Onychomycosis.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Onychomycosis]] in every nail of the right foot.]]\n\n*''[[Onycholysis]]'' is a loosening of the exposed portion of the nail from the nail bed, usually beginning at the free edge and continuing to the [[lunula (anatomy)|lunula]].

It may result from an acute injury or from repeated minor [[Physical trauma|trauma]] such as running in undersized shoes.  Acute [[subungual hematoma]]s are quite painful, and are usually treated by releasing the [[blood]] by creating a small hole in the nail.  [[Drilling]] and [[cauterization|thermal cautery]]  are common methods for creating the hole.

The normal process of change is: brittle nails, straight nails, spoon-shaped nails.\n*''[[Subungual hematoma]]'' occurs when trauma to the nail results in a collection of [[blood]], or [[hematoma]], under the nail.  It may result from an acute injury or from repeated minor [[Physical trauma|trauma]] such as running in undersized shoes.  Acute [[subungual hematoma]]s are quite painful, and are usually treated by releasing the [[blood]] by creating a small hole in the nail.  [[Drilling]] and [[cauterization|thermal cautery]]  are common methods for creating the hole.  Thermal cautery is not used on [[acrylic nails]] because they are [[flammable]].\n*''[[Onychomatricoma]]'', a tumor of the nail matrix.\n*''Nail [[Pemphigus]]'', an auto-immune disease.\n*''[[Longitudinal erythronychia|Erythronychia]]'', red bands in the nail from some inflammatory conditions.\n*''[[Melanonychia]]'', a black or brown discoloration of the nail, with numerous causes.\n\n==Nail changes and conditions associated with them==\n\nNail inspection can give hints to the internal condition of the body as well. \nNail disease can be very subtle and should be evaluated by a dermatologist with a focus in this particular area of medicine.

It monitors the amplification of a targeted [[DNA]] molecule during the PCR (i.e., in real time), not at its end, as in conventional PCR. Real-time PCR can be used quantitatively (quantitative real-time PCR) and semi-quantitatively (i.e., above/below a certain amount of DNA molecules) (semi-quantitative real-time PCR).\n\nTwo common methods for the detection of PCR products in real-time PCR are (1) non-specific [[fluorescent dye]]s that [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalate]] with any double-stranded DNA and (2) sequence-specific [[DNA probe]]s consisting of [[oligonucleotide]]s that are labelled with a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] reporter, which permits detection only after [[nucleic acid hybridisation|hybridization]] of the probe with its complementary sequence.\n\nThe [[Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments]] (MIQE) guidelines propose that the abbreviation ''qPCR'' be used for quantitative real-time PCR and that ''RT-qPCR'' be used for reverse transcription\u2013qPCR.<ref name=\"Bustin2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bustin SA, Benes V, Garson JA, Hellemans J, Huggett J, Kubista M, Mueller R, Nolan T, Pfaffl MW, Shipley GL, Vandesompele J, Wittwer CT|title=The MIQE guidelines: minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=55|issue=4|pages=611\u2013622|year=2009|pmid=19246619|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797}}</ref> The acronym \"RT-PCR\" commonly denotes [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] and not real-time PCR, but not all authors adhere to this convention.<ref name=\"Logan et al.\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Logan|editor1-first=Julie|editor2-last=Edwards|editor2-first=Kirstin|editor3-last=Saunders|editor3-first=Nick|year=2009|title=Real-Time PCR: Current Technology and Applications|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn=978-1-904455-39-4|last-author-amp=yes}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Molecular Beacons.jpg|thumb|Real time PCR uses [[fluorophore]]s in order to detect levels of [[gene expression]].]]\nCells in all organisms regulate [[gene expression]] by turnover of gene transcripts (single stranded [[RNA]]): The amount of an expressed gene in a cell can be measured by the number of copies of an RNA transcript of that gene present in a sample. In order to robustly detect and quantify gene expression from small amounts of RNA, amplification of the gene transcript is necessary. The [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is a common method for amplifying DNA; for RNA-based PCR the RNA sample is first reverse-transcribed to [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) with [[reverse transcriptase]].\n\nIn order to amplify small amounts of DNA, the same methodology is used as in conventional PCR using a DNA template, at least one pair of specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s, a suitable [[buffer solution]] and a thermo-stable [[DNA polymerase]]. A substance marked with a [[fluorophore]] is added to this mixture in a [[thermal cycler]] that contains [[sensor]]s for measuring the [[fluorescence]] of the fluorophore after it has been excited at the required [[wavelength]] allowing the generation rate to be measured for one or more specific products. \nThis allows the rate of generation of the amplified product to be measured at  each PCR cycle. The data thus generated can be analysed by computer software to calculate ''relative gene expression'' (or ''mRNA copy number'') in several samples. Quantitative PCR can also be applied to the detection and quantification of DNA in samples to determine the presence and abundance of a particular DNA sequence in these samples.<ref name=\"watson\">{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=J D|last2=Baker|first2=T A|last3=Bell|first3=S P|last4=Gann|first4=A|last5=Levine|first5=M|last6=Losick|first6=R|title=Molecular Biology of the Gene|date=2004|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-321-22368-5|edition=Fifth}}</ref> This measurement is made after each amplification cycle, and this is the reason why this method is called real time PCR (that is, immediate or simultaneous PCR).

In this instance the technique used is quantitative RT-PCR or Q-RT-PCR.\n\nQuantitative PCR and [[DNA microarray]] are modern methodologies for studying [[gene expression]]. Older methods were used to measure mRNA abundance: [[Differential display]], [[RNase protection assay]] and [[northern blot]]. [[Northern blot|Northern blotting]] is often used to estimate the expression level of a gene by visualizing the abundance of its mRNA transcript in a sample. In this method, purified RNA is separated by [[agarose gel electrophoresis]], transferred to a solid matrix (such as a nylon membrane), and probed with a specific [[Hybridization probe|DNA or RNA probe]] that is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the gene of interest. Although this technique is still used to assess gene expression, it requires relatively large amounts of RNA and provides only qualitative or semi quantitative information of mRNA levels.<ref name=\"Pfaffl\">Michael W.

An increase in DNA product during PCR therefore leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity measured at each cycle. However, dsDNA dyes such as [[SYBR Green]] will bind to all dsDNA PCR products, including nonspecific PCR products (such as [[Primer dimer]]). This can potentially interfere with, or prevent, accurate monitoring of the intended target sequence.\n\nIn real-time PCR with dsDNA dyes the reaction is prepared as usual, with the addition of fluorescent dsDNA dye. Then the reaction is run in a [[Quantitative PCR instrument|real-time PCR instrument]], and after each cycle, the intensity of fluorescence is measured with a detector; the dye only fluoresces when bound to the dsDNA (i.e., the PCR product). \nThis method has the advantage of only needing a pair of primers to carry out the amplification, which keeps costs down; multiple target sequences can be monitored in a tube by using different types of dyes.\n\n=== Specific detection: fluorescent reporter probe method ===\n[[File:TaqMan Probes.jpg|thumb|750px|(1) In intact probes, reporter fluorescence is quenched. (2) Probes and the complementary DNA strand are hybridized and reporter fluorescence is still quenched. (3) During PCR, the probe is degraded by the Taq polymerase and the fluorescent reporter released.]]\n\n[[fluorescence|Fluorescent]] reporter probes detect only the DNA containing the sequence complementary to the probe; therefore, use of the reporter probe significantly increases specificity, and enables performing the technique even in the presence of other dsDNA. Using different-coloured labels, fluorescent probes can be used in multiplex assays for monitoring several target sequences in the same tube. The specificity of fluorescent reporter probes also prevents interference of measurements caused by [[Primer Dimer|primer dimers]], which are undesirable potential by-products in PCR. However, fluorescent reporter probes do not prevent the inhibitory effect of the primer dimers, which may depress accumulation of the desired products in the reaction.\n\nThe method relies on a DNA-based probe with a fluorescent reporter at one end and a [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quencher]] of fluorescence at the opposite end of the probe. The close proximity of the reporter to the quencher prevents detection of its fluorescence; breakdown of the probe by the 5' to 3' [[exonuclease]] activity of the [[Taq polymerase]] breaks the reporter-quencher proximity and thus allows unquenched emission of fluorescence, which can be detected after [[Excited state|excitation]] with a laser. An increase in the product targeted by the reporter probe at each PCR cycle therefore causes a proportional increase in fluorescence due to the breakdown of the probe and release of the reporter.\n\n#The PCR is prepared as usual (see [[PCR]]), and the reporter probe is added.\n#As the reaction commences, during the [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]] stage of the PCR both probe and primers anneal to the DNA target.\n#Polymerisation of a new DNA strand is initiated from the primers, and once the polymerase reaches the probe, its 5'-3'-exonuclease degrades the probe, physically separating the fluorescent reporter from the quencher, resulting in an increase in fluorescence.\n#Fluorescence is detected and measured in a real-time PCR machine, and its geometric increase corresponding to exponential increase of the product is used to determine the quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]] in each reaction.\n\n== Fusion temperature analysis ==\n[[File:Melting Ponchel2003.jpg|thumb|Distinct fusion curves for a number of PCR products (showing distinct colours).

This is because, despite being a kinetic technique, quantitative PCR is usually evaluated at a distinct end point. The technique therefore usually provides more rapid results and/or uses fewer reactants than electrophoresis. If subsequent electrophoresis is required it is only necessary to test those samples that real time PCR has shown to be doubtful and/or to ratify the results for samples that have tested positive for a specific determinant.\n\n=== Modeling ===\nUnlike end point PCR (conventional PCR), real time PCR allows monitoring of the desired product at any point in the amplification process by measuring fluorescence (in real time frame, measurement is made of its level over a given threshold). A commonly employed method of DNA quantification by real-time PCR relies on plotting fluorescence against the number of cycles on a [[logarithmic scale]]. A threshold for detection of DNA-based fluorescence is set 3\u20135 times of the [[standard deviation]] of the signal noise above background. The number of cycles at which the fluorescence exceeds the threshold is called the threshold cycle (C<sub>t</sub>) or, according to the MIQE guidelines, quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]].<ref name=\"S.

It monitors the amplification of a targeted [[DNA]] molecule during the PCR (i.e., in real time), not at its end, as in conventional PCR. Real-time PCR can be used quantitatively (quantitative real-time PCR) and semi-quantitatively (i.e., above/below a certain amount of DNA molecules) (semi-quantitative real-time PCR).\n\nTwo common methods for the detection of PCR products in real-time PCR are (1) non-specific [[fluorescent dye]]s that [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalate]] with any double-stranded DNA and (2) sequence-specific [[DNA probe]]s consisting of [[oligonucleotide]]s that are labelled with a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] reporter, which permits detection only after [[nucleic acid hybridisation|hybridization]] of the probe with its complementary sequence.\n\nThe [[Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments]] (MIQE) guidelines propose that the abbreviation ''qPCR'' be used for quantitative real-time PCR and that ''RT-qPCR'' be used for reverse transcription\u2013qPCR.<ref name=\"Bustin2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bustin SA, Benes V, Garson JA, Hellemans J, Huggett J, Kubista M, Mueller R, Nolan T, Pfaffl MW, Shipley GL, Vandesompele J, Wittwer CT|title=The MIQE guidelines: minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=55|issue=4|pages=611\u2013622|year=2009|pmid=19246619|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797}}</ref> The acronym \"RT-PCR\" commonly denotes [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] and not real-time PCR, but not all authors adhere to this convention.<ref name=\"Logan et al.\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Logan|editor1-first=Julie|editor2-last=Edwards|editor2-first=Kirstin|editor3-last=Saunders|editor3-first=Nick|year=2009|title=Real-Time PCR: Current Technology and Applications|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn=978-1-904455-39-4|last-author-amp=yes}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Molecular Beacons.jpg|thumb|Real time PCR uses [[fluorophore]]s in order to detect levels of [[gene expression]].]]\nCells in all organisms regulate [[gene expression]] by turnover of gene transcripts (single stranded [[RNA]]): The amount of an expressed gene in a cell can be measured by the number of copies of an RNA transcript of that gene present in a sample. In order to robustly detect and quantify gene expression from small amounts of RNA, amplification of the gene transcript is necessary. The [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is a common method for amplifying DNA; for RNA-based PCR the RNA sample is first reverse-transcribed to [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) with [[reverse transcriptase]].\n\nIn order to amplify small amounts of DNA, the same methodology is used as in conventional PCR using a DNA template, at least one pair of specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s, a suitable [[buffer solution]] and a thermo-stable [[DNA polymerase]]. A substance marked with a [[fluorophore]] is added to this mixture in a [[thermal cycler]] that contains [[sensor]]s for measuring the [[fluorescence]] of the fluorophore after it has been excited at the required [[wavelength]] allowing the generation rate to be measured for one or more specific products. \nThis allows the rate of generation of the amplified product to be measured at  each PCR cycle. The data thus generated can be analysed by computer software to calculate ''relative gene expression'' (or ''mRNA copy number'') in several samples. Quantitative PCR can also be applied to the detection and quantification of DNA in samples to determine the presence and abundance of a particular DNA sequence in these samples.<ref name=\"watson\">{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=J D|last2=Baker|first2=T A|last3=Bell|first3=S P|last4=Gann|first4=A|last5=Levine|first5=M|last6=Losick|first6=R|title=Molecular Biology of the Gene|date=2004|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-321-22368-5|edition=Fifth}}</ref> This measurement is made after each amplification cycle, and this is the reason why this method is called real time PCR (that is, immediate or simultaneous PCR).

In this instance the technique used is quantitative RT-PCR or Q-RT-PCR.\n\nQuantitative PCR and [[DNA microarray]] are modern methodologies for studying [[gene expression]]. Older methods were used to measure mRNA abundance: [[Differential display]], [[RNase protection assay]] and [[northern blot]]. [[Northern blot|Northern blotting]] is often used to estimate the expression level of a gene by visualizing the abundance of its mRNA transcript in a sample. In this method, purified RNA is separated by [[agarose gel electrophoresis]], transferred to a solid matrix (such as a nylon membrane), and probed with a specific [[Hybridization probe|DNA or RNA probe]] that is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the gene of interest. Although this technique is still used to assess gene expression, it requires relatively large amounts of RNA and provides only qualitative or semi quantitative information of mRNA levels.<ref name=\"Pfaffl\">Michael W.

An increase in DNA product during PCR therefore leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity measured at each cycle. However, dsDNA dyes such as [[SYBR Green]] will bind to all dsDNA PCR products, including nonspecific PCR products (such as [[Primer dimer]]). This can potentially interfere with, or prevent, accurate monitoring of the intended target sequence.\n\nIn real-time PCR with dsDNA dyes the reaction is prepared as usual, with the addition of fluorescent dsDNA dye. Then the reaction is run in a [[Quantitative PCR instrument|real-time PCR instrument]], and after each cycle, the intensity of fluorescence is measured with a detector; the dye only fluoresces when bound to the dsDNA (i.e., the PCR product). \nThis method has the advantage of only needing a pair of primers to carry out the amplification, which keeps costs down; multiple target sequences can be monitored in a tube by using different types of dyes.\n\n=== Specific detection: fluorescent reporter probe method ===\n[[File:TaqMan Probes.jpg|thumb|750px|(1) In intact probes, reporter fluorescence is quenched. (2) Probes and the complementary DNA strand are hybridized and reporter fluorescence is still quenched. (3) During PCR, the probe is degraded by the Taq polymerase and the fluorescent reporter released.]]\n\n[[fluorescence|Fluorescent]] reporter probes detect only the DNA containing the sequence complementary to the probe; therefore, use of the reporter probe significantly increases specificity, and enables performing the technique even in the presence of other dsDNA. Using different-coloured labels, fluorescent probes can be used in multiplex assays for monitoring several target sequences in the same tube. The specificity of fluorescent reporter probes also prevents interference of measurements caused by [[Primer Dimer|primer dimers]], which are undesirable potential by-products in PCR. However, fluorescent reporter probes do not prevent the inhibitory effect of the primer dimers, which may depress accumulation of the desired products in the reaction.\n\nThe method relies on a DNA-based probe with a fluorescent reporter at one end and a [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quencher]] of fluorescence at the opposite end of the probe. The close proximity of the reporter to the quencher prevents detection of its fluorescence; breakdown of the probe by the 5' to 3' [[exonuclease]] activity of the [[Taq polymerase]] breaks the reporter-quencher proximity and thus allows unquenched emission of fluorescence, which can be detected after [[Excited state|excitation]] with a laser. An increase in the product targeted by the reporter probe at each PCR cycle therefore causes a proportional increase in fluorescence due to the breakdown of the probe and release of the reporter.\n\n#The PCR is prepared as usual (see [[PCR]]), and the reporter probe is added.\n#As the reaction commences, during the [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]] stage of the PCR both probe and primers anneal to the DNA target.\n#Polymerisation of a new DNA strand is initiated from the primers, and once the polymerase reaches the probe, its 5'-3'-exonuclease degrades the probe, physically separating the fluorescent reporter from the quencher, resulting in an increase in fluorescence.\n#Fluorescence is detected and measured in a real-time PCR machine, and its geometric increase corresponding to exponential increase of the product is used to determine the quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]] in each reaction.\n\n== Fusion temperature analysis ==\n[[File:Melting Ponchel2003.jpg|thumb|Distinct fusion curves for a number of PCR products (showing distinct colours).

This is because, despite being a kinetic technique, quantitative PCR is usually evaluated at a distinct end point. The technique therefore usually provides more rapid results and/or uses fewer reactants than electrophoresis. If subsequent electrophoresis is required it is only necessary to test those samples that real time PCR has shown to be doubtful and/or to ratify the results for samples that have tested positive for a specific determinant.\n\n=== Modeling ===\nUnlike end point PCR (conventional PCR), real time PCR allows monitoring of the desired product at any point in the amplification process by measuring fluorescence (in real time frame, measurement is made of its level over a given threshold). A commonly employed method of DNA quantification by real-time PCR relies on plotting fluorescence against the number of cycles on a [[logarithmic scale]]. A threshold for detection of DNA-based fluorescence is set 3\u20135 times of the [[standard deviation]] of the signal noise above background. The number of cycles at which the fluorescence exceeds the threshold is called the threshold cycle (C<sub>t</sub>) or, according to the MIQE guidelines, quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]].<ref name=\"S.

Therefore, the efficiency of a primer-template combination is assessed in a [[titration]] experiment with serial dilutions of DNA template to create a [[standard curve]] of the change in [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]] with each dilution. The [[slope]] of the [[linear regression]] is then used to determine the efficiency of amplification, which is 100% if a dilution of 1:2 results in a [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]] difference of 1.

This is often carried out by relative quantification using a control gene from the treated species that is only present as a single copy.<ref name=\"Holst-jensen2003\">{{Cite journal|last1=Holst-Jensen|first1=Arne|last2=R\u00f8nning|first2=Sissel B.|last3=L\u00f8vseth|first3=Astrid|last4=Berdal|first4=Knut G.|year=2003|title=PCR technology for screening and quantification of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|volume=375|number=8|pages=985\u2013993|doi=10.1007/s00216-003-1767-7|pmid=12733008}}</ref><ref name=\"Brodmann2002\">{{Cite journal|year=2002|title=\u2026 -Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Methods for Four Genetically Modified Maize Varieties \u2026|journal=Journal of AOAC International|volume=85|pages=646\u2013653|author1=Brodmann P.D|author2=Ilg E.C|author3=Berthoud H|author4=Herrmann A.|issue=3|doi=10.1093/jaoac/85.3.646|pmid=12083257}}</ref>\n\n=== Clinical quantification and genotyping ===\nViruses can be present in humans due to direct infection or co-infections which makes [[diagnosis]] difficult using classical techniques and can result in an incorrect [[prognosis]] and treatment.

Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.\n\nTypical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20\u201321}}\n* [[Quartz]]: SiO<sub>2</sub>\n* [[Calcite]]: CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\n* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)<sub>3</sub>AlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n\n[[File:L\u00f6ssacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]\nParent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.\n\nResidual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}\n\nMost soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.\n* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60\u201390 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.\n* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.\n* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.\n* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].\n\nCumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.\n\n=====Weathering=====\nThe [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref> Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable.

Tend to form in the B-horizon in high sodium soil where clay has accumulated.\n## Angular and subangular: Blocky peds are imperfect cubes, 5\u201350&nbsp;mm, angular have sharp edges, subangular have rounded edges. Tend to form in the B-horizon where clay has accumulated and indicate poor water penetration.\n## Granular and Crumb: Spheroid peds of polyhedrons, 1\u201310&nbsp;mm, often found in the A-horizon in the presence of organic material. Crumb peds are more porous and are considered ideal.\n# Classes: '''Size''' of peds whose ranges depend upon the above type\n## Very fine or very thin: <1&nbsp;mm platy and spherical; <5&nbsp;mm blocky; <10&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n## Fine or thin: 1\u20132&nbsp;mm platy, and spherical; 5\u201310&nbsp;mm blocky; 10\u201320&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n## Medium: 2\u20135&nbsp;mm platy, granular; 10\u201320&nbsp;mm blocky; 20\u201350 prismlike.\n## Coarse or thick: 5\u201310&nbsp;mm platy, granular; 20\u201350&nbsp;mm blocky; 50\u2013100&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n## Very coarse or very thick: >10&nbsp;mm platy, granular; >50&nbsp;mm blocky; >100&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n# Grades: Is a measure of the degree of '''development''' or cementation within the peds that results in their strength and stability.\n## Weak: Weak cementation allows peds to fall apart into the three textural constituents, sand, silt and clay.\n## Moderate: Peds are not distinct in undisturbed soil but when removed they break into aggregates, some broken aggregates and little unaggregated material. This is considered ideal.\n## Strong:Peds are distinct before removed from the profile and do not break apart easily.\n## Structureless: Soil is entirely cemented together in one great mass such as slabs of clay or no cementation at all such as with sand.\n\nAt the largest scale, the forces that shape a soil's structure result from [[Shrink\u2013swell capacity|swelling and shrinkage]] that initially tend to act horizontally, causing vertically oriented prismatic peds. This mechanical process is mainly exemplified in the development of [[vertisols]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dinka |first1=Takele M. |last2=Morgan |first2=Cristine L.S. |last3=McInnes |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Kishn\u00e9 |first4= Andrea Sz. |last5=Harmel |first5=R.

In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.\n\nThe terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:\n\n# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard\n# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm\n# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic\n# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62\u201363, 565\u201367}}\n\nSoil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads.

The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction.

The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.\n: <math>\\delta T</math> is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].\n: <math>\\delta x</math> is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.\n\nHeat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign.

As plants absorb the nutrients from the soil water, the soluble pool is replenished from the surface-bound pool. The decomposition of [[soil organic matter]] by microorganisms is another mechanism whereby the soluble pool of nutrients is replenished \u2013 this is important for the supply of plant-available N, S, P, and B from soil.<ref name=\"Roy2006Chapter4\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/soilbiodiversity/Downloadable_files/fpnb16.pdf |title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management |last1=Roy |first1=R.

However, in the case of phosphorus, diffusion is needed to supplement mass flow. For the most part, nutrient ions must travel some distance in the soil solution to reach the root surface. This movement can take place by mass flow, as when dissolved nutrients are carried along with the soil water flowing toward a root that is actively drawing water from the soil. In this type of movement, the nutrient ions are somewhat analogous to leaves floating down a stream. In addition, nutrient ions continually move by diffusion from areas of greater concentration toward the nutrient-depleted areas of lower concentration around the root surface. That process is due to random motion, also called [[Brownian motion]], of molecules within a gradient of decreasing concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kramers |first=Hendrik Anthony |year=1940 |title=Brownian motion in a field of force and the diffusion model of chemical reactions |journal=[[Physica (journal)|Physica]] |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=284\u2013304 |url=http://fy.chalmers.se/~frtbm/NonlinearDynamics/Kramers.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(40)90098-2 |accessdate=11 August 2019 |bibcode=1940Phy.....7..284K }}</ref> By this means, plants can continue to take up nutrients even at night, when water is only slowly absorbed into the roots as [[transpiration]] has almost stopped following [[stoma]]tal closure.

Genetic migration across strata is when contemporary genetic material leaches into older [[Sediment|sedimentary deposits]]. This was confirmed in a study on two cave sites in New Zealand.

It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications.

Soils degradation involves the [[Soil acidification|acidification]], [[soil contamination|contamination]], [[desertification]], [[erosion]] or [[Soil salinity|salination]].\n\n[[Soil acidification]] is beneficial in the case of alkaline soils, but it degrades land when it lowers crop productivity and increases soil vulnerability to contamination and erosion. Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].\n\n[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore [[soil functions]] and values. Techniques include leaching, air sparging, chemical amendments, [[phytoremediation]], [[bioremediation]] and natural degradation. An example of diffuse pollution with contaminants is the copper distribution in agricultural soils mainly due to fungicide applications in vineyards and other permanent crops.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ballabio|first=Cristiano|last2=Panagos|first2=Panos|last3=Lugato|first3=Emanuele|last4=Huang|first4=Jen-How|last5=Orgiazzi|first5=Alberto|last6=Jones|first6=Arwyn|last7=Fern\u00e1ndez-Ugalde|first7=Oihane|last8=Borrelli|first8=Pasquale|last9=Montanarella|first9=Luca|date=2018-09-15|title=Copper distribution in European topsoils: An assessment based on LUCAS soil survey|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=636|pages=282\u2013298|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.268|pmid=29709848|issn=0048-9697|bibcode=2018ScTEn.636..282B}}</ref>\n[[File:Soil erosion, Southfield - geograph.org.uk - 367917.jpg|thumb|Desertification]]\n\n[[Desertification]] is an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity. It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.\n[[File:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|thumb|upright|Erosion control]]\n\n[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.\n\nA serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.\n\nSoil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as [[Sinkhole|sink hole]] formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = j. a. a. | title = Soil piping and stream channel initiation | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 602\u201310 | year = 1976 | doi = 10.1029/WR007i003p00602 | bibcode=1971WRR.....7..602J}}</ref> The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dooley|first=Alan|title=Sandboils 101: Corps has experience dealing with common flood danger | website = Engineer Update|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers\n|date=June 2006|url=http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/pubs/jun06/story8.htm|accessdate = 14 May 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418185527/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/pubs/jun06/story8.htm |archivedate = 18 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Soil salination]] is the accumulation of free [[salt]]s to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. [[Surface irrigation|Irrigation]] of arid lands is especially problematic.<ref>{{cite web | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18\u201334 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219070320/http://waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | archivedate = 19 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> All irrigation water has some level of salinity.

For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.\n\nMany farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.\n\nIn 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.<ref name=\"Water Management Institute2010\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |author=International Water Management Institute}}</ref>\n\nIf the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition.

Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.\n\nTypical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20\u201321}}\n* [[Quartz]]: SiO<sub>2</sub>\n* [[Calcite]]: CaCO<sub>3</sub>\n* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\n* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)<sub>3</sub>AlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n\n[[File:L\u00f6ssacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]\nParent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.\n\nResidual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}\n\nMost soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.\n* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60\u201390 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.\n* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.\n* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.\n* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].\n\nCumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.\n\n=====Weathering=====\nThe [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref> Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable.

Rocks that will decompose in a few years in tropical climates will remain unaltered for millennia in deserts.<ref name=\"Gilluly1975\"/> Structural changes are the result of hydration, oxidation, and reduction.

Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of \"shells\". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying, thereby stressing the rock. Finally, organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=28\u201331}} Grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Clive G. |last2=Shachak |first2=Moshe |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990 |title=Fertilization of the desert soil by rock-eating snails |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=346 |issue=6287 |pages=839\u201341 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242874418 |doi=10.1038/346839a0 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=1990Natur.346..839J }}</ref>\n* ''Chemical decomposition'' and ''structural changes'' result when minerals are made soluble by water or are changed in structure.

Topography determines the rate of precipitation or [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and rate of formation or erosion of the surface [[soil profile]]. The topographical setting may either hasten or retard the work of climatic forces.\n\nSteep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by [[erosion]] and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence, little mineral deposition in lower profiles. In semiarid regions, the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover, so there is less plant contribution to soil formation. For all of these reasons, steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction. Therefore, soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow, poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby, more level sites.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Baoyuan |last2=Nearing |first2=Mark A. |last3=Risse |first3=L.

However, in the lowest landscape positions, water may saturate the regolith to such a degree that drainage and aeration are restricted. Here, the weathering of some minerals and the decomposition of organic matter are retarded, while the loss of iron and manganese is accelerated. In such low-lying topography, special profile features characteristic of [[wetland]] soils may develop. Depressions allow the accumulation of water, minerals and organic matter and in the extreme, the resulting soils will be [[saline marsh]]es or [[peat bog]]s.

Prismatic peds have flat tops, columnar peds have rounded tops. Tend to form in the B-horizon in high sodium soil where clay has accumulated.\n## Angular and subangular: Blocky peds are imperfect cubes, 5\u201350&nbsp;mm, angular have sharp edges, subangular have rounded edges. Tend to form in the B-horizon where clay has accumulated and indicate poor water penetration.\n## Granular and Crumb: Spheroid peds of polyhedrons, 1\u201310&nbsp;mm, often found in the A-horizon in the presence of organic material. Crumb peds are more porous and are considered ideal.\n# Classes: '''Size''' of peds whose ranges depend upon the above type\n## Very fine or very thin: <1&nbsp;mm platy and spherical; <5&nbsp;mm blocky; <10&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n## Fine or thin: 1\u20132&nbsp;mm platy, and spherical; 5\u201310&nbsp;mm blocky; 10\u201320&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n## Medium: 2\u20135&nbsp;mm platy, granular; 10\u201320&nbsp;mm blocky; 20\u201350 prismlike.\n## Coarse or thick: 5\u201310&nbsp;mm platy, granular; 20\u201350&nbsp;mm blocky; 50\u2013100&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n## Very coarse or very thick: >10&nbsp;mm platy, granular; >50&nbsp;mm blocky; >100&nbsp;mm prismlike.\n# Grades: Is a measure of the degree of '''development''' or cementation within the peds that results in their strength and stability.\n## Weak: Weak cementation allows peds to fall apart into the three textural constituents, sand, silt and clay.\n## Moderate: Peds are not distinct in undisturbed soil but when removed they break into aggregates, some broken aggregates and little unaggregated material. This is considered ideal.\n## Strong:Peds are distinct before removed from the profile and do not break apart easily.\n## Structureless: Soil is entirely cemented together in one great mass such as slabs of clay or no cementation at all such as with sand.\n\nAt the largest scale, the forces that shape a soil's structure result from [[Shrink\u2013swell capacity|swelling and shrinkage]] that initially tend to act horizontally, causing vertically oriented prismatic peds.

In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.\n\nThe terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:\n\n# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard\n# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm\n# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic\n# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62\u201363, 565\u201367}}\n\nSoil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads.

The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction. For the simple case of conduction into or out of the soil in the vertical direction, which is most often applicable the heat flux density is:\n\n: <math>q_x  = - k \\frac{\\delta T}{\\delta x}</math>\n\nIn [[SI]] units\n: <math>q</math> is the heat flux density, in SI the units are [[Watt|W]]\u00b7m<sup>\u22122</sup>\n: <math>k</math> is the soils' [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7[[Kelvin|K]]<sup>\u22121</sup>. The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.\n: <math>\\delta T</math> is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].\n: <math>\\delta x</math> is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.\n\nHeat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign. That is to say, if the temperature of the surface is higher than at depth x, the negative sign will result in a positive value for the heat flux q, and which is interpreted as the heat being conducted into the soil.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Striking colours and contrasting patterns are especially noticeable. The [[Red River of the South]] carries sediment eroded from extensive reddish soils like [[Port Silt Loam]] in Oklahoma.

For example, the application of finely ground minerals, [[feldspar]] and [[apatite]], to soil seldom provides the necessary amounts of potassium and phosphorus at a rate sufficient for good plant growth, as most of the nutrients remain bound in the crystals of those minerals.{{sfn|Dean|1957|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nThe nutrients adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay colloids and [[soil organic matter]] provide a more accessible reservoir of many plant nutrients (e.g. K, Ca, Mg, P, Zn). As plants absorb the nutrients from the soil water, the soluble pool is replenished from the surface-bound pool. The decomposition of [[soil organic matter]] by microorganisms is another mechanism whereby the soluble pool of nutrients is replenished \u2013 this is important for the supply of plant-available N, S, P, and B from soil.<ref name=\"Roy2006Chapter4\">{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/soilbiodiversity/Downloadable_files/fpnb16.pdf |title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management |last1=Roy |first1=R.

However, in the case of phosphorus, diffusion is needed to supplement mass flow. For the most part, nutrient ions must travel some distance in the soil solution to reach the root surface. This movement can take place by mass flow, as when dissolved nutrients are carried along with the soil water flowing toward a root that is actively drawing water from the soil. In this type of movement, the nutrient ions are somewhat analogous to leaves floating down a stream. In addition, nutrient ions continually move by diffusion from areas of greater concentration toward the nutrient-depleted areas of lower concentration around the root surface. That process is due to random motion, also called [[Brownian motion]], of molecules within a gradient of decreasing concentration.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kramers |first=Hendrik Anthony |year=1940 |title=Brownian motion in a field of force and the diffusion model of chemical reactions |journal=[[Physica (journal)|Physica]] |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=284\u2013304 |url=http://fy.chalmers.se/~frtbm/NonlinearDynamics/Kramers.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(40)90098-2 |accessdate=11 August 2019 |bibcode=1940Phy.....7..284K }}</ref> By this means, plants can continue to take up nutrients even at night, when water is only slowly absorbed into the roots as [[transpiration]] has almost stopped following [[stoma]]tal closure.

Clay soils often have higher organic contents that persist longer than soils without clay as the organic molecules adhere to and are stabilised by the clay. Proteins normally decompose readily, but when bound to clay particles, they become more resistant to decomposition. Clay particles also absorb the enzymes exuded by microbes which would normally break down proteins. The addition of organic matter to clay soils can render that organic matter and any added nutrients inaccessible to plants and microbes for many years.

That growth often results in the accumulation of organic residues. The accumulated organic layer called the [[forest floor|O horizon]] produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it. Organisms colonise and break down organic materials, making available nutrients upon which other plants and animals can live. After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.\n\n==Classification==\n{{main|Soil classification}}\n\nSoil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil in a particular region. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications.

Soils degradation involves the [[Soil acidification|acidification]], [[soil contamination|contamination]], [[desertification]], [[erosion]] or [[Soil salinity|salination]].\n\n[[Soil acidification]] is beneficial in the case of alkaline soils, but it degrades land when it lowers crop productivity and increases soil vulnerability to contamination and erosion. Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].\n\n[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively.

An example of diffuse pollution with contaminants is the copper distribution in agricultural soils mainly due to fungicide applications in vineyards and other permanent crops.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ballabio|first=Cristiano|last2=Panagos|first2=Panos|last3=Lugato|first3=Emanuele|last4=Huang|first4=Jen-How|last5=Orgiazzi|first5=Alberto|last6=Jones|first6=Arwyn|last7=Fern\u00e1ndez-Ugalde|first7=Oihane|last8=Borrelli|first8=Pasquale|last9=Montanarella|first9=Luca|date=2018-09-15|title=Copper distribution in European topsoils: An assessment based on LUCAS soil survey|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=636|pages=282\u2013298|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.268|pmid=29709848|issn=0048-9697|bibcode=2018ScTEn.636..282B}}</ref>\n[[File:Soil erosion, Southfield - geograph.org.uk - 367917.jpg|thumb|Desertification]]\n\n[[Desertification]] is an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity. It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.\n[[File:Riparian buffer on Bear Creek in Story County, Iowa.JPG|thumb|upright|Erosion control]]\n\n[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.\n\nA serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.\n\nSoil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as [[Sinkhole|sink hole]] formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = j. a. a. | title = Soil piping and stream channel initiation | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 602\u201310 | year = 1976 | doi = 10.1029/WR007i003p00602 | bibcode=1971WRR.....7..602J}}</ref> The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dooley|first=Alan|title=Sandboils 101: Corps has experience dealing with common flood danger | website = Engineer Update|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers\n|date=June 2006|url=http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/pubs/jun06/story8.htm|accessdate = 14 May 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418185527/http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/cepa/pubs/jun06/story8.htm |archivedate = 18 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Soil salination]] is the accumulation of free [[salt]]s to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. [[Surface irrigation|Irrigation]] of arid lands is especially problematic.<ref>{{cite web | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18\u201334 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219070320/http://waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | archivedate = 19 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying [[water table]]. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the [[capillary fringe]] of saline groundwater.

For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.\n\nMany farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.\n\nIn 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.<ref name=\"Water Management Institute2010\">{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |author=International Water Management Institute}}</ref>\n\nIf the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition.
