It was originally going to be called ''Crawl Through Knives'' but was later changed to its current title.\n\nThe album features the artwork of [[Derek Hess]], who is popular among metal bands and has produced artwork for [[Converge (band)|Converge]] and [[Sepultura]], amongst others. Specifically the artwork of Sepultura's album ''[[Roorback]]'' has a lot of similarities.\n\nThe song \"Take This Life\" is featured in ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' and music videos were produced for the song, along with \"Come Clarity\".\n\nThe drums, vocals, keys and programming were recorded at \"Dug Out Studio\" in [[Uppsala]], and guitars and bass were recorded at \"The Room\" in [[Gothenburg]]. This album was mixed and mastered at \"Tonteknik Recording\".\n\n== Style ==\nStylistically this harkens back to the band's heavier roots with elements of the later style still present.  The band had claimed the sound would be \"a bit of the old and a bit of the new\".\n\n''Come Clarity'' features the return of the guitar harmonies and the solos to the band, and can be described as a combination of their older sound with their newer sound.\n\nThe song \"Dead End\" is the fourth In Flames song to feature female vocals (the others are \"Everlost, Pt. 2\" from ''[[Lunar Strain]]'', \"Whoracle\" from ''[[Whoracle]]'' and \"Metaphor\" from ''Reroute to Remain''.)\n\n== Sales and awards ==\nThe album debuted at number 1 in Sweden<ref>{{cite web | url=http://swedishcharts.com/search.asp?cat=a&search=In+Flames | year=2006| title=In Flames Chart Positions | work=Swedish Charts | accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> and number 58 on the United States [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; in the latter country, selling almost 25,000 copies in its first week, and 50,000 in its first month. Since its release, the album has sold more than 110,000 copies in the United States. The album has also sold over 400,000 copies worldwide.\n\nThe album won the award for Best Hard Rock Album in the 2007 [[Grammis]] (Swedish Grammy Awards) over such nominated albums such as [[The Haunted (Swedish band)|The Haunted]]'s ''[[The Dead Eye]]'' and [[HammerFall]]'s ''[[Threshold (album)|Threshold]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.grammis.se/?page=32 | year=2007| title=Come Clarity winning Best Hardrock award at 2007 Grammis. | work=Grammis | accessdate=2007-02-26 }}</ref>\n\n''Come Clarity'' was named Best Swedish album of the Past Decade by readers of Swedish newspaper [[Aftonbladet]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/article6348054.ab | year=2009| title=In Flames & Bossen b\u00e4st | work=Aftonbladet | accessdate=2009-12-29 }}</ref>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing = [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]], and [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]]\n| title1 = Take This Life\n| length1 = 3:35\n| title2 = Leeches\n| length2 = 2:55\n| title3 = Reflect the Storm\n| length3 = 4:16\n| title4 = Dead End\n| length4 = 3:22\n| title5 = Scream\n| length5 = 3:12\n| title6 = [[Come Clarity (song)|Come Clarity]]\n| length6 = 4:15\n| title7 = Vacuum\n| length7 = 3:39\n| title8 = Pacing Death's Trail\n| length8 = 3:00\n| title9 = Crawl Through Knives\n| length9 = 4:02\n| title10 = Versus Terminus\n| length10 = 3:18\n| title11 = Our Infinite Struggle\n| note11 = Incorrectly listed as \"Our Infinite Solution\" on digital stores\n| length11 = 3:46\n| title12 = Vanishing Light\n| length12 = 3:14\n| title13 = Your Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone\n| length13 = 5:25\n|total_length = 48:06\n}}\nThe track \"Crawl Through Knives\" is listed incorrectly on some programs as \"Crawling Through Knives\", along with others such as \"Reflect the Storm\" which is listed as \"Reflect the End\", and \"Versus Terminus\"  as \"End of All Things\".{{Citation needed|reason=May 12|date=May 2009}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== In Flames ===\n* [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]] \u2013 [[Singing|vocals]]\n* [[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]] \u2013  [[lead guitar]] \n* [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] \u2013 [[rhythm guitar]]\n* [[Peter Iwers]] \u2013 [[Bass guitar|bass]]\n* [[Daniel Svensson]] \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n\n===Other personnel===\n;Additional musicians\n* \u00d6rjan \u00d6rnkloo \u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s and [[Programming (music)|programming]]\n* Uppsala Poker HC Crew \u2013 additional vocals on \"Scream\"\n* [[Lisa Miskovsky]] \u2013 additional vocals on \"Dead End\"\n\n;Production\n*Eskil L\u00f6vstrom - [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] \n*Pelle Henricsson - mixing & [[audio mastering|mastering]]\n*Magnus Lander- tracking\n\n;Additional personnel\n*Patric Ullaeus - [[photography]]\n* [[Derek Hess]] - artwork\n\n== Release history ==\nThis album was intended for release in the summer or early fall of 2005 but did not occur. The album did get released as a special plexiglass limited to 1000 copies box that features the album split onto 2 discs (with tracks 1-7 being disc 1 and the remainder as disc 2), a certificate pictures on a foil and a DVD.

It was originally going to be called ''Crawl Through Knives'' but was later changed to its current title.\n\nThe album features the artwork of [[Derek Hess]], who is popular among metal bands and has produced artwork for [[Converge (band)|Converge]] and [[Sepultura]], amongst others. Specifically the artwork of Sepultura's album ''[[Roorback]]'' has a lot of similarities.\n\nThe song \"Take This Life\" is featured in ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' and music videos were produced for the song, along with \"Come Clarity\".\n\nThe drums, vocals, keys and programming were recorded at \"Dug Out Studio\" in [[Uppsala]], and guitars and bass were recorded at \"The Room\" in [Gothenburg]]. This album was mixed and mastered at \"Tonteknik Recording\".\n\n== Style ==\nStylistically this harkens back to the band's heavier roots with elements of the later style still present.  The band had claimed the sound would be \"a bit of the old and a bit of the new\".\n\n''Come Clarity'' features the return of the guitar harmonies and the solos to the band, and can be described as a combination of their older sound with their newer sound.\n\nThe song \"Dead End\" is the fourth In Flames song to feature female vocals (the others are \"Everlost, Pt. 2\" from ''[[Lunar Strain]]'', \"Whoracle\" from ''[[Whoracle]]'' and \"Metaphor\" from ''Reroute to Remain''.)\n\n== Sales and awards ==\nThe album debuted at number 1 in Sweden<ref>{{cite web | url=http://swedishcharts.com/search.asp?cat=a&search=In+Flames | year=2006| title=In Flames Chart Positions | work=Swedish Charts | accessdate=2007-02-11 }}</ref> and number 58 on the United States [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; in the latter country, selling almost 25,000 copies in its first week, and 50,000 in its first month. Since its release, the album has sold more than 110,000 copies in the United States. The album has also sold over 400,000 copies worldwide.\n\nThe album won the award for Best Hard Rock Album in the 2007 [[Grammis]] (Swedish Grammy Awards) over such nominated albums such as [[The Haunted (Swedish band)|The Haunted]]'s ''[[The Dead Eye]]'' and [[HammerFall]]'s ''[[Threshold (album)|Threshold]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.grammis.se/?page=32 | year=2007| title=Come Clarity winning Best Hardrock award at 2007 Grammis. | work=Grammis | accessdate=2007-02-26 }}</ref>\n\n''Come Clarity'' was named Best Swedish album of the Past Decade by readers of Swedish newspaper [[Aftonbladet]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/article6348054.ab | year=2009| title=In Flames & Bossen b\u00e4st | work=Aftonbladet | accessdate=2009-12-29 }}</ref>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing = [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]], and [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]]\n| title1 = Take This Life\n| length1 = 3:35\n| title2 = Leeches\n| length2 = 2:55\n| title3 = Reflect the Storm\n| length3 = 4:16\n| title4 = Dead End\n| length4 = 3:22\n| title5 = Scream\n| length5 = 3:12\n| title6 = [[Come Clarity (song)|Come Clarity]]\n| length6 = 4:15\n| title7 = Vacuum\n| length7 = 3:39\n| title8 = Pacing Death's Trail\n| length8 = 3:00\n| title9 = Crawl Through Knives\n| length9 = 4:02\n| title10 = Versus Terminus\n| length10 = 3:18\n| title11 = Our Infinite Struggle\n| note11 = Incorrectly listed as \"Our Infinite Solution\" on digital stores\n| length11 = 3:46\n| title12 = Vanishing Light\n| length12 = 3:14\n| title13 = Your Bedtime Story Is Scaring Everyone\n| length13 = 5:25\n|total_length = 48:06\n}}\nThe track \"Crawl Through Knives\" is listed incorrectly on some programs as \"Crawling Through Knives\", along with others such as \"Reflect the Storm\" which is listed as \"Reflect the End\", and \"Versus Terminus\"  as \"End of All Things\".{{Citation needed|reason=May 12|date=May 2009}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== In Flames ===\n* [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]] \u2013 [[Singing|vocals]]\n* [[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]] \u2013  [[lead guitar]] \n* [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] \u2013 [[rhythm guitar]]\n* [[Peter Iwers]] \u2013 [[Bass guitar|bass]]\n* [[Daniel Svensson]] \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n\n===Other personnel===\n;Additional musicians\n* \u00d6rjan \u00d6rnkloo \u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s and [[Programming (music)|programming]]\n* Uppsala Poker HC Crew \u2013 additional vocals on \"Scream\"\n* [[Lisa Miskovsky]] \u2013 additional vocals on \"Dead End\"\n\n;Production\n*Eskil L\u00f6vstrom - [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] \n*Pelle Henricsson - mixing & [[audio mastering|mastering]]\n*Magnus Lander- tracking\n\n;Additional personnel\n*Patric Ullaeus - [[photography]]\n* [[Derek Hess]] - artwork\n\n== Release history ==\nThis album was intended for release in the summer or early fall of 2005 but did not occur.

For example, in the U.S., an average weekend attendance of more than 2,000 people separates a [[mega church]] from a large church, and an average weekend attendance between 51 and 300 people defines the large church; while a small church is the church with an attendance lower than 50 people.<ref>[http://www.usachurches.org/church-sizes.htm Church Sizes].
