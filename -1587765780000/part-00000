It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran).

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari.

The cheetah will stalk its prey, trying to conceal itself in cover, and try to approach as close as possible, often within {{convert|60|to|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey (or even farther for less alert prey). Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly. Cheetahs kill their prey by tripping it during the chase by hitting its rump with the forepaw or using the strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance, bringing it down with much force and sometimes even breaking one of its limbs.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs can decelerate extremely fast towards the end of the hunt, slowing down from {{convert|58|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} to {{convert|14|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} in just three strides, and can easily follow any twists and turns the prey makes as it tries to flee.<ref name=hunterwcw/> To kill medium- to large-sized prey the cheetah bites the prey's throat to suffocate it and lies down, maintaining the bite for around five minutes, within which the prey stops struggling. A bite on the nape of the neck or the snout (and sometimes on the skull) suffices to kill smaller prey.<ref name = wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs have an average hunting success rate of 25\u201340%, higher for smaller and more vulnerable prey.<ref name = \"O'Brien\" /><ref name=hunterwcw/>\n\nOnce the hunt is over, the prey is taken near a bush or a tree; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for five to 55 minutes.

Groups of cheetah devour the kill peacefully, though minor noises and snapping may be observed.<ref name=wcw/> Cheetahs can consume large quantities of food; a cheetah at the [[Etosha National Park]] was found to consume as much as {{convert|10|kg|lb}} within two hours.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Phillips |first1 = J.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran). To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls, and hitting the ground with the paws.<ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; this may be due to [[vulture]]s and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy [[carrion|carcasses]] within a short time; male cheetahs often take kills from females.<ref name=hunterwcw/><ref name=wcw/><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Houston |first1 = D.

Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

''Bento'' are readily available in many places throughout Japan, including [[convenience store]]s, {{nihongo|''bento'' shops|\u5f01\u5f53\u5c4b|bent\u014d-ya}}, railway stations, and [[department store]]s. However, Japanese [[homemaker]]s often spend time and energy on carefully prepared [[lunch box]]es for their spouses, children, or themselves.\n''Bentos'' can be elaborately arranged in a style called \"''[[kyaraben]]''\" (\"character ''bento''\"). ''Kyaraben'' are typically decorated to look like popular characters from Japanese animation ([[anime]]), comic books ([[manga]]), or [[video games]]. Another popular ''bento'' style is \"''oekakiben''\" or \"picture ''bento''\". This is decorated to look like people, animals, buildings and monuments, or items such as flowers and plants. Contests are often held where ''bento'' arrangers compete for the most aesthetically pleasing arrangements.\n\nThere are somewhat comparable forms of boxed lunches in Asian countries including the Philippines (''baon''), Korea (''[[dosirak]]''), Taiwan (''bi\u00e0nd\u0101ng'' in Mandarin and \u201cpi\u0101n-tong\u201d in Taiwanese) and India ([[tiffin]]). Also, Hawaiian culture has adopted localized versions of ''bento'' featuring local tastes after over a century of Japanese influence in the islands.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn Japan, \"''bento''\" is written as {{lang|ja|\u5f01\u5f53}}. The word originates from the [[Song Dynasty|Southern Song]] [[slang]] term {{lang|ja|\u4fbf\u5f53}} ({{lang|zh|\u4fbf\u7576}} ({{zh|p=bi\u00e0nd\u0101ng}})), meaning \"convenient\" or \"convenience\".

In [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]], \"''bento''\" is written as {{lang|zh|\u4fbf\u7576}} ({{zh|p=bi\u00e0nd\u0101ng}}).\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2006}}\n\n===Kamakura period===\nThe origin of ''bento'' can be traced back to the late [[Kamakura period]] (1185 to 1333), when cooked and dried rice called ''hoshi-ii'' ({{lang|ja|\u7cd2}} or {{lang|ja|\u5e72\u3057\u98ef}}, literally \"dried meal\") was developed, to be carried to work.<ref name=Chop/> ''Hoshi-ii'' can be eaten as is or boiled with water to make cooked rice, and is stored in a small bag.  In the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]] (1568\u20131600), wooden lacquered boxes like today's were produced, and ''bento'' would be eaten during a ''[[hanami]]'' or a tea party.\n\n===Edo period===\n[[File:Gotenyama hiroshige.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Hanami]]'' ''bento'' in the [[Edo period]]]]\nIn the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131867), ''bento'' culture spread and became more refined.  Travelers and sightseers would carry a simple ''koshibent\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u8170\u5f01\u5f53}}, \"waist ''bento''\"), consisting of several ''[[onigiri]]'' wrapped with bamboo leaves or in a woven bamboo box.  One of the most popular styles of ''bento'', called ''[[makunouchi|makuno-uchi]] bent\u014d'' (\"between-act ''bento''\"), was first made during this period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Japanese Lunch Boxes - History|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/virtual/bento/bento02.html|work=web-japan.org|publisher=Kids Web Japan|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>   People who came to see ''[[Noh]]'' and [[Kabuki]] ate specially prepared ''bentos'' between ''maku'' (acts).  Numerous cookbooks were published detailing how to cook, how to pack, and what to prepare for occasions like ''[[Hanami]]'' and ''[[Hinamatsuri]]''.\n\n===Meiji Period===\nIn the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912), the first ''ekibent\u014d'' or ''[[ekiben]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u99c5\u5f01\u5f53}} or {{lang|ja|\u99c5\u5f01}}, \"train station ''bento''\") was sold. There are several records that claim where ''ekiben'' was first sold, but it is believed that it was sold on 16 July 1885, at the [[Utsunomiya]] train station, in the northern [[Kant\u014d region]] of Japan, and contained two ''onigiri'' and a serving of ''[[takuan]]'' wrapped in bamboo leaves. As early schools did not provide lunch, students and teachers carried ''bentos'', as did many employees. \"European\" style ''bentos'' with sandwiches also went on sale during this period.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Taish\u014d period ===\nIn the [[Taish\u014d period]] (1912\u20131926), the aluminum ''bento'' box became a luxury item because of its ease of cleaning and its silver-like appearance. Also, a move to abolish the practice of ''bento'' in school became a social issue.  Disparities in wealth spread during this period, following an export boom during World War I and subsequent crop failures in the Tohoku region. A ''bento'' too often reflected a student's wealth, and many wondered if this had an unfavorable influence on children both physically, from lack of adequate diet, and psychologically, from a clumsily made ''bento'' or the richness of food. After World War II, the practice of bringing ''bentos'' to school gradually declined and was replaced by uniform food provided for all students and teachers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timeline.com/bento-box-history-27b04153c6f6|title=The controversial history of the bento box|last=Buck|first=Stephanie|date=2016-09-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bento box.png|thumb|200px|Aluminum bento box, 1961.

In addition, the expensive wood and metal boxes have been replaced at most ''bento'' shops with inexpensive, disposable [[polystyrene]] boxes. However, even handmade ''bentos'' have made a comeback, and they are once again a common, although not universal, sight at [[Education in Japan|Japanese schools]]. ''Bentos'' are still used by workers as a [[packed lunch]], by families on day trips, for school picnics and sports days etc. The ''bento'', made at home, is wrapped in a ''[[furoshiki]]'' cloth, which acts as both bag and table mat.\n\nAirports also offer an analogous version of the ''ekiben'': a bento filled with local cuisine, to be eaten while waiting for an airplane or during the flight.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashkenazi|first=Michael|title=The essence of Japanese cuisine: an essay on food and culture|year=2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812235661|page=226|author2=Jacob, Jeanne}}</ref>\n\n===In other countries===\nThe ''bento'' made its way to [[Taiwan]] in the first half of the 20th century during the Japanese colonial period and remains very popular to the present day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eater.com/2019/3/6/18241749/bento-box-best-food-train-stations-taiwan|title=Taiwan\u2019s Train Food Puts Amtrak to Shame|last=Chen|first=Karissa|date=2019-03-06|website=Eater|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref> The Japanese name was borrowed as ''bendong'' ([[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]: ''pi\u0101n-tong'') or [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] ''bi\u00e0nd\u0101ng'' (\u4fbf\u7576).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hiufu Wong |first1=Maggie |title=40 of the best Taiwanese foods and drinks |url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/40-taiwan-food/index.html |website=edition.cnn.com |publisher=CNN |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nIn Japan, it is common for mothers to make ''bento'' for their children to take to school.

For those in a hurry who have to spend their lunch time aboard the shinkansen, there is also the bento ekiben which, as its name suggests, is on sale in the stations of the Archipelago. As for the traditional bento, its content is varied and its price very affordable ! Bento is also present in more solemn moments, even on the [[Hatsum\u014dde|Japanese New Year's]] table for example.

A traditional ''bento'' holds rice or noodles, fish or meat, with [[pickling|pickled]] and cooked vegetables, in a box.<ref name=Chop>\"Bento: Changing New York's Lunch Culture,\" ''Chopsticks NY,'' vol. 27, July 2009, p. 10-11.</ref> Containers range from [[Mass production|mass-produced]] [[disposables]] to hand-crafted [[lacquerware]]. ''Bento'' are readily available in many places throughout Japan, including [[convenience store]]s, {{nihongo|''bento'' shops|\u5f01\u5f53\u5c4b|bent\u014d-ya}}, railway stations, and [[department store]]s. However, Japanese [[homemaker]]s often spend time and energy on carefully prepared [[lunch box]]es for their spouses, children, or themselves.\n''Bentos'' can be elaborately arranged in a style called \"''[[kyaraben]]''\" (\"character ''bento''\"). ''Kyaraben'' are typically decorated to look like popular characters from Japanese animation ([[anime]]), comic books ([[manga]]), or [[video games]]. Another popular ''bento'' style is \"''oekakiben''\" or \"picture ''bento''\". This is decorated to look like people, animals, buildings and monuments, or items such as flowers and plants. Contests are often held where ''bento'' arrangers compete for the most aesthetically pleasing arrangements.\n\nThere are somewhat comparable forms of boxed lunches in Asian countries including the Philippines (''baon''), Korea (''[[dosirak]]''), Taiwan (''bi\u00e0nd\u0101ng'' in Mandarin and \u201cpi\u0101n-tong\u201d in Taiwanese) and India ([[tiffin]]). Also, Hawaiian culture has adopted localized versions of ''bento'' featuring local tastes after over a century of Japanese influence in the islands.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn Japan, \"''bento''\" is written as {{lang|ja|\u5f01\u5f53}}. The word originates from the [[Song Dynasty|Southern Song]] [[slang]] term {{lang|ja|\u4fbf\u5f53}} ({{lang|zh|\u4fbf\u7576}} ({{zh|p=bi\u00e0nd\u0101ng}})), meaning \"convenient\" or \"convenience\". When imported to Japan, it was written with the [[ateji]] {{lang|ja|\u4fbf\u9053}} and {{lang|ja|\u5f01\u9053}}.<ref name=bento-dic>Bento [http://gogen-allguide.com/he/bentou.html \u5f01\u5f53\uff08\u3079\u3093\u3068\u3046\uff09] \u8a9e\u6e90\u7531\u6765\u8f9e\u5178 (Etymology Dictionary)</ref><ref>[https://www.japanhoppers.com/en/all_about_japan/food/234/ Bento (Lunch Box)], Japan Hoppers, Retrieved on 29 May 2017</ref>\n\nIn Japan, the word \"''bento''\" has been used since the 13th century, and the container itself, also called \"''bento''\", has been known since the 16th century.<ref name=bento-dic/>\n\nIn modern times, bento is commonly used in Western countries and East Asia. In [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]], \"''bento''\" is written as {{lang|zh|\u4fbf\u7576}} ({{zh|p=bi\u00e0nd\u0101ng}}).\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2006}}\n\n===Kamakura period===\nThe origin of ''bento'' can be traced back to the late [[Kamakura period]] (1185 to 1333), when cooked and dried rice called ''hoshi-ii'' ({{lang|ja|\u7cd2}} or {{lang|ja|\u5e72\u3057\u98ef}}, literally \"dried meal\") was developed, to be carried to work.<ref name=Chop/> ''Hoshi-ii'' can be eaten as is or boiled with water to make cooked rice, and is stored in a small bag.  In the [[Azuchi-Momoyama period]] (1568\u20131600), wooden lacquered boxes like today's were produced, and ''bento'' would be eaten during a ''[[hanami]]'' or a tea party.\n\n===Edo period===\n[[File:Gotenyama hiroshige.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Hanami]]'' ''bento'' in the [[Edo period]]]]\nIn the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131867), ''bento'' culture spread and became more refined.  Travelers and sightseers would carry a simple ''koshibent\u014d'' ({{lang|ja|\u8170\u5f01\u5f53}}, \"waist ''bento''\"), consisting of several ''[[onigiri]]'' wrapped with bamboo leaves or in a woven bamboo box.  One of the most popular styles of ''bento'', called ''[[makunouchi|makuno-uchi]] bent\u014d'' (\"between-act ''bento''\"), was first made during this period.<ref>{{cite web|title=Japanese Lunch Boxes - History|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/virtual/bento/bento02.html|work=web-japan.org|publisher=Kids Web Japan|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>   People who came to see ''[[Noh]]'' and [[Kabuki]] ate specially prepared ''bentos'' between ''maku'' (acts).  Numerous cookbooks were published detailing how to cook, how to pack, and what to prepare for occasions like ''[[Hanami]]'' and ''[[Hinamatsuri]]''.\n\n===Meiji Period===\nIn the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912), the first ''ekibent\u014d'' or ''[[ekiben]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u99c5\u5f01\u5f53}} or {{lang|ja|\u99c5\u5f01}}, \"train station ''bento''\") was sold. There are several records that claim where ''ekiben'' was first sold, but it is believed that it was sold on 16 July 1885, at the [[Utsunomiya]] train station, in the northern [[Kant\u014d region]] of Japan, and contained two ''onigiri'' and a serving of ''[[takuan]]'' wrapped in bamboo leaves. As early schools did not provide lunch, students and teachers carried ''bentos'', as did many employees. \"European\" style ''bentos'' with sandwiches also went on sale during this period.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Taish\u014d period ===\nIn the [[Taish\u014d period]] (1912\u20131926), the aluminum ''bento'' box became a luxury item because of its ease of cleaning and its silver-like appearance. Also, a move to abolish the practice of ''bento'' in school became a social issue.  Disparities in wealth spread during this period, following an export boom during World War I and subsequent crop failures in the Tohoku region. A ''bento'' too often reflected a student's wealth, and many wondered if this had an unfavorable influence on children both physically, from lack of adequate diet, and psychologically, from a clumsily made ''bento'' or the richness of food. After World War II, the practice of bringing ''bentos'' to school gradually declined and was replaced by uniform food provided for all students and teachers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timeline.com/bento-box-history-27b04153c6f6|title=The controversial history of the bento box|last=Buck|first=Stephanie|date=2016-09-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bento box.png|thumb|200px|Aluminum bento box, 1961.

In addition, the expensive wood and metal boxes have been replaced at most ''bento'' shops with inexpensive, disposable [[polystyrene]] boxes. However, even handmade ''bentos'' have made a comeback, and they are once again a common, although not universal, sight at [[Education in Japan|Japanese schools]]. ''Bentos'' are still used by workers as a [[packed lunch]], by families on day trips, for school picnics and sports days etc. The ''bento'', made at home, is wrapped in a ''[[furoshiki]]'' cloth, which acts as both bag and table mat.\n\nAirports also offer an analogous version of the ''ekiben'': a bento filled with local cuisine, to be eaten while waiting for an airplane or during the flight.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashkenazi|first=Michael|title=The essence of Japanese cuisine: an essay on food and culture|year=2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780812235661|page=226|author2=Jacob, Jeanne}}</ref>\n\n===In other countries===\nThe ''bento'' made its way to [[Taiwan]] in the first half of the 20th century during the Japanese colonial period and remains very popular to the present day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eater.com/2019/3/6/18241749/bento-box-best-food-train-stations-taiwan|title=Taiwan\u2019s Train Food Puts Amtrak to Shame|last=Chen|first=Karissa|date=2019-03-06|website=Eater|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref> The Japanese name was borrowed as ''bendong'' ([[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]: ''pi\u0101n-tong'') or [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] ''bi\u00e0nd\u0101ng'' (\u4fbf\u7576).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hiufu Wong |first1=Maggie |title=40 of the best Taiwanese foods and drinks |url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/40-taiwan-food/index.html |website=edition.cnn.com |publisher=CNN |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nIn Japan, it is common for mothers to make ''bento'' for their children to take to school.

The name was taken from the ''[[Hinomaru]]'', the Japanese flag, which has a white background with a red circle in the centre. Pure ''Hinomaru bento'' only consists of rice and ''umeboshi'' to flavor rice without any other side dishes.

This problem continues during his class trip to Gollyworld, where he misses out on many of the rides because Craig tells the popular kids that Jimmy will hold their items for them. The popular kids then, on Craig's suggestion, tell Jimmy to go try to find Milt Appleday's ([[Fred Willard]]) frozen brain, which supposedly is hidden somewhere in Tux's Arctic Adventure. As usual, Jimmy unwillingly gives in, and once there, bumps into Milt's middle-age clumsy son Sonny ([[Matt Knudsen]]), who is attempting to retrieve the brain from underneath the ice. After being spotted by Sonny, Jimmy quickly flees and during his escape, accidentally runs onto the path of an oncoming train and is sent to an on-premises hospital staffed by park staff who are also secretly certified physicians, where Milt's brain (which one of the doctors keeps in his lunch cooler) is transplanted into his head. He makes it out of the operation just fine with his personality intact (explained by the doctors salvaging his \"personality gland\") but, he can now see all of Appleday's characters in real life, while no one else can.\n\nWith the help of his crush, Robin ([[Eunice Cho]]), who is also Craig's sister, Jimmy and the characters learn that the reason they've lost their popularity is thanks to Sonny, who unwittingly ruined their cartoons through his own ideas, especially Golly, who is crushed to learn that his top spot as most popular cartoon character in the world has been reduced to nothing, but he figures with Jimmy now at the helm, he can quickly make him a star again, now that he's president of Appleday Pictures (Sonny was fired by the Chairman of the Board). Jimmy is immensely popular, but no longer has time for school or his friends.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonny has rented out a room in Jimmy's house and now lives with his family because Jimmy's dad allows him when Sonny is deceiving the family. Sonny has dinner with them and meets Jimmy's alien sister, Yancy (Rhea Lando), all the while constantly scheming to get Milt's brain out of Jimmy's head and for himself. And without the brain, Jimmy would die. He devises a plan to modify Crocco's train to include several dangerous devices on it that will decapitate Jimmy and get him what he wants. However, he says this plan out loud (yelling it at the top of his lungs) and Yancy catches on.\n\nEventually, Robin attempts to point out to Jimmy that the cartoons are walking all over him just like everybody else used to, but he denies this, adding that the only reason Robin even liked him was because of him having Milt's brain. He takes off for his television debut, leaving her behind to encounter Sonny, who says that since she knows his plan, he'll have to do away with her. At the studio, Jimmy tells the ego-maniac Golly that all that the Presidency of Appleday Studios has gotten him isn't what he really wanted, which drives Golly to get angry at him and shout at him that it is impossible for him to say no to anybody. Jimmy finally realizes Robin was right and denounces his position as President on-air. Sonny, however, still wants the brain, and has tied Robin down to the train tracks, forcing Jimmy and the characters (even Golly, who apologizes along the way) to go save her. Golly temporarily changes Jimmy into a cartoon \"Knight in shining armor\".\n\nRobin is saved from being run over after Jimmy goes inside the train and destroys the engine. Sonny's plan is foiled. Jimmy dresses up as Milt to hide from Sonny, and Sonny is momentarily distracted by his affection for his father. Yancy saves Jimmy just in time by using her power of teleportation. Robin and Jimmy return to Craig's house, where he was planning to throw a party with Jimmy as the guest of honor, and everything is patched up between them. However, since the partygoers were watching the show he was on, and saw him talk about the importance of friendship, they figured Jimmy wasn't cool, and instead just stupid at giving up all that fame, and leave the party.\n\nIn an epilogue, Jimmy is leaving for school. Sonny still wants the brain and is seen hiding behind a curtain. He has a device that can grab his head. Sonny almost succeeds, but the crane misses its target. He laughs evilly in the end, with Yancy telling him to shut up.\n\n===\"Golly Gopher: Hero in Train-ing\"===\nIt is an exclusive animated short produced by [[Renegade Animation]] which is included as a bonus on ''Re-Animated'' DVD; an extract was shown in the movie itself but only after the intro.

The [[List of How to Get Away with Murder episodes|thirtieth episode]] overall and the second [[season finale]], was written by show creator [[Peter Nowalk]] and directed by [[Bill D'Elia]]. It was first aired on March 17, 2016 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], following ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'s'' [[Grey's Anatomy (season 11)|eleventh season]] and ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'s'' [[Scandal (season 5)|fifth season]].\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Present time ===\nWith all the chaos surrounding Annalise, she just can't stand the pressure anymore and needs to escape. She goes to Memphis, with her mother without telling anyone. As the Keating 5, Oliver, Frank and Bonnie realize that Annalise is nowhere to be found, Laurel tells Frank that she accidentally told Annalise that he killed Lila while being drunk the night before. Frank says that he then knows why she got away, but before he can explain anything to Laurel, Bonnie walks in on them and says that they found out Annalise is on Memphis.\n\nMeanwhile, Annalise has all her family visit her mother's house when they hear that she's back in town. Soon, Annalise realizes her mother got back in touch with her father, who left them when she was younger. Later, Nate goes to Memphis to tell Annalise that D.A. Denver will put an arrest warrant on her. Nate stays for dinner, and he bonds with Ophelia, while Annalise gets upset when her parents start talking about how she never had any kids. After dinner and while helping her mother clean up, Annalise tells her mother that she did had a baby that she never told her about, because he died on a car accident before being even born. Annalise then walks Nate to his car, and thanks him for coming all the way from Philadelphia.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Ophelia wakes Annalise up and takes her to her garden with a notebook and a pen. She tells her daughter that she needs to write him a letter so she can move on. Once she finishes up the letter, and while crying, Annalise and her mother dig a hole on the ground and bury the letter. Annalise reveals that her dead son's name was Sam, and cries while her mother tries to comfort her.\n\nAt the Keating house, the group spends their time wondering what will happen next. Asher and Michaela continue having secret sex on the Keating house; Connor awaits for his Stanford acceptance letter, and once he receives it, Oliver deletes it so they don't move and can stay at Middleton. Frank tells Bonnie that he was the one who killed Lila under Sam's orders, and they both discuss Annalise's reaction when hearing the news. Bonnie asks Frank not to do anything stupid, and tells him that she will take care of it. Wes tells Laurel what Annalise told him, that Wallace Mahoney is his father and he wants to confront him, but they both agree to wait until Annalise comes back from Memphis before doing anything. Later, Laurel also tells Frank that Wallace is Wes' biological father and that she kissed Wes, but she says it won't happen again.\n\nThe next morning, Annalise talks to her father and warns him not to leave her mother alone again. Once she gets back to Philadelphia, Annalise goes to the D.A.'s Office to meet with Denver, and tells him that he won't go after her because she knows who really killed the Hapstalls: Caleb Hapstall. She gives him evidence, and brings Philip Jessup to testify about everything that happened between him and Catherine. Denver agrees, and he closes the case, while Annalise walks away free. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that Caleb Hapstall killed himself on his bathub.\n\nOnce she finally gets home, Annalise tells Bonnie that Frank has to go. Laurel goes to Frank's apartment, and as she looks for him everywhere, she finds out that he took off. In the very last scene of the season, Wes walks up to Wallace Mahoney in New York City. Wallace stops talking on the phone so he can listen to Wes: \"I think you're my father\" Wes says, while Wallace answers \"Why would you think that?\". Before Wes can say anything, Wallace is shot in the head in front of him. People start screaming as Wes, with blood on his face, sees Wallace's dead body on the floor in shock.\n\n=== Flashbacks ===\nDuring the episode, we see flashbacks to ten years earlier, when Frank met Lisa Cameron, who offers him a bag full of money in exchange from planting a bug on Annalise's room. After being treated badly by Annalise, he decides to help Lisa, and later he gets the bag full of money. After a while, Annalise has a car accident because the Mahoneys were able to listen to Annalise's plan to turn against them. In the hospital, after the car accident, Frank tells Sam about what he did. Furious, Sam threatens to ruin his life if he ever tells Annalise what happened because she would blame herself. Later, we see another flashback to the episode \"[[It's All My Fault]]\", where Sam tells Frank that \"he owes him\", to convince him to kill Lila.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Viewers ===\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Anna Mae\" was seen by an estimated 5.29 million household viewers and gained a 1.4/5 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to Nielsen Media Research.<ref name=\"2.15\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2016/03/18/thursday-final-ratings-march-17-2016/|title=Thursday final ratings: NCAA tourney has a soft start on CBS|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=March 18, 2016|accessdate=March 18, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320091055/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2016/03/18/thursday-final-ratings-march-17-2016/|archivedate=March 20, 2016}}</ref> This means that 1.4 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it.

The calendar had just 10 months, beginning with March. That the new year once began with the month of March is still reflected in some of the names of the months. September through to December, the ninth through to the twelfth months of the [[Gregorian calendar]], were originally positioned as the seventh through to the tenth months. (''Septem'' is [[Latin]] for \"seven\"; ''octo'', \"eight\"; ''novem'', \"nine\"; and ''decem'', \"ten\".)

Romans had long dated their years by [[list of Roman consuls|these consulships]], rather than sequentially, and making the kalends of January start the new year aligned this dating.

These days were also [[astronomy|astronomically]] and [[astrology|astrologically]] significant since, at the time of the [[Julian reform]], 25 March had been understood as the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]] and 25 December as the [[winter solstice]].

By the sixteenth century, the drift from the observed [[equinox]] had become unacceptable. In 1582, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] declared the [[Gregorian calendar]] widely used today, correcting the error by a deletion of 10 days. The Gregorian calendar reform also (in effect) restored 1 January as New Year's Day. Although most Catholic countries adopted the Gregorian calendar almost immediately, it was only gradually adopted among Protestant countries. The British, for example, did not adopt the reformed calendar [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|until 1752]]. Until then, the [[British Empire]] {{snd}} and its American colonies {{snd}} still celebrated the new year on 25 March.\n\nMost nations of Western Europe officially adopted 1 January as New Year's Day somewhat before they adopted the Gregorian Calendar.

This is normally on 14 April or 15 April, depending on the leap year. Elsewhere in northern/central India, the [[Vikram Samvat]] calendar is followed. According to that, the new year day is the first day of the Chaitra Month, also known as Chaitra Shukla Pratipada or [[Gudi Padwa]].  This is basically the first month of the Hindu calendar, the first Shukla paksha (fortnight) and the first day.   This normally comes around 23\u201324 March, mostly around the Spring Equinox in Gregorian Calendar.

They also exchange tokens of good wishes for a healthy and prosperous year ahead.\n* [[Malayalam]] New Year (Puthuvarsham) is celebrated either on the first day of the month of Medam in mid-April which is known as Vishu, or the first day of the month of [[Chingam]], in the [[Malayalam Calendar]] in mid-August according to another reckoning. Unlike most other calendar systems in India, the New Year's Day on the [[Malayalam Calendar]] is not based on any astronomical event. It is just the first day of the first of the 12 months on the [[Malayalam Calendar]].  The [[Malayalam Calendar]] (called Kollavarsham) originated in 825 AD, based on general agreement among scholars, with the re-opening of the city of [[Kollam]] (on [[Malabar Coast]]), which had been destroyed by a [[natural disaster]].\n* [[Nepal Sambat]] is the '''Nepalese New Year''' celebration.\n* [[Pahela Baishakh]] (Bengali: \u09aa\u09b9\u09c7\u09b2\u09be \u09ac\u09c8\u09b6\u09be\u0996) or Bangla Nabobarsho (Bengali: \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be \u09a8\u09ac\u09ac\u09b0\u09cd\u09b7, Bangla N\u00f4bob\u00f4rsho) is the first day of the Bengali Calendar.

There is an astrologically generated time gap between the passing year and the New Year, which is based on the passing of the sun from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries) in the celestial sphere. The astrological time difference between the New Year and the passing year (''nonagathe'') is celebrated with several Buddhist rituals and customs that are to be concentrated on, which are exclusive of all types of 'work'. After Buddhist rituals and traditions are attended to, Sinhala and Tamil New Year-based social gatherings and festive parties with the aid of firecrackers, and fireworks would be organised.

It falls on a different day every year because the Hindu calendar is a lunisolar calendar. The Saka calendar begins with the month of Chaitra (March\u2013April) and Ugadi/Yugadi marks the first day of the new year. Chaitra is the first month in Panchanga which is the Indian calendar.

By the sixteenth century, the drift from the observed [[equinox]] had become unacceptable. In 1582, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] declared the [[Gregorian calendar]] widely used today, correcting the error by a deletion of 10 days. The Gregorian calendar reform also (in effect) restored 1 January as New Year's Day. Although most Catholic countries adopted the Gregorian calendar almost immediately, it was only gradually adopted among Protestant countries. The British, for example, did not adopt the reformed calendar [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|until 1752]]. Until then, the [[British Empire]] {{snd}} and its American colonies {{snd}} still celebrated the new year on 25 March.\n\nMost nations of Western Europe officially adopted 1 January as New Year's Day somewhat before they adopted the Gregorian Calendar.

This is normally on 14 April or 15 April, depending on the leap year. Elsewhere in northern/central India, the [[Vikram Samvat]] calendar is followed. According to that, the new year day is the first day of the Chaitra Month, also known as Chaitra Shukla Pratipada or [[Gudi Padwa]].

Unlike most other calendar systems in India, the New Year's Day on the [[Malayalam Calendar]] is not based on any astronomical event. It is just the first day of the first of the 12 months on the [[Malayalam Calendar]].

The astrological time difference between the New Year and the passing year (''nonagathe'') is celebrated with several Buddhist rituals and customs that are to be concentrated on, which are exclusive of all types of 'work'. After Buddhist rituals and traditions are attended to, Sinhala and Tamil New Year-based social gatherings and festive parties with the aid of firecrackers, and fireworks would be organised.

Will is forbidden from watching films or television and is made to leave his classroom when the teacher puts on a documentary. In the corridor, he meets Lee Carter ([[Will Poulter]]), the worst-behaved boy in school, thrown out of another class for bad behaviour. They accidentally break a fish bowl in the corridor; Lee volunteers to take the blame, pretending that the punishment is torture, in exchange for Will's watch, which belonged to his dead father. Moreover, Lee demands that Will performs the [[stunt]]s in a film Lee is making with [[home video]] equipment owned by his bullying older brother, Lawrence, which Lawrence uses in his video bootlegging enterprise. He intends to enter the ''[[Screen Test]]'' Young Film-Makers' Competition.\n\nWill accepts, after accidentally seeing the film ''[[First Blood]]'' at Lee's house while hiding from Lawrence. He becomes very enthusiastic, and plays several dangerous action scenes, culminating in the two boys becoming 'blood brothers' after Lee saves Will from drowning. Lee finds Will's sketch book, full of colourful and glorious ideas, and starts to incorporate some of them into his film script. The two become best friends, but Will has to keep it secret from his family and the increasingly interfering Brother Joshua of the Brethren, who clearly has designs on his mother.\n\nFrench exchange students arrive and one of them, the suave Didier Revol, becomes very popular. After finding Will's sketch book, he asks Will if he and his acolytes can play in the film, and Will agrees. Didier reveals that he has always wanted to be an actor. This mushrooms into the whole school being part of the production, and Will being included with the cool sixth-formers. Lee does not like this, as he is no longer in control, and finally quits after a fight with Will during filming of the last sequence, which takes place at a disused power station. After Will becomes trapped when part of the unstable structure collapses due to Didier's carelessness, and the entire school/crew run away, Lee returns to rescue his friend, but uses the excuse that he has come to collect his brother's camera. He too gets hurt, and has to go to hospital. Lawrence visits him, but is angry about the fact that the camera is broken.\n\nWill's mother, from whom he has struggled to hide his activities, finally realises that her son must be allowed to be himself and her family leaves the Brethren. The film is never submitted to the competition as they miss the deadline. The French students leave, and while Didier was popular and worshipped in Britain, his own school-mates mock him, and he is actually lonely and isolated. When Lawrence looks at Lee's footage he is impressed, and he sees Lee's rant at Will defending Lawrence's neglect and bullying, which was accidentally filmed. With Will's help, he adds a part in which he acts himself \u2014 including a reply message for his brother. When Lee leaves the hospital, he is brought to a cinema by surprise. His film is shown before the main feature (much to the enjoyment of the audience) and the two boys reunite.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Bill Milner]] as Will Proudfoot\n* [[Will Poulter]] as Lee Carter\n* [[Neil Dudgeon]] as Brother Joshua\n* [[Adam Godley]] as Brethren Leader\n* [[Jessica Hynes]] as Mary Proudfoot\n** Imogen Aboud as young Mary\n* [[Anna Wing]] as Grandma\n* Charlie Thrift as Duncan Miller\n* Zofia Brooks as Tina\n* Tallulah Evans as Jess Proudfoot\n* [[Jules Sitruk]] as Didier Revol\n* [[Ed Westwick]] as Lawrence Carter\n* [[Eric Sykes]] as Frank\n* [[Asa Butterfield]] as Brethren Boy\n* [[Adam Buxton]] as Chemistry teacher\n* [[Paul Ritter (actor)|Paul Ritter]] as Geography teacher\n* [[Edgar Wright]] as Metal school teacher\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Son of Rambow'' is a project that [[Garth Jennings]] and [[Nick Goldsmith]] \u2014 collectively known as [[Hammer & Tongs]] \u2014 worked on for some years. Its development was interrupted when they were asked to make ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and it is their second major feature film. It was inspired by Jennings' own experiences as a child in the 1980s, when video equipment first became available to the public, and the film recreates the atmosphere of an English [[comprehensive school]] of the time, using a soundtrack of both familiar and lesser known pop tracks from the era.<ref>Garth Jennings, speaking after the London premiere</ref> The film was shot primarily in the English town of [[Berkhamsted]], and the nearby [[Ashridge Estate]] owned and managed by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] [[Hertfordshire]]: featuring [[Ashlyns School]] and [[The Rex, Berkhamsted|The Rex]], a recently refurbished listed [[Art Deco]] cinema which had been left derelict between 1989 and 2004.\n\nThe two roads where both boys live are approximately 1,200 metres apart, being located next to [[Berkhamsted Castle]].

The two become best friends, but Will has to keep it secret from his family and the increasingly interfering Brother Joshua of the Brethren, who clearly has designs on his mother.\n\nFrench exchange students arrive and one of them, the suave Didier Revol, becomes very popular. After finding Will's sketch book, he asks Will if he and his acolytes can play in the film, and Will agrees. Didier reveals that he has always wanted to be an actor. This mushrooms into the whole school being part of the production, and Will being included with the cool sixth-formers. Lee does not like this, as he is no longer in control, and finally quits after a fight with Will during filming of the last sequence, which takes place at a disused power station. After Will becomes trapped when part of the unstable structure collapses due to Didier's carelessness, and the entire school/crew run away, Lee returns to rescue his friend, but uses the excuse that he has come to collect his brother's camera. He too gets hurt, and has to go to hospital. Lawrence visits him, but is angry about the fact that the camera is broken.\n\nWill's mother, from whom he has struggled to hide his activities, finally realises that her son must be allowed to be himself and her family leaves the Brethren. The film is never submitted to the competition as they miss the deadline. The French students leave, and while Didier was popular and worshipped in Britain, his own school-mates mock him, and he is actually lonely and isolated. When Lawrence looks at Lee's footage he is impressed, and he sees Lee's rant at Will defending Lawrence's neglect and bullying, which was accidentally filmed. With Will's help, he adds a part in which he acts himself \u2014 including a reply message for his brother. When Lee leaves the hospital, he is brought to a cinema by surprise. His film is shown before the main feature (much to the enjoyment of the audience) and the two boys reunite.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Bill Milner]] as Will Proudfoot\n* [[Will Poulter]] as Lee Carter\n* [[Neil Dudgeon]] as Brother Joshua\n* [[Adam Godley]] as Brethren Leader\n* [[Jessica Hynes]] as Mary Proudfoot\n** Imogen Aboud as young Mary\n* [[Anna Wing]] as Grandma\n* Charlie Thrift as Duncan Miller\n* Zofia Brooks as Tina\n* Tallulah Evans as Jess Proudfoot\n* [[Jules Sitruk]] as Didier Revol\n* [[Ed Westwick]] as Lawrence Carter\n* [[Eric Sykes]] as Frank\n* [[Asa Butterfield]] as Brethren Boy\n* [[Adam Buxton]] as Chemistry teacher\n* [[Paul Ritter (actor)|Paul Ritter]] as Geography teacher\n* [[Edgar Wright]] as Metal school teacher\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Son of Rambow'' is a project that [[Garth Jennings]] and [[Nick Goldsmith]] \u2014 collectively known as [[Hammer & Tongs]] \u2014 worked on for some years. Its development was interrupted when they were asked to make ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and it is their second major feature film. It was inspired by Jennings' own experiences as a child in the 1980s, when video equipment first became available to the public, and the film recreates the atmosphere of an English [[comprehensive school]] of the time, using a soundtrack of both familiar and lesser known pop tracks from the era.<ref>Garth Jennings, speaking after the London premiere</ref> The film was shot primarily in the English town of [[Berkhamsted]], and the nearby [[Ashridge Estate]] owned and managed by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] [[Hertfordshire]]: featuring [[Ashlyns School]] and [[The Rex, Berkhamsted|The Rex]], a recently refurbished listed [[Art Deco]] cinema which had been left derelict between 1989 and 2004.\n\nThe two roads where both boys live are approximately 1,200 metres apart, being located next to [[Berkhamsted Castle]].

The film, starring [[Amanda Bynes]], [[Sara Paxton]] and [[Matt Long]], was released theatrically on September 21, 2007 by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nSydney White ([[Amanda Bynes]]) is a simple, boyish, easy-going, and the daughter of a plumber, Paul White ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]]). Her mother, a Kappa Sorority member, died when Sydney was still young. She sets off to attend college at SAU and pledge to her mother's once dignified sorority. There she meets Demetria Rosemead Hotchkiss ([[Crystal Hunt]]), known as Dinky, also an incoming member of the Kappa Sorority, and the two quickly become friends. While on their way to their dorm, she meets Tyler Prince ([[Matt Long]]), the president of a popular fraternity, who is also the on-off boyfriend of the extremely tyrannical, manipulative, and most hated president of the student council and the head of the Kappa Sorority, Rachel Witchburn ([[Sara Paxton]]). Rachel checks out her university's website that ranks the \"hottest\" in the school several times a day, and is always number one on the list. Tyler meets Sydney and is immediately smitten, while Rachel watches from her window, with an immediate dislike towards Sydney. When she first meets Sydney she believes that she's not \"Kappa material\" and doesn't care that she's a legacy.\n\nSince Sydney and Dinky's mothers were Kappas, they survived the rush and were accepted as legacies. However, they need to survive the pledging. Sydney's tomboyish upbringing proves to be an asset as she stands out among the other girls and manages to overcome the difficult initiation tasks. She also unintentionally inspires the other girls to innocently defy shallow things that Rachel teaches them. This unique personality gradually propels Sydney's popularity as seen on the university website. Rachel gets extremely jealous of her because of this. As one of the Kappa Sorority's traditional rituals, the freshmen need to find a date late at midnight. Sydney finds Lenny ([[Jack Carpenter (actor)|Jack Carpenter]]), one of the seven dorks who live in a run-down house known as the Vortex. Sydney is then picked by Rachel to ditch her date, which ended in Lenny paying.\n\nSydney fails to become a member of Kappa when Rachel humiliates her in the pledge gala and lies that she has disobeyed the rules: lying about her background and cheating on a Kappa quiz. Sydney leaves that night in the rain, unintentionally sitting in front of the Vortex. She is welcomed by the seven dorks: Lenny, the one with high maintenance health; Terrence ([[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]]), a genius and post-grad, despite the fact that he still attends classes; Jeremy ([[Adam Hendershott]]), who is very shy and uses a dog puppet to communicate, Gurkin ([[Danny Strong]]), a hot-tempered blogger; Spanky ([[Samm Levine]]), who has no experience with girls; George ([[Arnie Pantoja]]), the childlike freshman who still believes in [[Santa Claus]] and doesn't know how to tie a knot; and Embelakbo Akapaktumbe\u2013 also known as \"Embele\"\u2013 (Dont\u00e9 Bonner), a [[Nigeria]]n interchange student who is highly intelligent but has [[Jet lag]]. The Vortex is coincidentally the target of Rachel's plan to open a luxury centre that will benefit only the top Greek sororities and fraternities. She plans to subject it to a planned demolition, which is something Tyler is opposed to after he gets to know Sydney and her housemates better.\n\nSydney, together with the seven dorks, tries to bring Rachel down from her student council position by running Terrence for president. He is soon disqualified because he had already graduated six years prior, as revealed when Rachel humiliated the group at a party. Sydney replaces him as a presidential candidate and starts her campaign. Unlike Rachel's views that promote elitism and exclusivism based solely on popularity and appearances, something that everyone on campus dislikes about her, Sydney and the dorks believe in accepting diversity and equality. This earns Sydney respect from different cliques, and she gets the number one rank on the school's \"hottest\" website, which infuriates Rachel more than ever. The day before the debate and election, Rachel hires a hacker to destroy Sydney's files using a virus called 'The Poison Apple.' Sydney is then forced to stay up all night in the library doing her work on Gurkin's laptop. When Sydney finishes her work, she accidentally falls asleep and is almost disqualified for not showing up, but Tyler wakes her with a kiss just in time. After Rachel answers the question posed by Professor Carlton ([[Brian Patrick Clarke]]), Sydney's supporters arrive, led by a [[Goth subculture|goth]] girl (Kierstin Koppel) whose group is devoted to Gurkin's blog and becomes his girlfriend. Sydney's speech defends the underrated people, including dorks, and concludes by stating that she herself is a dork. This incites a number of students to also admit dork status including Tyler, Jeremy, Spanky and Dinky. Sydney wins the debate and the election, becoming the new president, while Rachel is stripped of her Kappa sisterhood privileges by her sisters because of the years of cruelty she bestowed on both her Kappa sisters and the students at the University as well as lying and cheating during the election.\n\nThe film ends with Sydney's father and other construction workers fixing the Vortex. New relationships have formed as well\u2014Dinky and Lenny are now a couple (who bonded because of their sensitive digestive system), Spanky is finally getting some girls, the Goth girl and Gurkin are dating, and Sydney and Tyler are together. George has learned how to tie a knot, Jeremy is finally coming out of his shell, and Terrence has become a millionaire because of his theory (He sold his theory {the predictive analytic probability theory that he finally perfected and can predict anything from the behavior of amino acids in a stable isotope peptide bond to the outcome of sporting events} to ibet.com for $10 million). And, according to Sydney's narration, they all lived \"dorkily ever after\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Amanda Bynes]] as Sydney White \n** Cree Ivey as young Sydney\n* [[Sara Paxton]] as Rachel Witchburn \n* [[Matt Long]] as Tyler Prince \n* [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] as Paul White\n* [[Crystal Hunt]] as Demetria Rosemead \"Dinky\" Hotchkiss \n* [[Jack Carpenter (actor)|Jack Carpenter]] as Lenny \n* [[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]] as Terrence \n* [[Adam Hendershott]] as Jeremy \n* [[Danny Strong]] as Gurkin \n* [[Samm Levine]] as Spanky \n* [[Arnie Pantoja]] as George \n* Dont\u00e9 Bonner as Embele \n* [[Brian Patrick Clarke]] as Professor Carleton\n* Libby Mintz as Christy\n* Lisandra Vazquez as Amy\n* Lauren Leech as Katy\n* Kierstin Koppel as Goth girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] took place in and around Orlando from February 14, 2007 to April 4, 2007.
