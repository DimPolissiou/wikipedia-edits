(''[[Administrative divisions of Somalia|gobol]]'') of northern [[Somalia]], within the autonomous region of [[Somaliland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Badhan, Somalia - Geographical Names, map, geographic coordinates|url=https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4555313&fid=5769&c=somalia|website=geographic.org|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History of Badhan ==\n[[File:BadhanNewarea.JPG|thumb|left|260px|Overview of a residential area in Badhan, Maakhir, Somalia]]\n\nOld Badhan is about 150 years old. The town used to be located in the settlement of Hubeera, which is now located in lowland. It was always in danger of flooding during the raining seasons. About 40 years ago, the town was re-located near a borewell called Badhan and it has assumed the name ever since. The area was first settled in the 14th century by [[Somali people|Somali]] herdsmen from the [[Warsangali]] subclan of the [[Darod]] clan, as there was water available for their flocks.\n\nBadhan is also famous for being the stage of battles between the [[dervish]]es of [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the Sultanate of Warsangeli. Hassan, the leader of dervishes, ordered the construction of a new grand fort in the city. Nowadays, the fort is in need of restoration, as time has worn it down.\n\nIn July 2007, the district became the capital city of the autonomous [[Maakhir]] (Maakhir has rejoined Puntland since January 2009) region of Somalia. Since the start of the [[Somali civil war]], the city has grown to include, among other things, a [[hospital]], three secondary [[schools]], as well as a [[university]] in the works since the Maakhir regional authorities was planning to open another university in [[Buraan]], another city towards the East of [[Sanaag]], however that has never happened. Badhan consists of five main neighbourhoods\u2014'''golis''', '''horseed''', '''iftiin''' '''waaberi''' and '''geeldoora'''.\n\n==Local government==\n[[File:Badhan Women District Members.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Women Council members in Badhan district, Somalia]] On 20 March 2011, a new council District Members and District commissioner, Mr Abdirizak Ahmed Isse and new deputy commissioner, Ms Zainab Abdi Mohamed, was elected on 20 March 2011, the election was observed by the local elders and Puntland interior minister, [[Abdullahi Ahmed Jama \u2018Ilkajir\u2019]],<ref>[http://laasqoray.net/news-in-english/somalia-badhan-receives-first-district-council ]</ref> the members of the council districts includes 9 women<ref>http://laasqoray.net/news-in-english/year-of-women-in-badhan-womens-leadership-in-local-government-%E2%80%93-badhan-city-sanaag-puntland-somalia</ref> and therefore the District of Badhan became the first [[Somali people|Somali]] district to elect this significant elected women council members. In 2006, the local clan elders have chosen Mr Ahmed Muse Suldan as the District Commissioner of Badhan but it has functioned with limited mandate as far as defining and enforcing city Ordinances and the legal responsibility of its members or sub-committee. This is bound to change, hopefully\n\nThe local Clan elders whom facilitated the current elected district members and district commissioner will served in partnership with Local Government and the community in all matters relating to disputes in trade, property, crime and land distribution.\n\nGenerally districts in Somalia, the DC positions used to be powerful in local affairs but this has declined since the civil war, therefore, the commissioner's level of powers are limited in terms of the scope of his position given the current Somali political situation.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:FurqanHighSchool.JPG|thumb|250px|Scene of Alfurqan High School in Badhan]]\n\nSince 1997, Badhan has experienced educational revolution, there are three primary and elementary schools in Badhan and three high schools and another one is to be opened soon probably by mid-2009 school year. There are also plans for building Technical College which will provide a much-needed training for both the local residents and high school graduates from other cities and towns of [[Sanaag]] Region in order to enhance their employability or the skills to generate income for themselves. Exclusively funded by the [[Minneapolis]] chapter of [[Maakhir]] diaspora, the current university dean, Dr. Abdirahman Hersi, is convinced that the school will proceed with two undergraduate programs: Education and Computer of Information Science. It will then expand into other essential programs like Health, Business and Finance later on.\n\n[[Horn Relief]] has its main office in the city and it also runs, among other essential services, a Pastoralist Youth Leadership program for the local pastoralist community around the environs of Badhan City.\n\nAs of 2008, there are about 5 linguistic private schools which mostly teach Arabic and English. The most well-known language schools operating in Badhan are Lafoole English School and Tawakal English learning centre.\n\n==Maakhir University==\nSituated in Badhan, the [[Maakhir University]] was established in 2009 with the purpose of providing affordable higher education to residents of the province and elsewhere in the nation. According to the institution's website, Maakhir University offers undergraduate degrees with the ultimate goal of contributing to the development of Somali society.\n\nIn 2014, the government of [[Puntland]] signed an agreement in [[Dubai]] with a Kuwaiti company for the development of facilities at Maakhir University as well as the [[Garowe International Airport]]. The deal was valued at US$10 million and was financed by the [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]]. Speaking at the ceremony held for the deal, Puntland Finance Minister Farah thanked Kuwait for helping Somalia stand on its feet again, adding that the flagship projects would boost the local economy and education sector.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20140416090203/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Kuwaiti-Company-to-construct-Airport-University-in-Puntland.shtml</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Puntland debuted newly constructed Maakhir University.<ref>https://twitter.com/abdirashidmd/status/904006198566912000</ref>\n\n==Primary to high school==\n*Alfurqan Primary and Elementary School\n*Alnour Primary and Elementary School\n*tayo Primary and Elementary School\n*Sinai Primary and Elementary School\n*Alfurqan High School\n*Alnour High School\n*Badhan High School\n\nTotal number of students in Badhan stands at 2994, with the broader Badhan district boasting 5,590 students.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011/2 Primary School Census Statistics Yearbook|url=https://www.unicef.org/somalia/SOM_resources_primschoolcensus20112.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Post-secondary institutions==\n* Lafole School of Languages\n* Tawakal School of Languages\n* Haji Ayan Community College\n* [[Iqra Institute for Higher Education]]\n* [[Maakhir University]]\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Land===\n\n[[File:GeeldoraRoad.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Badhan-[[Laasqoray]] road]] Local people in Badhan District use basic modes of transportation. Small percentage of the district residents own motor vehicles. Since Badhan lies in the centre of [[Sanaag]] Region, there are roads from Bosaso to Erigavo that goes through the city, also another road comes from [[Laasqoray]] and passes through the city to Laas-Anod in [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] Region, however, these roads are unpaved and travelers go through very harsh terrains.\n\nThe road that links Badhan to [[Laasqoray]] which locals called [[Geeldora]] Road is 95&nbsp;km away. Approximately 60&nbsp;km of the road traverses the hilly terrains that form [[Cal Madow]] Mountains. The existing road is an earth road which is in poor state and especially on the mountainous areas where traffic is \u2018one way'. On the flat sections, the road crosses several dry river beds on the first few kilometers after Badhan and just before [[Laasqoray]]. The drainage structures / run-off water channels are either poorly formed or collapsed in most of the areas.\n\n====Condition of the road====\n[[File:BadhanCity09.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Main road in the city of Badhan]] The road is on flat terrain for the first 10&nbsp;km coming from Badhan though it meanders quite a bit probably brought about by traffic trying to run on the smoothest possible surface. There are no specific obstacles that could be said to cause the wavy traffic movement.\n\nAfter the 50th kilometer, from Badhan, the terrain is mostly downhill. One noticeable feature is that there is an increasingly large number of turns that are much tighter when going downhill compared to the general uphill section from 19 to 50 km when coming from Badhan. Again, cut slope angles need to be improved throughout the section.\n\nThe downhill terrain continues until 72.5 km from Badhan where the terrain is flat and with loose stones on approaching a dry river bed at 73 km, the upstream edge of the road at that section had some protective gabions which built by the former Somali government. When leaving the river bed, the approach going up was noted to be narrow. Between 77.2 and 77.3 km, again coming from Badhan, the road crosses 3 other river beds. From the last dry river bed crossing on that section, the road route runs almost parallel to the river all the way to [[Laasqoray]]. The terrain thereon to [[Laasqoray]] is flat.\n\n===Air===\n\n[[File:BadhanAirport.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Landing strip in Badhan]]Badhan has a landing strip which used to serve as a major airport during the 1980s for oil companies that were exploring oil deposits in the area, However, of the post-government collapse, regular and scheduled flights in or out of Badhan have diminished to a great extent. The nearest airport or landing strip is in [[Laasqoray]]. [[Erigavo]] airport is also used for Badhan destination. Just after the civil war started in [[Somalia]] the UNDP chartered flights used to land the unpaved airstrip on the Southeast of the city which was carrying Warsangeli refugees from Southern [[Somalia]].\n\nThe airstrip is located within the centre of the city and runs on the South-eastern bound. It is 2&nbsp;km long and 65 m wide. The grade along the runway rises evenly at approximately 3% and slopes across the runway towards the right at approximately 1.5%. There is a storage / parking / re-fuelling area midway along the runway but no buildings / offices. The airstrip has no storm drain system and most of the edge marker stones are either covered with grass or missing.\n\nThe runway [[wearing course]] is made of in-situ gravel material. Most of the runway surface is covered in silt and overgrown with grass. The underlying rock layer has been exposed on approximately 20% of the entire runway surface. The landing strip was the hub for [[UN]] and operations during 1993\u20131996 but had fallen into despair since then, however local NGOs are planning to renovate and rebuild it.\n\n====Conditions of the airport====\n[[File:HouseINBadhan.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Uniquely designed house in Badhan]]Since the runway has not been used for nearly 13 years ago. Lack of use and maintenance has led to grass growing all over the runway and generally the airstrip location. The lack of a storm drainage system on either side of the runway has led surface water to form rills / gulleys on the edges of the runway. There are a few edge markers made of well placed stones but those have been covered by the grass overgrowth. The airstrip was constructed by stripping the ground of grass and overburden material and compacting the surface. There are also two access roads that cut across the airstrip leading to dwellings.\n\n====Repair====\n[[File:QudlohoBadhan.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Overview of Qudloho neighbourhoods in Badhan]]Within the airstrip locality, there are no borrow pits nearby only sites where the locals \u2018harvest' stones and sand for building purposes. Water is readily available, a grader and roller are the only machines that will be required to rehabilitate the airstrip.\n\nWith no borrow pits near-by, the best approach to rehabilitating the airstrip would be to strip the runway surface of grass and silt, scarify 100\u2013150&nbsp;mm, shape and compact the surface. A side drain should be excavated for on the LHS with scour checks provided at 50m intervals while mitre drains should be provided on the RHS at 100m intervals.\nThe water mains cutting across the runway should be protected; by providing a plastic (PVC) sleeve and haunching (surround) the sleeve with concrete. The PVC pipe size should be reasonable enough so as to act as a service duct for further use in future.\n\nEdge markers should also be provided on both edges of the runway. Well arranged stones should be placed at 10 m intervals and painted red every 50 m. The access roads should also be diverted to a single service road on either side of the runway / airstrip area to avoid vehicular traffic going across the airstrip. At some point, an office building will be required at the very least to house communication equipment and maintain records.\n\n==Public services==\n\nBadhan has the largest hospital in Sanaag region, built by the Diaspora of the Region, sadly the hospital is closed since February 2009 due lack of funding and now the local community is left to face the daunting task of taking their sick to [[Bosaso]] in Bari region. The hospital used to offer all the basic medical needs and it has a Maternity ward but that now is closed too. The local MCH is serving the locals and the city has also many pharmacies which offer first aid and other light medical attention.\n\n== Business in Badhan ==\n[[File:Badhan Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Overview of a new hotel in Badhan]] Badhan is a city that is experiencing a period of rapid growth. Similar to any other small town in Somalia, it used to count a population of less than 5,000 residents. However, in the wake of the [[Somali civil war]], Somalis from various different clans who had been victimized in other unsafe parts in Somalia started migrating safe areas of the country including [[Sanaag]] [[region]].\n\nBadhan, being a save haven for many Somalis, subsequently ballooned in size from a city to a population of over 20,000 and counting.\n\nSome small scale [[business]] ventures started flourishing, mainly because the location of the city in the middle of [[Sanaag]] [[region]] and growing local inhabitant, business such as small market for fresh milk, meat and locally produced vegetables have become commonly available in the town. as well in badhan city its also based Construction and contractor Business of Sanaag Construction Company the and participating the rebuilding and growth of the countries developments.\n\nNew hotel with three floors opened its door in 2009, built by local businessman who is from [[Cardiff]], in [[Wales]], [[UK]].\n\n== Entertainment in Badhan ==\nBadhan has green mountains on the west side popularly known as the [[Cal Madow]] towards the city of [[Laasqoray]], while the sea with white beaches, crystal clear water, and a kaleidoscopic reef, is situated just across the mountains of [[Laasqoray]]. In the city there are many activities one can do while on vacation like visit coffee shops where [[khat]] is consumed, or drop in on an Internet caf\u00e9. There are also many hotels and guest houses.\n\nThe best period to visit this city is during September\u2013May during the rain season as the heat in the summer is unbearable for outsiders. On the outskirts of the city are rock mountains, grassland with [[wildlife]] and unique trees\u2014a [[panoramic]] view.\n\n==Communication==\n\nBadhan has a modern telephone system which most residents in the town is able to utilize, the local communication company is called Golis Telecom, a subsidiary of Golis Telesom, based in [[Bosaso]]. Landline telephone system and mobile with some access to the Internet are very common in Badhan cafes.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Caano_Lulid.JPG|School girls from Alfurqan Secondary School in

(''[[Administrative divisions of Somalia|gobol]]'') of northern [[Somalia]], within the autonomous region of [[Somaliland]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Badhan, Somalia - Geographical Names, map, geographic coordinates|url=https://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4555313&fid=5769&c=somalia|website=geographic.org|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History of Badhan ==\n[[File:BadhanNewarea.JPG|thumb|left|260px|Overview of a residential area in Badhan, Maakhir, Somalia]]\n\nOld Badhan is about 150 years old. The town used to be located in the settlement of Hubeera, which is now located in lowland. It was always in danger of flooding during the raining seasons. About 40 years ago, the town was re-located near a borewell called Badhan and it has assumed the name ever since. The area was first settled in the 14th century by [[Somali people|Somali]] herdsmen from the [[Warsangali]] subclan of the [[Darod]] clan, as there was water available for their flocks.\n\nBadhan is also famous for being the stage of battles between the [[dervish]]es of [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the Sultanate of Warsangeli. Hassan, the leader of dervishes, ordered the construction of a new grand fort in the city. Nowadays, the fort is in need of restoration, as time has worn it down.\n\nIn July 2007, the district became the capital city of the autonomous [[Maakhir]] (Maakhir has rejoined Puntland since January 2009) region of Somalia. Since the start of the [[Somali civil war]], the city has grown to include, among other things, a [[hospital]], three secondary [[schools]], as well as a [[university]] in the works since the Maakhir regional authorities was planning to open another University in [[Buraan]], another city towards the East of [[Sanaag]], however that has never happened. Badhan consists of five main neighbourhoods\u2014'''golis''', '''horseed''', '''iftiin''' '''waaberi''' and '''geeldoora'''.\n\n==Local government==\n[[File:Badhan Women District Members.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Women Council members in Badhan district, Somalia]] On 20 March 2011, a new council District Members and District commissioner,Mr Abdirizak Ahmed Isse and new deputy commissioner, Ms Zainab Abdi Mohamed, was elected on 20 March 2011, the election was observed by the local elders and Puntland interior minister, [[Abdullahi Ahmed Jama \u2018Ilkajir\u2019]],<ref>[http://laasqoray.net/news-in-english/somalia-badhan-receives-first-district-council ]</ref> the members of the council districts includes 9 women<ref>http://laasqoray.net/news-in-english/year-of-women-in-badhan-womens-leadership-in-local-government-%E2%80%93-badhan-city-sanaag-puntland-somalia</ref> and therefore the District of Badhan became the first [[Somali people|Somali]] district to elect this significant elected women council members. In 2006, the local clan elders have chosen Mr Ahmed Muse Suldan as the District Commissioner of Badhan but it has functioned with limited mandate as far as defining and enforcing city Ordinances and the legal responsibility of its members or sub-committee. This is bound to change, hopefully\n\nThe local Clan elders whom facilitated the current elected district members and district commissioner will served in partnership with Local Government and the community in all matters relating to disputes in trade, property, crime and land distribution.\n\nGenerally districts in Somalia, the DC positions used to be powerful in local affairs but this has declined since the civil war, therefore, the commissioner's level of powers are limited in terms of the scope of his position given the current Somali political situation.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:FurqanHighSchool.JPG|thumb|250px|Scene of Alfurqan High School in Badhan]]\n\nSince 1997, Badhan has experienced educational revolution, there are three primary and elementary schools in Badhan and three high schools and another one is to be opened soon probably by mid-2009 school year. There are also plans for building Technical College which will provide a much-needed training for both the local residents and high school graduates from other cities and towns of [[Sanaag]] Region in order to enhance their employability or the skills to generate income for themselves. Exclusively funded by the [[Minneapolis]] chapter of [[Maakhir]] diaspora, the current university dean, Dr. Abdirahman Hersi, is convinced that the school will proceed with two undergraduate programs: Education and Computer of Information Science. It will then expand into other essential programs like Health, Business and Finance later on.\n\n[[Horn Relief]] has its main office in the city and it also runs, among other essential services, a Pastoralist Youth Leadership program for the local pastoralist community around the environs of Badhan City.\n\nAs of 2008, there are about 5 linguistic private schools which mostly teach Arabic and English. The most well-known language schools operating in Badhan are Lafoole English School and Tawakal English learning centre.\n\n==Maakhir University==\nSituated in Badhan, the [[Maakhir University]] was established in 2009 with the purpose of providing affordable higher education to residents of the province and elsewhere in the nation. According to the institution's website, Maakhir University offers undergraduate degrees with the ultimate goal of contributing to the development of Somali society.\n\nIn 2014, the government of [[Puntland]] signed an agreement in [[Dubai]] with a Kuwaiti company for the development of facilities at Maakhir University as well as the [[Garowe International Airport]]. The deal was valued at US$10 million and was financed by the [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]]. Speaking at the ceremony held for the deal, Puntland Finance Minister Farah thanked Kuwait for helping Somalia stand on its feet again, adding that the flagship projects would boost the local economy and education sector.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20140416090203/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia-Kuwaiti-Company-to-construct-Airport-University-in-Puntland.shtml</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Puntland debuted newly constructed Maakhir University.<ref>https://twitter.com/abdirashidmd/status/904006198566912000</ref>\n\n==Primary to high school==\n*Alfurqan Primary and Elementary School\n*Alnour Primary and Elementary School\n*tayo Primary and Elementary School\n*Sinai Primary and Elementary School\n*Alfurqan High School\n*Alnour High School\n*Badhan High School\n\nTotal number of students in Badhan stands at 2994, with the broader Badhan district boasting 5,590 students.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011/2 Primary School Census Statistics Yearbook|url=https://www.unicef.org/somalia/SOM_resources_primschoolcensus20112.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Post-secondary institutions==\n* Lafole School of Languages\n* Tawakal School of Languages\n* Haji Ayan Community College\n* [[Iqra Institute for Higher Education]]\n* [[Maakhir University]]\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Land===\n\n[[File:GeeldoraRoad.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Badhan-[[Laasqoray]] road]] Local people in Badhan District use basic modes of transportation. Small percentage of the district residents own motor vehicles. Since Badhan lies in the centre of [[Sanaag]] Region, there are roads from Bosaso to Erigavo that goes through the city, also another road comes from [[Laasqoray]] and passes through the city to Laas-Anod in [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] Region, however, these roads are unpaved and travelers go through very harsh terrains.\n\nThe road that links Badhan to [[Laasqoray]] which locals called [[Geeldora]] Road is 95&nbsp;km away. Approximately 60&nbsp;km of the road traverses the hilly terrains that form [[Cal Madow]] Mountains. The existing road is an earth road which is in poor state and especially on the mountainous areas where traffic is \u2018one way'. On the flat sections, the road crosses several dry river beds on the first few kilometers after Badhan and just before [[Laasqoray]]. The drainage structures / run-off water channels are either poorly formed or collapsed in most of the areas.\n\n====Condition of the road====\n[[File:BadhanCity09.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Main road in the city of Badhan]] The road is on flat terrain for the first 10&nbsp;km coming from Badhan though it meanders quite a bit probably brought about by traffic trying to run on the smoothest possible surface. There are no specific obstacles that could be said to cause the wavy traffic movement.\n\nAfter the 50th kilometer, from Badhan, the terrain is mostly downhill. One noticeable feature is that there is an increasingly large number of turns that are much tighter when going downhill compared to the general uphill section from 19 to 50 km when coming from Badhan. Again, cut slope angles need to be improved throughout the section.\n\nThe downhill terrain continues until 72.5 km from Badhan where the terrain is flat and with loose stones on approaching a dry river bed at 73 km, the upstream edge of the road at that section had some protective gabions which built by the former Somali government. When leaving the river bed, the approach going up was noted to be narrow. Between 77.2 and 77.3 km, again coming from Badhan, the road crosses 3 other river beds. From the last dry river bed crossing on that section, the road route runs almost parallel to the river all the way to [[Laasqoray]]. The terrain thereon to [[Laasqoray]] is flat.\n\n===Air===\n\n[[File:BadhanAirport.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Landing strip in Badhan]]Badhan has a landing strip which used to serve as a major airport during the 1980s for oil companies that were exploring oil deposits in the area, However, of the post-government collapse, regular and scheduled flights in or out of Badhan have diminished to a great extent. The nearest airport or landing strip is in [[Laasqoray]]. [[Erigavo]] airport is also used for Badhan destination. Just after the civil war started in [[Somalia]] the UNDP chartered flights used to land the unpaved airstrip on the Southeast of the city which was carrying Warsangeli refugees from Southern [[Somalia]].\n\nThe airstrip is located within the centre of the city and runs on the South-eastern bound. It is 2&nbsp;km long and 65 m wide. The grade along the runway rises evenly at approximately 3% and slopes across the runway towards the right at approximately 1.5%. There is a storage / parking / re-fuelling area midway along the runway but no buildings / offices. The airstrip has no storm drain system and most of the edge marker stones are either covered with grass or missing.\n\nThe runway [[wearing course]] is made of in-situ gravel material. Most of the runway surface is covered in silt and overgrown with grass. The underlying rock layer has been exposed on approximately 20% of the entire runway surface. The landing strip was the hub for [[UN]] and operations during 1993\u20131996 but had fallen into despair since then, however local NGOs are planning to renovate and rebuild it.\n\n====Conditions of the airport====\n[[File:HouseINBadhan.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Uniquely designed house in Badhan]]Since the runway has not been used for nearly 13 years ago. Lack of use and maintenance has led to grass growing all over the runway and generally the airstrip location. The lack of a storm drainage system on either side of the runway has led surface water to form rills / gulleys on the edges of the runway. There are a few edge markers made of well placed stones but those have been covered by the grass overgrowth. The airstrip was constructed by stripping the ground of grass and overburden material and compacting the surface. There are also two access roads that cut across the airstrip leading to dwellings.\n\n====Repair====\n[[File:QudlohoBadhan.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Overview of Qudloho neighbourhoods in Badhan]]Within the airstrip locality, there are no borrow pits nearby only sites where the locals \u2018harvest' stones and sand for building purposes. Water is readily available,a grader and roller are the only machines that will be required to rehabilitate the airstrip.\n\nWith no borrow pits near-by, the best approach to rehabilitating the airstrip would be to strip the runway surface of grass and silt, scarify 100\u2013150&nbsp;mm, shape and compact the surface. A side drain should be excavated for on the LHS with scour checks provided at 50m intervals while mitre drains should be provided on the RHS at 100m intervals.\nThe water mains cutting across the runway should be protected; by providing a plastic (PVC) sleeve and haunching (surround) the sleeve with concrete. The PVC pipe size should be reasonable enough so as to act as a service duct for further use in future.\n\nEdge markers should also be provided on both edges of the runway. Well arranged stones should be placed at 10 m intervals and painted red every 50 m. The access roads should also be diverted to a single service road on either side of the runway / airstrip area to avoid vehicular traffic going across the airstrip. At some point, an office building will be required at the very least to house communication equipment and maintain records.\n\n==Public services==\n\nBadhan has the largest hospital in Sanaag region, built by the Diaspora of the Region, sadly the hospital is closed since February 2009 due lack of funding and now the local community is left to face the daunting task of taking their sick to [[Bosaso]] in Bari region. The hospital used to offer all the basic medical needs and it has a Maternity ward but that now is closed too. The local MCH is serving the locals and the city has also many pharmacies which offer first aid and other light medical attention.\n\n== Business in Badhan ==\n[[File:Badhan Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Overview of a new hotel in Badhan]] Badhan is a city that is experiencing a period of rapid growth. Similar to any other small town in Somalia, it used to count a population of less than 5,000 residents. However, in the wake of the [[Somali civil war]], Somalis from various different clans who had been victimized in other unsafe parts in Somalia started migrating safe areas of the country including [[Sanaag]] [[region]].\n\nBadhan, being a save haven for many Somalis, subsequently ballooned in size from a city to a population of over 20,000 and counting.\n\nSome small scale [[business]] ventures started flourishing, mainly because the location of the city in the middle of [[Sanaag]] [[region]] and growing local inhabitant, business such as small market for fresh milk, meat and locally produced vegetables have become commonly available in the town. as well in badhan city its also based Construction and contractor Business of Sanaag Construction Company the and participating the rebuilding and growth of the countries developments.\n\nNew hotel with three floors opened its door in 2009,built by local businessman who is from [[Cardiff]], in [[Wales]], [[UK]].\n\n== Entertainment in Badhan ==\nBadhan has green mountains on the west side popularly known as the [[Cal Madow]] towards the city of [[Laasqoray]], while the sea with white beaches, crystal clear water, and a kaleidoscopic reef, is situated just across the mountains of [[Laasqoray]]. In the city there are many activities one can do while on vacation like visit coffee shops where [[khat]] is consumed, or drop in on an Internet caf\u00e9. There are also many hotels and guest houses.\n\nThe best period to visit this city is during September\u2013May during the rain season as the heat in the summer is unbearable for outsiders.

{"title_page": "United States biological weapons program", "text_new": "{{short description|Military program}}\nThe '''United States biological weapons program''' began in 1943. It was replaced by the [[United States biological defense program]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history (1918\u20131941)===\n\nThe '''[[United States]] [[biological weapons]] program''' officially began in spring 1943 on orders from U.S. President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. Research continued following [[World War II]] as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of [[biological agent]]s and [[biological weapon|weapons]]. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven [[bio-agent]]s (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)]]\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations.

Research continued following [[World War II]] as the U.S. built up a large stockpile of [[biological agent]]s and [[biological weapon|weapons]]. Over the course of its 27-year history, the program weaponized and stockpiled the following seven [[bio-agent]]s (and pursued basic research on many more):\n\n*''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' ([[anthrax]])\n*''[[Francisella tularensis]]'' ([[tularemia]])\n*''[[Brucella]]'' spp ([[brucellosis]])\n*''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' ([[Q-fever]])\n*[[Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus|Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE)]]\n*[[Botulinum toxin]] ([[botulism]])\n*[[Staphylococcal enterotoxin B]]\nThroughout its history, the U.S. bioweapons program was secret. It was later revealed that laboratory and field testing (some of the latter using simulants on non-consenting individuals) had been common. The official policy of the United States was first to deter the use of bio-weapons against U.S. forces and secondarily to retaliate if deterrence failed.\n\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] ended all offensive (i.e., non-defensive) aspects of the U.S. bio-weapons program. In 1975 the U.S. ratified both the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]] and the 1972 [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC)\u2014international treaties outlawing biological warfare. Recent U.S. [[biodefense]] programs, however, have raised concerns that the U.S. may be pursuing research that is outlawed by The United Nations. Initial interest in any form of biological warfare came at the close of [[World War I]]. The only agent the U.S. tested was the toxin [[ricin]], a product of the castor plant.<ref name=\"smart\" /> The U.S. conducted tests concerning two methods of ricin dissemination: the first, which involved adhering the toxin to [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] for delivery by [[artillery shell]], was successful;<ref name=\"smart\" /> the second, delivering an aerosol cloud of ricin, was proven less successful in these tests.<ref name=\"smart\" /> Neither delivery method was perfected before the war in Europe ended.<ref name=\"smart\">Smart, Jeffery K.

Project 112 starting in the 1960s tested chemical and biological agents, including VX, sarin and E. coli, on military personnel who did not know they were being tested. After the Defense Department finally acknowledged conducting the tests on unwitting human subjects, it agreed to help the Veterans' Affairs Department track down those who were exposed, but a Government Accountability Office report in 2008 scolded the military for ceasing the effort.<ref name=\"sltrib.com\"/>\n\n====In civilian venues====\nMedical experiments were conducted on a large scale on civilians who had not consented to participate.

There is a drawing exercise where the model slowly but continuously moves, but the shortest is usually one minute. Short dynamic poses are used for [[gesture drawing]] exercises or warm-ups, with the model taking strenuous or precarious positions that could not be sustained for a longer pose\u2014just long enough for the artist to quickly capture the essence of it. Drawing sessions proceed through groups of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minute poses generally for a total of three hours. Active, gestural, or challenging standing poses are often scheduled at the beginning of a session when the models' energy level is highest. Specific exercises or lesson plans may require a particular type of pose, but more often the model is expected to do a series of poses with little direction. The more a model knows about the types of exercises used to teach art, the better they become at posing.<ref name=\"Steinhart\">\n{{cite book| author=Steinhart, Peter| year=2004| title=The Undressed Art: Why We Draw| publisher=Alfred A.

Within each of these, there are varying levels of difficulty, so one kind is not always easier than another. Artists and life drawing instructors will often prefer poses in which the body is being exerted, for a more dynamic and aesthetically interesting subject. Common poses such as standing twists, slouched seated poses and especially the classical [[contrapposto]] are difficult to sustain accurately for any amount of time, although it is often surprising what a skilled model can do. The model's level of experience and skill may be taken into account in determining the length of the posing session and the difficulty of the poses.\n\nWhile posing, a model is expected to remain essentially motionless,<ref name=\"Bulloch\">{{cite book| author=Bullock, Linda| year=2005| title=Finding Human Form: Artists' Models in Studio and Classroom| publisher=R.S.

To accommodate the physical limitations, a schedule such as 20 to 25 minutes of posing, with five- or ten-minute breaks is observed. These breaks\u2014during which the model usually wears a robe or puts on clothing\u2014allow the model to stretch, relax and attend to other needs.\n\nIn art schools classrooms or studios, the model usually poses on a raised platform called the model stand or dais. In sculpture studios this platform may be built to rotate to allow for a 360\u00b0 view for every artist.<ref name=\"Rooney\">{{cite book| author=Rooney, Kathleen| year = 2009| title=Live Nude Girl: My Life as an Object| publisher=University of Arkansas Press| location=Fayetteville| isbn =978-1-55728-891-2 }}</ref> Long poses are generally required for painting (hours or days) and sculpture (perhaps days).

However, artists who hire individuals with whom they have no prior relationship tend to observe art school standards in order to make models feel more comfortable, and to avoid possible legal issues. Professional artists often hire the same models on a regular basis. When a comfortable working relationship is established, many artists relax their standards and models do the same. This may be something as simple as not undressing in another room, or not wearing a robe during breaks. In addition, silence is no longer necessary if the artist is comfortable working and conversing with the model. A more collegial relationship may develop where artist and model feel that they are collaborating. However, in a private studio environment, with an artist on a deadline or with commission guidelines, stricter work standards may apply regarding punctuality and holding longer, more demanding poses, but also require higher rates of pay.\n\n[[Chuck Close]] apologized when several women accused him of making inappropriate comments when they came to his studio to pose, but initially denied any wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/arts/design/chuck-close-sexual-harassment.html| title=Chuck Close Apologizes After Accusations of Sexual Harassment| author=Robin Pogrebin| date=December 20, 2017| newspaper=THe New York Times| accessdate=October 30, 2019}}</ref> \n\nArtists frequently have used family members as models, both nude and otherwise, in creating their works.

However, this was not always so. In 1886, Thomas Eakins was famously dismissed from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art for removing the loincloth from a male model in a mixed classroom. Similarly, Victorian modesty sometimes required the female model to pose nude with her face draped (''Masked Nude'' by Eakins, for example). European arts academies did not allow women to study the nude at all until the end of the nineteenth century. Even today there remain some schools where the employment of nude models is limited (male models wearing jockstraps) or prohibited, usually for religious reasons.\n\n==== Alternative views ====\nAll of the above is based upon a moderate position regarding the value of figure studies and nudity in art. There are also schools or studios that may be more [[Social conservatism|conservative]], or more [[Social liberalism|liberal]].\nMany art programs in Christian institutions consider nudity in any form to be in conflict with their beliefs, and therefore hire only clothed models for art classes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-grant/christian-colleges-strugg_b_901394.html |title=Christian Colleges Struggle with Their Fine Art Programs  |author=Daniel Grant |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=7 October 2012|date=2011-07-18}}</ref> [[Brigham Young University]] does not allow nude models, describing their policy as self-censorship within the context of the school's honor code.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://universe.byu.edu/2012/10/19/honor-code-and-the-arts-art-censorship-at-byu/| title=Honor Code and the visual arts| website=The Daily Universe| author=Katelyn Johns| date=October 19, 2012| accessdate=September 24, 2019}}</ref>\nOther institutions view the absence of figure studies as bringing into question the completeness of the art education offered.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://glimmerglass.olivet.edu/2012/03/01/nudity-in-art-is-professional-not-sexual/|title=Nudity in art is professional, not sexual|publisher=Associated Students of Olivet Nazarene University|date=March 1, 2012|first=Jenny|last=White|accessdate=2013-02-28}}</ref> Some recognize that an appreciation of the beauty of the human body is compatible with a Christian education.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.augie.edu/sites/default/files/Art-Policy-on-Nude-Models.pdf| title=Art Policy on Nude Models| accessdate=March 6, 2016}}</ref> [[Gordon College (Massachusetts)|Gordon College]] not only maintains the need for nude figure studies as part of a complete classical art education, but sees the use of models clad in swimwear or other revealing garments as placing the activity in the context of advertisement and sexual exploitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gordon.edu/download.cfm?id=1554 |title=POLICY ON THE USE OF NUDE MODELS IN ART| website=Gordon College |accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[James Elkins (art historian)|James Elkins]] voices an alternative to classical \"dispassionate\" figure study by stating that the nude is never devoid of erotic meaning, and it is a fiction to pretend otherwise.<ref>{{cite book| last=Elkins| first=James| year=2001| title=Why Art Cannot Be Taught: A Handbook for Art Students| page=[https://archive.org/details/whyartcannotbeta00jame/page/85 85]| publisher=University of Illinois Press| location=Urbana| isbn=978-0-252-06950-5| url=https://archive.org/details/whyartcannotbeta00jame/page/85}}</ref> Even the staunch advocate of classical aesthetics [[Kenneth Clark]] recognized that \"biological urges\" were never absent even in the most chaste nude, nor should they be unless all life is drained from the work.<ref name=\"Clark\"/>  However, most models maintain that posing nude need not be any more sexual than any other coed social situation as long as all participants maintain a mature attitude.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> However, decorum is not always maintained when either a model or the students are not familiar with the often unspoken rules. Models may be apprehensive about posing for incoming freshmen who, having never encountered classroom nudity, respond immaturely.<ref name=\"Bulloch\"/><ref name=\"Rooney\"/>\n\nAcceptance of the erotic is apparent in the work and behavior of some artists, for example Picasso was also famous for having a series of model/muse/mistresses through his life: [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter]], [[Fernande Olivier]], [[Dora Maar]], and [[Fran\u00e7oise Gilot]]. The painter [[John Currin]], whose work is often erotic, combines images from popular culture and references to his wife, [[Rachel Feinstein]].\n\nA feminist view is the [[male gaze]], which asserts that nudes are inherently voyeuristic, with the viewer in the place of the powerful male gazing upon the passive female subject.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eaton|first=E.W.|title=Feminist philosophy of art|journal= Philosophy Compass | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 873\u2013893 | doi = 10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00154.x | date = September 2008 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===Photography===\n{{main|Nude photography (art)}}\nThere has been controversy regarding the status of photography as a fine arts medium that is reflected in the unwillingness of some nude models for other fine art media to also pose for photography.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> The experience of nude modeling for an amateur photographer is different from that of posing for figure drawing/painting.<ref name=\"Rooney\"/> Traditional media create a single image that is not a ''true likeness'' of the individual model, but photographs require a [[model release|release]] in order to protect the model's [[right to privacy]].

This creates some demand for clothed models in those schools that continue to teach [[academic painting]] methods. Some models may promote their services based upon having interesting or varied costumes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atelierkanawa.com/#!kimono-model |title=Kimono Model |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}</ref> Clothing is required in public venues, such as Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-07-04/people/model-behavior/|author= Rachel Kramer Bussel |title=Model Behavior| publisher = The Village Voice |accessdate= 10 October 2012 }}</ref> but occurs in more traditional settings as well, such as the fund-raising marathons sponsored by the Bay Area Models Guild.<ref name=\"Steinhart\"/> Other than costumes, the work requirements and conditions of clothed models for art are identical to that of nude models.\n\nPortraits generally have a client or \"sitter\" rather than a model as the subject; and are now often done from photographs at least in part, although artists prefer to have at least some hours of live sitting particularly at the beginning to better capture the personality, and at the end for final touches.\n\n==Training and selection==\nMost models learn on the job, but many have experience in the performing arts, athletics, or yoga<ref name=\"Bulloch\"/> that provide a basis for posing, such as strength, flexibility, and a well-developed sense of [[Proprioception|kinesthesis]].\n\nIn some countries there are organizations which concern themselves with the competence, conduct and reliability of art models. An example is the Register of Artists' Models (RAM) in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modelreg.co.uk/ |title=Register of Artists' Models |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref>  Some basic training is offered to beginners and membership is by audition \u2013 to test competence, not to discriminate on grounds of physical characteristics. RAM also acts as an important employment exchange for models and publishes the 'RAM Guidelines', which are widely referred to by models and employers. A similar organization in the United States, the Bay Area Models Guild in California, was founded in 1947. Groups also exist in Australia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lifemodelssociety.org/ |title=Lifemodelssociety.org |publisher=Lifemodelssociety.org |date= |accessdate=2019-05-16 |df= }}</ref> Sweden,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyo.se/ |title=The Swedish Organization for Life Models |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> Washington, D.C.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.figuremodelsguild.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227150301/http://www.figuremodelsguild.org/index.asp| archive-date=December 27, 2015| title=Figure Models Guild of Washington, D.C.|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}</ref> and several other cities in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artmodeltips.com/models/guilds|title=ArtModelTips.com: List of model guilds and associations|accessdate=2012-11-03|date=2012-09-09}}</ref>\n\nThese groups may also attempt to establish minimum rates of pay and working conditions, but only rarely have models been sufficiently organized to go on strike.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8213177 |title=Model's Strike 1941 |publisher=Trove |accessdate=2012-10-10}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323751,00.html |title=Italian Model's Strike 2008 |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=2012-10-10}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a9NlE0c0HvX0 |title=Paris Model's Strike 2008 |publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=2012-10-10}}</ref>\n\n===Appearance/age/gender===\nUnlike [[Model (person)|fashion modeling]], modeling in an art school classroom is for the purpose of learning how to draw humans of different shapes, ages, and ethnicity.<ref name=\"Bulloch\"/> Obese models may be in demand by experienced artists.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Nudity and children#Children|Children]] are generally excluded from modeling nude for classes.

However, both male and female models tend to keep their modeling career distinct from their other social interactions, if for different reasons.

It was probably in Ancient Greece that models were first used. The story told of [[Zeuxis]] by [[Valerius Maximus]], who had five of the most beautiful virgins of the city of [[Crotone]] offered him as models for his picture of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], proves their occasional use. The remark of [[Eupompus]], quoted by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], who advised [[Lysippos]], \"Let nature be your model, not an artist\", directing his attention to the crowd instead of to his own work, also suggests a use of models which the many portrait statues of Greek and Roman times show to have been not unknown.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Models, Artists'|volume=18|page=640}}</ref> The names of some of these models of the era are themselves known, such as the beautiful [[Phryne]] who modeled for many paintings and sculptures.\n\nThe nude virtually disappeared from Western art during the Middle Ages due to a combination of civil disorder and the attitude of the early Christians.<ref>{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/numr/hd_numr.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> This changed with the [[Renaissance]] and the rediscovery of classical antiquity, when painters generally made use of their relatives and friends as models, of which many examples might be quoted from [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Rome]] and other places, and the stories of [[Titian]] and the duchess of Ferrara and of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Simonetta Vespucci]], go to show that ladies of exalted rank were sometimes not averse to having their charms immortalized by the painter's brush.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The story of the love between [[Raphael]] and his mistress-model [[Margarita Luti]] (''[[La Fornarina]]'') is \"the [[Archetype|archetypal]] artist-model relationship of [[Western culture|Western tradition]]\".<ref name=\"Lathers\">{{cite book| author=Lathers, Marie |title=Bodies of Art: French Literary Realism and the Artist's Model |page=60| publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=978-0-8032-2941-9 |year=2001 }}</ref> <!-- Paid models were not unknown, as the story of the unfortunate contadino used by [[Jacopo Sansovino]] as model for his statue of the [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] will show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11559/11559-8.txt |title=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> -->\n\n{{See also|Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment}}\n\n[[File:Jan Vermeer - The Art of Painting - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[The Art of Painting]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]], c. 1666]]\nArt modeling as an occupation appeared in the late Renaissance when the establishment of schools for the study of the human figure created a regular demand, and since that time the remuneration offered ensured a continual supply.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> However, academy models were only men until the 19th Century, as were the students. The status of nude models has fluctuated with the value and acceptance of nudity in art. Maintaining the classical ideals of Greece and Rome into the Christian Era, nudity was prominent in the decoration of Catholic churches in the Renaissance, only to be covered up with draperies or [[fig leaf|fig leaves]] by more prudish successors. The Protestant Reformation went even further, destroying many artworks. From being a possibly glamorous occupation celebrating beauty, being a nude model was at other times equivalent to prostitution, practiced by persons without the means to gain more respectable employment. The costumed models used to create historical paintings may not have been a distinct group, since nude studies were done in preparation for any figure painting.\n\nIn 19th century Paris, a number of models earned a place in art history. [[Victorine Meurent]] became a painter herself after posing for several works, including two of the most infamous: ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Manet's Olympia]]'' and '' [[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]''. [[Joanna Hiffernan]] (c. 1843{{snd}}after 1903) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] artists' model and [[muse]] who was romantically linked with [[United States|American]] [[Painting|painter]] [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] and [[France|French]] painter [[Gustave Courbet]]. She is the model for Whistler's painting ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]'' and is rumored to be the model for Courbet's painting ''[[L'Origine du monde]]''. [[Suzanne Valadon]], also a painter, modeled for [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], and [[Edgar Degas]]. She is best known as the figure in Renoir's ''[[Dance at Bougival]]'', and she was the mother of the painter [[Maurice Utrillo]].\n\nWhen [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] attitudes took hold in England, studies with a live model became more restrictive than they had been in the prior century, limited to advanced classes of students that had already proved their worthiness by copying old master paintings and drawing from plaster casts. This is in part because many schools were publicly funded, so decisions were under the scrutiny of non-artists. Modeling was not respectable, and even less so for women. During the same period, the French art atelier system allowed any art student to work from life in a less formal atmosphere, and also admitted women as students. Live figure studies only returned to its classical status in art education throughout the England, Europe and the United States with the approach of the 20th Century.<ref name=\"Postle\"/>\n\nIn the postmodern era, the nude has returned to gain some acceptance in the art world, but not necessarily the art model. Figure drawing is offered in most art schools, but may not be required for a fine art degree. Peter Steinhart says that in trendy galleries, the nude has become pass\u00e9,<ref name=\"Steinhart\"/> while according to Wendy Steiner there has been a revival in the importance of the figure as a source of beauty in contemporary art.<ref name=\"Steiner.2001\">{{cite book| first=Steiner| last=Wendy| year=2001| title=Venus in Exile: The Rejection of Beauty in Twentieth-century Art| publisher=The Free Press| location=| isbn=978-0-684-85781-7 }}</ref> Some established living artists work from models, but more work from photographs, or their imagination.

Paid art models are usually anonymous and unacknowledged subjects of the work. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of artists that gather to share the expense of a model. Models are also employed privately by professional artists.  Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models.

There is a drawing exercise where the model slowly but continuously moves, but the shortest is usually one minute. Short dynamic poses are used for [[gesture drawing]] exercises or warm-ups, with the model taking strenuous or precarious positions that could not be sustained for a longer pose\u2014just long enough for the artist to quickly capture the essence of it. Drawing sessions proceed through groups of 5, 10, 15, or 20 minute poses generally for a total of three hours. Active, gestural, or challenging standing poses are often scheduled at the beginning of a session when the models' energy level is highest. Specific exercises or lesson plans may require a particular type of pose, but more often the model is expected to do a series of poses with little direction. The more a model knows about the types of exercises used to teach art, the better they become at posing.<ref name=\"Steinhart\">\n{{cite book| author=Steinhart, Peter| year=2004| title=The Undressed Art: Why We Draw| publisher=Alfred A.

Within each of these, there are varying levels of difficulty, so one kind is not always easier than another. Artists and life drawing instructors will often prefer poses in which the body is being exerted, for a more dynamic and aesthetically interesting subject. Common poses such as standing twists, slouched seated poses and especially the classical [[contrapposto]] are difficult to sustain accurately for any amount of time, although it is often surprising what a skilled model can do. The model's level of experience and skill may be taken into account in determining the length of the posing session and the difficulty of the poses.\n\nWhile posing, a model is expected to remain essentially motionless,<ref name=\"Bulloch\">{{cite book| author=Bullock, Linda| year=2005| title=Finding Human Form: Artists' Models in Studio and Classroom| publisher=R.S.

To accommodate the physical limitations, a schedule such as 20 to 25 minutes of posing, with five- or ten-minute breaks is observed. These breaks\u2014during which the model usually wears a robe or puts on clothing\u2014allow the model to stretch, relax and attend to other needs.\n\nIn art schools classrooms or studios, the model usually poses on a raised platform called the model stand or dais. In sculpture studios this platform may be built to rotate to allow for a 360\u00b0 view for every artist.<ref name=\"Rooney\">{{cite book| author=Rooney, Kathleen| year = 2009| title=Live Nude Girl: My Life as an Object| publisher=University of Arkansas Press| location=Fayetteville| isbn =978-1-55728-891-2 }}</ref> Long poses are generally required for painting (hours or days) and sculpture (perhaps days).

In a job advertisement seeking nude models, this may be referred to as being \"undraped\" or \"disrobed.\" Art models who pose in the nude for [[life drawing]] are also called '''life models''' or '''figure models'''.

Very close examinations are only made with the permission of the model. Some institutions allow only the instructor to speak directly with a model. Experienced models avoid any sexually suggestive poses.<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> Art instructors and institutions may consider the incident of a male model gaining an [[erection]] while posing cause for termination, or at any rate, grounds for not hiring him again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modelreg.co.uk/st_GuidelinesContentiousIssues.php |title=RAM Guidelines - Contentious Issues| accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>  Any of these policies may vary in different parts of the world.

However, artists who hire individuals with whom they have no prior relationship tend to observe art school standards in order to make models feel more comfortable, and to avoid possible legal issues. Professional artists often hire the same models on a regular basis. When a comfortable working relationship is established, many artists relax their standards and models do the same. This may be something as simple as not undressing in another room, or not wearing a robe during breaks. In addition, silence is no longer necessary if the artist is comfortable working and conversing with the model. A more collegial relationship may develop where artist and model feel that they are collaborating. However, in a private studio environment, with an artist on a deadline or with commission guidelines, stricter work standards may apply regarding punctuality and holding longer, more demanding poses, but also require higher rates of pay.\n\n[[Chuck Close]] apologized when several women accused him of making inappropriate comments when they came to his studio to pose, but initially denied any wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/arts/design/chuck-close-sexual-harassment.html| title=Chuck Close Apologizes After Accusations of Sexual Harassment| author=Robin Pogrebin| date=December 20, 2017| newspaper=THe New York Times| accessdate=October 30, 2019}}</ref> \n\nArtists frequently have used family members as models, both nude and otherwise, in creating their works and the role between male photographers and their wives as models is studied in Arthur Ollman's book, \u2018\u2019The Model Wife.

However, this was not always so. In 1886, Thomas Eakins was famously dismissed from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art for removing the loincloth from a male model in a mixed classroom. Similarly, Victorian modesty sometimes required the female model to pose nude with her face draped (''Masked Nude'' by Eakins, for example). European arts academies did not allow women to study the nude at all until the end of the nineteenth century. Even today there remain some schools where the employment of nude models is limited (male models wearing jockstraps) or prohibited, usually for religious reasons.\n\n==== Alternative views ====\nAll of the above is based upon a moderate position regarding the value of figure studies and nudity in art.

This creates some demand for clothed models in those schools that continue to teach [[academic painting]] methods. Some models may promote their services based upon having interesting or varied costumes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atelierkanawa.com/#!kimono-model |title=Kimono Model |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}</ref> Clothing is required in public venues, such as Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art School,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-07-04/people/model-behavior/|author= Rachel Kramer Bussel |title=Model Behavior| publisher = The Village Voice |accessdate= 10 October 2012 }}</ref> but occurs in more traditional settings as well, such as the fund-raising marathons sponsored by the Bay Area Models Guild.<ref name=\"Steinhart\"/> Other than costumes, the work requirements and conditions of clothed models for art are identical to that of nude models.\n\nPortraits generally have a client or \"sitter\" rather than a model as the subject; and are now often done from photographs at least in part, although artists prefer to have at least some hours of live sitting particularly at the beginning to better capture the personality, and at the end for final touches.\n\n==Training and selection==\nMost models learn on the job, but many have experience in the performing arts, athletics, or yoga<ref name=\"Bulloch\"/> that provide a basis for posing, such as strength, flexibility, and a well-developed sense of [[Proprioception|kinesthesis]].\n\nIn some countries there are organizations which concern themselves with the competence, conduct and reliability of art models. An example is the Register of Artists' Models (RAM) in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modelreg.co.uk/ |title=Register of Artists' Models |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref>  Some basic training is offered to beginners and membership is by audition \u2013 to test competence, not to discriminate on grounds of physical characteristics. RAM also acts as an important employment exchange for models and publishes the 'RAM Guidelines', which are widely referred to by models and employers. A similar organization in the United States, the Bay Area Models Guild in California, was founded in 1947. Groups also exist in Australia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lifemodelssociety.org/ |title=Lifemodelssociety.org |publisher=Lifemodelssociety.org |date= |accessdate=2019-05-16 |df= }}</ref> Sweden,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyo.se/ |title=The Swedish Organization for Life Models |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> Washington, D.C.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.figuremodelsguild.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227150301/http://www.figuremodelsguild.org/index.asp| archive-date=December 27, 2015| title=Figure Models Guild of Washington, D.C.|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}</ref> and several other cities in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artmodeltips.com/models/guilds|title=ArtModelTips.com: List of model guilds and associations|accessdate=2012-11-03|date=2012-09-09}}</ref>\n\nThese groups may also attempt to establish minimum rates of pay and working conditions, but only rarely have models been sufficiently organized to go on strike.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8213177 |title=Model's Strike 1941 |publisher=Trove |accessdate=2012-10-10}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323751,00.html |title=Italian Model's Strike 2008 |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=2012-10-10}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a9NlE0c0HvX0 |title=Paris Model's Strike 2008 |publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=2012-10-10}}</ref>\n\n===Appearance/age/gender===\nUnlike [[Model (person)|fashion modeling]], modeling in an art school classroom is for the purpose of learning how to draw humans of different shapes, ages, and ethnicity.<ref name=\"Bulloch\"/> Obese models may be in demand by experienced artists.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Nudity and children#Children|Children]] are generally excluded from modeling nude for classes.

However, both male and female models tend to keep their modeling career distinct from their other social interactions, if for different reasons. Attitudes toward male nudity, issues of homosexuality when male models work from male artists, and some bias towards the female form in art may lead to less opportunity for male models,<ref name=\"Phillips\"/> and works of art that include male nudity are much less marketable.<ref name=\"Steinhart\"/> However, historically this has not been the case (See below).\n\n===Art model job listings and policies===\nJob description posted by art schools includes statements that poses are nude, and requirements are generally limited to being able to hold poses up to 45 minutes, and to follow cues from the instructor.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://kcai.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Artist-Model-Ad-2.pdf| title=Artist Model Ad| website=Kansas City Art Institute| accessdate=September 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://kishwaukeecollege-openhire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.dspjob&jobid=550&company_id=17021&version=1&jobBoardId=3341| title=Job Posting| website=Kishwaukee College| accessdate=September 24, 2019}}</ref>  \nModels cannot be students at the [[Art Academy of Cincinnati]]<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.artacademy.edu/about-aac/pdf/2017%20Figure%20Model%20Job%20Posting.pdf| title=Job Posting| website=Art Academy of Cincinnati| accessdate=September 24, 2019}}</ref> or [[Orange Coast College]]<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/cccd/jobs/1553478/pt-hourly-pool-art-model| title=Art Model| website=Classified Staff, Management, and Other Opportunities| accessdate=September 24, 2019}}</ref>, but students may model as [[Oregon State University]]<ref>{{cite web| url=https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/school-arts-and-communication/art/students/model-department| title=Model for the Department | website=Oregon State University| accessdate=September 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome colleges have lists of guidelines, while others have extensive manuals that describe policies regarding both in-class and outside interaction by models, students, and faculty; with special consideration for issues of sexual harassment.\n\nThe [[Columbus College of Art and Design]] guidelines  specifically state that students are discouraged from forming any amorous relationship with models, and must report any existing relationship to avoid possible conflicts.

It was probably in Ancient Greece that models were first used. The story told of [[Zeuxis]] by [[Valerius Maximus]], who had five of the most beautiful virgins of the city of [[Crotone]] offered him as models for his picture of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], proves their occasional use. The remark of [[Eupompus]], quoted by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], who advised [[Lysippos]], \"Let nature be your model, not an artist\", directing his attention to the crowd instead of to his own work, also suggests a use of models which the many portrait statues of Greek and Roman times show to have been not unknown.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Models, Artists'|volume=18|page=640}}</ref> The names of some of these models of the era are themselves known, such as the beautiful [[Phryne]] who modeled for many paintings and sculptures.\n\nThe nude virtually disappeared from Western art during the Middle Ages due to a combination of civil disorder and the attitude of the early Christians.<ref>{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/numr/hd_numr.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> This changed with the [[Renaissance]] and the rediscovery of classical antiquity, when painters generally made use of their relatives and friends as models, of which many examples might be quoted from [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Rome]] and other places, and the stories of [[Titian]] and the duchess of Ferrara and of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Simonetta Vespucci]], go to show that ladies of exalted rank were sometimes not averse to having their charms immortalized by the painter's brush.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The story of the love between [[Raphael]] and his mistress-model [[Margarita Luti]] (''[[La Fornarina]]'') is \"the [[Archetype|archetypal]] artist-model relationship of [[Western culture|Western tradition]]\".<ref name=\"Lathers\">{{cite book| author=Lathers, Marie |title=Bodies of Art: French Literary Realism and the Artist's Model |page=60| publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=978-0-8032-2941-9 |year=2001 }}</ref> <!-- Paid models were not unknown, as the story of the unfortunate contadino used by [[Jacopo Sansovino]] as model for his statue of the [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] will show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11559/11559-8.txt |title=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> -->\n\n{{See also|Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment}}\n\n[[File:Jan Vermeer - The Art of Painting - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[The Art of Painting]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]], c. 1666]]\nArt modeling as an occupation appeared in the late Renaissance when the establishment of schools for the study of the human figure created a regular demand, and since that time the remuneration offered ensured a continual supply.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> However, academy models were only men until the 19th Century, as were the students. The status of nude models has fluctuated with the value and acceptance of nudity in art. Maintaining the classical ideals of Greece and Rome into the Christian Era, nudity was prominent in the decoration of Catholic churches in the Renaissance, only to be covered up with draperies or [[fig leaf|fig leaves]] by more prudish successors. The Protestant Reformation went even further, destroying many artworks. From being a possibly glamorous occupation celebrating beauty, being a nude model was at other times equivalent to prostitution, practiced by persons without the means to gain more respectable employment. The costumed models used to create historical paintings may not have been a distinct group, since nude studies were done in preparation for any figure painting.\n\nIn 19th century Paris, a number of models earned a place in art history. [[Victorine Meurent]] became a painter herself after posing for several works, including two of the most infamous: ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Manet's Olympia]]'' and '' [[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]]''. [[Joanna Hiffernan]] (c. 1843{{snd}}after 1903) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] artists' model and [[muse]] who was romantically linked with [[United States|American]] [[Painting|painter]] [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] and [[France|French]] painter [[Gustave Courbet]]. She is the model for Whistler's painting ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]'' and is rumored to be the model for Courbet's painting ''[[L'Origine du monde]]''. [[Suzanne Valadon]], also a painter, modeled for [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], and [[Edgar Degas]]. She is best known as the figure in Renoir's ''[[Dance at Bougival]]'', and she was the mother of the painter [[Maurice Utrillo]].\n\nWhen [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] attitudes took hold in England, studies with a live model became more restrictive than they had been in the prior century, limited to advanced classes of students that had already proved their worthiness by copying old master paintings and drawing from plaster casts. This is in part because many schools were publicly funded, so decisions were under the scrutiny of non-artists. Modeling was not respectable, and even less so for women. During the same period, the French art atelier system allowed any art student to work from life in a less formal atmosphere, and also admitted women as students. Live figure studies only returned to its classical status in art education throughout the England, Europe and the United States with the approach of the 20th Century.<ref name=\"Postle\"/>\n\nIn the postmodern era, the nude has returned to gain some acceptance in the art world, but not necessarily the art model. Figure drawing is offered in most art schools, but may not be required for a fine art degree. Peter Steinhart says that in trendy galleries, the nude has become pass\u00e9,<ref name=\"Steinhart\"/> while according to Wendy Steiner there has been a revival in the importance of the figure as a source of beauty in contemporary art.<ref name=\"Steiner.2001\">{{cite book| first=Steiner| last=Wendy| year=2001| title=Venus in Exile: The Rejection of Beauty in Twentieth-century Art| publisher=The Free Press| location=| isbn=978-0-684-85781-7 }}</ref> Some established living artists work from models, but more work from photographs, or their imagination.

They decided to use the [[USATC]] built [[SR Class USA|USA tanks]]. No. 30072 started life at the [[Vulcan Iron Works#Pennsylvania.2C United States|Vulcan Iron Works]] in 1943 as works number 4446.<ref name=\"KWVR Locos ATW\"/> After 4 years, the Southern Railway bought it and 14 others of its class renumbering it No. 72. At nationalisation, 30,000 was added to the number (as was customary for southern engines), and it stayed at Southampton. In 1962, its duties were taken over by diesel shunting engines and No. 30072 was moved to [[Guildford (Surrey) railway station#Motive Power Depot|Guildford (70C)]] shed.<ref name=\"KWVR Locos ATW\"/> On 9 July 1967, it was moved to Salisbury for storage, from where it was bought.</small>\n\n<small>When at the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, it hauled the re-opening special with 41241. It operated as an oil-burning locomotive from 1976 to 1987.</small>\n\n<small>No. 30072 was purchased by Andy Booth (the current owner of [[L&YR Class 27]] no 1300) in August 2015 and is presently stored inside the [[Ribble Steam Railway]]'s museum awaiting a space in the workshop for its overhaul to commence.
