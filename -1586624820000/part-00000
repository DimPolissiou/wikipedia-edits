The industry offers a wide choice of options extending across many interdisciplinary interdependent specialities, including aerospace engineering.\n\nMechanical engineering is concerned with all types of machinery in industries and all aspects of their mechanism and functioning; the design, development, construction, production, installation, operation and maintenance; such as large steam and gas turbines, components of thermal power stations, internal combustion engines, jet engines, machine tools, air conditioning and heating machines, refrigerators etc. to name a few. They not only design and create new products, but also develop materials for them and ways of making them.\nEvery year the [[Robot competition|ROBOT competition]] is organized by the institution in which the Mechanical department plays a role in designing the robot.\n\nIn 2014, the department took the initiatives to introduce aerospace engineering degree in Nepal, alongside its Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering program. The courses were initially designed in collaboration with aviation and aeronautical experts in Nepal,  and a faculty member for aeronautical engineering was added to the department in April 2014. Since then, the department established aerospace laboratories, including airframe, avionics and gas-turbine engine components, a subsonic wind-tunnel facility, and a high-performance computing workstation facility. Aeronautical/aerospace engineering was taught as a specialization course in fourth year (AeroStream), where the students were allowed to choose their respective streams. Since 2014, around 20 students enrolled in AeroStream each year at Pulchowk, with provisions for additional students enrolling at IOE Thapathali and IOE Dharan. Additionally, with the start of the M.Sc. in Mechanical Systems Design and Engineering at the department in February 2017, and the addition of three new faculty members for aerospace engineering during late 2017 and early 2018, the department took the necessary steps to introduce Bachelors of Aerospace Engineering in 2018.<ref>http://mech.pcampus.edu.np/index.php/faculty-and-research/</ref>\n\n=== Career Prospects ===\nMechanical engineers use engineering principles to provide efficient solutions to the development of processes and products, ranging from small component designs to extremely large plant, machinery or vehicles. They can work on all stages of a product, from research and development to design and manufacture, through to installation and final commissioning.\n\nMost industries rely on mechanical systems and mechanical engineering is thought to be one of the most diverse of all engineering disciplines, with employment opportunities available in a wide range of sectors, such as the manufacturing, power, construction and medical industries.\n\nMechanical engineers can also be involved in the management of people and resources, as well as the development and use of new materials and technologies.\n\n=== Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering (B.E) (48 Seats) ===\nCarrying-on from the developments under the [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical/aerospace]] unit at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pulchowk Campus started the bachelor's degree program in aerospace engineering in 2018. With the intakes starting in August of that year, the program is run under the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The program covers all the essential as well as optional courses of the aeronautical streams, with further elective courses options for space engineering- including propulsion systems, navigation and communication systems, aerothermodynamics, etc. Following the current conventions in the field, the program was named 'Aerospace Engineering', instead of [[Aeronautical Engineering]].\n\nThe department has already established aerospace laboratories, including airframe, avionics and gas-turbine engine components laboratory, a subsonic wind-tunnel facility, and a high-performance computing workstation facility. In addition, with now an academic unit for aerospace engineering with 4 academics, the department is establishing new laboratories for teaching and research over the next several years.\n\n=== Career Prospects ===\nSince aerospace engineering is generally the driver of state-of-art of the engineering and applied sciences, this field can strongly complement other fields of science and engineering.

The industry offers a wide choice of options extending across many interdisciplinary interdependent specialities, including aerospace engineering.\n\nMechanical engineering is concerned with all types of machinery in industries and all aspects of their mechanism and functioning; the design, development, construction, production, installation, operation and maintenance; such as large steam and gas turbines, components of thermal power stations, internal combustion engines, jet engines, machine tools, air conditioning and heating machines, refrigerators etc. to name a few. They not only design and create new products, but also develop materials for them and ways of making them.\nEvery year the [[Robot competition|ROBOT competition]] is organized by the institution in which the Mechanical department plays a role in designing the robot.\n\nIn 2014, the department took the initiatives to introduce aerospace engineering degree in Nepal, alongside its Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering program. The courses were initially designed in collaboration with aviation and aeronautical experts in Nepal,  and a faculty member for aeronautical engineering was added to the department in April 2014. Since then, the department established aerospace laboratories, including airframe, avionics and gas-turbine engine components, a subsonic wind-tunnel facility, and a high-performance computing workstation facility. Aeronautical/aerospace engineering was taught as a specialization course in fourth year (AeroStream), where the students were allowed to choose their respective streams. Since 2014, around 20 students enrolled in AeroStream each year at Pulchowk, with provisions for additional students enrolling at IOE Thapathali and IOE Dharan. Additionally, with the start of the M.Sc. in Mechanical Systems Design and Engineering at the department in February 2017, and the addition of three new faculty members for aerospace engineering during late 2017 and early 2018, the department took the necessary steps to introduce Bachelors of Aerospace Engineering in 2018.<ref>http://mech.pcampus.edu.np/index.php/faculty-and-research/</ref>\n\n=== Career Prospects ===\nMechanical engineers use engineering principles to provide efficient solutions to the development of processes and products, ranging from small component designs to extremely large plant, machinery or vehicles. They can work on all stages of a product, from research and development to design and manufacture, through to installation and final commissioning.\n\nMost industries rely on mechanical systems and mechanical engineering is thought to be one of the most diverse of all engineering disciplines, with employment opportunities available in a wide range of sectors, such as the manufacturing, power, construction and medical industries.\n\nMechanical engineers can also be involved in the management of people and resources, as well as the development and use of new materials and technologies.\n\n=== Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering (B.E) (48 Seats) ===\nCarrying-on from the developments under the [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical/aerospace]] unit at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pulchowk Campus started the bachelor's degree program in aerospace engineering in 2018. With the intakes starting in August of that year, the program is run under the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The program covers all the essential as well as optional courses of the aeronautical streams, with further elective courses options for space engineering- including propulsion systems, navigation and communication systems, aerothermodynamics, etc. Following the current conventions in the field, the program was named 'Aerospace Engineering', instead of [[Aeronautical Engineering]].\n\nThe department has already established aerospace laboratories, including airframe, avionics and gas-turbine engine components laboratory, a subsonic wind-tunnel facility, and a high-performance computing workstation facility. In addition, with now an academic unit for aerospace engineering with 4 academics, the department is establishing new laboratories for teaching and research over the next several years.\n\n=== Career Prospects ===\nSince aerospace engineering is generally the driver of state-of-art of the engineering and applied sciences, this field can strongly complement other fields of science and engineering. Many of the advanced technological fields such as computational and experimental fluid dynamics, composite and advanced material science and manufacturing, fatigue and fracture mechanics, computer-aided engineering designs, structural analysis using finite element methods, structural health monitoring, high-performance computing, numerical methods in science and engineering, communication and navigation systems, etc. have been largely a product of the developments in aerospace industry and research.\n\nFor a country like Nepal with difficult terrains for land-based transportation and access, aviation has proven to be a reliable and increasingly affordable form of the transportation system. Its importance has been further highlighted by the rapid growth in the aviation sector in the country in the recent years. However, due to the weak infrastructure, inadequate aerodrome standards, underdeveloped industrial practices and at times heedless regulatory oversight in the country, the aviation industry has so far struggled to meet the service and safety standards as anticipated by the current necessities, which has also greatly hindered its progress. This program intends to boost the domestic capabilities in the aviation and aerospace engineering sector with the generation of the capable manpower.\n\nIn Nepal, the student can choose to work in the rapidly growing aviation industry- in the private as well as public organizations. In addition, the program will provide the essential skill sets to be competitive for academic, engineering as well as research position in industries and universities outside Nepal in the fields of aviation and aerospace sciences and technology.\n\n=== Bachelor of Electrical Engineering (B.E) (48 Seats) ===\nElectrical Engineering courses could only be taken at Pulchowk Campus until recently, when the private colleges have started providing the same. The department has a Power and Electrical machines lab. Most of the electrical engineering graduates are working in the Nepal Electricity Authority, the governmental organization involved in power generation, transmission and distribution. The department offers an MS in Power Systems. Graduates pursuing their MS and PhD programs have been involved in research in universities around the world.\n\n=== Career Prospects ===\nSome electrical engineers focus in the study of electronic devices and circuits that are the basic building blocks of complex electronic systems. Others study power and the generation, transmission, and utilization of electrical energy. A large group of electrical engineers studies the application of these complex systems to other areas, including medicine, biology, geology, and ecology. Still another controls, telecommunications, wireless communications, and signal processing.\n\n=== Bachelor in Architecture (B.Arch) (48 Seats) ===\nArchitecture is the blend of art and Science in designing Physical structures that shape the environment in which we live, using creativity and practical understanding of structures and materials do develop concept, plans, and specifications and detailed drawing of buildings. Architects may also be involved in project feasibility studies, heritage study, urban planning, interior design and landscape design.  If you are interested in Creating things, expressing them visually and Art and designs you can succeed and enjoy in this career.\n\n=== Career Options ===\nAs an architect you may choose to go into general practice or specialize in commercial, historical building conservation, housing renovation, industrial or institutional developments anywhere in the world.\n\n== Undergraduate Programs Enrollment<ref name=\":0\" />==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Level\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Course\n!colspan=\"3\"|Intake\n|-\n!Regular\n!Full fee\n!Total\n|-\n|BE    ||Civil ||108||84||192\n|-\n|BE ||Computer ||36||60||96\n|-\n|BE    ||Mechanical   ||24||24||48\n|-\n|BE    ||Electrical   ||24||24||48\n|-\n|BE    ||Electronics  ||24||24||48\n|-\n|BE||Aerospace ||12||36||48\n|-\n|BE ||Chemical ||12||36||48\n|-\n|B.Arch||Architecture ||24||24||48\n|-\n|}\n\n== Postgraduate programmes ==\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Urban Planning]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Information & Communication Engineering]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Structural Engineering]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Power System Engineering]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Renewable Energy Engineering]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Water Resources Engineering]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Geo-Technical Engineering]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Transportation Engineering]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Disaster Risk Management]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Computer System and Knowledge Engineering]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Energy System Planning and Management]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Environmental Engineering]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Construction Management]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Technology and Innovation Management]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Climate change and Development]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Material Science]]\n* Master of Science (M.Sc) in [[Mechanical Engineering]] (Mechanical Systems Design and Engineering)\n\n== College Facilities ==\nThe college premises spreading on 480 ropanis, consists of several buildings for classes and laboratories of engineering/architecture faculties.

Currently, it consists of student cohorts in twelve levels of study (Grades 1 to 12) and operates an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school under a single administration. One of the oldest private schools in the country, St. Xavier's has historically been considered an elite institution, often attracting students from the upper crust of Nepal's society.

Each was different, as they were intended as showcases for his [[patent]]s rather than for serious production.\n\n==Engine and running gear==\nThe cars incorporated such features as [[independent suspension]], [[hydraulic brake]]s, a heater and all seating within the [[wheelbase]]. Ignition and other controls operated through flexible cables encased in copper tubing, which followed contemporary aircraft industry practice.<ref name=Motor197202/>  The cars were rear-engined with twin radiators.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Gernsback | first = Hugo |title = Streamline Car Carries Engine at Rear | journal = Everyday Science and Mechanics |date=November 1931 |page=663 | publisher = Gernsback Publication }} Shows cut-away view of car.</ref> The first car used an [[Alvis Cars|Alvis]] front-wheel-drive chassis effectively turned back-to-front but adapted so the new front wheels steered. Later cars used [[Beverley Works|Beverley]] straight 8, [[Lycoming engine|Lycoming]] and [[Armstrong Siddeley]] engines.\n\n==Body==\nThe streamlined bodywork is very long at just under {{convert|20|ft|m}}. The spare wheel was carried inside one of the rear doors which must have put an enormous strain on the hinges and door pillar. The equivalent space in the opposite door was occupied either by a second spare wheel<ref name=Motor197202/> or a [[cocktail cabinet]].  The car's unusual aerodynamic design was eye catching, with very little front overhang, but a long rear overhang (containing the engine).<ref name=Motor197202/>  The underside was also covered in sheet metal to enhance aerodynamic efficiency.<ref name=Motor197202/>   The Streamline pointed to the future in terms of space efficiency, featuring a seven-seat interior and, even by the standards of the time, excellent headroom, which seems to have been a particular concern for [[Charles Dennistoun Burney|the designer]].<ref name=Motor197202>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Cyril Posthumus| title =The Burney Streamline|magazine= Motor| volume = | pages =1\u20133|date = 19 February 1972}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial==\nEach car was priced at around \u00a31,500. A blue one was bought by the [[Prince of Wales]] late in 1930,<ref name=Motor197202/> and another crossed the [[Atlantic]] to be exhibited at the [[Detroit Car Show]].

No two Streamlines were identical and the version tested was \"only\" 18&nbsp;ft 7 in (approximately 5.6 meters) long with a 12&nbsp;ft 5 in (3.8 m) wheelbase which made it unwieldy in restricted spaces.  It was longer than the longest available [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and only about \u00a3350 cheaper.<ref name=Motor197202/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nSome of the ideas (including the location of the spare wheel) were used by [[Crossley Motors]] in their \"Streamline\" but this also was not a production success.

Later cars used [[Beverley Works|Beverley]] straight 8, [[Lycoming engine|Lycoming]] and [[Armstrong Siddeley]] engines.\n\n==Body==\nThe streamlined bodywork is very long at just under {{convert|20|ft|m}}. The spare wheel was carried inside one of the rear doors which must have put an enormous strain on the hinges and door pillar. The equivalent space in the opposite door was occupied either by a second spare wheel<ref name=Motor197202/> or a [[cocktail cabinet]].  The car's unusual aerodynamic design was eye catching, with very little front overhang, but a long rear overhang (containing the engine).<ref name=Motor197202/>  The underside was also covered in sheet metal to enhance aerodynamic efficiency.<ref name=Motor197202/>   The Streamline pointed to the future in terms of space efficiency, featuring a seven-seat interior and, even by the standards of the time, excellent headroom, which seems to have been a particular concern for [[Charles Dennistoun Burney|the designer]].<ref name=Motor197202>{{cite magazine| authorlink = Cyril Posthumus| title =The Burney Streamline|magazine= Motor| volume = | pages =1\u20133|date = 19 February 1972}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial==\nEach car was priced at around \u00a31,500. A blue one was bought by the [[Prince of Wales]] late in 1930,<ref name=Motor197202/> and another crossed the [[Atlantic]] to be exhibited at the [[Detroit Car Show]].  In total, 12 Streamlines were built between 1929 and 1931,<ref name=Motor197202/> but none appears to have survived.<ref name =\" Prince of Wales \">{{citation | last =Special Cable to New York Times | title = Burney Will Display His Latest Auto Here | newspaper = New York Times | pages = Automobiles pg 1 | date = 4 January 1932}}\"Inventor and Streamlined Car With Rear Engine Will Sail From England Tomorrow.\" This will be the ninth one built; the Prince of Wales bought the fifth one.</ref> [[Crossley Motors]] took out a licence to build the Streamline, producing a further 25 vehicles,{{sfnp|Chapman|2008|p=25}} of which two survive.\n\nThe [[Straight eight]] Beverley-Barnes engines in the earlier cars proved to be unreliable, and in the final three cars were replaced by US-built 6-cylinder [[Lycoming engine|Lycoming]] or UK-built [[Armstrong Siddeley]] units.<ref name=Motor197202/>\n\nStreamline Cars finally closed in 1936.\n\n==Driving impressions==\nA contemporary report commended the lack of mechanical noise from the driver's seat and the excellence of the ride.<ref name=Motor197202/>   The car's considerable weight \u2013 38&nbsp;cwt or about 1900&nbsp;kg on the 1930 model \u2013 may have been one cause of the clutch-slip reported at 76&nbsp;mph (about 122&nbsp;km/h) which was close to the car's claimed maximum.<ref name=Motor197202/>  The engine was mounted wholly behind the rear axle, and the car was therefore alarmingly unstable in wet or windy weather.\n\nA remarkable turning circle of {{Convert|39|ft|m|abbr=on}} was achieved in spite of the car's length. No two Streamlines were identical and the version tested was \"only\" 18&nbsp;ft 7 in (approximately 5.6 meters) long with a 12&nbsp;ft 5 in (3.8 m) wheelbase which made it unwieldy in restricted spaces.  It was longer than the longest available [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and only about \u00a3350 cheaper.<ref name=Motor197202/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nSome of the ideas (including the location of the spare wheel) were used by [[Crossley Motors]] in their \"Streamline\" but this also was not a production success. The Maidenhead factory was also used for car production by [[Marendaz]] and [[GWK (car)|GWK]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom]]\n\n==References==\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Giles |title=The Worst Cars Ever Sold |year=2008 |publisher=The History Press |origyear=2001 |isbn=978-0-7509-4714-5 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Nield, Dr. Bernard.

Further, stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors leads to glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and thus elevation of blood glucose levels).\n\nA pheochromocytoma can also cause resistant [[arterial hypertension]]. A pheochromocytoma can be fatal if it causes a [[hypertensive emergency]], that is, severely high blood pressure that impairs one or more organ systems (formerly called \"malignant hypertension\"). This hypertension is not well controlled with standard blood pressure medications.\n\nTumors may grow large, but most are smaller than {{convert|10|cm|0}}.\n\nPheochromocytoma crisis is a rare and potentially lifethreatening emergency. It can occur spontaneously or be precipitated by administration of pharmacological agents, tumor manipulation, micturition (urinary bladder pheochromocytoma), or foods that aggravate release of catecholamines by the tumor.<ref>doi: 10.4158/EP10388.CR.{{PMID|21324811}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nThe massive release of catecholamines in pheochromocytoma can cause damage to heart cells.<ref name=Goldman_327>{{Harvnb|Goldman|2011|pp=327}}</ref> This damage may be due to either compromising the coronary microcirculation or by direct toxic effects on the heart cells.<ref name=Goldman_327 />\n\nA common clinical presentation of pheochromocytoma includes hypertension, due to increased total peripheral resistance. Most pheochromocytomas secrete norepinephrine, which is a vasoconstrictor via \u03b1-adrenergic receptor stimulation, however research has yet to significantly correlate the increase in peripheral resistance with increased circulating norepinephrine. Theories behind the inability to correlate the two variables include simultaneous dopamine release, which has the opposing effect of norepinephrine in terms of vasodilation. Other mechanisms propose the down-regulation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors or the release of other hormones that have opposing effects to norepinephrine. Due to increased catecholamine production, cardiovascular complications upon presentation and throughout the course of the disease are common. Complications that arise from these cardiovascular disturbances include blood pressure changes as well as possible sudden death, heart attack despite no prior history, noncardiogenic pulmonary shock/edema, and arrhythmias.\n\nPheochromocytoma is also capable of causing, at presentation, pseudo-obstruction of bowels, diabetic ketoacidosis, or multisystem crisis involving lactic acidosis. These symptoms may be in part due to the co-secretion of other hormones associated with norepinephrine, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropin, and interleukin six.\n\nPheochromocytoma may go undiagnosed or undetected for multiple reasons. The main reason is the fact that the tumors are rare. Hypertension may not clinically present itself right away due to the fact that catecholamines can convert into their biologically inactive forms in the tumor, suppressing symptoms. Lastly, the symptoms of the disease are non-specific and common to stress neuronal release of catecholamines. Lag in diagnosis averages about three years. Presymptomatic diagnosis is most possible in patients with germ-line inheritance.\n\n==Cause==\nThe hereditary implications of pheochromocytoma are still being investigated, however, genes have been identified as genomic biomarkers to aid in the identification of inherited disease. [1] Of these genes studied, the most well-known include VHL, RET, and [[neurofibromin 1|NF1]] of [[neurofibromatosis type I]]. Aberrations of these genes are associated with bilateral disease.\n\nThe RET protein is a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays an integral role in development of sympathetic neurons [2]. Mutations in the gene via germ-line (MEN-2) or somatic acquisition activate multiple signaling pathways involved in PCC, as well as other neuroendocrine tumors in humans. [[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2|MEN-2]] generally results from a gain-of-function variant of this RET gene, and MEN-2 is commonly associated with pheochromocytoma and amyloid producing medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nMutations in two subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase gene, SDHB and SDHD, have been strongly associated with cancer presenting at a younger age as well as extra-adrenal location, multiple tumors/metastasis, and poor prognosis.\n\nPheochromocytoma linked to MEN II can be caused by [[RET oncogene]] mutations. Both syndromes are characterized by pheochromocytoma as well as [[thyroid cancer]] (thyroid medullary carcinoma). MEN IIA also presents with hyperparathyroidism, while MEN IIB also presents with mucosal neuroma.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Adrenal pheochromocytoma (3) histopathology.jpg|thumb|150px|Histopathology of adrenal pheochromocytoma.

Care should be taken to rule out other causes of adrenergic (adrenaline-like) excess like hypoglycemia, stress, exercise, and drugs affecting the catecholamines like [[stimulant]]s, [[methyldopa]], [[dopamine]] [[agonist]]s, or ganglion blocking [[antihypertensive]]s. Various foodstuffs (e.g. coffee, tea, bananas, chocolate, cocoa, citrus fruits, and vanilla) can also affect the levels of urinary [[metanephrine]] and VMA ([[vanillylmandelic acid]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=117&pid=1&gid=003613 |title=Catecholamines \u2013 urine \u2013 Penn State Hershey Medical Center |publisher=Pennstatehershey.adam.com |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2013-02-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203023424/http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=117&pid=1&gid=003613 |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}</ref>\n\nImaging by [[computed tomography]] or a [[Spin-spin relaxation time|T2]] weighted [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of the [[head]], [[neck]], and [[chest]], and [[abdomen]] can help localize the tumor.

[[Von Hippel Lindau]] patients may also develop these tumors.<ref name=Goldman_185>{{Harvnb|Goldman|2011|pp=185}}</ref>\n\nPatients experiencing symptoms associated with pheochromocytoma should be aware that it is rare. However, it often goes undiagnosed until autopsy; therefore patients might wisely choose to take steps to provide a physician with important clues, such as recording whether blood pressure changes significantly during episodes of apparent anxiety.\n\n===Testing===\nTesting prior to tumor excision helps ascertain whether the tumor is a singular tumor or if there are multiple, if it is ectopic or adrenal originating, malignant or benign, and isolated or present with other tumors in context of inherited disease. CT is the most commonly used imaging technique, however MRI is preferred. [[Iobenguane|MIBG]] scanning should be used when possible, as it is the most accurate way to locate cancer in catecholamine producing cancers, as catecholamine plasma membrane and vesicular transport systems are especially abundant in pheochromocytoma cells. Imaging using MIBG would yield specific and sensitive results compared to CT and MRI, as the latter two are non-specific generalized imaging techniques\n[[File:Adrenaline.svg|thumb|150px|[[Epinephrine]]]]\n[[File:Noradrenaline2.svg|thumb|150px|[[Norepinephrine]]]]\n*'''[[Blood test]]s''': Buters and others have suggested that analysis of free metanephrines ([[metadrenaline]]s) (normetanephrine and metanephrine) in blood plasma is the most accurate test for detecting pheochromocytoma.\n*'''[[Urinalysis|Urine tests]]''': Although this test is slightly less effective than plasma testing it is still considered highly effective in diagnosis. Usually the metabolites of [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]], [[normetanephrine]] (NMN) and [[metanephrine]] (MN), are found in relatively small amounts in normal humans. The increased excretion of these metabolites is indicative of the disease, but does not completely rule out other diseases which may cause the same excretion values.\n*'''Other Tests''':\n:*One diagnostic test used in the past for a pheochromocytoma is to administer [[clonidine]], a centrally-acting alpha-2 agonist used to treat high blood pressure. Clonidine mimics catecholamines in the brain, causing it to reduce the activity of the sympathetic nerves controlling the adrenal medulla. A healthy adrenal medulla will respond to the [[Clonidine#Clonidine suppression test|clonidine suppression test]] by reducing catecholamine production; the lack of a response is evidence of pheochromocytoma.\n\n:*[[Chromogranin A]] is elevated in case of pheochromocytoma.<ref name=\"pmid15850005\">{{cite journal |pmid=15850005 |year=2005 |last1=Cotesta |first1=D |last2=Caliumi |first2=C |last3=Al\u00f2 |first3=P |last4=Petramala |first4=L |last5=Reale |first5=MG |last6=Masciangelo |first6=R |last7=Signore |first7=A |last8=Cianci |first8=R |last9=D'erasmo |first9=E |last10=Letizia |first10=C |title=High plasma levels of human chromogranin A and adrenomedullin in patients with pheochromocytoma |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=53\u20138 |journal=Tumori|display-authors=8 |doi=10.1177/030089160509100110 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Adrenal pheochromocytoma (1) histopathology.jpg|[[Micrograph]] of pheochromocytoma.\nFile:Adrenal pheochromocytoma (2) histopathology.jpg|Micrograph of pheochromocytoma.\nFile:Adrenal pheochromocytoma (3) histopathology.jpg|Micrograph of pheochromocytoma.\nFile:Bilateral pheo MEN2.jpg|Bilateral pheochromocytoma in [[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2|MEN2]].\nFile:Pheochromocytoma.jpg|Pheochromocytoma.

In children, a quarter of tumors are bilateral, and an additional quarter are extra-adrenal. Solitary lesions inexplicably favor the right side. Although pheochromocytomas may grow to large size (>3&nbsp;kg), most weigh <100&nbsp;g and are <10&nbsp;cm in diameter. Pheochromocytomas are highly vascular.\n\nThe tumors are made up of large, polyhedral, pleomorphic chromaffin cells. Fewer than 10% of these tumors are malignant. As with several other endocrine tumors, malignancy cannot be determined from the histologic appearance; tumors that contain large number of aneuploid or tetraploid cells, as determined by [[flow cytometry]], are more likely to recur. Local invasion of surrounding tissues or distant [[metastases]] indicate malignancy.\n\n'''Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas:'''\nExtra-adrenal pheochromocytomas usually weigh 20 to 40&nbsp;g and are <5&nbsp;cm in diameter. Most are located within the abdomen in association with the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric ganglia and the [[organ of Zuckerkandl]].

In addition to the surgical expertise that such centers can provide, they will also have the necessary endocrine and anesthesia resources. It may also be necessary to carry out adrenalectomy, a complete surgical removal of the affected adrenal gland(s).\n\nEither surgical option requires prior treatment with the non-specific and irreversible alpha adrenoceptor blocker [[phenoxybenzamine]] or a short acting alpha antagonist (e.g. [[prazosin]], [[terazosin]], or [[doxazosin]]).<ref name=\"pmid17989126\">{{cite journal |pages=4069\u201379 |title=Preoperative management of the pheochromocytoma patient. |year=2007 |last1=Pacack |first1=K. |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=92 |issue=11 |pmid=17989126 |doi=10.1210/jc.2007-1720}}</ref> Doing so permits the surgery to proceed while minimizing the likelihood of severe intraoperative hypertension (as might occur when the tumor is manipulated). Some authorities would recommend that a combined alpha/beta blocker such as [[labetalol]] also be given in order to slow the heart rate. Regardless, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker such as [[propranolol]] must never be used, without adequate alpha blockade, in the presence of a pheochromocytoma. The mechanism for \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker-associated adverse events is generally ascribed to inhibition of \u03b22-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, leaving \u03b11-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses to catecholamines unopposed and, thus, severe and potentially refractory hypertension. However some clinical guidelines permit beta-1 blockade use together with alpha blockers during surgery for control of tachycardia.\n\nThe patient with pheochromocytoma is invariably volume depleted. In other words, the chronically elevated [[adrenergic]] state characteristic of an untreated pheochromocytoma leads to near-total inhibition of [[renin]]-[[angiotensin]] activity, resulting in excessive fluid loss in the urine and thus reduced blood volume. Hence, once the pheochromocytoma has been resected, thereby removing the major source of circulating [[catecholamines]], a situation arises where there is both very low sympathetic activity and volume depletion. This can result in profound [[hypotension]]. Therefore, it is usually advised to \"salt load\" pheochromocytoma patients before their surgery. This may consist of simple interventions such as consumption of high salt food pre-operatively, direct salt replacement or through the administration of intravenous saline solution.\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThere is increased life-time risk of secondary cancers ([[relative risk]] 3.63), with a slightly increased mortality risk (1.21) according to a 2004 Swedish study of 481 patients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Khorram-Manesh|first=A.|last2=Ahlman|first2=H.|last3=Nilsson|first3=O.|last4=Od\u00e9n|first4=A.|last5=Jansson|first5=S.|title=Mortality associated with pheochromocytoma in a large Swedish cohort|journal=European Journal of Surgical Oncology|volume=30|issue=5|pages=556\u2013559|doi=10.1016/j.ejso.2004.03.006|pmid=15135486|df=|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nPheochromocytoma is seen in between two and eight in 1,000,000, with approximately 1000 cases diagnosed in United States yearly.

Further, stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors leads to glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and thus elevation of blood glucose levels).\n\nA pheochromocytoma can also cause resistant [[arterial hypertension]]. A pheochromocytoma can be fatal if it causes a [[hypertensive emergency]], that is, severely high blood pressure that impairs one or more organ systems (formerly called \"malignant hypertension\"). This hypertension is not well controlled with standard blood pressure medications.\n\nTumors may grow large, but most are smaller than {{convert|10|cm|0}}.\n\nPheochromocytoma crisis is a rare and potentially lifethreatening emergency. It can occur spontaneously or be precipitated by administration of pharmacological agents, tumor manipulation, micturition (urinary bladder pheochromocytoma), or foods that aggravate release of catecholamines by the tumor.<ref>doi: 10.4158/EP10388.CR.{{PMID|21324811}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\nThe massive release of catecholamines in pheochromocytoma can cause damage to heart cells.<ref name=Goldman_327>{{Harvnb|Goldman|2011|pp=327}}</ref> This damage may be due to either compromising the coronary microcirculation or by direct toxic effects on the heart cells.<ref name=Goldman_327 />\n\nA common clinical presentation of pheochromocytoma includes hypertension, due to increased total peripheral resistance. Most pheochromocytomas secrete norepinephrine, which is a vasoconstrictor via \u03b1-adrenergic receptor stimulation, however research has yet to significantly correlate the increase in peripheral resistance with increased circulating norepinephrine. Theories behind the inability to correlate the two variables include simultaneous dopamine release, which has the opposing effect of norepinephrine in terms of vasodilation. Other mechanisms propose the down-regulation of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors or the release of other hormones that have opposing effects to norepinephrine. Due to increased catecholamine production, cardiovascular complications upon presentation and throughout the course of the disease are common. Complications that arise from these cardiovascular disturbances include blood pressure changes as well as possible sudden death, heart attack despite no prior history, noncardiogenic pulmonary shock/edema, and arrhythmias.\n\nPheochromocytoma is also capable of causing, at presentation, pseudo-obstruction of bowels, diabetic ketoacidosis, or multisystem crisis involving lactic acidosis. These symptoms may be in part due to the co-secretion of other hormones associated with norepinephrine, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropin, and interleukin six.\n\nPheochromocytoma may go undiagnosed or undetected for multiple reasons. The main reason is the fact that the tumors are rare. Hypertension may not clinically present itself right away due to the fact that catecholamines can convert into their biologically inactive forms in the tumor, suppressing symptoms. Lastly, the symptoms of the disease are non-specific and common to stress neuronal release of catecholamines. Lag in diagnosis averages about three years. Presymptomatic diagnosis is most possible in patients with germ-line inheritance.\n\n==Cause==\nThe hereditary implications of pheochromocytoma are still being investigated, however, genes have been identified as genomic biomarkers to aid in the identification of inherited disease. [1] Of these genes studied, the most well-known include VHL, RET, and [[neurofibromin 1|NF1]] of [[neurofibromatosis type I]]. Aberrations of these genes are associated with bilateral disease.\n\nThe RET protein is a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays an integral role in development of sympathetic neurons [2]. Mutations in the gene via germ-line (MEN-2) or somatic acquisition activate multiple signaling pathways involved in PCC, as well as other neuroendocrine tumors in humans. [[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2|MEN-2]] generally results from a gain-of-function variant of this RET gene, and MEN-2 is commonly associated with pheochromocytoma and amyloid producing medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n\nMutations in two subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase gene, SDHB and SDHD, have been strongly associated with cancer presenting at a younger age as well as extra-adrenal location, multiple tumors/metastasis, and poor prognosis.\n\nPheochromocytoma linked to MEN II can be caused by [[RET oncogene]] mutations. Both syndromes are characterized by pheochromocytoma as well as [[thyroid cancer]] (thyroid medullary carcinoma). MEN IIA also presents with hyperparathyroidism, while MEN IIB also presents with mucosal neuroma.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Adrenal pheochromocytoma (3) histopathology.jpg|thumb|150px|Histopathology of adrenal pheochromocytoma.

Front and back views also show [[radioiodine]] collection in thyroid (neck) and bladder (pelvis)]]\n[[File:Pheochromocytoma 2 0001.jpg|thumb|pheochromocytoma on ultrasound]]\n\nThe diagnosis can be established by measuring [[catecholamine]]s and [[metanephrine]]s in plasma (blood) or through a 24-hour urine collection. Care should be taken to rule out other causes of adrenergic (adrenaline-like) excess like hypoglycemia, stress, exercise, and drugs affecting the catecholamines like [[stimulant]]s, [[methyldopa]], [[dopamine]] [[agonist]]s, or ganglion blocking [[antihypertensive]]s. Various foodstuffs (e.g. coffee, tea, bananas, chocolate, cocoa, citrus fruits, and vanilla) can also affect the levels of urinary [[metanephrine]] and VMA ([[vanillylmandelic acid]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=117&pid=1&gid=003613 |title=Catecholamines \u2013 urine \u2013 Penn State Hershey Medical Center |publisher=Pennstatehershey.adam.com |date=2011-01-06 |accessdate=2013-02-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203023424/http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=117&pid=1&gid=003613 |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}</ref>\n\nImaging by [[computed tomography]] or a [[Spin-spin relaxation time|T2]] weighted [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] of the [[head]], [[neck]], and [[chest]], and [[abdomen]] can help localize the tumor.

[[Von Hippel Lindau]] patients may also develop these tumors.<ref name=Goldman_185>{{Harvnb|Goldman|2011|pp=185}}</ref>\n\nPatients experiencing symptoms associated with pheochromocytoma should be aware that it is rare. However, it often goes undiagnosed until autopsy; therefore patients might wisely choose to take steps to provide a physician with important clues, such as recording whether blood pressure changes significantly during episodes of apparent anxiety.\n\n===Testing===\nTesting prior to tumor excision helps ascertain whether the tumor is a singular tumor or if there are multiple, if it is ectopic or adrenal originating, malignant or benign, and isolated or present with other tumors in context of inherited disease. CT is the most commonly used imaging technique, however MRI is preferred. [[Iobenguane|MIBG]] scanning should be used when possible, as it is the most accurate way to locate cancer in catecholamine producing cancers, as catecholamine plasma membrane and vesicular transport systems are especially abundant in pheochromocytoma cells. Imaging using MIBG would yield specific and sensitive results compared to CT and MRI, as the latter two are non-specific generalized imaging techniques\n[[File:Adrenaline.svg|thumb|150px|[[Epinephrine]]]]\n[[File:Noradrenaline2.svg|thumb|150px|[[Norepinephrine]]]]\n*'''[[Blood test]]s''': Buters and others have suggested that analysis of free metanephrines ([[metadrenaline]]s) (normetanephrine and metanephrine) in blood plasma is the most accurate test for detecting pheochromocytoma.\n*'''[[Urinalysis|Urine tests]]''': Although this test is slightly less effective than plasma testing it is still considered highly effective in diagnosis. Usually the metabolites of [[norepinephrine]] and [[epinephrine]], [[normetanephrine]] (NMN) and [[metanephrine]] (MN), are found in relatively small amounts in normal humans. The increased excretion of these metabolites is indicative of the disease, but does not completely rule out other diseases which may cause the same excretion values.\n*'''Other Tests''':\n:*One diagnostic test used in the past for a pheochromocytoma is to administer [[clonidine]], a centrally-acting alpha-2 agonist used to treat high blood pressure. Clonidine mimics catecholamines in the brain, causing it to reduce the activity of the sympathetic nerves controlling the adrenal medulla. A healthy adrenal medulla will respond to the [[Clonidine#Clonidine suppression test|clonidine suppression test]] by reducing catecholamine production; the lack of a response is evidence of pheochromocytoma.\n\n:*[[Chromogranin A]] is elevated in case of pheochromocytoma.<ref name=\"pmid15850005\">{{cite journal |pmid=15850005 |year=2005 |last1=Cotesta |first1=D |last2=Caliumi |first2=C |last3=Al\u00f2 |first3=P |last4=Petramala |first4=L |last5=Reale |first5=MG |last6=Masciangelo |first6=R |last7=Signore |first7=A |last8=Cianci |first8=R |last9=D'erasmo |first9=E |last10=Letizia |first10=C |title=High plasma levels of human chromogranin A and adrenomedullin in patients with pheochromocytoma |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=53\u20138 |journal=Tumori|display-authors=8 |doi=10.1177/030089160509100110 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Adrenal pheochromocytoma (1) histopathology.jpg|[[Micrograph]] of pheochromocytoma.\nFile:Adrenal pheochromocytoma (2) histopathology.jpg|Micrograph of pheochromocytoma.\nFile:Adrenal pheochromocytoma (3) histopathology.jpg|Micrograph of pheochromocytoma.\nFile:Bilateral pheo MEN2.jpg|Bilateral pheochromocytoma in [[Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2|MEN2]].\nFile:Pheochromocytoma.jpg|Pheochromocytoma.

In children, a quarter of tumors are bilateral, and an additional quarter are extra-adrenal. Solitary lesions inexplicably favor the right side. Although pheochromocytomas may grow to large size (>3&nbsp;kg), most weigh <100&nbsp;g and are <10&nbsp;cm in diameter. Pheochromocytomas are highly vascular.\n\nThe tumors are made up of large, polyhedral, pleomorphic chromaffin cells. Fewer than 10% of these tumors are malignant. As with several other endocrine tumors, malignancy cannot be determined from the histologic appearance; tumors that contain large number of aneuploid or tetraploid cells, as determined by [[flow cytometry]], are more likely to recur. Local invasion of surrounding tissues or distant [[metastases]] indicate malignancy.\n\n'''Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas:'''\nExtra-adrenal pheochromocytomas usually weigh 20 to 40&nbsp;g and are <5&nbsp;cm in diameter. Most are located within the abdomen in association with the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric ganglia and the [[organ of Zuckerkandl]]. Approximately 10% are in the thorax, 1% are within the urinary bladder, and less than 3% are in the neck, usually in association with the sympathetic ganglia or the extracranial branches of the ninth cranial nerves.\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\nThe [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]] of pheochromocytoma include:\n*[[Anxiety disorder]]s, including [[Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]]\n*[[Paraganglioma]]s\n*[[Von Hippel\u2013Lindau Disease]]\n*[[Essential hypertension]]\n*[[Hyperthyroidism]]\n*[[Insulinoma]]\n*[[Mercury poisoning]]\n*[[Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia]]\n*[[Renovascular hypertension]]\n*[[Carcinoid]]<ref>{{cite book |first1=A.

In addition to the surgical expertise that such centers can provide, they will also have the necessary endocrine and anesthesia resources. It may also be necessary to carry out adrenalectomy, a complete surgical removal of the affected adrenal gland(s).\n\nEither surgical option requires prior treatment with the non-specific and irreversible alpha adrenoceptor blocker [[phenoxybenzamine]] or a short acting alpha antagonist (e.g. [[prazosin]], [[terazosin]], or [[doxazosin]]).<ref name=\"pmid17989126\">{{cite journal |pages=4069\u201379 |title=Preoperative management of the pheochromocytoma patient. |year=2007 |last1=Pacack |first1=K. |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=92 |issue=11 |pmid=17989126 |doi=10.1210/jc.2007-1720}}</ref> Doing so permits the surgery to proceed while minimizing the likelihood of severe intraoperative hypertension (as might occur when the tumor is manipulated). Some authorities would recommend that a combined alpha/beta blocker such as [[labetalol]] also be given in order to slow the heart rate. Regardless, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker such as [[propranolol]] must never be used, without adequate alpha blockade, in the presence of a pheochromocytoma. The mechanism for \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker-associated adverse events is generally ascribed to inhibition of \u03b22-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, leaving \u03b11-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses to catecholamines unopposed and, thus, severe and potentially refractory hypertension. However some clinical guidelines permit beta-1 blockade use together with alpha blockers during surgery for control of tachycardia.\n\nThe patient with pheochromocytoma is invariably volume depleted. In other words, the chronically elevated [[adrenergic]] state characteristic of an untreated pheochromocytoma leads to near-total inhibition of [[renin]]-[[angiotensin]] activity, resulting in excessive fluid loss in the urine and thus reduced blood volume. Hence, once the pheochromocytoma has been resected, thereby removing the major source of circulating [[catecholamines]], a situation arises where there is both very low sympathetic activity and volume depletion. This can result in profound [[hypotension]]. Therefore, it is usually advised to \"salt load\" pheochromocytoma patients before their surgery. This may consist of simple interventions such as consumption of high salt food pre-operatively, direct salt replacement or through the administration of intravenous saline solution.\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThere is increased life-time risk of secondary cancers ([[relative risk]] 3.63), with a slightly increased mortality risk (1.21) according to a 2004 Swedish study of 481 patients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Khorram-Manesh|first=A.|last2=Ahlman|first2=H.|last3=Nilsson|first3=O.|last4=Od\u00e9n|first4=A.|last5=Jansson|first5=S.|title=Mortality associated with pheochromocytoma in a large Swedish cohort|journal=European Journal of Surgical Oncology|volume=30|issue=5|pages=556\u2013559|doi=10.1016/j.ejso.2004.03.006|pmid=15135486|df=|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nPheochromocytoma is seen in between two and eight in 1,000,000, with approximately 1000 cases diagnosed in United States yearly.

He once had a corporeal human form, but now appears as a floating head in an energy tube.\n\nHe is initially voiced and portrayed by [[David Fielding (voice actor)|David Fielding]], and later voiced by [[Robert L.

Bulk, the leader of the duo, was prone to dragging Skull into wacky schemes, which usually failed miserably and ended in humiliation or injury.\n\nIn the second season, the two decide to discover the identities of the Power Rangers after they were saved by the Rangers in \"The Mutiny\".\n\nIn the third season, they enroll in the Junior Police Force.

She also married Lord Zedd. She is a [[Witchcraft|witch]] who is the daughter of the first demonic overlord of the M51 Galaxy, Master Vile. Her brother Rito is a bumbler, and completely incompetent. She also had a child with Zedd named [[Thrax (Power Rangers)|Thrax]], who was sealed away at some point between 1998 and 2007, who would have only been at most two years old when his parents were turned back into non-powered humanoid aliens. This could easily be perceived as them being killed, since the people they were died when Zordon did, and the people they were before that are put in their place, whilst her father, and her brother were not so lucky for unspecified reasons.\n\nIn ''[[Power Rangers Turbo]]'' (1997) Divatox contacts Rita for advice on how to defeat the Power Rangers, but Rita retorts that if she had known how to do that she would not be in her current predicament, and she holds the phone up to Lord Zedd's face, who is heavily snoring in his sleep. In ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', however, their relationship has become more hostile as seen their catty immature behaviour, before and after Dark Spectre turns up to the meeting, they act like teenagers as they fight for Dark Spectre's attention only to both get snubbed in favour of his disciple Astronema.\n\nRita Repulsa was played by [[Machiko Soga]] in ''Zyuranger'' footage, played by Carla Perez in U.S. footage, and played by Sydney native Julia Cortez in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' (1995). All her ''Power Rangers'' appearances are voiced by [[Barbara Goodson]], who overdubs the actresses' lip movements with the unmistakable screechy voice that is among Rita's trademark characteristics.\n\n===Goldar===\n{{About|the [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]] villain|the giant robot from \"The Space Giants\"|Ambassador Magma|section=yes}}\n'''Goldar''' is a [[manticore]]-themed [[knight]] who serves as Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd's right-hand man. In season one, he is a considerably more competent fighter, who is shown fighting alongside [[Scorpina]], whom his Sentai Counterpart was married to, since it's implied but not really developed upon at any point, unlike the Grifforizer/Lami relationship in Zyuranger. From season 2 onwards, he's a considerably less capable fighter, gradually transitioning to comic relief, since the stunt double in the suit for original footage clearly was unable/ not allowed to show how maneuverable the character was, from season 3 onwards he's frequently seen working with a villain with far more credible threat in the Sentai series season 3 is based on, otherwise known as Rito Revolto. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' describes him as a \"big freak with wings\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1BJTsbRdMEC&pg=PA80|title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|date=June 1995|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|page=80 |url-status=live |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref> Goldar frequently does battle with the megazord, during the first season, if the episode's monster or device had already been dispatched by the Rangers. Scorpina (and later, Rito through the usage of stock footage, and careful editing,) would aid Goldar in these Megazord battles. Sometimes one or more of them would aid the monster in battle. Unlike the villains of the week, they and\u00a0 Goldar understood the value of discretion, since being cautious is better than being reckless, which is to say he would retreat\u00a0 whenever the Rangers prepared their final attack at one point barely escaping with his life, (although it is debatable whether it would have even defeated Goldar given his survival of the Thunder Megazord slash). Goldar's role draws parallels as the first born, acting like an older brother to Squatt, and Baboo.\n\nGoldar leads Rita Repulsa's first attack on the Earth. However, he soon faces the Power Rangers and is beaten by their Megazord after an intense fight. He also becomes notable for telling Rita what to do frequently, and always promises that they will get revenge for their schemes' failures. He also has been called a \"bumbling fool\" by Rita in \"A Star is Born\", and is scolded vehemently by Rita in \"Happy Birthday, Zack\", being called a \"worthless misfit\" and a \"dweeb\". This pattern also happens when [[Lord Zedd]] is introduced as well; in addition to insulting the now apparently incompetent golden warrior, he often blames Goldar for his ''own'' failures, and has a habit of silencing him (and Squatt and Baboo) frequently. Ever since then, Goldar fights the Rangers and their Zords, growing a strong hatred for [[Jason Lee Scott|Jason]] and [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]], the Red and Green Rangers, for their continual victories in single combat. Goldar also has a [[Zord]] of his own known as Cyclopsis, an ancient war machine, but this Zord is defeated by the Rangers' Ultrazord after a prolonged battle. He is also involved in one of [[Bulk and Skull]]'s more memorable encounters with a monster, in which Goldar (giant sized) picks up a bus with the two inside.\n\nWhen [[Lord Zedd]] arrives on the Moon, Goldar eagerly abandons Rita for Zedd, regaining his wings in the process. As Zedd's right-hand man, Goldar leads many missions for him, encountering Tommy (now the White Ranger) again and again. Each time they fight, the White Ranger bests him, sending Goldar back to Zedd in disgrace. When Rita returns to the moon and marries Zedd, Goldar is aghast and quite suspicious of his master's supposed return of feeling for Rita. When he finally discovers it is a sham (thanks in some part to Rito's loose lips), he immediately sets out to make things right and has [[#Finster|Finster]] create an antidote for the love spell that Rita used. Unfortunately for Goldar, it is revealed that Zedd has come to love Rita on his own, potion or not. Even after Rita drops her secret plans of usurping Zedd, Goldar still has a massive dislike for her. Often paired with [[Rito Revolto]], Goldar is disgusted by the skeleton's stupidity (and stench), though the two eventually formed a friendship. Goldar is also essential in Lord Zedd's powering of the [[Shogun Zords]], as he soundly defeats [[Ninjor (Power Rangers)|Ninjor]], allowing Zedd to capture and use him as a power source for the Shogunzords.\n\nIn ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]'', Goldar and Rito plant a bomb outside of the Command Center, but it is defused by [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]]. Goldar also played a role in the destruction of the power coins. Later, Goldar and Rito are sent to the Command Center, having been given a map of the Command Center's basement, and attempt to destroy the Command Center with an implosion device. The bomb goes off, destroying the Command Center. Just before the implosion device goes off, Goldar steals the Zeo Crystal with the help of Rito. In ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'', the Rangers discover the Zeo Crystal in the ruins of the Command Center, surmising that Rito and Goldar must have dropped it. Rito and Goldar also lose their memories (and in Goldar's case, his wings), and end up wandering around [[Angel Grove]]. A possible explanation is that the blast caught them in mid-teleportation and caused their amnesia. They eventually find Bulk and Skull, and end up becoming their butlers in exchange for food and shelter. Zedd and Rita eventually find them and restore their memories (and Goldar's wings). They return to their employers and help them in their quest to destroy the [[Machine Empire]]. Goldar's final appearance is in the final episode of ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes|Countdown to Destruction]]\". Unlike Rito, Goldar goes with Zedd and Rita to the Cimmerian Planet for [[Dark Specter]]'s conference, where he is responsible for revealing [[Andros (Power Rangers)|Andros]]' identity as a Power Ranger by removing his cloak. He is later present in their invasion of the Vica Galaxy, helping to subdue the [[Trey of Triforia|Gold Ranger]]. It is not shown what happens to Goldar following [[Zordon]]'s destruction as the subsequent energy wave either destroys or purifies the other villains ending his and other villains' reign of terror.\n\nIn the alternate continuity of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'', Goldar serves Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, but when Ivan Ooze shows up, Mordant and he switches sides almost automatically after Ooze traps both Rita and Zedd in a snowglobe, depriving them of their powers. He thinks Kimberly is cute, and when the time comes, he flies away as Ivan takes Angel Grove Tower out of the Ground. In this film, he is portrayed as a bumbling sidekick, very similar to Squatt in the main series. At the very end following Ivan Ooze's destruction, Goldar had taken over the palace and calls himself King Goldar. Soon a furious Rita and Lord Zedd shows up to punish both him and Mordant.\n\nIn both the series and the film, he is voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]]. In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'', his suit actor is [[Kerry Casey]]. In the video game ''Power Rangers: Super Legends'', he is voiced by [[Nolan North]].\n\nGoldar appears as a secondary antagonist in the [[Power Rangers (film)|2017 movie reboot]] with his vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He appears as a giant [[gargoyle]]-like monster made purely out of gold.<ref name=\"NYCC\">{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/10/08/nycc-goldar-confirmed-for-power-rangers-movie/|title=NYCC: Goldar Confirmed for Power Rangers Movie|publisher=ComicBook.com|last=Awesome|first=Amy|date=8 October 2016}}</ref> Goldar serves as the monster Rita creates, stealing gold from jewelry stores and even dental implants to manifest the monster. As Rita orders Goldar to retrieve the Zeo Crystal from underneath the local [[Krispy Kreme]] shop, the Rangers confront him with their zords for the first time, which culminates in them assembling the Megazord. Rita attempts to counter them by merging herself with Goldar directly, but the Rangers are still able to destroy the monster.\n\nA villain that almost resembles Goldar is set to appear along with Snide in [[Power Rangers Beast Morphers|Power Rangers Beast Morphers season 2]].\n\n===Squatt and Baboo===\n'''Squatt''' is a servant of [[Lord Zedd]] and [[Rita Repulsa]], the dimwitted sidekick of Baboo. Squatt is a short, blue-skinned [[hobgoblin]]-like creature with a large horn. He wears metal armor and is said to be a mix between a [[blueberry]] and a [[warthog]]. Squatt is rather excitable, and may act like an eager child when Rita has a plan or when the Rangers are having trouble in a battle. Squatt is easily frightened by his bosses' bad tempers. He is a coward, and rather than fight, he and Baboo often accompany [[Goldar]], [[Scorpina]], and monsters as they attack the Earth, cheering them on. However, he often goes to Earth when there is no fight going on, because his main duties are acting as a spy and saboteur, as shown in episodes like \"Switching Places\", \"Foul Play in the Sky\", \"Calamity Kimberly\", and \"Rita's Seed of Evil\". Squatt's birthplace is given as Myrgo, Venus.\n\n'''Baboo''' is the more intelligent of a dimwitted duo consisting of him and Squatt. He is a tall, slim, black [[vampire]] that resembles a cross between a monkey and a [[vampire bat]] with crippled wings. Like Finster, he mainly works behind the lines. Though spineless and scatterbrained, he is highly creative. He serves as [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]]'s [[alchemy|alchemist]] and [[potion]] maker, creating substances and devices for her to use. Notable creations include a time device, a punk potion, the monster Shellshock, and the Nasty Knight's sword. Baboo is rarely confident in his mistress' plans, but would never say this to her face. Like Squatt, he is somewhat cowardly, often going to Earth to scheme or cheer on [[Goldar]] and/or [[Scorpina]] in battle rather than taking part in a fight himself. Both Squatt and Baboo have a relationship with Scorpina reminiscent of a mean older sister bullying her younger brothers. Baboo had a great fear of Scorpina saying he remembered the terrible things she did. He asks Rita to keep her stinger away from him; Squatt recalls that Scorpina stung Baboo on the head and he complained for a week. Baboo's birthplace was given as the Planet of the Pongies.\n\nWhen Lord Zedd took over as the main villain in the second season, Squatt and Baboo's roles were greatly reduced. Though still living in the palace, they mainly watch events in the throne room from behind a wall and offer occasional comments. Both participate in Zedd and Rita's wedding. They were later put back to work as saboteurs after Rita's return. In the third season, they are pure comic relief and occasionally are paired with Rito Revolto in schemes Rita involves them in.\n\nSquatt and Baboo disappear during the ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'' series, when fleeing from the [[Machine Empire]] with their masters. Squatt was seen in \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes|Countdown to Destruction]]\". However, Squatt was never actually seen reduced to sand or purified by Zordon's wave. It can be assumed that Baboo met the same fate as Squatt.\n\nSquatt was voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] and his suit actor is [[Minoru Watanabe]]. Baboo was voiced by [[Dave Mallow|Colin Philips]] and his suit actor was portrayed by Hideaki Kusaka (uncredited in season 1) Steve Andreno in Seasons 1\u20133 and later by Jason Ybarra in Seasons 3-Zeo.\n\n===Finster===\n'''Finster''' is a shy henchman of Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, though mostly the former. He resembles an anthropomorphic white [[Scottish Terrier]]. Finster's birthplace was given as the distant planet Claydoious.\n\nDuring the first season of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'', he is primarily responsible for creating a new monster to battle the Power Rangers in each episode, as well as producing a regular supply of Putty Patrollers, although this function falls to Lord Zedd after his appearance. Finster does this by sculpting the monsters out of clay and \"cooking\" them in a special oven/kiln/machine called the Monstermatic in his workshop. Not only is he skilled at supplying monsters and henchmen for his leaders, he is also shown to be a skilled alchemist and potion maker (similar to Baboo) and [[Invention|inventor]] supplying many kinds of potions and gadgets. He is also extremely brilliant and somewhat all-knowing, as he is also able to provide wisdom for Rita and Zedd. Near the end of the episode \"Crystal of Nightmares\", it is implied by Goldar that Finster thought using the Crystal is a good idea, while Goldar denies it (calling him an \"overgrown rat\" in the process). He is the one responsible for making the suggestion that [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]] be used in \"delivering the message of evil\", as [[Rita Repulsa]] had called it, in \"The Wedding\".\n\nWhen Lord Zedd takes over as the main villain in Season 2, Finster is suddenly made obsolete. Zedd makes his own monsters, though after Pirantishead (Zedd's first monster) is destroyed, Finster comments that he could have done better with the monsters he could have created for Zedd. Finster laments his current status among the villains, missing the time when Rita was in charge. When Rita returns from her exile, Finster helps her return to power \u2013 restoring her size, making her look younger and creating a love potion to get Zedd to marry her so she can manipulate him before destroying him as revenge for casting her away in space. He quickly noticed the love potion he created had some side effects, when Rita had a hard time trying to manipulate Zedd as he devoted his time with her (as well as Rita inadvertently falling in love with Zedd as well).\n\nIn the third season and the ''Mighty Morphin' Alien Rangers'' mini-series, Finster returns to making monsters. His love potion is first accidentally revealed to [[Rito Revolto|Rito]] and eventually Goldar learns the truth. He forces Finster to make the antidote for Zedd. Though the antidote worked, he is just as surprised as anyone to find, though, that Zedd actually did love Rita.\n\nAt the start of the [[Power Rangers Zeo|Zeo]] season, Finster joins Zedd and Rita in fleeing the oncoming forces of the [[Machine Empire]]. He later returns with his masters and builds several machines for them. In \"Rangers of Two Worlds, Part 1\", Finster makes a new Staff for Rita which is absurdly more powerful than the previous one, as it creates a monster that is too strong even for the Zeo Ultrazord. He also builds a bomb for Zedd's plan against the Machine Empire's leaders and Zedd successfully defeats them with it, proving to the machines that Zedd's party is their equal.\n\nFinster is either reduced to sand or turned into a human, like several other villains were by [[Zordon]]'s energy wave in ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]''{{'}}s two-part final episode \"Countdown to Destruction\".\n\nWhile working for Rita and Zedd, Finster is never really an evil character, but rather an artist. He at one point even says, \"sometimes it's no fun being a bad guy\".\n\nFinster is voiced by [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]].\n\n===Scorpina===\n'''Scorpina''' is a human-[[scorpion]] hybrid and is one of [[Rita Repulsa]]'s most ruthless and dangerous minions aside from Goldar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/scorpina-power-rangers-villain-explained/ |title=Scorpina: Why Did the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Villain Disappear? |publisher=Cbr.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref> Though the Scorpina/Goldar relationship in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' is significantly less developed than the Grifforzer/Lamie relationship of its Japanese counterpart, Goldar and Scorpina have shown affection toward each other where Goldar is shown to be protective of her. She has a human form (a beautiful [[Asian people|Asian]] woman with long black hair wearing a somewhat tight golden scorpion armor), but has a hideous scorpion monster form when Rita makes her gigantic. Like Goldar, she often engages in giant battles with the Zords if the monster or device was already destroyed by the small rangers.\n\nVery little is actually known about Scorpina. Her first appearance was in the \"Green with Evil\" story arc. She is an old friend of Rita Repulsa. Both Squatt and Baboo have a relationship with Scorpina reminiscent of a mean older sister bullying her younger brothers. Baboo had a great fear of Scorpina saying he remembered the terrible things she did. He asks Rita to keep her stinger away from him; Squatt recalls that Scorpina stung Baboo on the head and he complained for a week. Much like Goldar, she would often square off against [[Jason Lee Scott|Jason]] when sent to battle the Rangers and overpowered them with relative ease. Scorpina has a boomerang-like sword she used to attack the Rangers with. When in giant form, she loses any human appearance and often fights alongside Goldar. Scorpina once used her pet [[Bombyx mori|silkworm]] to fight the Power Rangers. Her personality is very cold and calculating compared to most season one villains, although she has moments of being less serious than Goldar, but despite that is seen almost always smiling (at least in her human form), even in battle. She also created a monster called the Rockstar.\n\nIn \"The Mutiny, Part 1\" at the start of the second season, Scorpina is seen among Rita's group. When [[Lord Zedd]] arrives and causes the palace to shake, Scorpina is seen going to help Rita who has just fallen to the ground. She then disappears after Zedd punished Rita for her failure by shrinking her and casting her away in a space dumpster. Though Scorpina's disappearance was unexplained, it was presumed she didn't want to work for Lord Zedd after what he did to Rita and kept her distance. She later resurfaces in \"Goldar's Vice Versa\" as a favor for Goldar. Scorpina has one chance to defeat the Rangers by Lord Zedd. To accomplish this, she poses as a human girl named Sabrina to try to ensnare Adam Park and turn him against his friends. This failed and Scorpina found a rivalry in [[Aisha Campbell]], who suspected her from the start due to her rudeness with her and the other rangers. Revealing herself as Scorpina, she was forced to take both of them hostage, though the other Rangers arrived in time to save them. Unlike the last time, she squares off with Aisha, partially due to being foiled. She even grows to giant-size and battles the Thunder Megazord, with her and Goldar showing improved abilities all around (such as being unfazed by the Thunder Megazord finisher) but soon retreats after being overwhelmed by the new and improved Zords herself (particularly the Thunder Ultrazord).\n\nThis was her last appearance due to being unable to secure the actress for another appearance (which she was supposed to make in a three-parter called \"Zordon I Shrunk The Rangers\"). She was thus absent during the \"Countdown to Destruction\" finale of ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', in which the majority of the series' surviving villains were either purified into human form or reduced to dust. An early concept for the series that became ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm]]'' would have featured Scorpina and other absent villains returning and menacing Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/234583|title=Power Rangers Seasons We Never Saw|website=Den of Geek|access-date=14 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nScorpina was portrayed by [[Ami Kawai]] in ''Zyuranger'' footage and was voiced by [[Wendee Lee|Wendee Swan]]. The American actress who later portrayed her in \"Goldar's Vice-Versa\" was Sabrina Lu.\n\nScorpina was said to appear in the [[Power Rangers (film)|2017 film]] as the main antagonist, along with Goldar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/power-rangers-movie-villains-timeline-opening-scene-details/|title=Exclusive: \u2018Power Rangers\u2019 Movie Villains, Timeline, and Opening Scene Revealed|publisher=Collider|last=Trumbore|first=Dave|date=9 October 2015}}</ref> The concept was scrapped as Rita Repulsa ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) would be the film's antagonist. Elements of Scorpina's appearance in the show were incorporated into Rita's costume, such as her armor.\n\n===Lokar===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]] -->\nAppearing as a floating, demonic, ethereal, blue head, the powerful '''Lokar''' changes Mutitus to his more powerful form and assists in sending the Power Rangers to the Island of Illusions. He is an old friend of Rita's and she called on him for a favor to defeat the Rangers. After destroying Mutitus, the Power Rangers attack Lokar with the Ultrazord, but he manages to escape. Lokar is seen teleporting away just after the blast hits and Jason says, \"We'll get him next time\".\n\nLokar is later summoned again when Goldar goes into battle with his extremely powerful War Zord, Cyclopsis (\"Doomsday, Parts 1 & 2\"). Lokar, heavily scarred from the Ultrazord attack, recreates the War Zord when it falls to the Power Rangers' attack and then aids Cyclopsis in its next two battles against the Power Rangers, but disappears forever when Cyclopsis is destroyed by the Ultrazord. Early plans for the series that became ''Ninja Storm'' would have featured Lokar\u2014like Scorpina\u2014making a return appearance as a villain.\n\nLokar was portrayed by Masahiko Urano and voiced by [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]].\n\n===Lord Zedd===\nLord Zedd was the primary antagonist for the first 40 episodes of the second season and co-antagonist for the rest of season 2 and all of season 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/power-rangers-lord-zedd-venjinx-best-villain/ |title=Power Rangers: 5 Reasons Lord Zedd Is The Best Villain In The Franchise (& 5 Why It\u2019s Venjix) |publisher=Cbr.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref> When he first appeared in the second season of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', Zedd was quite furious with Rita's constant failures for being defeated by a bunch of children, even after she warned him about Zordon. Zedd has her punished by shrinking her and sealing her away in a space dumpster to travel for eternity. Despite his early defeats, Zedd's attack on Earth became progressively more violent and focused most of his attention on eliminating [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]], whom he saw as Rita's biggest mistake. He succeeded in eliminating the Green Ranger powers with the help of a Green Crystal that serves to drain Tommy's powers as well as serving to power up his own brand of evil rangers. After both the crystal and Turbanshell were destroyed, he finally succeeded in ridding the Green Ranger's powers.\n\nEventually, Zedd realizes the warning Rita had given him was true and he was having the same difficulties in defeating the Rangers like she had experienced. In retaliation, he brought forth his personal zord, a large serpentine named Serpenterra. Despite the large zord's advantage against the Thunder Zords, it had a serious flaw in using too much of its energy, which infuriated Zedd to no end. He attempts to find an infinite power source for Serpenterra to no avail. Soon it came time for Zedd's Centennial Energy Recharge and while he undergoes it, Rita makes a secret return for revenge against him. Upon awakening under the love potion, Zedd immediately fell in love with Rita much to her delight and proposed to her. However, the love potion did not work as Rita hoped; she planned to turn Zedd sycophantic to her under the potion, but somehow he remains in control and attempted to dominate over Rita as a commanding husband. He even wants Rita to produce heirs for him, much to her hysterical outrage and leading her to order Finster to work on an antidote. After their wedding, they often bickered with each other when failing to overcome one another but remained together. Zedd became less serious about defeating the Rangers and more focused on his life with Rita, while Rita remains determined to defeat them with Zedd's aid. In time, Rita was unknowingly falling in love with Zedd too, and accepts her status as his wife and co-leader to their minions.\n\nWith Zedd and Rita side by side, the Rangers' battles were more difficult. Zedd and Rita's schemes together included creating a clone of the evil Tommy and sending the Rangers back into the past. Zedd also had a rivalry against [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Villains|Count Dregon]]. When his wife's brother, [[Rito Revolto]], arrived on the moon (even with Tengas and a Vampirus as gifts) Lord Zedd was disgusted by the skeleton's stupidity, and would bellow with rage every time Rito called him \"Ed\". Rita's love potion was eventually removed from Zedd after Goldar used the antidote on him. However, to everyone's surprise, Zedd loved Rita on his own; his devotion to his wife was genuine from the start, and thus explaining why Rita had difficulty controlling him due to his love for her being based on [[free will]]; the antidote merely caused a momentary vertigo when used on him. During the Pink Ranger fiasco when Zedd had her held hostage to force the Rangers to use the Shogun Zords in his service, Lord Zedd battled Tommy personally to keep him from saving Kimberly from an alternate dimension. This marked the only time that Zedd had battled a Ranger personally, proving himself quite capable of holding his own, a trait passed down to his son in later years. Though Zedd easily gained the upper hand against the White Ranger, Tommy used Saba to shatter Zedd's Z-Staff, forcing him to retreat.\n\nWhen Master Vile arrived on the moon, Lord Zedd was pushed to the side as Vile took over in his search for the Zeo Crystal. He expressed disdain for his father-in-law, who constantly put him down. Once Vile left after his army was defeated by the [[Aquitian Rangers]], Zedd was ecstatic, and he resumed his attacks on Earth. The Rangers had been turned to children due to Vile's Orb of Doom and all that stood in Zedd's way were the [[Aquitian Rangers]]. Zedd managed to find a map of the Ranger's Command Center, pointing out a weak point. He sent Goldar and Rito in to plant a bomb and steal the Zeo Crystal before the Orb of Doom's magic was undone. Though unable to stop the rangers in undoing the damage Master Vile did, Zedd was able to destroy the Command Center. But before they could take advantage of it, the [[Machine Empire]] arrived and attacked. Zedd and Rita were forced to retreat, taking Serpentera to the M51 Galaxy where they would stay with Master Vile, to Zedd's dismay. They soon returned, however, in a motorhome, plotting to overthrow [[King Mondo]] and destroy the Empire. The two forces clashed on several occasions, neither gaining much ground. At one point, [[Prince Gasket]] had Tommy brainwashed and closed a dimensional portal to his arena to prevent the Rangers (Minus Jason, who was at the arena) from saving him, but Zedd had Finster help get the rangers to the arena to prevent a Machine victory. After a series of failed attempts, they finally managed to destroy the [[Royal House of Gadgetry]] with a bomb in the shape of a gift.\n\nZedd and Rita were mysteriously absent during the ''Power Rangers: Turbo'' Season, and fans have speculated that a \"gap\" between ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'' and ''[[Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie]]'' reveals what occurred after Rita and Zedd had regained control of the moon from The Machine Empire. Events in [[Forever Red]] suggest that Zedd at some point launched an attack on Earth with a significantly more powerful Serpentera, only to be defeated again by the Zeo Rangers. Disillusioned and convinced he would never defeat them, Zedd and Rita retreated for good. It was also hinted that somewhere between this, Rita had given birth to Thrax, forcing her and Zedd to remain in retirement.\n\nLord Zedd, along with Rita, makes a cameo appearance in'' Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'', when [[Divatox]] calls Rita for advice on how to deal with the Power Rangers; Rita asks Divatox if she would allow herself to be subjected to Zedd's snoring if she knew how to defeat the Rangers, advising the other villain to flee, rather than fight. After many successive failures, this was the best advice the villainess could get.\n\nA year later, Zedd and [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]] attended Dark Specter's conference on the Cimmerian Planet, Zedd toasting to Dark Specter's capture of Zordon and takeover of the universe, and unsuccessfully tried to attack Andros when he was caught spying. Months later, they invaded the Vica Galaxy and quickly conquered it, defeating and capturing the Gold Ranger in the process. When [[Zordon]]'s energy wave washed over them and their army, Zedd was spared, transformed into a human being.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/power-rangers-lord-zedd-secrets/ |title=Lord Zedd: 8 Unspeakable Secrets (And 7 Fan Theories That'll Leave Ya Shook) |publisher=Cbr.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref> His love for Rita seemed to remain and the two danced together in the remnants of their army, much to the confusion and relief of the Gold Ranger.\n\nHe was performed by Ed Neil in the TV series, Mark Ginther in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'', and voiced by [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]]. In the video game ''Power Rangers: Super Legends'', he is voiced by [[Steve Blum]].\n\n===Dark Rangers===\nThe '''Dark Rangers''' are the bad counterparts of the Powers Rangers. There are two versions of them:\n\n* The first Dark Rangers are a bunch of punks named Justin (portrayed by Patrick Wolf), Zane (portrayed by [[Ogie Banks]]), Bobby, Tina (portrayed by Jhoanna Trias), and Kristen who just enrolled at Angel Grove High School and first appeared to the Rangers after knocking around Bulk and Skull. Lord Zedd took interest in them. Before both groups can spar, they are teleported to Otherworld by Lord Zedd. Using a Green Crystal he filled, Lord Zedd transformed them into the Dark Rangers as the Rangers tried inform them what Lord Zedd would do with them to no avail. When the Green Ranger destroyed the Green Crystal, the punks were returned to Angel Grove in a normal state. They made amends with the Rangers.{{efn|According to stunt coordinator Jeff Pruitt, there were plans for a fight between the Rangers and the Dark Rangers. The idea was scrapped because the Dark Ranger suits were too low quality as the crew has imagined and the fact that they are repainted from some Z-Putty suits.}}\n* In the 1995 comic series, another version of the Dark Rangers was formed in the issue \"Dark Thunder.\" Lord Zedd harvested the energies of the old Dino Coins to create another version of the Dark Rangers who would control the rebuilt Thunderzords. Due to Angel Grove not having any worthy bad people, Lord Zedd had to find worthy people around the world. He gained a bully from Zimbanwe named Farai Jukwa as his Red Dark Ranger, a looter from Japan named Osama Tezuka as his Black Dark Ranger, an avaricious man from the United States named Stanford Winner as his Blue Dark Ranger, a gang member from Columbia named Nelida Valensis as his Yellow Dark Ranger, and a pickpocket from France named Marie Claire le Monde as his Pink Dark Ranger. Their Dark Ranger forms resemble the original morphed forms of the Rangers. Following the first fight, the Dark Rangers summoned the rebuilt Thunder Megazord to fight the Rangers in the Ninja Megazord as a rebuilt White Tigerzord appeared. When the Ninja Falconzord was being formed, the Dark Rangers and their Zords got away. Zordon commented that a Dark White Ranger would be impossible to create since the powers of the White Ranger can't be corrupted by evil.\n\n===Tom Oliver (clone)===\n'''Tom Oliver''' (portrayed by [[Jason David Frank]]) is an exact [[Cloning|clone]] of [[Tommy Oliver]] that was created and put under a spell by the Wizard of Deception to serve as an evil Green Ranger variant for [[Lord Zedd]] and [[Rita Repulsa]]. He is referred to as \"Tom\" to differentiate himself from [[Tommy Oliver]]. Tom wears a green [[kerchief|bandana]] with a ponytail behind his head. Being Tommy's perfect duplicate, Tom can easily deceive the Power Rangers to believe that Tommy has betrayed them to their enemies. He also has all of Tommy's tactics and training along with his former Green Ranger powers, allowing him to be able to anticipate most of his doppelg\u00e4nger's actions. Under the Wizard of Deception's powers, the Dragonzord's strength level is on par with the White Ranger's Tigerzord, but only because the White Ranger's power was temporarily weakened by the Wizard.\n\nIn a battle with some Putties, Tommy was knocked unconscious, and the Wizard cut a lock from his hair and turned him into an evil clone, imbued with the restored Green Ranger powers. The clone tricked the other Rangers into meeting him in an isolated spot, where the Wizard of Deception sent them back to [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] Angel Grove. He then confronted Tommy, who was suffering a headache, caused by some of his powers being used to recreate the Green Ranger. The two Rangers fought each other to a draw until the Wizard intervened, zapping Tommy with his wand, causing him to demorph and lie in a coma. The Green Ranger then went to the Command Center to threaten Zordon, and then unleashed the Dragonzord on Angel Grove.\n\nWhen Tommy was revived to full strength, he summoned his White Tigerzord to defend the city, but Dragonzord, energized by the Wizard's evil, soundly beat him. Tommy then stole the Wizard's wand, went back to rescue the other Rangers, and brought them back to summon the Thunder Megazord and deal with the Dragonzord. He then destroyed the Wizard, breaking the spell on the Green Ranger, whom he now called Tom.\n\nTom, much like Tommy was, was sick with remorse after being freed from the spell, but Tommy convinced him that he could still do good based on his own experience. Tom broke the spell on the Dragonzord and sent him back to the sea. The White and Green Rangers went back in time to colonial Angel Grove to destroy the Rat Monsters the Wizard had created to torture the other Rangers. Afterwards, despite Tommy's attempts to persuade Tom to join the Power Rangers, Tom decided to stay in colonial Angel Grove so he could make up for his past deeds, rejecting the restored Green Ranger powers, therefore Tom's power coin was removed from circulation, which makes the appearance of the Mighty Morphin\u2019 Green Ranger in Super Megaforce's legendary war confusing, since Tommy's head is overlaid with a white ranger helmet when he saves a kid left in a car hanging over the edge of a long fall, despite this Green Ranger still appears to help defeat the Armada even though we don't see the White Ranger.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Legendary Battle|episodelink=|series=Power Rangers Super Megaforce|serieslink=Power Rangers Megaforce|airdate=22 November 2014|season=21|number=20}}</ref>\n\n===Rito Revolto===\n'''Rito Revolto''' is a [[Gashadokuro]]/[[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] who was Rita Repulsa's younger brother, Master Vile's son with an unknown female humanoid and the secondary henchman for her and Lord Zedd in the third season, often partnered with Goldar and a few times with Baboo and Squatt(whom occasionally were [[The Three Stooges]] of the PR verse).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/uncensored-power-rangers-villains/ |title=Power Rangers Villains Who Snuck Past The Censors |publisher=CBR |date= |accessdate=27 February 2020}}</ref> He is famous for his introduction saga entitled Ninja Quest, where he destroyed the Thunderzords. He remained in Lord Zedd's palace afterwards and he constantly called Lord Zedd \"Ed\", which, along with Rito's stupidity, angered Zedd and causing him to yell at Rito to get his name right. Rito and Goldar placed an explosive device in the bowels of the Command Center and stole the completed Zeo Crystal before the device detonated, but they dropped their crystal on their escape.\n\nIn [[Power Rangers Zeo]], Rito and Goldar had lost their memories and were wandering around Angel Grove. They were taken in by Bulk and Skull as their butlers in exchange for food and shelter. They were later found by Zedd and Rita, who after confronting them for their failure in not procuring the Zeo Crystal, restored their memories and returned to the Moon. In Zedd and Rita's first attempt to overthrow the Machine Empire, they sent Rito and Goldar to Earth and instructed them to launch Louie Kaboom (a renegade robot) into space as their first attempt to avoid Queen Machina from tracing the robot back to them. Though Rito succeeded, he subsequently lost the remote to control Kaboom and this earned both him and Goldar their fury because it left them with no chance of controlling Kaboom. Rito is shown to be a [[back-seat driver|backseat driver]] and this got him in trouble with both Master Vile and Lord Zedd.\n\nThough he was not seen in \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes|Countdown to Destruction]]\", he was possibly reduced to sand by Zordon's Wave or he was purified since Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd were purified as well.\n\nRito Revolto was voiced by [[Bob Papenbrook]].{{efn|He was based on the character [[Gashadokuro]] who was the son of Master Vile's Japanese equivalent in ''Kakuranger''. Unlike Gashadokuro/Young Noble Junior, Rito is portrayed as moronic and bumbling.}}\n\n===Master Vile===\n'''Master Vile''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) was the father of [[Rita Repulsa]] and [[Rito Revolto]] and was based on the character Y\u014dkai Daima\u014d, the ultimate antagonist in ''[[Ninja Sentai Kakuranger|Kakuranger]]''. He was a tall [[demon]]-like being with large ear-like appendages and wore a dark cloak that had snakes seen emerging from it and wielded a magic [[wand]]. His home planet is called '''Gamma Vile''', which was in the [[Whirlpool Galaxy|M51 galaxy]]. His personality is that of a crochety old man. He's a very cunning villain overall, but is very comical. He also appears to be something of a coward. Master Vile and [[Lord Zedd]] have an obvious dislike for each other. This is evident when he found out Rita married Zedd and was very furious with her for it. The angry Master Vile yelled at her for being an idiot in marrying him and pointing out that she could've found someone else much better. Zedd was offended and called him out for the whole thing. He pointed out that at least he has the Falcon Zord and Ninjor, much to Master Vile's disbelief.\n\nMaster Vile arrived on the [[moon]] in search of the legendary Zeo Crystal during the third season of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]''. He very nearly succeeded with the aid of an energy-draining monster he created and called the Blue Globber. After capturing Ninjor, the Crystal and the Rangers' Zords, Vile decided to throw an \"End of the World Party\" in the Angel Grove Youth Center before he would use the Zeo crystal to destroy the earth. However, Vile throwing his party gave the rangers the time and opportunity to locate and retrieve their Zords. Vile grew to giant size after Ninjor regained his energy and joined the Rangers in their battle against the Globber. Although his monster was destroyed, Vile survived the finishing attacks of both the Shogun and Ninja Megafalconzord, and still managed to retreat despite not appearing to be that badly hurt. On his retreat to the moon, he considered the failure nothing more than a minor setback and decided to stay.\n\nVile later summoned his old ally Dischordia (a monster that uses dance to control her victims) to battle the Rangers, and she nearly succeeded in taking control of the Rangers' minds. Vile was foiled once again, as Dischordia met her end courtesy of Ninjor and the Shogun Ultrazord.\n\nVile then summoned the Orb of Doom to the Earth, which he used to revert the Rangers to powerless children. He prevented [[Lord Zedd]], [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]], [[Goldar]], and Rito from destroying Angel Grove, revealing that he had more plans for the Earth. He sent a selection of monsters to invade the planet, led by his field general, Professor Longnose. When the invasion was thwarted by the [[Aquitian Rangers]], Vile threw a tantrum and Rita reprimanded him for embarrassing her. Fed up, Vile fled back to his home galaxy, where he claimed \"the bad guy always win\". Zedd was overly happy to be rid off Vile to the point he actually kissed an annoyed Goldar.\n\nAfter being overthrown by the Machine Empire at the start of ''Power Rangers Zeo'', Rita called her father and begged him to let them stay with him. Vile reluctantly agreed knowing that his daughter would be bringing \"that husband of hers\" and told them not to wake him when they arrive. Master Vile also stated that the Machine Empire was worse than he was.\n\nMaster Vile appeared in the ''Power Rangers Zeo'' comic book, in which the forces of the Machine Empire attacked his planet looking for Lord Zedd, who was in possession of the Ninja Power Coin energies after he and Rita destroyed them in the television series. In the end, Master Vile handed the energies over to the Machine Empire despite the Rangers' attempts to stop the Machine Empire from getting them. The Power Coin energies subplot went unresolved and has since been deemed non-canon.\n\nMaster Vile was last seen on the Cimmerian Planet, attending [[Dark Specter]]'s conference. He was most likely purified (like his daughter) or destroyed by Zordon's Wave during the battles that succeeded the conference.\n\nIn the ''[[Power Rangers: Operation Overdrive]]'' episode \"[[Once a Ranger]]\", it is revealed that he has a grandson named Thrax.\n\nVile was the first villain to receive the \"semi-independent villain\" position \u2013 a role which would later be filled by [[Machine Empire#Louie Kaboom|Louie Kaboom]], [[Machine Empire#Prince Gasket|Prince Gasket]], General Havoc, [[Villains in Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy#Captain Mutiny|Captain Mutiny]], [[Villains in Power Rangers: Wild Force#Mandilok|Mandilok]], and some of the monsters in S.P.D.\n\n* The Monsters that attended Master Vile's End of the World Party at the Youth Center are Fighting Flea, Slippery Shark, Oysterizer, Robogoat, Invenusable Flytrap, Vampirus, Artistmole, Centiback, Hate Master, Miss Chief, Incisorator, See Monster, Garbage Mouth, Brick Bully's second form, and Dischordia.\n* Monsters at Master Vile's conference are Crabbie Cabbie, See Monster, Brick Bully's second form, Miss Chief, Lanterra, the as-yet-unintroduced Arachnofiend, an unnamed clown dog monster, an unnamed flat-topped bluish-white clay monster, an unnamed furry brown tiki-masked monster, and an unnamed swirl-textured dustcloth monster.\n\n===Hydro Hog===\n'''Hydro Hog''' is the [[Umib\u014dzu]]-themed nemesis of the [[Aquitian Rangers]] and the main antagonist of ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]''. He was known as the Emperor of the Dark Waters on Aquitar for his evil ways. He was known for having destroyed many planets. His main power is to consume all the water available before the Aquitian Rangers can get to it, leaving them dehydrated. [[Rita Repulsa]] and [[Lord Zedd]] sought out Hydro Hog's help when the Aquitian Rangers proved to be too much against them on their own.\n\nHydro Hog was too powerful for the [[Aquitian Rangers]] to destroy, and he was the only villain capable of withstanding the Shogun Megazord's Fire Blade, actually completely blocking the sword before it hit him. However, he was eventually defeated by the Shogun Megafalconzord. He was the first archvillain to be destroyed in battle, later followed by [[King Mondo]]. Hydro Hog is also the only monster and/or archvillain to be destroyed by the Shogun Megafalconzord.\n\nHydro Hog is voiced by Brad Orchard.{{efn|Hydro Hog was based on the ''Kakuranger'' monster Umib\u014dzu who was originally a one-shot villain.}}\n\n===Foot Soldiers===\n====Putty Patrol====\nThe '''Putty Patrol''' is the standard foot soldiers deployed by Rita Repulsa during the first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. They are based on the [[Golem]] Soldiers in ''Zyuranger'' and are made from clay. Though neither particularly strong, intelligent, nor resilient, their basic power of numbers allow them to be a regular challenge to the Power Rangers. Occasionally, some of them were encountered that seemed a little smarter (Jason at one point fought one that was able to drive a car). Putties are mass-produced in Finster's Monstermatic through use of steam-pressured molds and then sent through the Monstermatic in large numbers. Putties do have some manner of spoken language, though it is incomprehensible to humans, coming across as strings of garbled noises.<ref>{{cite news|title= Hooked on Power |publisher= Sun Sentinel|date=|url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-14/lifestyle/9407140208_1_white-ranger-pink-ranger-black-ranger/2|accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere had been some special Putty Patrollers that had been exclusive to each of Rita Repulsa's monsters.\n\n* In \"High Five\", the Skeleton Warriors that assist Bones are skeleton-themed Putty Patrollers.\n* In \"Trick or Treat\" Pumpkin Rapper is assisted by Putty Patrollers who have pumpkins for heads.\n* In \"Football Season\", Rhinoblaster has some Putty Patrollers that are trained at [[American football|football]] and make up his football team.\n* In \"Mighty Morphin' Mutants\", Goldar trains six Putty Patrollers to fight like the Power Rangers. When one of them fails the training due to its clumsiness, Goldar teleports that Putty Patroller back into Finster's clay pot. The other five Putty Patrollers are given the Badges of Darkness which turn them into the '''Mutant Rangers''', evil counterparts of the Power Rangers. These Putties become the Mutant Rangers while Finster creates Commander Crayfish to use in place of their Red one, after Goldar had destroyed the Red Badge of Darkness. The Female Mutants are destroyed by the Power Blaster while the Male ones are later destroyed along with Commander Crayfish by the Ultrazord\n\nThe Putty Patrollers appear in ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]'' with their vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. They are redesigned as stone golems that can be formed out of anything that is made of rock.<ref name=\"NYCC\"/>\n\nThe original Putties are set to reappear in ''[[Power Rangers Beast Morphers]]''.\n\nThere are different variants of the Putties:\n\n* The '''Super Putties''' are the stronger versions of regular Putty Patrollers. They were mentioned in \"Life's a Masquerade\" and later appeared in \"Gung Ho!\" The Super Putties were made from the super putty that Rita Repulsa and her minions mined.\n* Bones is accompanied by skeleton-themed Putties called '''Skeleton Warriors'''.\n* Pumpkin Rapper is accompanied by pumpkin-headed Putties.\n* Rhinoblaster is accompanied by football-themed Putties.\n* The '''Z-Putties''' are Lord Zedd's own army of Putties. Despite being stronger than Rita's Putties, their main weakness is the \"Z\" on their chests which causes them to shatter/explode when hit. Following this discovery, Z-Putties become less effective than Rita's as Zedd sacrifices durability for strength. In season three, the Putties and Z-Putties are replaced by Rito's own army of foot soldiers the Tenga Warriors. In the ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'' episode \"Flashes of Darkonda\", a Z-Putty is seen at the Onyx Tavern. An army of Z-Putties assists Rita and Zedd in their invasion on Triforia during \"Countdown to Destruction\".\n\n===Tenga Warriors===\nThe '''Tenga Warriors''' are Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa's new crow-like foot soldiers with them being wedding gifts from [[Rito Revolto]]. Rita states that Tengas are the most vicious warriors in the universe; however, the clumsiness her Tenga display suggests she got a bad batch. They are the only grunt soldiers to have their own theme song \"Tenga Bye Bye\". Throughout Season 3, the Rangers are never seen battling these grunt soldiers in civilian form, but used their Ninja Ranger or Power Ranger forms instead, implying the Tenga are strong enough to out-match the rangers without their powers. The Tengas also have the power of speech. The Tenga Warriors effectively replace the Putties because they cannot be destroyed easily as they can.\n\nIn ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'', Ivan Ooze had virtually identical soldiers called the '''[[Tengu]] Warriors''', but created from his ooze instead of eggs. Like their TV counterparts, the Tengus are shown to have the power of speech.\n\nIn the ''[[Power Rangers S.P.D.]]'' episodes \"Shadow\" Pt. 2 and \"Wired\" Pt. 2, a Tenga is seen as a patron at Piggy's diner.\n\n===Ivan Ooze===\n'''Ivan Ooze''' is a fictional character in the [[Power Rangers]] universe, who appears as the primary [[antagonist]] in the film ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'' (1995). He was played by [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Oberon to Ooze\u2014It's All in a Day's Work|work= Los Angeles Times|date=28 June 1995|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-28/entertainment/ca-17997_1_mighty-morphin-power-rangers|accessdate=22 August 2010 | first=David | last=Gritten}}</ref> Though Ivan is depicted as pure evil, he has a comical and charming side to him shown throughout the movie, typical of other villains in the series. He has his own troops of soldiers including Ooze-Men that are easily destroyed by the Rangers and winged creatures called Tengoo (based on the Japanese myth of the [[Tengu]]) which he blew up when they failed to kill the Power Rangers.\n\nIvan Ooze was a [[tyrant]] 6,000 years ago, until he was imprisoned in an egg-shaped Hyperlock Chamber by [[Zordon]] and a small group of young warriors, who presumably were the precursors to the modern Power Rangers. When his hyperlock chamber is unearthed by an Angel Grove construction crew, Ivan was released by [[Lord Zedd]] after 6,000 years of imprisonment. Apparently, he was most angered by the boredom of his lengthy imprisonment, being forced to miss several disasters throughout Earth's history such as the [[Black Death]], the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and the 1981 reunion of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''. He also claims that he \"had a [[Charley horse]] since the [[Renaissance]]\". Ivan proceeds to demolish the [[Command Center]] and fatally injure Zordon and Alpha 5, leaving the Rangers powerless to morph, fight or even call their Zords.\n\nAfter rendering the Rangers powerless, Ivan travels to the moon, and betrays both [[Lord Zedd]] and [[Rita Repulsa]], trapping them within a snowglobe, much to their dismay. Their henchmen [[Goldar]] and [[#Mordant|Mordant]] then swear allegiance to Ivan rather than join Rita and Zedd in captivity. Ivan then begins brainwashing the parents of Angel Grove into digging up and repairing his Ecto-Morphicons (large insect-like machines similar to the Rangers' Zords) Hornitor and Scorpitron which he turns loose to rampage in Angel Grove. After this, he tells the parents to go and \"leap to their doom\", but the parents' children, with some help from Bulk and Skull, stop them.\n\nAfter the Rangers gain the Great Power, they return to Angel Grove and battle Ivan's machines with their new Ninja Zords. Using these Zords, they are able to destroy Scorpitron. An enraged Ivan combines with Hornitor, and takes on the Rangers himself. The battle progresses into outer space, and though Ivan consistently has the upper hand, he is destroyed when the Ninja Falcon-Megazord knees him in the groin, which sends him flying into the path of Ryan's Comet, which happened to be passing the Earth at this time.\n\n===Mordant===\n'''Mordant''' is a [[warthog]] [[henchman]] in ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]''. Together with [[#Goldar|Goldar]], he defects from [[Lord Zedd]] to join [[#Ivan Ooze|Ivan Ooze]], when Ivan imprisons [[#Lord Zedd|Lord Zedd]] and [[Rita Repulsa]] in a snowglobe. After the destruction of Ivan Ooze, when Goldar claims he is now the leader of the group, Mordant follows him willingly, until Rita and Zedd return from their imprisonment.\n\nMordant is not featured in the television series in any manner and is created for the film, but he also appears in [[Marvel Comics]]' adaptation of the film and television series. In an early draft of the script as well as in some merchandise, he is identified as Goldar's second cousin three times removed on his mother's side visiting for the summer.{{Original research inline|date=January 2016}}\n\nMordant is performed by Jean Paul Bell and voiced by Martin G. Metcalf.\n\n===Oozemen===\nThe '''Oozemen''' are Ivan Ooze's foot soldiers that are made from his own ooze. Their name is not mentioned in the movie proper, but they are instead referred to as Ivan's \"kids\" just seconds before he forms them. The Oozemen proved to be too strong for the Rangers unmorphed, forcing them to call upon their powers. They are highly resilient to pain and fatigue, but if smashed by something hard enough, they are reduced to ooze.\n\nIn the [[Sega]] [[Mega Drive]]/Genesis and [[Sega Game Gear]] adaptions of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (video game)|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'', they are officially called Oozemen.\n\n===Monsters===\nThe monsters of Season One are created by Finster using his Monstermatic to bring his clay models to life; although Rita has brought forth monsters through summoning spells as well. They are adapted from the monsters featured in ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]'' with the exception of the last 15, which were part of specially created Japanese footage for ''Power Rangers'' which fans call \"Zyu2\". To make them grow, Rita throws her wand to Earth which emits energy that causes the Earth to shake and split open, releasing a steam that then enlarges the monster.\n\n* '''Bones''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 Bones is a [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] monster created by Finster. Bones could detach his head and have it fly. He also could recreate himself after falling apart and jump long distances. If his head is destroyed, the rest of him follows. Trini dropped Bones' head into a fiery crack in the ground which destroys him.\n* '''Giant''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 A [[giant]] [[knight]] that is summoned by Rita after Bones' destruction. This monster was destroyed by the Tyrannosaurus Dinozord.\n* '''Mighty Minotaur''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) A [[minotaur]] monster created by Finster that wielded a spiked [[Club (weapon)|club]] and a [[shield]]. This monster was destroyed by the Power Blaster. Ironically, he proved too powerful as a giant for the megazord, so Rita shrunk him back down after the Rangers escaped to learn how to beat him.\n* '''King Sphinx''' (voiced by [[Richard Cansino]]) \u2013 A [[sphinx]] monster created by Finster with powerful wings that blow away the Rangers. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.\n* '''Gnarly Gnome''' (voiced by [[Steve Kramer (actor)|Steve Kramer]]) \u2013 A musical [[goblin]]/[[gnome]] monster in [[Vikings|Viking]] attire created by Finster. He had the ability to become invisible and use his accordion to hypnotize people. Kimberly's deaf friend was immune, allowing her to inform the Rangers. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.\n* '''Pudgy Pig''' (voiced by [[Dave Mallow]]) \u2013 A ravenous pig monster created by Finster. He can eat anything, but cannot handle spicy food; the rangers took advantage of this to make him spit up their weapons. Destroyed by the Power Blaster. Rita later recreated Pudgy Pig in \"A Pig Surprise\" by casting a spell on a normal pig a disguised Putty Patroller left at a pet adoption drive.

She also married Lord Zedd. She is a [[Witchcraft|witch]] who is the daughter of the first demonic overlord of the M51 Galaxy, Master Vile. Her brother Rito is a bumbler, and completely incompetent. She also had a child with Zedd named [[Thrax (Power Rangers)|Thrax]], who was sealed away at some point between 1998 and 2007, who would have only been at most two years old when his parents were turned back into non-powered humanoid aliens. This could easily be perceived as them being killed, since the people they were died when Zordon did, and the people they were before that are put in their place, whilst her father, and her brother were not so lucky for unspecified reasons.\n\nIn ''[[Power Rangers Turbo]]'' (1997) Divatox contacts Rita for advice on how to defeat the Power Rangers, but Rita retorts that if she had known how to do that she would not be in her current predicament, and she holds the phone up to Lord Zedd's face, who is heavily snoring in his sleep. In ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', however, their relationship has become more hostile as seen their catty immature behaviour, before and after Dark Spectre turns up to the meeting, they act like teenagers as they fight for Dark Spectre's attention only to both get snubbed in favour of his disciple Astronema.\n\nRita Repulsa was played by [[Machiko Soga]] in ''Zyuranger'' footage, played by Carla Perez in U.S. footage, and played by Sydney native Julia Cortez in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' (1995). All her ''Power Rangers'' appearances are voiced by [[Barbara Goodson]], who overdubs the actresses' lip movements with the unmistakable screechy voice that is among Rita's trademark characteristics.\n\n===Goldar===\n{{About|the [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]] villain|the giant robot from \"The Space Giants\"|Ambassador Magma|section=yes}}\n'''Goldar''' is a [[manticore]]-themed [[knight]] who serves as Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd's right-hand man. In season one, he is a considerably more competent fighter, who is shown fighting alongside [[Scorpina]], whom his Sentai Counterpart was married to, since it's implied but not really developed upon at any point, unlike the Grifforizer/Lami relationship in Zyuranger. From season 2 onwards, he's a considerably less capable fighter, gradually transitioning to comic relief, since the stunt double in the suit for original footage clearly was unable/ not allowed to show how maneuverable the character was, from season 3 onwards he's frequently seen working with a villain with far more credible threat in the Sentai series season 3 is based on, otherwise known as Rito Revolto. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' describes him as a \"big freak with wings\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1BJTsbRdMEC&pg=PA80|title=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|date=June 1995|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|page=80 |url-status=live |accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref> Goldar frequently does battle with the megazord, during the first season, if the episode's monster or device had already been dispatched by the Rangers. Scorpina (and later, Rito through the usage of stock footage, and careful editing,) would aid Goldar in these Megazord battles. Sometimes one or more of them would aid the monster in battle. Unlike the villains of the week, they and\u00a0 Goldar understood the value of discretion, since being cautious is better than being reckless, which is to say he would retreat\u00a0 whenever the Rangers prepared their final attack at one point barely escaping with his life, (although it is debatable whether it would have even defeated Goldar given his survival of the Thunder Megazord slash). Goldar's role draws parallels as the first born, acting like an older brother to Squatt, and Baboo.\n\nGoldar leads Rita Repulsa's first attack on the Earth. However, he soon faces the Power Rangers and is beaten by their Megazord after an intense fight. He also becomes notable for telling Rita what to do frequently, and always promises that they will get revenge for their schemes' failures. He also has been called a \"bumbling fool\" by Rita in \"A Star is Born\", and is scolded vehemently by Rita in \"Happy Birthday, Zack\", being called a \"worthless misfit\" and a \"dweeb\". This pattern also happens when [[Lord Zedd]] is introduced as well; in addition to insulting the now apparently incompetent golden warrior, he often blames Goldar for his ''own'' failures, and has a habit of silencing him (and Squatt and Baboo) frequently. Ever since then, Goldar fights the Rangers and their Zords, growing a strong hatred for [[Jason Lee Scott|Jason]] and [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]], the Red and Green Rangers, for their continual victories in single combat. Goldar also has a [[Zord]] of his own known as Cyclopsis, an ancient war machine, but this Zord is defeated by the Rangers' Ultrazord after a prolonged battle. He is also involved in one of [[Bulk and Skull]]'s more memorable encounters with a monster, in which Goldar (giant sized) picks up a bus with the two inside.\n\nWhen [[Lord Zedd]] arrives on the Moon, Goldar eagerly abandons Rita for Zedd, regaining his wings in the process. As Zedd's right-hand man, Goldar leads many missions for him, encountering Tommy (now the White Ranger) again and again. Each time they fight, the White Ranger bests him, sending Goldar back to Zedd in disgrace. When Rita returns to the moon and marries Zedd, Goldar is aghast and quite suspicious of his master's supposed return of feeling for Rita. When he finally discovers it is a sham (thanks in some part to Rito's loose lips), he immediately sets out to make things right and has [[#Finster|Finster]] create an antidote for the love spell that Rita used. Unfortunately for Goldar, it is revealed that Zedd has come to love Rita on his own, potion or not. Even after Rita drops her secret plans of usurping Zedd, Goldar still has a massive dislike for her. Often paired with [[Rito Revolto]], Goldar is disgusted by the skeleton's stupidity (and stench), though the two eventually formed a friendship. Goldar is also essential in Lord Zedd's powering of the [[Shogun Zords]], as he soundly defeats [[Ninjor (Power Rangers)|Ninjor]], allowing Zedd to capture and use him as a power source for the Shogunzords.\n\nIn ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]'', Goldar and Rito plant a bomb outside of the Command Center, but it is defused by [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]]. Goldar also played a role in the destruction of the power coins. Later, Goldar and Rito are sent to the Command Center, having been given a map of the Command Center's basement, and attempt to destroy the Command Center with an implosion device. The bomb goes off, destroying the Command Center. Just before the implosion device goes off, Goldar steals the Zeo Crystal with the help of Rito. In ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'', the Rangers discover the Zeo Crystal in the ruins of the Command Center, surmising that Rito and Goldar must have dropped it. Rito and Goldar also lose their memories (and in Goldar's case, his wings), and end up wandering around [[Angel Grove]]. A possible explanation is that the blast caught them in mid-teleportation and caused their amnesia. They eventually find Bulk and Skull, and end up becoming their butlers in exchange for food and shelter. Zedd and Rita eventually find them and restore their memories (and Goldar's wings). They return to their employers and help them in their quest to destroy the [[Machine Empire]]. Goldar's final appearance is in the final episode of ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes|Countdown to Destruction]]\". Unlike Rito, Goldar goes with Zedd and Rita to the Cimmerian Planet for [[Dark Specter]]'s conference, where he is responsible for revealing [[Andros (Power Rangers)|Andros]]' identity as a Power Ranger by removing his cloak. He is later present in their invasion of the Vica Galaxy, helping to subdue the [[Trey of Triforia|Gold Ranger]]. It is not shown what happens to Goldar following [[Zordon]]'s destruction as the subsequent energy wave either destroys or purifies the other villains ending his and other villains' reign of terror.\n\nIn the alternate continuity of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'', Goldar serves Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, but when Ivan Ooze shows up, Mordant and he switches sides almost automatically after Ooze traps both Rita and Zedd in a snowglobe, depriving them of their powers. He thinks Kimberly is cute, and when the time comes, he flies away as Ivan takes Angel Grove Tower out of the Ground. In this film, he is portrayed as a bumbling sidekick, very similar to Squatt in the main series. At the very end following Ivan Ooze's destruction, Goldar had taken over the palace and calls himself King Goldar. Soon a furious Rita and Lord Zedd shows up to punish both him and Mordant.\n\nIn both the series and the film, he is voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]]. In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'', his suit actor is [[Kerry Casey]]. In the video game ''Power Rangers: Super Legends'', he is voiced by [[Nolan North]].\n\nGoldar appears as a secondary antagonist in the [[Power Rangers (film)|2017 movie reboot]] with his vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He appears as a giant [[gargoyle]]-like monster made purely out of gold.<ref name=\"NYCC\">{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/10/08/nycc-goldar-confirmed-for-power-rangers-movie/|title=NYCC: Goldar Confirmed for Power Rangers Movie|publisher=ComicBook.com|last=Awesome|first=Amy|date=October 8, 2016}}</ref> Goldar serves as the monster Rita creates, stealing gold from jewelry stores and even dental implants to manifest the monster. As Rita orders Goldar to retrieve the Zeo Crystal from underneath the local [[Krispy Kreme]] shop, the Rangers confront him with their zords for the first time, which culminates in them assembling the Megazord. Rita attempts to counter them by merging herself with Goldar directly, but the Rangers are still able to destroy the monster.\n\nA villain that almost resembles Goldar is set to appear along with Snide in [[Power Rangers Beast Morphers|Power Rangers Beast Morphers season 2]].\n\n===Squatt and Baboo===\n'''Squatt''' is a servant of [[Lord Zedd]] and [[Rita Repulsa]], the dimwitted sidekick of Baboo. Squatt is a short, blue-skinned [[hobgoblin]]-like creature with a large horn. He wears metal armor and is said to be a mix between a [[blueberry]] and a [[warthog]]. Squatt is rather excitable, and may act like an eager child when Rita has a plan or when the Rangers are having trouble in a battle. Squatt is easily frightened by his bosses' bad tempers. He is a coward, and rather than fight, he and Baboo often accompany [[Goldar]], [[Scorpina]], and monsters as they attack the Earth, cheering them on. However, he often goes to Earth when there is no fight going on, because his main duties are acting as a spy and saboteur, as shown in episodes like \"Switching Places\", \"Foul Play in the Sky\", \"Calamity Kimberly\", and \"Rita's Seed of Evil\". Squatt's birthplace is given as Myrgo, Venus.\n\n'''Baboo''' is the more intelligent of a dimwitted duo consisting of him and Squatt. He is a tall, slim, black [[vampire]] that resembles a cross between a monkey and a [[vampire bat]] with crippled wings. Like Finster, he mainly works behind the lines. Though spineless and scatterbrained, he is highly creative. He serves as [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]]'s [[alchemy|alchemist]] and [[potion]] maker, creating substances and devices for her to use. Notable creations include a time device, a punk potion, the monster Shellshock, and the Nasty Knight's sword. Baboo is rarely confident in his mistress' plans, but would never say this to her face. Like Squatt, he is somewhat cowardly, often going to Earth to scheme or cheer on [[Goldar]] and/or [[Scorpina]] in battle rather than taking part in a fight himself. Both Squatt and Baboo have a relationship with Scorpina reminiscent of a mean older sister bullying her younger brothers. Baboo had a great fear of Scorpina saying he remembered the terrible things she did. He asks Rita to keep her stinger away from him; Squatt recalls that Scorpina stung Baboo on the head and he complained for a week. Baboo's birthplace was given as the Planet of the Pongies.\n\nWhen Lord Zedd took over as the main villain in the second season, Squatt and Baboo's roles were greatly reduced. Though still living in the palace, they mainly watch events in the throne room from behind a wall and offer occasional comments. Both participate in Zedd and Rita's wedding. They were later put back to work as saboteurs after Rita's return. In the third season, they are pure comic relief and occasionally are paired with Rito Revolto in schemes Rita involves them in.\n\nSquatt and Baboo disappear during the ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'' series, when fleeing from the [[Machine Empire]] with their masters. Squatt was seen in \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes|Countdown to Destruction]]\". However, Squatt was never actually seen reduced to sand or purified by Zordon's wave. It can be assumed that Baboo met the same fate as Squatt.\n\nSquatt was voiced by [[Michael Sorich]] and his suit actor is [[Minoru Watanabe]]. Baboo was voiced by [[Dave Mallow|Colin Philips]] and his suit actor was portrayed by Hideaki Kusaka (uncredited in season 1) Steve Andreno in Seasons 1\u20133 and later by Jason Ybarra in Seasons 3-Zeo.\n\n===Finster===\n'''Finster''' is a shy henchman of Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, though mostly the former. He resembles an anthropomorphic white [[Scottish Terrier]]. Finster's birthplace was given as the distant planet Claydoious.\n\nDuring the first season of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'', he is primarily responsible for creating a new monster to battle the Power Rangers in each episode, as well as producing a regular supply of Putty Patrollers, although this function falls to Lord Zedd after his appearance. Finster does this by sculpting the monsters out of clay and \"cooking\" them in a special oven/kiln/machine called the Monstermatic in his workshop. Not only is he skilled at supplying monsters and henchmen for his leaders, he is also shown to be a skilled alchemist and potion maker (similar to Baboo) and [[Invention|inventor]] supplying many kinds of potions and gadgets. He is also extremely brilliant and somewhat all-knowing, as he is also able to provide wisdom for Rita and Zedd. Near the end of the episode \"Crystal of Nightmares\", it is implied by Goldar that Finster thought using the Crystal is a good idea, while Goldar denies it (calling him an \"overgrown rat\" in the process). He is the one responsible for making the suggestion that [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]] be used in \"delivering the message of evil\", as [[Rita Repulsa]] had called it, in \"The Wedding\".\n\nWhen Lord Zedd takes over as the main villain in Season 2, Finster is suddenly made obsolete. Zedd makes his own monsters, though after Pirantishead (Zedd's first monster) is destroyed, Finster comments that he could have done better with the monsters he could have created for Zedd. Finster laments his current status among the villains, missing the time when Rita was in charge. When Rita returns from her exile, Finster helps her return to power \u2013 restoring her size, making her look younger and creating a love potion to get Zedd to marry her so she can manipulate him before destroying him as revenge for casting her away in space. He quickly noticed the love potion he created had some side effects, when Rita had a hard time trying to manipulate Zedd as he devoted his time with her (as well as Rita inadvertently falling in love with Zedd as well).\n\nIn the third season and the ''Mighty Morphin' Alien Rangers'' mini-series, Finster returns to making monsters. His love potion is first accidentally revealed to [[Rito Revolto|Rito]] and eventually Goldar learns the truth. He forces Finster to make the antidote for Zedd. Though the antidote worked, he is just as surprised as anyone to find, though, that Zedd actually did love Rita.\n\nAt the start of the [[Power Rangers Zeo|Zeo]] season, Finster joins Zedd and Rita in fleeing the oncoming forces of the [[Machine Empire]]. He later returns with his masters and builds several machines for them. In \"Rangers of Two Worlds, Part 1\", Finster makes a new Staff for Rita which is absurdly more powerful than the previous one, as it creates a monster that is too strong even for the Zeo Ultrazord. He also builds a bomb for Zedd's plan against the Machine Empire's leaders and Zedd successfully defeats them with it, proving to the machines that Zedd's party is their equal.\n\nFinster is either reduced to sand or turned into a human, like several other villains were by [[Zordon]]'s energy wave in ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]''{{'}}s two-part final episode \"Countdown to Destruction\".\n\nWhile working for Rita and Zedd, Finster is never really an evil character, but rather an artist. He at one point even says, \"sometimes it's no fun being a bad guy\".\n\nFinster is voiced by [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]].\n\n===Scorpina===\n'''Scorpina''' is a human-[[scorpion]] hybrid and is one of [[Rita Repulsa]]'s most ruthless and dangerous minions aside from Goldar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/scorpina-power-rangers-villain-explained/ |title=Scorpina: Why Did the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Villain Disappear? |publisher=Cbr.com |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref> Though the Scorpina/Goldar relationship in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' is significantly less developed than the Grifforzer/Lamie relationship of its Japanese counterpart, Goldar and Scorpina have shown affection toward each other where Goldar is shown to be protective of her. She has a human form (a beautiful [[Asian people|Asian]] woman with long black hair wearing a somewhat tight golden scorpion armor), but has a hideous scorpion monster form when Rita makes her gigantic. Like Goldar, she often engages in giant battles with the Zords if the monster or device was already destroyed by the small rangers.\n\nVery little is actually known about Scorpina. Her first appearance was in the \"Green with Evil\" story arc. She is an old friend of Rita Repulsa. Both Squatt and Baboo have a relationship with Scorpina reminiscent of a mean older sister bullying her younger brothers. Baboo had a great fear of Scorpina saying he remembered the terrible things she did. He asks Rita to keep her stinger away from him; Squatt recalls that Scorpina stung Baboo on the head and he complained for a week. Much like Goldar, she would often square off against [[Jason Lee Scott|Jason]] when sent to battle the Rangers and overpowered them with relative ease. Scorpina has a boomerang-like sword she used to attack the Rangers with. When in giant form, she loses any human appearance and often fights alongside Goldar. Scorpina once used her pet [[Bombyx mori|silkworm]] to fight the Power Rangers. Her personality is very cold and calculating compared to most season one villains, although she has moments of being less serious than Goldar, but despite that is seen almost always smiling (at least in her human form), even in battle. She also created a monster called the Rockstar.\n\nIn \"The Mutiny, Part 1\" at the start of the second season, Scorpina is seen among Rita's group. When [[Lord Zedd]] arrives and causes the palace to shake, Scorpina is seen going to help Rita who has just fallen to the ground. She then disappears after Zedd punished Rita for her failure by shrinking her and casting her away in a space dumpster. Though Scorpina's disappearance was unexplained, it was presumed she didn't want to work for Lord Zedd after what he did to Rita and kept her distance. She later resurfaces in \"Goldar's Vice Versa\" as a favor for Goldar. Scorpina has one chance to defeat the Rangers by Lord Zedd. To accomplish this, she poses as a human girl named Sabrina to try to ensnare Adam Park and turn him against his friends. This failed and Scorpina found a rivalry in [[Aisha Campbell]], who suspected her from the start due to her rudeness with her and the other rangers. Revealing herself as Scorpina, she was forced to take both of them hostage, though the other Rangers arrived in time to save them. Unlike the last time, she squares off with Aisha, partially due to being foiled. She even grows to giant-size and battles the Thunder Megazord, with her and Goldar showing improved abilities all around (such as being unfazed by the Thunder Megazord finisher) but soon retreats after being overwhelmed by the new and improved Zords herself (particularly the Thunder Ultrazord).\n\nThis was her last appearance due to being unable to secure the actress for another appearance (which she was supposed to make in a three-parter called \"Zordon I Shrunk The Rangers\"). She was thus absent during the \"Countdown to Destruction\" finale of ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'', in which the majority of the series' surviving villains were either purified into human form or reduced to dust. An early concept for the series that became ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm]]'' would have featured Scorpina and other absent villains returning and menacing Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/234583|title=Power Rangers Seasons We Never Saw|website=Den of Geek|access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nScorpina was portrayed by [[Ami Kawai]] in ''Zyuranger'' footage and was voiced by [[Wendee Lee|Wendee Swan]]. The American actress who later portrayed her in \"Goldar's Vice-Versa\" was Sabrina Lu.\n\nScorpina was said to appear in the [[Power Rangers (film)|2017 film]] as the main antagonist, along with Goldar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/power-rangers-movie-villains-timeline-opening-scene-details/|title=Exclusive: \u2018Power Rangers\u2019 Movie Villains, Timeline, and Opening Scene Revealed|publisher=Collider|last=Trumbore|first=Dave|date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> The concept was scrapped as Rita Repulsa ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) would be the film's antagonist. Elements of Scorpina's appearance in the show were incorporated into Rita's costume, such as her armor.\n\n===Lokar===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]] -->\nAppearing as a floating, demonic, ethereal, blue head, the powerful '''Lokar''' changes Mutitus to his more powerful form and assists in sending the Power Rangers to the Island of Illusions. He is an old friend of Rita's and she called on him for a favor to defeat the Rangers. After destroying Mutitus, the Power Rangers attack Lokar with the Ultrazord, but he manages to escape. Lokar is seen teleporting away just after the blast hits and Jason says, \"We'll get him next time\".\n\nLokar is later summoned again when Goldar goes into battle with his extremely powerful War Zord, Cyclopsis (\"Doomsday, Parts 1 & 2\"). Lokar, heavily scarred from the Ultrazord attack, recreates the War Zord when it falls to the Power Rangers' attack and then aids Cyclopsis in its next two battles against the Power Rangers, but disappears forever when Cyclopsis is destroyed by the Ultrazord. Early plans for the series that became ''Ninja Storm'' would have featured Lokar\u2014like Scorpina\u2014making a return appearance as a villain.\n\nLokar was portrayed by Masahiko Urano and voiced by [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]].\n\n===Lord Zedd===\nLord Zedd was the primary antagonist for the first 40 episodes of the second season and co-antagonist for the rest of season 2 and all of season 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/power-rangers-lord-zedd-venjinx-best-villain/ |title=Power Rangers: 5 Reasons Lord Zedd Is The Best Villain In The Franchise (& 5 Why It\u2019s Venjix) |publisher=Cbr.com |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref> When he first appeared in the second season of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', Zedd was quite furious with Rita's constant failures for being defeated by a bunch of children, even after she warned him about Zordon. Zedd has her punished by shrinking her and sealing her away in a space dumpster to travel for eternity. Despite his early defeats, Zedd's attack on Earth became progressively more violent and focused most of his attention on eliminating [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]], whom he saw as Rita's biggest mistake. He succeeded in eliminating the Green Ranger powers with the help of a Green Crystal that serves to drain Tommy's powers as well as serving to power up his own brand of evil rangers. After both the crystal and Turbanshell were destroyed, he finally succeeded in ridding the Green Ranger's powers.\n\nEventually, Zedd realizes the warning Rita had given him was true and he was having the same difficulties in defeating the Rangers like she had experienced. In retaliation, he brought forth his personal zord, a large serpentine named Serpenterra. Despite the large zord's advantage against the Thunder Zords, it had a serious flaw in using too much of its energy, which infuriated Zedd to no end. He attempts to find an infinite power source for Serpenterra to no avail. Soon it came time for Zedd's Centennial Energy Recharge and while he undergoes it, Rita makes a secret return for revenge against him. Upon awakening under the love potion, Zedd immediately fell in love with Rita much to her delight and proposed to her. However, the love potion did not work as Rita hoped; she planned to turn Zedd sycophantic to her under the potion, but somehow he remains in control and attempted to dominate over Rita as a commanding husband. He even wants Rita to produce heirs for him, much to her hysterical outrage and leading her to order Finster to work on an antidote. After their wedding, they often bickered with each other when failing to overcome one another but remained together. Zedd became less serious about defeating the Rangers and more focused on his life with Rita, while Rita remains determined to defeat them with Zedd's aid. In time, Rita was unknowingly falling in love with Zedd too, and accepts her status as his wife and co-leader to their minions.\n\nWith Zedd and Rita side by side, the Rangers' battles were more difficult. Zedd and Rita's schemes together included creating a clone of the evil Tommy and sending the Rangers back into the past. Zedd also had a rivalry against [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Villains|Count Dregon]]. When his wife's brother, [[Rito Revolto]], arrived on the moon (even with Tengas and a Vampirus as gifts) Lord Zedd was disgusted by the skeleton's stupidity, and would bellow with rage every time Rito called him \"Ed\". Rita's love potion was eventually removed from Zedd after Goldar used the antidote on him. However, to everyone's surprise, Zedd loved Rita on his own; his devotion to his wife was genuine from the start, and thus explaining why Rita had difficulty controlling him due to his love for her being based on [[free will]]; the antidote merely caused a momentary vertigo when used on him. During the Pink Ranger fiasco when Zedd had her held hostage to force the Rangers to use the Shogun Zords in his service, Lord Zedd battled Tommy personally to keep him from saving Kimberly from an alternate dimension. This marked the only time that Zedd had battled a Ranger personally, proving himself quite capable of holding his own, a trait passed down to his son in later years. Though Zedd easily gained the upper hand against the White Ranger, Tommy used Saba to shatter Zedd's Z-Staff, forcing him to retreat.\n\nWhen Master Vile arrived on the moon, Lord Zedd was pushed to the side as Vile took over in his search for the Zeo Crystal. He expressed disdain for his father-in-law, who constantly put him down. Once Vile left after his army was defeated by the [[Aquitian Rangers]], Zedd was ecstatic, and he resumed his attacks on Earth. The Rangers had been turned to children due to Vile's Orb of Doom and all that stood in Zedd's way were the [[Aquitian Rangers]]. Zedd managed to find a map of the Ranger's Command Center, pointing out a weak point. He sent Goldar and Rito in to plant a bomb and steal the Zeo Crystal before the Orb of Doom's magic was undone. Though unable to stop the rangers in undoing the damage Master Vile did, Zedd was able to destroy the Command Center. But before they could take advantage of it, the [[Machine Empire]] arrived and attacked. Zedd and Rita were forced to retreat, taking Serpentera to the M51 Galaxy where they would stay with Master Vile, to Zedd's dismay. They soon returned, however, in a motorhome, plotting to overthrow [[King Mondo]] and destroy the Empire. The two forces clashed on several occasions, neither gaining much ground. At one point, [[Prince Gasket]] had Tommy brainwashed and closed a dimensional portal to his arena to prevent the Rangers (Minus Jason, who was at the arena) from saving him, but Zedd had Finster help get the rangers to the arena to prevent a Machine victory. After a series of failed attempts, they finally managed to destroy the [[Royal House of Gadgetry]] with a bomb in the shape of a gift.\n\nZedd and Rita were mysteriously absent during the ''Power Rangers: Turbo'' Season, and fans have speculated that a \"gap\" between ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'' and ''[[Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie]]'' reveals what occurred after Rita and Zedd had regained control of the moon from The Machine Empire. Events in [[Forever Red]] suggest that Zedd at some point launched an attack on Earth with a significantly more powerful Serpentera, only to be defeated again by the Zeo Rangers. Disillusioned and convinced he would never defeat them, Zedd and Rita retreated for good. It was also hinted that somewhere between this, Rita had given birth to Thrax, forcing her and Zedd to remain in retirement.\n\nLord Zedd, along with Rita, makes a cameo appearance in'' Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie'', when [[Divatox]] calls Rita for advice on how to deal with the Power Rangers; Rita asks Divatox if she would allow herself to be subjected to Zedd's snoring if she knew how to defeat the Rangers, advising the other villain to flee, rather than fight. After many successive failures, this was the best advice the villainess could get.\n\nA year later, Zedd and [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]] attended Dark Specter's conference on the Cimmerian Planet, Zedd toasting to Dark Specter's capture of Zordon and takeover of the universe, and unsuccessfully tried to attack Andros when he was caught spying. Months later, they invaded the Vica Galaxy and quickly conquered it, defeating and capturing the Gold Ranger in the process. When [[Zordon]]'s energy wave washed over them and their army, Zedd was spared, transformed into a human being.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/power-rangers-lord-zedd-secrets/ |title=Lord Zedd: 8 Unspeakable Secrets (And 7 Fan Theories That'll Leave Ya Shook) |publisher=Cbr.com |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref> His love for Rita seemed to remain and the two danced together in the remnants of their army, much to the confusion and relief of the Gold Ranger.\n\nHe was performed by Ed Neil in the TV series, Mark Ginther in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'', and voiced by [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod]]. In the video game ''Power Rangers: Super Legends'', he is voiced by [[Steve Blum]].\n\n===Dark Rangers===\nThe '''Dark Rangers''' are the bad counterparts of the Powers Rangers. There are two versions of them:\n\n* The first Dark Rangers are a bunch of punks named Justin (portrayed by Patrick Wolf), Zane (portrayed by [[Ogie Banks]]), Bobby, Tina (portrayed by Jhoanna Trias), and Kristen who just enrolled at Angel Grove High School and first appeared to the Rangers after knocking around Bulk and Skull. Lord Zedd took interest in them. Before both groups can spar, they are teleported to Otherworld by Lord Zedd. Using a Green Crystal he filled, Lord Zedd transformed them into the Dark Rangers as the Rangers tried inform them what Lord Zedd would do with them to no avail. When the Green Ranger destroyed the Green Crystal, the punks were returned to Angel Grove in a normal state. They made amends with the Rangers.{{efn|According to stunt coordinator Jeff Pruitt, there were plans for a fight between the Rangers and the Dark Rangers. The idea was scrapped because the Dark Ranger suits were too low quality as the crew has imagined and the fact that they are repainted from some Z-Putty suits.}}\n* In the 1995 comic series, another version of the Dark Rangers was formed in the issue \"Dark Thunder.\" Lord Zedd harvested the energies of the old Dino Coins to create another version of the Dark Rangers who would control the rebuilt Thunderzords. Due to Angel Grove not having any worthy bad people, Lord Zedd had to find worthy people around the world. He gained a bully from Zimbanwe named Farai Jukwa as his Red Dark Ranger, a looter from Japan named Osama Tezuka as his Black Dark Ranger, an avaricious man from the United States named Stanford Winner as his Blue Dark Ranger, a gang member from Columbia named Nelida Valensis as his Yellow Dark Ranger, and a pickpocket from France named Marie Claire le Monde as his Pink Dark Ranger. Their Dark Ranger forms resemble the original morphed forms of the Rangers. Following the first fight, the Dark Rangers summoned the rebuilt Thunder Megazord to fight the Rangers in the Ninja Megazord as a rebuilt White Tigerzord appeared. When the Ninja Falconzord was being formed, the Dark Rangers and their Zords got away. Zordon commented that a Dark White Ranger would be impossible to create since the powers of the White Ranger can't be corrupted by evil.\n\n===Tom Oliver (clone)===\n'''Tom Oliver''' (portrayed by [[Jason David Frank]]) is an exact [[Cloning|clone]] of [[Tommy Oliver]] that was created and put under a spell by the Wizard of Deception to serve as an evil Green Ranger variant for [[Lord Zedd]] and [[Rita Repulsa]]. He is referred to as \"Tom\" to differentiate himself from [[Tommy Oliver]]. Tom wears a green [[kerchief|bandana]] with a ponytail behind his head. Being Tommy's perfect duplicate, Tom can easily deceive the Power Rangers to believe that Tommy has betrayed them to their enemies. He also has all of Tommy's tactics and training along with his former Green Ranger powers, allowing him to be able to anticipate most of his doppelg\u00e4nger's actions. Under the Wizard of Deception's powers, the Dragonzord's strength level is on par with the White Ranger's Tigerzord, but only because the White Ranger's power was temporarily weakened by the Wizard.\n\nIn a battle with some Putties, Tommy was knocked unconscious, and the Wizard cut a lock from his hair and turned him into an evil clone, imbued with the restored Green Ranger powers. The clone tricked the other Rangers into meeting him in an isolated spot, where the Wizard of Deception sent them back to [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] Angel Grove. He then confronted Tommy, who was suffering a headache, caused by some of his powers being used to recreate the Green Ranger. The two Rangers fought each other to a draw until the Wizard intervened, zapping Tommy with his wand, causing him to demorph and lie in a coma. The Green Ranger then went to the Command Center to threaten Zordon, and then unleashed the Dragonzord on Angel Grove.\n\nWhen Tommy was revived to full strength, he summoned his White Tigerzord to defend the city, but Dragonzord, energized by the Wizard's evil, soundly beat him. Tommy then stole the Wizard's wand, went back to rescue the other Rangers, and brought them back to summon the Thunder Megazord and deal with the Dragonzord. He then destroyed the Wizard, breaking the spell on the Green Ranger, whom he now called Tom.\n\nTom, much like Tommy was, was sick with remorse after being freed from the spell, but Tommy convinced him that he could still do good based on his own experience. Tom broke the spell on the Dragonzord and sent him back to the sea. The White and Green Rangers went back in time to colonial Angel Grove to destroy the Rat Monsters the Wizard had created to torture the other Rangers. Afterwards, despite Tommy's attempts to persuade Tom to join the Power Rangers, Tom decided to stay in colonial Angel Grove so he could make up for his past deeds, rejecting the restored Green Ranger powers, therefore Tom's power coin was removed from circulation, which makes the appearance of the Mighty Morphin\u2019 Green Ranger in Super Megaforce's legendary war confusing, since Tommy's head is overlaid with a white ranger helmet when he saves a kid left in a car hanging over the edge of a long fall, despite this Green Ranger still appears to help defeat the Armada even though we don't see the White Ranger.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Legendary Battle|episodelink=|series=Power Rangers Super Megaforce|serieslink=Power Rangers Megaforce|airdate=November 22, 2014|season=21|number=20}}</ref>\n\n===Rito Revolto===\n'''Rito Revolto''' is a [[Gashadokuro]]/[[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] who was Rita Repulsa's younger brother, Master Vile's son with an unknown female humanoid and the secondary henchman for her and Lord Zedd in the third season, often partnered with Goldar and a few times with Baboo and Squatt(whom occasionally were [[The Three Stooges]] of the PR verse).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/uncensored-power-rangers-villains/ |title=Power Rangers Villains Who Snuck Past The Censors |publisher=CBR |date= |accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref> He is famous for his introduction saga entitled Ninja Quest, where he destroyed the Thunderzords. He remained in Lord Zedd's palace afterwards and he constantly called Lord Zedd \"Ed\", which, along with Rito's stupidity, angered Zedd and causing him to yell at Rito to get his name right. Rito and Goldar placed an explosive device in the bowels of the Command Center and stole the completed Zeo Crystal before the device detonated, but they dropped their crystal on their escape.\n\nIn [[Power Rangers Zeo]], Rito and Goldar had lost their memories and were wandering around Angel Grove. They were taken in by Bulk and Skull as their butlers in exchange for food and shelter. They were later found by Zedd and Rita, who after confronting them for their failure in not procuring the Zeo Crystal, restored their memories and returned to the Moon. In Zedd and Rita's first attempt to overthrow the Machine Empire, they sent Rito and Goldar to Earth and instructed them to launch Louie Kaboom (a renegade robot) into space as their first attempt to avoid Queen Machina from tracing the robot back to them. Though Rito succeeded, he subsequently lost the remote to control Kaboom and this earned both him and Goldar their fury because it left them with no chance of controlling Kaboom. Rito is shown to be a [[back-seat driver|backseat driver]] and this got him in trouble with both Master Vile and Lord Zedd.\n\nThough he was not seen in \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes|Countdown to Destruction]]\", he was possibly reduced to sand by Zordon's Wave or he was purified since Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd were purified as well.\n\nRito Revolto was voiced by [[Bob Papenbrook]].{{efn|He was based on the character [[Gashadokuro]] who was the son of Master Vile's Japanese equivalent in ''Kakuranger''. Unlike Gashadokuro/Young Noble Junior, Rito is portrayed as moronic and bumbling.}}\n\n===Master Vile===\n'''Master Vile''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) was the father of [[Rita Repulsa]] and [[Rito Revolto]] and was based on the character Y\u014dkai Daima\u014d, the ultimate antagonist in ''[[Ninja Sentai Kakuranger|Kakuranger]]''. He was a tall [[demon]]-like being with large ear-like appendages and wore a dark cloak that had snakes seen emerging from it and wielded a magic [[wand]]. His home planet is called '''Gamma Vile''', which was in the [[Whirlpool Galaxy|M51 galaxy]]. His personality is that of a crochety old man. He's a very cunning villain overall, but is very comical. He also appears to be something of a coward. Master Vile and [[Lord Zedd]] have an obvious dislike for each other. This is evident when he found out Rita married Zedd and was very furious with her for it. The angry Master Vile yelled at her for being an idiot in marrying him and pointing out that she could've found someone else much better. Zedd was offended and called him out for the whole thing. He pointed out that at least he has the Falcon Zord and Ninjor, much to Master Vile's disbelief.\n\nMaster Vile arrived on the [[moon]] in search of the legendary Zeo Crystal during the third season of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]''. He very nearly succeeded with the aid of an energy-draining monster he created and called the Blue Globber. After capturing Ninjor, the Crystal and the Rangers' Zords, Vile decided to throw an \"End of the World Party\" in the Angel Grove Youth Center before he would use the Zeo crystal to destroy the earth. However, Vile throwing his party gave the rangers the time and opportunity to locate and retrieve their Zords. Vile grew to giant size after Ninjor regained his energy and joined the Rangers in their battle against the Globber. Although his monster was destroyed, Vile survived the finishing attacks of both the Shogun and Ninja Megafalconzord, and still managed to retreat despite not appearing to be that badly hurt. On his retreat to the moon, he considered the failure nothing more than a minor setback and decided to stay.\n\nVile later summoned his old ally Dischordia (a monster that uses dance to control her victims) to battle the Rangers, and she nearly succeeded in taking control of the Rangers' minds. Vile was foiled once again, as Dischordia met her end courtesy of Ninjor and the Shogun Ultrazord.\n\nVile then summoned the Orb of Doom to the Earth, which he used to revert the Rangers to powerless children. He prevented [[Lord Zedd]], [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]], [[Goldar]], and Rito from destroying Angel Grove, revealing that he had more plans for the Earth. He sent a selection of monsters to invade the planet, led by his field general, Professor Longnose. When the invasion was thwarted by the [[Aquitian Rangers]], Vile threw a tantrum and Rita reprimanded him for embarrassing her. Fed up, Vile fled back to his home galaxy, where he claimed \"the bad guy always win\". Zedd was overly happy to be rid off Vile to the point he actually kissed an annoyed Goldar.\n\nAfter being overthrown by the Machine Empire at the start of ''Power Rangers Zeo'', Rita called her father and begged him to let them stay with him. Vile reluctantly agreed knowing that his daughter would be bringing \"that husband of hers\" and told them not to wake him when they arrive. Master Vile also stated that the Machine Empire was worse than he was.\n\nMaster Vile appeared in the ''Power Rangers Zeo'' comic book, in which the forces of the Machine Empire attacked his planet looking for Lord Zedd, who was in possession of the Ninja Power Coin energies after he and Rita destroyed them in the television series. In the end, Master Vile handed the energies over to the Machine Empire despite the Rangers' attempts to stop the Machine Empire from getting them. The Power Coin energies subplot went unresolved and has since been deemed non-canon.\n\nMaster Vile was last seen on the Cimmerian Planet, attending [[Dark Specter]]'s conference. He was most likely purified (like his daughter) or destroyed by Zordon's Wave during the battles that succeeded the conference.\n\nIn the ''[[Power Rangers: Operation Overdrive]]'' episode \"[[Once a Ranger]]\", it is revealed that he has a grandson named Thrax.\n\nVile was the first villain to receive the \"semi-independent villain\" position \u2013 a role which would later be filled by [[Machine Empire#Louie Kaboom|Louie Kaboom]], [[Machine Empire#Prince Gasket|Prince Gasket]], General Havoc, [[Villains in Power Rangers: Lost Galaxy#Captain Mutiny|Captain Mutiny]], [[Villains in Power Rangers: Wild Force#Mandilok|Mandilok]], and some of the monsters in S.P.D.\n\n* The Monsters that attended Master Vile's End of the World Party at the Youth Center are Fighting Flea, Slippery Shark, Oysterizer, Robogoat, Invenusable Flytrap, Vampirus, Artistmole, Centiback, Hate Master, Miss Chief, Incisorator, See Monster, Garbage Mouth, Brick Bully's second form, and Dischordia.\n* Monsters at Master Vile's conference are Crabbie Cabbie, See Monster, Brick Bully's second form, Miss Chief, Lanterra, the as-yet-unintroduced Arachnofiend, an unnamed clown dog monster, an unnamed flat-topped bluish-white clay monster, an unnamed furry brown tiki-masked monster, and an unnamed swirl-textured dustcloth monster.\n\n===Hydro Hog===\n'''Hydro Hog''' is the [[Umib\u014dzu]]-themed nemesis of the [[Aquitian Rangers]] and the main antagonist of ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]''. He was known as the Emperor of the Dark Waters on Aquitar for his evil ways. He was known for having destroyed many planets. His main power is to consume all the water available before the Aquitian Rangers can get to it, leaving them dehydrated. [[Rita Repulsa]] and [[Lord Zedd]] sought out Hydro Hog's help when the Aquitian Rangers proved to be too much against them on their own.\n\nHydro Hog was too powerful for the [[Aquitian Rangers]] to destroy, and he was the only villain capable of withstanding the Shogun Megazord's Fire Blade, actually completely blocking the sword before it hit him. However, he was eventually defeated by the Shogun Megafalconzord. He was the first archvillain to be destroyed in battle, later followed by [[King Mondo]]. Hydro Hog is also the only monster and/or archvillain to be destroyed by the Shogun Megafalconzord.\n\nHydro Hog is voiced by Brad Orchard.{{efn|Hydro Hog was based on the ''Kakuranger'' monster Umib\u014dzu who was originally a one-shot villain.}}\n\n===Foot Soldiers===\n====Putty Patrol====\nThe '''Putty Patrol''' is the standard foot soldiers deployed by Rita Repulsa during the first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. They are based on the [[Golem]] Soldiers in ''Zyuranger'' and are made from clay. Though neither particularly strong, intelligent, nor resilient, their basic power of numbers allow them to be a regular challenge to the Power Rangers. Occasionally, some of them were encountered that seemed a little smarter (Jason at one point fought one that was able to drive a car). Putties are mass-produced in Finster's Monstermatic through use of steam-pressured molds and then sent through the Monstermatic in large numbers. Putties do have some manner of spoken language, though it is incomprehensible to humans, coming across as strings of garbled noises.<ref>{{cite news|title= Hooked on Power |publisher= Sun Sentinel|date=|url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-07-14/lifestyle/9407140208_1_white-ranger-pink-ranger-black-ranger/2|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThere had been some special Putty Patrollers that had been exclusive to each of Rita Repulsa's monsters.\n\n* In \"High Five\", the Skeleton Warriors that assist Bones are skeleton-themed Putty Patrollers.\n* In \"Trick or Treat\" Pumpkin Rapper is assisted by Putty Patrollers who have pumpkins for heads.\n* In \"Football Season\", Rhinoblaster has some Putty Patrollers that are trained at [[American football|football]] and make up his football team.\n* In \"Mighty Morphin' Mutants\", Goldar trains six Putty Patrollers to fight like the Power Rangers. When one of them fails the training due to its clumsiness, Goldar teleports that Putty Patroller back into Finster's clay pot. The other five Putty Patrollers are given the Badges of Darkness which turn them into the '''Mutant Rangers''', evil counterparts of the Power Rangers. These Putties become the Mutant Rangers while Finster creates Commander Crayfish to use in place of their Red one, after Goldar had destroyed the Red Badge of Darkness. The Female Mutants are destroyed by the Power Blaster while the Male ones are later destroyed along with Commander Crayfish by the Ultrazord\n\nThe Putty Patrollers appear in ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]'' with their vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. They are redesigned as stone golems that can be formed out of anything that is made of rock.<ref name=\"NYCC\"/>\n\nThe original Putties are set to reappear in ''[[Power Rangers Beast Morphers]]''.\n\nThere are different variants of the Putties:\n\n* The '''Super Putties''' are the stronger versions of regular Putty Patrollers. They were mentioned in \"Life's a Masquerade\" and later appeared in \"Gung Ho!\" The Super Putties were made from the super putty that Rita Repulsa and her minions mined.\n* Bones is accompanied by skeleton-themed Putties called '''Skeleton Warriors'''.\n* Pumpkin Rapper is accompanied by pumpkin-headed Putties.\n* Rhinoblaster is accompanied by football-themed Putties.\n* The '''Z-Putties''' are Lord Zedd's own army of Putties. Despite being stronger than Rita's Putties, their main weakness is the \"Z\" on their chests which causes them to shatter/explode when hit. Following this discovery, Z-Putties become less effective than Rita's as Zedd sacrifices durability for strength. In season three, the Putties and Z-Putties are replaced by Rito's own army of foot soldiers the Tenga Warriors. In the ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'' episode \"Flashes of Darkonda\", a Z-Putty is seen at the Onyx Tavern. An army of Z-Putties assists Rita and Zedd in their invasion on Triforia during \"Countdown to Destruction\".\n\n===Tenga Warriors===\nThe '''Tenga Warriors''' are Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa's new crow-like foot soldiers with them being wedding gifts from [[Rito Revolto]]. Rita states that Tengas are the most vicious warriors in the universe; however, the clumsiness her Tenga display suggests she got a bad batch. They are the only grunt soldiers to have their own theme song \"Tenga Bye Bye\". Throughout Season 3, the Rangers are never seen battling these grunt soldiers in civilian form, but used their Ninja Ranger or Power Ranger forms instead, implying the Tenga are strong enough to out-match the rangers without their powers. The Tengas also have the power of speech. The Tenga Warriors effectively replace the Putties because they cannot be destroyed easily as they can.\n\nIn ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'', Ivan Ooze had virtually identical soldiers called the '''[[Tengu]] Warriors''', but created from his ooze instead of eggs. Like their TV counterparts, the Tengus are shown to have the power of speech.\n\nIn the ''[[Power Rangers S.P.D.]]'' episodes \"Shadow\" Pt. 2 and \"Wired\" Pt. 2, a Tenga is seen as a patron at Piggy's diner.\n\n===Ivan Ooze===\n'''Ivan Ooze''' is a fictional character in the [[Power Rangers]] universe, who appears as the primary [[antagonist]] in the film ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'' (1995). He was played by [[Paul Freeman (actor)|Paul Freeman]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Oberon to Ooze\u2014It's All in a Day's Work|work= Los Angeles Times|date=June 28, 1995|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-28/entertainment/ca-17997_1_mighty-morphin-power-rangers|accessdate=August 22, 2010 | first=David | last=Gritten}}</ref> Though Ivan is depicted as pure evil, he has a comical and charming side to him shown throughout the movie, typical of other villains in the series. He has his own troops of soldiers including Ooze-Men that are easily destroyed by the Rangers and winged creatures called Tengoo (based on the Japanese myth of the [[Tengu]]) which he blew up when they failed to kill the Power Rangers.\n\nIvan Ooze was a [[tyrant]] 6,000 years ago, until he was imprisoned in an egg-shaped Hyperlock Chamber by [[Zordon]] and a small group of young warriors, who presumably were the precursors to the modern Power Rangers. When his hyperlock chamber is unearthed by an Angel Grove construction crew, Ivan was released by [[Lord Zedd]] after 6,000 years of imprisonment. Apparently, he was most angered by the boredom of his lengthy imprisonment, being forced to miss several disasters throughout Earth's history such as the [[Black Death]], the [[Spanish Inquisition]], and the 1981 reunion of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''. He also claims that he \"had a [[Charley horse]] since the [[Renaissance]]\". Ivan proceeds to demolish the [[Command Center]] and fatally injure Zordon and Alpha 5, leaving the Rangers powerless to morph, fight or even call their Zords.\n\nAfter rendering the Rangers powerless, Ivan travels to the moon, and betrays both [[Lord Zedd]] and [[Rita Repulsa]], trapping them within a snowglobe, much to their dismay. Their henchmen [[Goldar]] and [[#Mordant|Mordant]] then swear allegiance to Ivan rather than join Rita and Zedd in captivity. Ivan then begins brainwashing the parents of Angel Grove into digging up and repairing his Ecto-Morphicons (large insect-like machines similar to the Rangers' Zords) Hornitor and Scorpitron which he turns loose to rampage in Angel Grove. After this, he tells the parents to go and \"leap to their doom\", but the parents' children, with some help from Bulk and Skull, stop them.\n\nAfter the Rangers gain the Great Power, they return to Angel Grove and battle Ivan's machines with their new Ninja Zords. Using these Zords, they are able to destroy Scorpitron. An enraged Ivan combines with Hornitor, and takes on the Rangers himself. The battle progresses into outer space, and though Ivan consistently has the upper hand, he is destroyed when the Ninja Falcon-Megazord knees him in the groin, which sends him flying into the path of Ryan's Comet, which happened to be passing the Earth at this time.\n\n===Mordant===\n'''Mordant''' is a [[warthog]] [[henchman]] in ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]''. Together with [[#Goldar|Goldar]], he defects from [[Lord Zedd]] to join [[#Ivan Ooze|Ivan Ooze]], when Ivan imprisons [[#Lord Zedd|Lord Zedd]] and [[Rita Repulsa]] in a snowglobe. After the destruction of Ivan Ooze, when Goldar claims he is now the leader of the group, Mordant follows him willingly, until Rita and Zedd return from their imprisonment.\n\nMordant is not featured in the television series in any manner and is created for the film, but he also appears in [[Marvel Comics]]' adaptation of the film and television series. In an early draft of the script as well as in some merchandise, he is identified as Goldar's second cousin three times removed on his mother's side visiting for the summer.{{Original research inline|date=January 2016}}\n\nMordant is performed by Jean Paul Bell and voiced by Martin G. Metcalf.\n\n===Oozemen===\nThe '''Oozemen''' are Ivan Ooze's foot soldiers that are made from his own ooze. Their name is not mentioned in the movie proper, but they are instead referred to as Ivan's \"kids\" just seconds before he forms them. The Oozemen proved to be too strong for the Rangers unmorphed, forcing them to call upon their powers. They are highly resilient to pain and fatigue, but if smashed by something hard enough, they are reduced to ooze.\n\nIn the [[Sega]] [[Mega Drive]]/Genesis and [[Sega Game Gear]] adaptions of ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (video game)|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]'', they are officially called Oozemen.\n\n===Monsters===\nThe monsters of Season One are created by Finster using his Monstermatic to bring his clay models to life; although Rita has brought forth monsters through summoning spells as well. They are adapted from the monsters featured in ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]'' with the exception of the last 15, which were part of specially created Japanese footage for ''Power Rangers'' which fans call \"Zyu2\". To make them grow, Rita throws her wand to Earth which emits energy that causes the Earth to shake and split open, releasing a steam that then enlarges the monster.\n\n* '''Bones''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 Bones is a [[Skeleton (undead)|skeleton]] monster created by Finster. Bones could detach his head and have it fly. He also could recreate himself after falling apart and jump long distances. If his head is destroyed, the rest of him follows. Trini dropped Bones' head into a fiery crack in the ground which destroys him.\n* '''Giant''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 A [[giant]] [[knight]] that is summoned by Rita after Bones' destruction. This monster was destroyed by the Tyrannosaurus Dinozord.\n* '''Mighty Minotaur''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) A [[minotaur]] monster created by Finster that wielded a spiked [[Club (weapon)|club]] and a [[shield]]. This monster was destroyed by the Power Blaster. Ironically, he proved too powerful as a giant for the megazord, so Rita shrunk him back down after the Rangers escaped to learn how to beat him.\n* '''King Sphinx''' (voiced by [[Richard Cansino]]) \u2013 A [[sphinx]] monster created by Finster with powerful wings that blow away the Rangers. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.\n* '''Gnarly Gnome''' (voiced by [[Steve Kramer (actor)|Steve Kramer]]) \u2013 A musical [[goblin]]/[[gnome]] monster in [[Vikings|Viking]] attire created by Finster. He had the ability to become invisible and use his accordion to hypnotize people. Kimberly's deaf friend was immune, allowing her to inform the Rangers. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.\n* '''Pudgy Pig''' (voiced by [[Dave Mallow]]) \u2013 A ravenous pig monster created by Finster. He can eat anything, but cannot handle spicy food; the rangers took advantage of this to make him spit up their weapons. Destroyed by the Power Blaster. Rita later recreated Pudgy Pig in \"A Pig Surprise\" by casting a spell on a normal pig a disguised Putty Patroller left at a pet adoption drive. However, the rangers were able to reverse the spell.\n* '''Eye Guy''' (voiced by [[Richard Cansino]]) \u2013 A multi-eyed monster that is prone to eye-related puns. He imprisoned Billy's friend Willy within the dimension inside his main eye so Rita could use his genius. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord. Keen-eyed viewers of the Power Rangers series may notice that Eye Guy has made many appearances throughout the series: he was one of the illusions seen by the Rangers in \"Island of Illusion,\" ambushing the Rangers at the Spectre Theater and attended Rita and Zedd's wedding in the three-part episode \"The Wedding,\" was among the Machine Empire's army of monsters during the two-part ''Power Rangers in Space'' episode \"Countdown to Destruction,\" and was one of the monsters seen in the Shadow World's tomb in the ''Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue'' episode \"The Fate of Lightspeed\" Pt. 2.\n* '''Terror Toad''' (voiced by [[Michael Sorich]]) \u2013 A [[toad]] monster created by Finster. He swallowed most of the Rangers. A picture of each Ranger's helmet appeared on his belly when they were swallowed. Destroyed by Pink Ranger's Power Bow when its arrow was shot into his mouth.\n* '''Madame Woe''' (voiced by [[Alex Borstein]]) \u2013 An elemental ghost-themed sorceress monster who was an old friend of Rita Repulsa. She mistook Billy's girlfriend for a Power Ranger (due to Billy having just been at the location she was sent to), and captured her. This monster was destroyed by the Power Blaster.\n* '''Mr. Ticklesneezer''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 A [[troll]]/[[elf]] monster created by Squatt from Trini's doll in her dream. He has the power to shrink anything and put it in a bottle as part of his collection. Rita either intimidated him or cast spell, given she repeatedly got in his face while instructing him. The dream ended as Trini persuaded Mr. Ticklesneezer to put everything back.\n* '''Snizzard''' (voiced by [[Bryan Cranston]] in the first appearance, [[Bob Papenbrook]] in the third appearance) \u2013 A [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]]-themed snake/lizard monster with cobra-headed hands, snake-like piles for legs, and an apple-shaped part on his head that was created by Finster. This monster was destroyed by Pink Ranger's Power Bow, by shooting the apple on his head. In \"Zedd's Monster Mash,\" Doomstone revived Snizzard to attack the Rangers in Lord Zedd's Haunted Forest. In the three-part episode \"The Wedding,\" Snizzard was recreated by Finster to ambush the Rangers at the Spectre Theater and attend the wedding of Lord Zedd and Rita Repula. He did interact with Saliguana during the wedding and was not seen fighting the Rangers.\n* '''Chunky Chicken''' (voiced by [[Robert Axelrod (actor)|Robert Axelrod) \u2013 A chicken monster created by Finster to kidnap a girl Trini and Kimberly were looking after, so she could open a box containing the morphin eggs. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.\n* '''Genie''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 An evil [[wolf]] [[Jinn|genie]] released by Squatt and Baboo after they obtained his lamp from Canine 4 of the Wolf's Head Galaxy. Rita enlarges him differently, instead shooting a blast from her scepter. He disappeared when Billy teleported the lamp away from Earth.\n* '''Knasty Knight''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 An evil [[knight]] summoned by Rita as a twisted idea of a birthday present for Zack. He was originally created by Rita using an evil spell and was first used on Tarmac 3 where he made \"space dust\" out of its finest warrior. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.\n* '''Pineoctopus''' (voiced by [[Mike Reynolds (actor)|Mike Reynolds]]) \u2013 A [[pineapple]] monster with plant-like tendrils created by Finster. He could turn anybody his spore touched into cardboard cut-outs of themselves (only water could undo the damage). The Rangers suits made them immune to the dust. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.\n* '''Dark Warrior''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 A stealthy [[ninja]] monster created by Finster. He kidnapped Trini's scientist uncle for his invisibility potion; however, it had been accidentally left at the Youth Center, making the kidnapping pointless. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.\n* '''Shellshock''' (voiced by [[Richard Epcar]]) \u2013 A turtle monster created by Squatt and Baboo. Shellshock had a traffic light atop his body which created speed and freeze spells; Trini was forced to constantly move, while Billy, Zack and Kimberly were frozen in time. For hand weapons, he had a hook and a baseball bat with a ball, as well as a large cannon in his shell. Rita was quite proud of this monster, as he managed to win a fight with the Rangers. This monster was destroyed by the Dragonzord and the Tyrannosaurus Dinozord.\n* '''Spidertron''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 A spider monster created by Finster when Rita heard of Zack's fear of bugs (especially spiders). He was hidden in a copy of a park statue until Zack blasted the copy apart. Despite his name, he appears completely organic. This monster was destroyed by the Dragonzord's Battle Mode.\n* '''Spitflower''' (voiced by [[Mike Reynolds (actor)|Mike Reynolds]]) \u2013 A [[flower]]-eating plant monster created by Finster. He can swallow countless flowers and made them into energy-sucking carnivorous plants.

He was voiced by [[Tom Wyner]].\n* '''Mutitus''' (voiced by [[Richard Epcar]]) A powerful [[zombie]] monster summoned by Rita along with Lokar. He was later upgraded into a more demon-like monster by Lokar which looked like a dragon, with stubby arms. Destroyed by MegaDragonzord.{{efn|In the original version, Mutitus' Japanese equivalent was what the Japanese equivalent of Frankenstein's Monster became after his first defeat.}}\n* '''Rockstar''' (voiced by [[Tony Oliver]]) \u2013 A [[rock (geology)|rock]] monster created by Scorpina. He can fire boulders that pinned his victims under them. This monster was destroyed by the Mirror of Destruction.\n* '''Samurai Fan Man''' (voiced by [[Tom Wyner]]) \u2013 A [[samurai]] monster created by Finster.

No matter how much the Power Rangers had destroyed Hatchasaurus, Cardiatron keeps reviving him stronger than ever until Hatchasaurus was in his second form complete with horns and spikes. This monster was destroyed by the Ultrazord the first time. Terror Blossom later revived Hatchasaurus. This monster was destroyed by the Thunder Megazord. The second time he was revived thanks to Cardiatron, Hatchasaurus was destroyed by the White Tigerzord after he was weakened by the Thunder Megazord. Hatchasaurus was later in the ''Power Ranger Lightspeed Rescue'' episode \"The Fate of Lightspeed\" Pt. 2 as one of the monsters in the Shadow World.\n** '''Cardiatron''' (voiced by [[Richard Cansino]]) \u2013 A magical computer heart that recreates Hatchasaurus every time he was destroyed.

This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.\n* '''Twin Man''' (voiced by [[Bryan Cranston]]) \u2013 A reflective monster created by Finster. He used his powers to turn the Putties into duplicates of the Rangers and took the guise of the Red Ranger as part of a plot to give the Power Rangers and their civilian identities a bad reputation. They first started by getting the Rangers put in detention while causing trouble in their civilian forms and then attacking the city in their Ranger forms, forcing the real Rangers to set up a quick scam to make Bulk and Skull (who they were also serving detention with) think they were still in the room while they left to defeat their doubles.

In \"Ninja Quest\" Pt 1, Fighting Flea was among the powerful monsters recreated by Finster for Lord Zedd's trap. He, Lizzinator, Octophantom, and Stag Beetle dislike working with Rito as they see him as an idiot where a hiding Fighting Flee had to remind him that he is the bait for the Rangers.\n* '''Jellyfish Warrior''' (voiced by [[Richard Cansino]]) \u2013 A jellyfish monster created by Finster. He can teleport and emit venom that can eat through the Power Rangers' suits.

{"title_page": "Niccolo's Smile", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n'''''Niccolo's Smile: A Biography of Machiavelli''''' is a translation of [[Machiavelli]]'s diaries and memoirs by [[Maurizio Viroli]], a scholar from the [[University of Bologna]], Italy, and [[Princeton University]].\n\nPublished in 1998 using Machiavelli's original source materials, the author recreates his biography.\n\n\"Machiavellian\" is a pejorative term suggesting serpentine scheming and use of immoral, ruthless means to achieve desired ends. Those ends usually include the maintenance of power at all costs. Some scholars assert that Machiavelli endorses these methods in his works on political philosophy. He lived in interesting but chaotic and often violent times. Viroli states that Machiavelli's longing for a powerful ruler was not merely based on a cynical wish to see power exercised; rather, he posits that Machiavelli hoped for a strong and, if necessary, devious ruler who could rule effectively but also wisely and justly. In his personal life, he is revealed here as a caring, sensitive man who, contrary to expectations, was frequently ruled by his heart rather than his head.\n\nDescribing \"Machiavelli's Dream\", the author recounts a legend in which on his death bed, the great philosopher gathered his friends and told of a dream. In the dream, a band of ragged, poorly dressed and miserable men were the self-described \"saintly and blessed; we are on our way to Heaven\". He then saw a crowd of solemnly attired, noble men of grave appearance. He recognized among them [[Plato]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Tacitus]]. They told him \"We are the damned of Hell\". Machiavelli tells his friends he would be far happier in Hell where he could discuss politics with the great men of the ancient world, whereas in Heaven he would languish in boredom among the saintly and blessed.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.c-span.org/video/?160904-1/niccolos-smile ''Booknotes'' interview with Viroli on ''Niccolo's Smile''], {{#dateformat:February 18, 2001}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1998 books]]\n[[Category:Philosophy books]]\n[[Category:Biographies (books)]]\n[[Category:Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]\n\n\n{{philo-book-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n'''''Niccolo's Smile: A Biography of Machiavelli''''' is a translation of [[Machiavelli]]'s diaries and memoirs by [[Maurizio Viroli]], a scholar from the [[University of Bologna]], Italy, and [[Princeton University]].\n\nPublished in 1998 using Machiavelli's original source materials, the author recreates his biography.\n\n\"Machiavellian\" is a pejorative term suggesting serpentine scheming and use of immoral, ruthless means to achieve desired ends.
