At the end of the conflict, neither the Normans nor the Byzantines could boast much power; by the mid-13th century exhaustive fighting with other powers had weakened both, leading to the Byzantines losing [[Asia Minor]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 14th century, and the Normans losing [[Sicily]] to the [[Hohenstaufen]].\n\n==Norman conquest of southern Italy==\n{{main|Norman conquest of southern Italy}}\nThe Normans' initial military involvement in southern Italy was on the side of the [[Lombards]] against the Byzantines. Eventually, some Normans, including the powerful de Hauteville brothers, served in the army of [[George Maniakes]] during the attempted Byzantine reconquest of Sicily, only to turn against their employers when the emirs proved difficult to conquer.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Shepard 1973, p.86.</ref> By 1030, [[Rainulf Drengot|Rainulf]] became count of Aversa, marking the start of permanent Norman settlement in Italy.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1042, [[William Iron Arm|William de Hauteville]] was made a count, taking Lombard prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] as his liege.<ref name=\":0\">Holmes 1988, p. 210</ref> To further strengthen ties and legitimacy, [[Robert Guiscard]] also married Lombard Princess [[Sikelgaita]] in 1058.<ref name=\":0\" />  Following the death of Guaimar, the Normans were increasingly independent actors on the south Italian scene, which brought them into direct conflict with Byzantium.\n\nDuring the time that the Normans had conquered southern Italy, the Byzantine Empire was in a state of internal decay; the administration of the Empire had been wrecked, the efficient government institutions that provided [[Basil II]] with a quarter of a million troops and adequate resources by taxation had collapsed within a period of three decades. Attempts by [[Isaac I Komnenos]] and [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] to reverse the situation proved unfruitful. The premature death of the former and the overthrow of the latter led to further collapse as the Normans consolidated their conquest of Sicily and Italy.\n\n[[Reggio Calabria]], the capital of the [[tagma (military)|tagma]] of Calabria, was captured by Robert Guiscard in 1060. At the time, the Byzantines held a few coastal towns in Apulia, including Bari, the capital of the [[catepanate of Italy]]. In 1067\u201368, they gave financial support to a rebellion against Guiscard. In 1068, the Normans besieged [[Otranto]]; in the same year, they began the [[siege of Bari]] itself. After defeating the Byzantines in a series of battles in Apulia, and after two major attempts to relieve the city had failed, the city Bari surrendered in April 1071, ending the Byzantine presence in southern Italy.\n\nIn 1079\u201380, the Byzantines again gave their support to a rebellion against Guiscard.\n\nOver a thirty-year period (1061-1091), Norman factions also completed the initial Byzantine attempt to retake Sicily. However, it would not be until 1130 that both Sicily and southern Italy were united into one kingdom, formalized by [[Roger II of Sicily]].<ref>Davis-Secord 2017, p.214.</ref>\n\n==First Norman invasion of the Balkans (1081&ndash;1085)==\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|left|thumb|260px|The map of Europe after the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085.]]\nFollowing their successful [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquest of southern Italy]], the Normans saw no reason to stop; Byzantium was decaying further still and looked ripe for conquest. When [[Alexios I Comnenus]] ascended to the throne of Byzantium, his early emergency reforms, such as requisitioning Church money - a previously unthinkable move - proved too little to stop the Normans.\n\nLed by the formidable [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemund of Taranto]] (later, Bohemund I of Antioch), they took [[Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]], and laid siege to [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]] (see [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]).<ref>Davis-Secord 2017, p.216-7.</ref> Alexios suffered several defeats before being able to strike back with success. He enhanced this by bribing the German king [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] with 360,000 gold pieces to attack the Normans in Italy, which forced the Normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083&ndash;1084. He also secured the alliance of [[Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo]], who controlled the [[Gargano Peninsula]] and dated his charters by Alexios' reign. The Norman danger ended for the time being with the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085, combined with a Byzantine victory and crucial [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] aid that allowed the Byzantines to retake the [[Balkans]].<ref>Loud 1999, p.824.</ref>\n\n==Rebellion of Antioch (1104&ndash;1140)==\nDuring the [[First Crusade]], a large number of Normans naturally joined in what appeared to be a great expedition into the unknown where land and loot was plentiful. During this time, the Byzantines were able to utilize, to some extent, the aggressive Normans to defeat the [[Seljuk Turks]] in numerous battles and many cities fell.<ref>Shepard 1972, p. 72</ref> It is speculated that, in exchange for an oath of loyalty, Alexios promised land around the city of Antioch to Bohemond in order to create a buffer vassal state and simultaneously keep Bohemond away from Italy.<ref>Charanis 1952, p.129.</ref> However, when [[Antioch]] fell the Normans refused to hand it over, although in time Byzantine domination was established.<ref name=\":1\" /> Out of fear that this signaled Byzantine intentions to reconquer southern Italy and remove his suzerainty over the Normans, [[Pope Innocent II]] declared the emperor an excommunicate, and threatened any Latin Christian who served in his army with the same consequence.<ref>Rowe 1952, p.120.</ref> With the death of [[John II Komnenos|John Comnenus]] the Norman [[Principality of Antioch]] rebelled once again, attacking [[Cyprus]] and invading [[Cilicia]], which also rebelled. The quick and energetic response of [[Manuel Comnenus]] allowed the Byzantines to extract an even more favorable ''[[modus vivendi]]'' with Antioch (in 1145 being forced to provide Byzantium with a contingent of troops and allow a Byzantine garrison in the city). However, the city was given guarantees of protection against Turkic attack and [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] abstained from attacking the northern parts of the Crusader states as a result.\n\n==Second Norman invasion of the Balkans (1147&ndash;1149)==\n[[File:Southern Italy 1112.svg|right|thumb|Southern Italy in 1112, at the time of Roger II's coming of age, showing the major states and cities. The border of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in 1154, at the time of Roger's death, is shown by a thicker black line encircling most of southern Italy.]]\n\nIn 1147 the Byzantine empire under [[Manuel I Comnenus]] was faced with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had captured the Byzantine island of [[Corfu]] and plundered [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Byzantine Corinth|Corinth]]. However, despite being distracted by a [[Cuman]] attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of [[Conrad III of Germany]], and the help of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet.<ref name=\":1\">Rowe 1959, p.118.</ref> In ca.1148, the political situation in the Balkans was divided by two sides, one being the alliance of the Byzantines and Venice, the other the Normans and Hungarians. The Normans were sure of the danger that the battlefield would move from the Balkans to their area in Italy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti|title=Dru\u0161tveni i istoriski spisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yA1OAQAAIAAJ|year=1940|quote=\u041e\u043a\u043e 1148. \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0443 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0432\u0430\u043a\u0430. \u041d\u0430 \u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0445\u0443 \u0443 \u0441\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0443 \u0412\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0438 \u041c\u043b\u0435\u0446\u0438, \u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0458 \u041d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0452\u0430\u0440\u0438. \u041d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0443 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0452\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0443 \u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435 \u0441 \u0411\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u045a\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0447\u0458\u0435 \u0443 \u0418\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0443. \u0414\u0430 \u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0443 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0458\u043b\u0430 \u0443 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0443 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u043c\u0430, \u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u0443\u045b\u0435. \u0414\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430, 1149. \u0433\u043e\u0434. \u0458\u0430\u0432\u0459\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0412\u0438- \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0458\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u041c\u0430\u0452\u0430\u0440\u0438. \u0426\u0430\u0440 ...}}</ref> The Serbs, Hungarians and Normans exchanged envoys, being in the interest of the Normans to stop Manuel's plans to recover Italy.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=237}} In 1149, Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans, while Roger II sent [[George of Antioch]] with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople's suburbs.{{sfn|Norwich|1995|pp=98, 103}} Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily. The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel's foreign policy for the rest of his reign, despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad's death.{{sfn|Magdalino|2005|p=621}} However, while Manuel was in Valona planning the offensive across the Adriatic, the Serbs revolted, posing a danger to the Byzantine Adriatic bases.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=237}}\n\nThe death of Roger in February 1154, who was succeeded by [[William I of Sicily|William I]], combined with the widespread rebellions against the rule of the new King in [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Apulia]], the presence of Apulian refugees at the Byzantian court, and [[Frederick Barbarossa]]'s (Conrad's successor) failure to deal with the Normans encouraged Manuel to take advantage of the multiple instabilities that existed in the [[Italian peninsula]].{{sfn|Duggan|2003|p=122}} He sent [[Michael Palaiologos (general)|Michael Palaiologos]] and [[John Doukas (general under Manuel I)|John Doukas]], both of whom held the high imperial rank of ''[[sebastos]]'', with Byzantine troops, 10 Byzantine ships, and large quantities of gold to invade [[Apulia]] (1155).{{sfn|Birkenmeier|2002|p=114}}{{sfn|Norwich|1995|p=112}} The two generals were instructed to enlist the support of Frederick Barbarossa, since he was hostile to the Normans of Sicily and was south of the [[Alps]] at the time, but he declined because his demoralised army longed to get back north of the Alps as soon as possible.{{Cref|b}} Nevertheless, with the help of disaffected local barons including Count [[Robert II of Bassunvilla|Robert of Loritello]], Manuel's expedition achieved astonishingly rapid progress as the whole of [[Mezzogiorno|southern Italy]] rose up in rebellion against the Sicilian Crown, and the untried William I.{{sfn|Magdalino|2005|p=621}} There followed a string of spectacular successes as numerous strongholds yielded either to force or the lure of gold.{{sfn|Brooke|2004|p=482}}{{sfn|Magdalino|2002|p=67}}\n\nWilliam and his army landed on the peninsula and destroyed the Greek fleet (4 ships) and army at Brindisi on May 28, 1156 and recovered Bari.

The incompetent rule of [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronicus Comnenus]] allowed the Normans to go unchecked towards the Byzantine capital giving [[Thessalonica]] a [[Sack of Thessalonica (1185)|savage sack]] (a grim portent of what Constantinople would face in 20 years time). The resulting panic, however, allowed [[Isaac Angelus]] to take the throne. In the aftermath of the fall of Andronikos I, a reinforced Byzantine field army under [[Alexios Branas]] decisively defeated the overconfident Normans at [[Battle of Demetritzes]]. Following this battle Thessalonica was speedily recovered and the invaders were pushed back to Italy. The only exception being the [[County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]], the latter remained in the hands of the Norman admiral [[Margaritus of Brindisi]] and his successors until 1479.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the Normans unable to take the Balkans, they turned their attention to European affairs. The Byzantines meanwhile had not possessed the will or the resources for any Italian invasion since the days of [[Manuel Comnenus]]. After the third invasion, the survival of the Empire became more important to the Byzantines than a mere province on the other side of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The death of [[William II of Sicily|William II,]] who was without an heir, threw the kingdom into instability and upheaval, and by 1194 the [[Hohenstaufen]] had taken power, themselves being replaced in 1266 by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]].<ref>Davis-Secord 2017, p.215.</ref> The successive Sicilian rulers would eventually continue the Norman policy of domination over post-Byzantine states in the Ionian Sea and Greece, attempting to assert suzerainty over [[Corfu]], finally conquered in 1260, the [[County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]], the [[Despotate of Epirus]] and other territories.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Primary===\n* [[Anna Comnena]], translated by E.R.A Sewter (1969).

At the end of the conflict, neither the Normans nor the Byzantines could boast much power; by the mid-13th century exhaustive fighting with other powers had weakened both, leading to the Byzantines losing [[Asia Minor]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 14th century, and the Normans losing [[Sicily]] to the [[Hohenstaufen]].\n\n==Norman conquest of southern Italy==\n{{main|Norman conquest of southern Italy}}\nThe Normans' initial military involvement in southern Italy was on the side of the [[Lombards]] against the Byzantines. Eventually, some Normans, including the powerful de Hauteville brothers, served in the army of [[George Maniakes]] during the attempted Byzantine reconquest of Sicily, only to turn against their employers when the emirs proved difficult to conquer.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Shepard 1973, p.86.</ref> By 1030, [[Rainulf Drengot|Rainulf]] became count of Aversa, marking the start of permanent Norman settlement in Italy.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1042, [[William Iron Arm|William de Hauteville]] was made a count, taking Lombard prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] as his liege.<ref name=\":0\">Holmes 1988, p. 210</ref> To further strengthen ties and legitimacy, [[Robert Guiscard]] also married Lombard Princess [[Sikelgaita]] in 1058.<ref name=\":0\" />  Following the death of Guaimar, the Normans were increasingly independent actors on the south Italian scene, which brought them into direct conflict with Byzantium.\n\nDuring the time that the Normans had conquered southern Italy, the Byzantine Empire was in a state of internal decay; the administration of the Empire had been wrecked, the efficient government institutions that provided [[Basil II]] with a quarter of a million troops and adequate resources by taxation had collapsed within a period of three decades. Attempts by [[Isaac I Komnenos]] and [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] to reverse the situation proved unfruitful. The premature death of the former and the overthrow of the latter led to further collapse as the Normans consolidated their conquest of Sicily and Italy.\n\n[[Reggio Calabria]], the capital of the [[tagma (military)|tagma]] of Calabria, was captured by Robert Guiscard in 1060. At the time, the Byzantines held a few coastal towns in Apulia, including Bari, the capital of the [[catepanate of Italy]]. In 1067\u201368, they gave financial support to a rebellion against Guiscard. In 1068, the Normans besieged [[Otranto]]; in the same year, they began the [[siege of Bari]] itself. After defeating the Byzantines in a series of battles in Apulia, and after two major attempts to relieve the city had failed, the city Bari surrendered in April 1071, ending the Byzantine presence in southern Italy.\n\nIn 1079\u201380, the Byzantines again gave their support to a rebellion against Guiscard.\n\nOver a thirty-year period (1061-1091), Norman factions also completed the initial Byzantine attempt to retake Sicily. However, it would not be until 1130 that both Sicily and southern Italy were united into one kingdom, formalized by [[Roger II of Sicily]].<ref>Davis-Secord 2017, p.214.</ref>\n\n==First Norman invasion of the Balkans (1081&ndash;1085)==\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|left|thumb|260px|The map of Europe after the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085.]]\nFollowing their successful [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquest of southern Italy]], the Normans saw no reason to stop; Byzantium was decaying further still and looked ripe for conquest. When [[Alexios I Comnenus]] ascended to the throne of Byzantium, his early emergency reforms, such as requisitioning Church money - a previously unthinkable move - proved too little to stop the Normans.\n\nLed by the formidable [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemund of Taranto]] (later, Bohemund I of Antioch), they took [[Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]], and laid siege to [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]] (see [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]).<ref>Davis-Secord 2017, p.216-7.</ref> Alexios suffered several defeats before being able to strike back with success. He enhanced this by bribing the German king [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] with 360,000 gold pieces to attack the Normans in Italy, which forced the Normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083&ndash;1084. He also secured the alliance of [[Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo]], who controlled the [[Gargano Peninsula]] and dated his charters by Alexios' reign. The Norman danger ended for the time being with the death of Robert Guiscard in 1085, combined with a Byzantine victory and crucial [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] aid that allowed the Byzantines to retake the [[Balkans]].<ref>Loud 1999, p.824.</ref>\n\n==Rebellion of Antioch (1104&ndash;1140)==\nDuring the [[First Crusade]], a large number of Normans naturally joined in what appeared to be a great expedition into the unknown where land and loot was plentiful. During this time, the Byzantines were able to utilize, to some extent, the aggressive Normans to defeat the [[Seljuk Turks]] in numerous battles and many cities fell.<ref>Shepard 1972, p. 72</ref> It is speculated that, in exchange for an oath of loyalty, Alexios promised land around the city of Antioch to Bohemond in order to create a buffer vassal state and simultaneously keep Bohemond away from Italy.<ref>Charanis 1952, p.129.</ref> However, when [[Antioch]] fell the Normans refused to hand it over, although in time Byzantine domination was established.<ref name=\":1\" /> Out of fear that this signaled Byzantine intentions to reconquer southern Italy and remove his suzerainty over the Normans, [[Pope Innocent II]] declared the emperor an excommunicate, and threatened any Latin Christian who served in his army with the same consequence.<ref>Rowe 1952, p.120.</ref> With the death of [[John II Komnenos|John Comnenus]] the Norman [[Principality of Antioch]] rebelled once again, attacking [[Cyprus]] and invading [[Cilicia]], which also rebelled. The quick and energetic response of [[Manuel Comnenus]] allowed the Byzantines to extract an even more favorable ''[[modus vivendi]]'' with Antioch (in 1145 being forced to provide Byzantium with a contingent of troops and allow a Byzantine garrison in the city). However, the city was given guarantees of protection against Turkic attack and [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] abstained from attacking the northern parts of the Crusader states as a result.\n\n==Second Norman invasion of the Balkans (1147&ndash;1149)==\n[[File:Southern Italy 1112.svg|right|thumb|Southern Italy in 1112, at the time of Roger II's coming of age, showing the major states and cities. The border of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in 1154, at the time of Roger's death, is shown by a thicker black line encircling most of southern Italy.]]\n\nIn 1147 the Byzantine empire under [[Manuel I Comnenus]] was faced with war by Roger II of Sicily, whose fleet had captured the Byzantine island of [[Corfu]] and plundered [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Byzantine Corinth|Corinth]]. However, despite being distracted by a [[Cuman]] attack in the Balkans, in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of [[Conrad III of Germany]], and the help of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet.<ref name=\":1\">Rowe 1959, p.118.</ref> In ca.1148, the political situation in the Balkans was divided by two sides, one being the alliance of the Byzantines and Venice, the other the Normans and Hungarians.

The incompetent rule of [[Andronikos I Komnenos|Andronicus Comnenus]] allowed the Normans to go unchecked towards the Byzantine capital giving [[Thessalonica]] a [[Sack of Thessalonica (1185)|savage sack]] (a grim portent of what Constantinople would face in 20 years time). The resulting panic, however, allowed [[Isaac Angelus]] to take the throne. In the aftermath of the fall of Andronikos I, a reinforced Byzantine field army under [[Alexios Branas]] decisively defeated the overconfident Normans at [[Battle of Demetritzes]]. Following this battle Thessalonica was speedily recovered and the invaders were pushed back to Italy. The only exception being the [[County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]], the latter remained in the hands of the Norman admiral [[Margaritus of Brindisi]] and his successors until 1479.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the Normans unable to take the Balkans, they turned their attention to European affairs. The Byzantines meanwhile had not possessed the will or the resources for any Italian invasion since the days of [[Manuel Comnenus]]. After the third invasion, the survival of the Empire became more important to the Byzantines than a mere province on the other side of the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The death of [[William II of Sicily|William II,]] who was without an heir, threw the kingdom into instability and upheaval, and by 1194 the [[Hohenstaufen]] had taken power, themselves being replaced in 1266 by the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]].<ref>Davis-Secord 2017, p.215.</ref> The successive Sicilian rulers would eventually continue the Norman policy of domination over post-Byzantine states in the Ionian Sea and Greece, attempting to assert suzerainty over [[Corfu]], finally conquered in 1260, the [[County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos]], the [[Despotate of Epirus]] and other territories.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Primary===\n* [[Anna Comnena]], translated by E.R.A Sewter (1969).
