Of the hundreds of [[aularian]] houses that sprang up across the city, only [[St Edmund Hall]] (c. 1225) remains. What put an end to the halls was the emergence of colleges. [[Colleges of the University of Oxford#History|Oxford's earliest colleges]] were [[University College, Oxford|University College]] (1249), [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] (1263) and [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] (1264). These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology, inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the arts, as society began to see itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford were supported by the Church in the hope of reconciling [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]]. The relationship between \"[[town and gown]]\" has often been uneasy \u2013 as many as 93 students and townspeople were killed in the [[St. Scholastica riot|St Scholastica Day Riot]] of 1355.\n\nThe [[sweating sickness]] epidemic in 1517 was particularly devastating to Oxford and [[Cambridge]] where it killed half of both cities' populations, including many students and dons.<ref>[http://www.storyoflondon.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=244&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 \"The Sweating Sickness\"].

Another reminder of the ongoing war was found in the influx of wounded and disabled soldiers, who were treated in new hospitals housed in buildings such as the university's Examination School, the [[Oxford Town Hall|town hall]] and [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of the University of Oxford: Volume VIII: The Twentieth Century \u2013 Oxford Scholarship|url = http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001/acprof-9780198229742|doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001|access-date = 10 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117073638/http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001/acprof-9780198229742|archive-date = 17 November 2015|url-status = live|year = 1994|isbn = 9780198229742|publisher = Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century, there was rapid industrial and population growth, with the printing and publishing industries becoming well established by the 1920s. In 1929 the boundaries of the city were extended to include the suburbs of [[Headington]], [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] and [[Iffley]] to the east, and [[Wolvercote]] to the north.<ref name=boundaries/>\n\nAlso during the 1920s, the economy and society of Oxford underwent a huge transformation as [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|William Morris]] established [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]] to mass-produce cars in Cowley, on the south-eastern edge of the city. By the early 1970s over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the huge Morris Motors and [[Pressed Steel Fisher]] plants. Oxford was now a city of two halves: the university city to the west of [[Magdalen Bridge]] and the car town to the east. This led to the witticism that \"Oxford is the left bank of Cowley\". Cowley suffered major job losses in the 1980s and 1990s during the decline of [[British Leyland]], but is now producing the successful [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] for [[BMW]] on a smaller site. Much of the original car factories at Cowley was demolished in the 1990s, and is now the site of the [[Oxford Business Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/go/oxfordbg.html|title=Oxford Business Group Country Reports|work=hbs.edu|access-date=25 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730091137/http://www.library.hbs.edu/go/oxfordbg.html|archive-date=30 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Oxford was largely ignored by the German air raids during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], perhaps due to the lack of heavy industry such as steelworks or shipbuilding that would have made it a target, although it was still affected by the rationing and influx of refugees fleeing London and other cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/120111_1.html|title=Exhibition remembers refugees who fled to Oxford before and during World War II|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021091922/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/120111_1.html|archivedate=21 October 2012}}</ref> The university's colleges served as temporary military barracks and training areas for soldiers before deployment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/345/brasenose-college-archives-and-history-38/college-life-214/college-life-in-wartime-421.html|title=College life in wartime|author=Neil Harvey|work=ox.ac.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515114548/http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/345/brasenose-college-archives-and-history-38/college-life-214/college-life-in-wartime-421.html|archivedate=15 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 May 1954, [[Roger Bannister]], a 25-year-old medical student, ran the first authenticated sub-[[four-minute mile]] at the [[Iffley Road]] running track in Oxford.

These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology, inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the arts, as society began to see itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford were supported by the Church in the hope of reconciling [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]].

By the early 1970s over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the huge Morris Motors and [[Pressed Steel Fisher]] plants. Oxford was now a city of two halves: the university city to the west of [[Magdalen Bridge]] and the car town to the east. This led to the witticism that \"Oxford is the left bank of Cowley\". Cowley suffered major job losses in the 1980s and 1990s during the decline of [[British Leyland]], but is now producing the successful [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] for [[BMW]] on a smaller site.

The principal production site for [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] cars, owned by [[BMW]] since 2000, is in the Oxford suburb of [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]]. The plant, which survived the threat of closure in the early 1990s, also produced cars under the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Rover Group|Rover]] brands following the demise of the Morris brand in 1984, although the last Morris-badged car was produced there in 1982.\n\n===Publishing===\n[[Oxford University Press]], a department of the University of Oxford, is based in the city, although it no longer operates its own paper mill and printing house. The city is also home to the UK operations of [[Wiley-Blackwell]], [[Elsevier]] and several smaller publishing houses.\n\n===Science and technology===\nThe presence of the university has given rise to many science and technology based businesses, including [[Oxford Instruments]], [[Research Machines]] and [[Sophos]]. The university established [[Isis Innovation]] in 1987 to promote technology transfer. The [[Oxford Science Park]] was established in 1990, and the [[Begbroke Science Park]], owned by the university, lies north of the city.\n\nOxford increasingly has a reputation for being a centre of digital innovation, as epitomized by Digital Oxford.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Home \u2013 Digital Oxford|url = http://digitaloxford.com/|website = Digital Oxford|accessdate = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150509055659/http://digitaloxford.com/|archive-date = 9 May 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Several startups including Passle,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Passle \u2013 become a thought leader|url = http://passle.net|website = Passle: Don't have time to blog?|accessdate = 3 June 2015}}</ref> Brainomix,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Brainomix|url = https://www.brainomix.com/|website = Brainomix|accessdate = 5 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150708091626/https://www.brainomix.com/|archive-date = 8 July 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> [[Labstep]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Labstep|url = https://angel.co/labstep|website = angel.co|accessdate = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603230831/https://angel.co/labstep|archive-date = 3 June 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> and more, are based in Oxford.\n\n===Education===\nThe presence of the university has also led to Oxford becoming a centre for the education industry.

Several of the colleges had private breweries, one of which, at [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], survived until 1889.

His father, Chesney Baker Sr., was a professional guitarist, and his mother, Vera Moser, was a pianist who worked in a perfume factory. His maternal grandmother was Norwegian.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gavin |first=James |title=Deep In A Dream: The Long Night Of Chet Baker |page=10 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2011 |isbn=9781569767573}}</ref> Baker said that due to the Great Depression, his father, though talented, had to quit as a musician and take a regular job.\n\nBaker began his musical career singing in a church choir. His father gave him a trombone, which was replaced with a trumpet when the trombone proved too large. His mother said that he had begun to memorize tunes on the radio before he was given an instrument. After \"falling in love\" with the trumpet, he improved noticeably in two weeks. Peers called Baker a natural musician to whom playing came effortlessly.<ref name=\"documentary\">''[[Let's Get Lost (1988 film)|Let's Get Lost]]'' (1988) documentary by [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]]</ref>\n\nBaker received some musical education at Glendale Junior High School, but he left school at the age of 16 in 1946 to join the [[United States Army]]. He was assigned to Berlin, Germany, where he joined the 298th Army Band. After leaving the Army in 1948, he studied music theory and harmony at [[El Camino College]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chet-baker-mn0000094210/biography|title=Chet Baker|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref> He dropped out during his second year to re-enlist.

Rather than playing identical melody lines in unison like Parker and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], Baker and Mulligan complemented each other with counterpoint and anticipating what the other would play next. \"[[My Funny Valentine]]\", with a solo by Baker, became a hit and would be associated with Baker for the rest of his career.<ref>{{cite web|author=Davis Inman|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/01/chet-baker-my-funny-valentine/|title=Chet Baker, 'My Funny Valentine' |work=American Songwriter |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref> With the Quartet, Baker was a regular performer at Los Angeles jazz clubs such as [[The Haig]] and the [[Tiffany Club]].<ref name=\"documentary\"/>\n\nWithin a year, Mulligan was arrested and imprisoned on drug charges. Baker formed a quartet with a rotation that included pianist [[Russ Freeman (pianist)|Russ Freeman]], bassists [[Bob Whitlock (musician)|Bob Whitlock]], [[Carson Smith (musician)|Carson Smith]], [[Joe Mondragon]], and Jimmy Bond, and drummers [[Larry Bunker]], Bob Neel, and [[Shelly Manne]]. Baker's quartet released popular albums between 1953 and 1956. Baker won reader's polls at ''[[Metronome (magazine)|Metronome]]'' and ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine, beating trumpeters Miles Davis and Clifford Brown. In 1954, readers named Baker the top jazz vocalist. In 1956, [[Pacific Jazz Records]] released ''[[Chet Baker Sings]]'', an album that increased his visibility and drew criticism. Nevertheless, Baker sang throughout the rest of his career.\n\nHollywood studios saw an opportunity in Baker's chiseled features. He made his acting debut in the film ''[[Hell's Horizon]]'', released in the fall of 1955. He declined a studio contract, preferring life on the road as a musician. Over the next few years, Baker led his own combos, including a 1955 quintet with [[Francy Boland]], where Baker combined playing trumpet and singing. In 1956 he completed an eight-month tour of Europe, where he recorded ''Chet Baker in Europe.''<ref name=\"Inc.1956\">{{cite journal|title=Review spotlight on...

Freeman was Baker's musical director after Baker left the Mulligan quartet. Sometimes Baker pawned his instruments to buy drugs. During the 1960s, he was imprisoned in Italy on drug charges and was expelled from Germany and the UK on drug-related offences. He was deported to the U.S. from Germany for getting into trouble with the law a second time.

In the film ''[[Let's Get Lost (1988 film)|Let's Get Lost]]'', Baker said an acquaintance attempted to rob him but backed off, only to return the next night with a group of men who chased him. He entered a car and became surrounded. Instead of rescuing him, the people inside the car pushed him back out onto the street, where the chase continued. He received cuts and one of his teeth was cracked.

He moved to New York City and began performing and recording again, including with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]]. Later in the 1970s, Baker returned to Europe, where he was assisted by his friend Diane Vavra, who took care of his personal needs and helped him during his recording and performance dates.\n\nFrom 1978 until his death in 1988, Baker lived and played almost exclusively in Europe, returning to the U.S. once a year for a few performances. This was Baker's most prolific era as a recording artist.\n\nIn 1983, British singer [[Elvis Costello]], a longtime fan of Baker, hired the trumpeter to play a solo on his song \"[[Shipbuilding (song)|Shipbuilding]]\" for the album ''[[Punch the Clock]]''. The song exposed Baker's music to a new audience. Later, Baker often featured Costello's song \"[[Almost Blue (song)|Almost Blue]]\" (inspired by Baker's version of Ray Henderson\u2019s \u201cThe Thrill Is Gone;\" not to be confused with the Roy Hawkins song of the same name, made famous by B.B. King) in his concert sets, and recorded the song for ''Let's Get Lost''.\n\nIn 1986, ''Chet Baker: Live at Ronnie Scott's London'' presents Baker in an intimate stage performance filmed with Elvis Costello and [[Van Morrison]] as he performs a set of standards and classics, including \"Just Friends\", \"My Ideal\", and \"Shifting Down\". Augmenting the music, Baker speaks one-on-one with friend and colleague Costello about his childhood, career, and struggle with drugs.\n\nBaker recorded the live album ''Chet Baker in Tokyo'' with his quartet featuring pianist [[Harold Danko]], bassist [[Hein Van de Geyn]] and drummer [[John Engels]] less than a year before his death, and it was released posthumously. ''Silent Nights'', a recording of Christmas music, was recorded with Christopher Mason in New Orleans in 1986 and released in 1987.\n\nIn 2006, \"Jazz Icons: Chet Baker: Live in '64 & '79\" was released, featuring two European concerts filmed 15 years apart. The 1964 performance took place in a Belgian TV studio, and the 1979 set was recorded in Norway. Other musicians featured are saxophonist Jacques Pelzer, French pianist Rene Urtreger, and vibraphonist [[Wolfgang Lackerschmid]]. Songs include the Miles Davis classic \"So What,\" the jazz standard \"Time After Time,\" \"Blue Train,\" and many others.

An Academy Award-nominated 1988 documentary about Baker, ''Let's Get Lost'', portrays him as a cultural icon of the 1950s, but juxtaposes this with his later image as a drug addict. The film, directed by fashion photographer [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], was shot in black-and-white and includes a series of interviews with friends, family (including his three children by third wife Carol Baker), associates and women friends, interspersed with film from Baker's earlier life, and with interviews with Baker from his last years. In ''Chet Baker, His Life and Music'', author De Valk and others criticize the film for presenting Baker as a washed-up musician in his later years. The film was shot during a few weeks in the first half of 1987, prior to highlights such as the Japanese concert.\n\n''Time after Time: The Chet Baker Project'', written by playwright James O'Reilly, toured Canada in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2001/legit/reviews/time-after-time-the-chet-baker-project-1200467920/ |title=Time After Time: The Chet Baker Project |first=Robert |last=Crew |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 6, 2001 |access-date=November 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nJeroen de Valk has written a biography of Baker: ''Chet Baker: His Life and Music'' is the English translation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jeroendevalk.nl/ |title=Jeroen de Valk: tekst & muziek |work=Jeroendevalk.nl |date= |access-date=December 18, 2013 |language=Dutch}}</ref> Other biographies include James Gavin's ''Deep in a Dream\u2014The Long Night of Chet Baker'', and Matthew Ruddick's ''Funny Valentine''.

His father gave him a trombone, which was replaced with a trumpet when the trombone proved too large. His mother said that he had begun to memorize tunes on the radio before he was given an instrument. After \"falling in love\" with the trumpet, he improved noticeably in two weeks. Peers called Baker a natural musician to whom playing came effortlessly.<ref name=\"documentary\">''[[Let's Get Lost (1988 film)|Let's Get Lost]]'' (1988) documentary by [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]]</ref>\n\nBaker received some musical education at Glendale Junior High School, but he left school at the age of 16 in 1946 to join the [[United States Army]]. He was assigned to Berlin, Germany, where he joined the 298th Army Band. After leaving the Army in 1948, he studied music theory and harmony at [[El Camino College]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chet-baker-mn0000094210/biography|title=Chet Baker|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref> He dropped out during his second year to re-enlist.

Rather than playing identical melody lines in unison like Parker and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], Baker and Mulligan complemented each other with counterpoint and anticipating what the other would play next. \"[[My Funny Valentine]]\", with a solo by Baker, became a hit and would be associated with Baker for the rest of his career.<ref>{{cite web|author=Davis Inman|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/01/chet-baker-my-funny-valentine/|title=Chet Baker, 'My Funny Valentine' |work=American Songwriter |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref> With the Quartet, Baker was a regular performer at Los Angeles jazz clubs such as [[The Haig]] and the [[Tiffany Club]].<ref name=\"documentary\"/>\n\nWithin a year, Mulligan was arrested and imprisoned on drug charges. Baker formed a quartet with a rotation that included pianist [[Russ Freeman (pianist)|Russ Freeman]], bassists [[Bob Whitlock (musician)|Bob Whitlock]], [[Carson Smith (musician)|Carson Smith]], [[Joe Mondragon]], and Jimmy Bond, and drummers [[Larry Bunker]], Bob Neel, and [[Shelly Manne]]. Baker's quartet released popular albums between 1953 and 1956. Baker won reader's polls at ''[[Metronome (magazine)|Metronome]]'' and ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine, beating trumpeters Miles Davis and Clifford Brown. In 1954, readers named Baker the top jazz vocalist. In 1956, [[Pacific Jazz Records]] released ''[[Chet Baker Sings]]'', an album that increased his visibility and drew criticism. Nevertheless, Baker sang throughout the rest of his career.\n\nHollywood studios saw an opportunity in Baker's chiseled features. He made his acting debut in the film ''[[Hell's Horizon]]'', released in the fall of 1955. He declined a studio contract, preferring life on the road as a musician. Over the next few years, Baker led his own combos, including a 1955 quintet with [[Francy Boland]], where Baker combined playing trumpet and singing. In 1956 he completed an eight-month tour of Europe, where he recorded ''Chet Baker in Europe.''<ref name=\"Inc.1956\">{{cite journal|title=Review spotlight on...

During the 1960s, he was imprisoned in Italy on drug charges and was expelled from Germany and the UK on drug-related offences. He was deported to the U.S. from Germany for getting into trouble with the law a second time.

In the film ''[[Let's Get Lost (1988 film)|Let's Get Lost]]'', Baker said an acquaintance attempted to rob him but backed off, only to return the next night with a group of men who chased him. He entered a car and became surrounded. Instead of rescuing him, the people inside the car pushed him back out onto the street, where the chase continued. He received cuts and one of his teeth was cracked.

He moved to New York City and began performing and recording again, including with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]]. Later in the 1970s, Baker returned to Europe, where he was assisted by his friend Diane Vavra, who took care of his personal needs and helped him during his recording and performance dates.\n\nFrom 1978 until his death in 1988, Baker lived and played almost exclusively in Europe, returning to the U.S. once a year for a few performances. This was Baker's most prolific era as a recording artist.\n\nIn 1983, British singer [[Elvis Costello]], a longtime fan of Baker, hired the trumpeter to play a solo on his song \"[[Shipbuilding (song)|Shipbuilding]]\" for the album ''[[Punch the Clock]]''. The song exposed Baker's music to a new audience. Later, Baker often featured Costello's song \"[[Almost Blue (song)|Almost Blue]]\" (inspired by Baker's version of Ray Henderson\u2019s \u201cThe Thrill Is Gone;\" not to be confused with the Roy Hawkins song of the same name, made famous by B.B. King) in his concert sets, and recorded the song for ''Let's Get Lost''.\n\nIn 1986, ''Chet Baker: Live at Ronnie Scott's London'' presents Baker in an intimate stage performance filmed with Elvis Costello and [[Van Morrison]] as he performs a set of standards and classics, including \"Just Friends\", \"My Ideal\", and \"Shifting Down\". Augmenting the music, Baker speaks one-on-one with friend and colleague Costello about his childhood, career, and struggle with drugs.\n\nBaker recorded the live album ''Chet Baker in Tokyo'' with his quartet featuring pianist [[Harold Danko]], bassist [[Hein Van de Geyn]] and drummer [[John Engels]] less than a year before his death, and it was released posthumously. ''Silent Nights'', a recording of Christmas music, was recorded with Christopher Mason in New Orleans in 1986 and released in 1987.\n\nIn 2006, \"Jazz Icons: Chet Baker: Live in '64 & '79\" was released, featuring two European concerts filmed 15 years apart. The 1964 performance took place in a Belgian TV studio, and the 1979 set was recorded in Norway. Other musicians featured are saxophonist Jacques Pelzer, French pianist Rene Urtreger, and vibraphonist [[Wolfgang Lackerschmid]]. Songs include the Miles Davis classic \"So What,\" the jazz standard \"Time After Time,\" \"Blue Train,\" and many others.

An Academy Award-nominated 1988 documentary about Baker, ''Let's Get Lost'', portrays him as a cultural icon of the 1950s, but juxtaposes this with his later image as a drug addict. The film, directed by fashion photographer [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], was shot in black-and-white and includes a series of interviews with friends, family (including his three children by third wife Carol Baker), associates and women friends, interspersed with film from Baker's earlier life, and with interviews with Baker from his last years. In ''Chet Baker, His Life and Music'', author De Valk and others criticize the film for presenting Baker as a washed-up musician in his later years. The film was shot during a few weeks in the first half of 1987, prior to highlights such as the Japanese concert.\n\n''Time after Time: The Chet Baker Project'', written by playwright James O'Reilly, toured Canada in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://variety.com/2001/legit/reviews/time-after-time-the-chet-baker-project-1200467920/ |title=Time After Time: The Chet Baker Project |first=Robert |last=Crew |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 6, 2001 |access-date=November 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nJeroen de Valk has written a biography of Baker: ''Chet Baker: His Life and Music'' is the English translation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jeroendevalk.nl/ |title=Jeroen de Valk: tekst & muziek |work=Jeroendevalk.nl |date= |access-date=December 18, 2013 |language=Dutch}}</ref> Other biographies include James Gavin's ''Deep in a Dream\u2014The Long Night of Chet Baker'', and Matthew Ruddick's ''Funny Valentine''.

It originated in the [[United States]] as a morning program block on the [[Disney Channel]]. Its programming was targeted at children ages 2\u20136, featuring a mix of live-action and [[list of animated television series|animated series]].\n\nThe Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel was rebranded as the [[Disney Junior]] block on Disney Channel on February 14, 2011. The 22 cable channels and blocks using the Playhouse Disney brand around the world were relaunched under the Disney Junior brand over the next two years, concluding with the rebranding of the Russian channel in November 2012.\n\n==History==\nPrior to Playhouse Disney's launch, Disney Channel had aired a lineup of preschool-targeted programs (which were mixed alongside animated series aimed at older children) during the morning hours since its debut in April 1983. On April 6, 1997, Disney Channel underwent a relaunch that signified the beginning of its full conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel, and its morning program block now utilized a similar graphics package for its promotions as that used for the channel's afternoon children's programs. After Disney Channel's preschool block premiered three new original series in 1998 (''[[PB&J Otter]]'', ''[[Rolie Polie Olie]]'', and ''[[Out of the Box (TV series)|Out of the Box]]''), the block rebranded as Playhouse Disney on February 1, 1999.\n\nOne of the Playhouse Disney block's most popular series was ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'', an educational live-action series from [[Jim Henson Productions]] that debuted in October 1997, focusing on the adventures of Bear (voice by [[Noel MacNeal]]); the series was named by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as one of the \"top 10 new shows for kids\" that year.<ref name=ks>{{cite news|last=Kidscreen Staff|title=A Salute to Disney Channel: Disney Channel time line|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21442-19980401/|accessdate=April 12, 2014|newspaper=KidScreen.com|date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> For the first three years of its run, the Playhouse Disney block originally aired each weekday from 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 2:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], and weekends from 6:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time. Following each program, which usually ran 23 minutes (most of which, with the exception of movies, aired without promotional interruption), the remainder of the time period was filled by either short segments and [[music video]]s (the latter of which were originally aired under the banner \"Feet Beat\") or an episode of an acquired short series.\n\nOn April 16, 2001, Playhouse Disney introduced a new on-air graphics package produced by motion graphics company Beehive;<ref>[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2002/June-1-2002/Opens-and-Logos.aspx Opens and Logos], ''Post Magazine'', June 1, 2002.</ref> actress [[Allyce Beasley]] began serving as the U.S. block's promo announcer at this time, a capacity she would hold until March 30, 2007. [[Radio Disney]] [[cross-promotion|cross-promoted]] the block by rebranding its \"Mickey and Minnie's Tune Time\" block as \"Playhouse Disney\", and in 2002, the TV block's \"Feet Beat\" interstitials were renamed \"[[B. B. Good|B.B.]]'s Music Time\" to promote the Radio Disney block. On June 25, 2001, Disney-ABC Cable Networks Group (now Disney-ABC Television Group) announced plans to launch Playhouse Disney Channel, a companion [[digital cable]] and satellite channel that would have served the same target audience as the Disney Channel block;<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624034312/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76166895.html Play nice now; Walt Disney Co. plans to introduce Playhouse Disney Channel], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'' (via HighBeam Research), June 25, 2001.</ref><ref name=wsj>{{cite news|last1=Beatty|first1=Sally|title=Disney Plans to Launch New Cable Network, Aiming Programming at Preschool Audience|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB993071891973180362|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=June 21, 2001}}</ref> plans for the network were later scrapped, although Disney-ABC International Television would launch dedicated Playhouse Disney Channels in international markets (including [[Canada]] and [[Latin America]]) between 2002 and 2007. The Walt Disney Company acquired the broadcast rights to ''[[The Wiggles]]'' as part of their purchase of the [[Fox Family Channel]] in 2001; ''The Wiggles'' moved to Playhouse Disney in June 2002 and became one of the block's most watched shows during its run.\n\nLike Disney Channel, Playhouse Disney was a commercial-free service, but it did show short \"promotional spots\" (structured as short-form segments for Disney products targeted at the block's demographics) along with \u2013 beginning in 2002 \u2013 [[underwriting|underwriter sponsorships]] (with companies such as [[McDonald's]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oei|first1=Lily|title=Nick's Noggin nabs sponsors|url=https://variety.com/2004/tv/news/nick-s-noggin-nabs-sponsors-1117897987/|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Variety|date=January 7, 2004}}</ref>) within breaks between programs<ref>{{cite web | title = Playhouse Disney schedule | url = http://tv.disney.go.com/playhouse/grown-ups/tvschedule.html | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}</ref> (preschool-targeted programs that aired between 3:00 and 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Central Time outside of the Playhouse Disney banner, included the promotional shorts for Disney entertainment products that were seen during Disney Channel's afternoon and nighttime schedule). On October 7, 2002, Playhouse Disney changed its logo to reflect Disney Channel's on-air rebranding. As part of the block's effort to phase out its older interstitial material, it introduced a mascot in September named Clay (voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]]), an anthropomorphic clay figure who often used the catchphrases \"It's true!\" and \"Are you with me?\".\n\nOn March 31, 2007, Clay was replaced by two anthropomorphic monkey puppets as the block's hosts, Ooh and Aah (who served as the main characters for one of the short series featured on the Playhouse Disney lineup, ''[[Ooh, Aah & You]]''). Beginning in 2007, Disney Channel began truncating the weekday block to four hours (from 5:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time) during the summer months, in order to air episodes of Disney Channel original series during the late morning and early afternoon hours; however, the weekend schedule continued to air as a seven-hour block. By this point, the Playhouse Disney block had expanded to air from 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays, and 4:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time on weekends, each running a different schedule.\n\n===Disney Junior===\n{{see also|Disney Junior}}\nOn May 26, 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced the launch of Disney Junior, a relaunching of Playhouse Disney that would serve as the brand for the Disney Channel block and a new standalone digital cable and satellite channel in the United States, as well as the new brand for the 22 existing Playhouse Disney-branded cable channels and program blocks worldwide.<ref name=\"PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/business/media/27disney.html?src=busln PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2010.</ref><ref name=\"EW\">[http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior SOAPnet Will Go Dark to Make Way for Disney Junior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527032646/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', May 26, 2010.</ref> The Playhouse Disney block ended its 14-year run on February 13, 2011, with the last program to air being an episode of the short series ''Handy Manny's School for Tools'' at 1:55&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Disney Junior block debuted on February 14, 2011,<ref>{{cite web |first=Christy|last=Grosz |url=https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/disney-junior-acing-frosh-year-1118043061/ |title=Disney Junior acing frosh year |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 26, 2011 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref> with ''[[Little Einsteins]]'' as its first program.<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart|last=Levine |url=https://variety.com/2010/scene/markets-festivals/doc-mcstuffins-set-for-disney-1118021002/ |title=\"Doc McStuffins\" Set for Disney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 24, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/disney-junior-to-debut-in-february-2011-on-disney-channel/ |title=Disney Junior to Debut In February 2011 on Disney Channel |publisher=Disney Junior |via=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=November 5, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sofia M.|last=Fernandez |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-junior-shifts-focus-educational-35845 |title=Disney Junior Shifts Focus Away From Educational Programming |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 4, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=None of these sources even mention ''Little Einsteins''.|date=September 2019}} Several former Playhouse Disney series were carried over to the relaunched block including ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', ''[[Imagination Movers (TV series)|Imagination Movers]]'', ''[[Handy Manny]]'', and ''[[Little Einsteins]]''.

television|satellite]] [[television channel]] that was owned by the [[Disney Channels Worldwide]] unit of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Disney\u2013ABC Television Group]]. It originated in the [[United States]] as a morning program block on the [[Disney Channel]]. Its programming was targeted at children ages 2\u20136, featuring a mix of live-action and [[list of animated television series|animated series]].\n\nThe Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel was rebranded as the [[Disney Junior]] block on Disney Channel on February 14, 2011. The 22 cable channels and blocks using the Playhouse Disney brand around the world were relaunched under the Disney Junior brand over the next two years, concluding with the rebranding of the Russian channel in November 2012.\n\n==History==\nPrior to Playhouse Disney's launch, Disney Channel had aired a lineup of preschool-targeted programs (which were mixed alongside animated series aimed at older children) during the morning hours since its debut in April 1983. On April 6, 1997, Disney Channel underwent a relaunch that signified the beginning of its full conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel, and its morning program block now utilized a similar graphics package for its promotions as that used for the channel's afternoon children's programs. After Disney Channel's preschool block premiered three new original series in 1998 (''[[PB&J Otter]]'', ''[[Rolie Polie Olie]]'', and ''[[Out of the Box (TV series)|Out of the Box]]''), the block rebranded as Playhouse Disney on February 1, 1999.\n\nOne of the Playhouse Disney block's most popular series was ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'', an educational live-action series from [[Jim Henson Productions]] that debuted in October 1997, focusing on the adventures of Bear (voice by [[Noel MacNeal]]); the series was named by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as one of the \"top 10 new shows for kids\" that year.<ref name=ks>{{cite news|last=Kidscreen Staff|title=A Salute to Disney Channel: Disney Channel time line|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21442-19980401/|accessdate=April 12, 2014|newspaper=KidScreen.com|date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> For the first three years of its run, the Playhouse Disney block originally aired each weekday from 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 2:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], and weekends from 6:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time. Following each program, which usually ran 23 minutes (most of which, with the exception of movies, aired without promotional interruption), the remainder of the time period was filled by either short segments and [[music video]]s (the latter of which were originally aired under the banner \"Feet Beat\") or an episode of an acquired short series.\n\nOn April 16, 2001, Playhouse Disney introduced a new on-air graphics package produced by motion graphics company Beehive;<ref>[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2002/June-1-2002/Opens-and-Logos.aspx Opens and Logos], ''Post Magazine'', June 1, 2002.</ref> actress [[Allyce Beasley]] began serving as the U.S. block's promo announcer at this time, a capacity she would hold until March 30, 2007. [[Radio Disney]] [[cross-promotion|cross-promoted]] the block by rebranding its \"Mickey and Minnie's Tune Time\" block as \"Playhouse Disney\", and in 2002, the TV block's \"Feet Beat\" interstitials were renamed \"[[B. B. Good|B.B.]]'s Music Time\" to promote the Radio Disney block. On June 25, 2001, Disney-ABC Cable Networks Group (now Disney-ABC Television Group) announced plans to launch Playhouse Disney Channel, a companion [[digital cable]] and satellite channel that would have served the same target audience as the Disney Channel block;<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624034312/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76166895.html Play nice now; Walt Disney Co. plans to introduce Playhouse Disney Channel], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'' (via HighBeam Research), June 25, 2001.</ref><ref name=wsj>{{cite news|last1=Beatty|first1=Sally|title=Disney Plans to Launch New Cable Network, Aiming Programming at Preschool Audience|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB993071891973180362|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=June 21, 2001}}</ref> plans for the network were later scrapped, although Disney-ABC International Television would launch dedicated Playhouse Disney Channels in international markets (including [[Canada]] and [[Latin America]]) between 2002 and 2007. The Walt Disney Company acquired the broadcast rights to ''[[The Wiggles]]'' as part of their purchase of the [[Fox Family Channel]] in 2001; ''The Wiggles'' moved to Playhouse Disney in June 2002 and became one of the block's most watched shows during its run.\n\nLike Disney Channel, Playhouse Disney was a commercial-free service, but it did show short \"promotional spots\" (structured as short-form segments for Disney products targeted at the block's demographics) along with \u2013 beginning in 2002 \u2013 [[underwriting|underwriter sponsorships]] (with companies such as [[McDonald's]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oei|first1=Lily|title=Nick's Noggin nabs sponsors|url=https://variety.com/2004/tv/news/nick-s-noggin-nabs-sponsors-1117897987/|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Variety|date=January 7, 2004}}</ref>) within breaks between programs<ref>{{cite web | title = Playhouse Disney schedule | url = http://tv.disney.go.com/playhouse/grown-ups/tvschedule.html | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}</ref> (preschool-targeted programs that aired between 3:00 and 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Central Time outside of the Playhouse Disney banner, included the promotional shorts for Disney entertainment products that were seen during Disney Channel's afternoon and nighttime schedule). On October 7, 2002, Playhouse Disney changed its logo to reflect Disney Channel's on-air rebranding. As part of the block's effort to phase out its older interstitial material, it introduced a mascot in September named Clay (voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]]), an anthropomorphic clay figure who often used the catchphrases \"It's true!\" and \"Are you with me?\".\n\nOn March 31, 2007, Clay was replaced by two anthropomorphic monkey puppets as the block's hosts, Ooh and Aah (who served as the main characters for one of the short series featured on the Playhouse Disney lineup, ''[[Ooh, Aah & You]]''). Beginning in 2007, Disney Channel began truncating the weekday block to four hours (from 5:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time) during the summer months, in order to air episodes of Disney Channel original series during the late morning and early afternoon hours; however, the weekend schedule continued to air as a seven-hour block. By this point, the Playhouse Disney block had expanded to air from 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays, and 4:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time on weekends, each running a different schedule.\n\n===Disney Junior===\n{{see also|Disney Junior}}\nOn May 26, 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced the launch of Disney Junior, a relaunching of Playhouse Disney that would serve as the brand for the Disney Channel block and a new standalone digital cable and satellite channel in the United States, as well as the new brand for the 22 existing Playhouse Disney-branded cable channels and program blocks worldwide.<ref name=\"PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/business/media/27disney.html?src=busln PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2010.</ref><ref name=\"EW\">[http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior SOAPnet Will Go Dark to Make Way for Disney Junior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527032646/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', May 26, 2010.</ref> The Playhouse Disney block ended its 14-year run on February 13, 2011, with the last program to air being an episode of the short series ''Handy Manny's School for Tools'' at 1:55&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Disney Junior block debuted on February 14, 2011,<ref>{{cite web |first=Christy|last=Grosz |url=https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/disney-junior-acing-frosh-year-1118043061/ |title=Disney Junior acing frosh year |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 26, 2011 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref> with ''[[Little Einsteins]]'' as its first program.<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart|last=Levine |url=https://variety.com/2010/scene/markets-festivals/doc-mcstuffins-set-for-disney-1118021002/ |title=\"Doc McStuffins\" Set for Disney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 24, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/disney-junior-to-debut-in-february-2011-on-disney-channel/ |title=Disney Junior to Debut In February 2011 on Disney Channel |publisher=Disney Junior |via=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=November 5, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sofia M.|last=Fernandez |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-junior-shifts-focus-educational-35845 |title=Disney Junior Shifts Focus Away From Educational Programming |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 4, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=None of these sources even mention ''Little Einsteins''.|date=September 2019}} Several former Playhouse Disney series were carried over to the relaunched block including ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', ''[[Imagination Movers (TV series)|Imagination Movers]]'', ''[[Handy Manny]]'', and ''[[Little Einsteins]]''.

Cycles range from its initial development to its eventual release, and include updated versions of the released version to help improve software or fix [[software bug]]s still present in the software.\n\nComputer users are most likely to be familiar with the ''beta'' phase, as software products are sometimes publicly advertised as being beta in order to reduce users' expectations of their reliability.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Google kept Gmail in \"beta\" for so many years.|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/07/why-google-kept-gmail-in-beta-for-so-many-years.html}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nUsage of the \"alpha/beta\" test terminology originated at [[IBM]]. Similar terminologies for IBM's software development were used by people involved with IBM from at least the 1950s (and probably earlier). \"A\" test was the [[software verification|verification]] of a new product before the public announcement. \"B\" test was the verification before releasing the product to be manufactured. \"C\" test was the final test before the general availability of the product. As software became a significant part of IBM's offerings, the alpha test terminology was used to denote the pre-announcement test and the beta test ?!mpjkjj\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM nkjjkuikjpjjferdgikiyiiwas used to show product readiness for general availability. Martin Belsky, a manager on some of IBM's earlier software projects claimed to have invented the terminology. IBM dropped the alpha/beta terminology during the 1960s, but by then it had received fairly wide notice. The usage of \"beta test\" to refer to testing done by customers was not done in IBM. Rather, IBM used the term \"field test\".\n\n== Stages of development ==\n=== Pre-alpha ===\nPre-alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project before formal testing. These activities can include [[requirements analysis]], [[software design]], [[software development]], and [[unit testing]]. In typical [[Open-source software|open source]] development, there are several types of pre-alpha versions. ''Milestone'' versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the feature is complete.\n\n=== {{anchor|Alpha}}Alpha ===\nThe alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin [[software testing]] (alpha is the first letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], used as the number 1). In this phase, developers generally test the software using [[white-box testing|white-box techniques]]. Additional validation is then performed using [[black-box testing|black-box]] or [[Grey box testing#Grey box testing|gray-box]] techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black-box testing inside the organization is known as ''alpha release''.<ref name=alphadef>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=alpha+version&i=37675,00.asp |title=Encyclopedia definition of alpha version |work=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2011-01-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427065905/http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3Dalpha%20version%26i%3D37675%2C00.asp |archivedate=2011-04-27 }}</ref>{{better source needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAlpha software is software that is not thoroughly tested by the developer before it is released to customers.

The alpha phase usually ends with a [[Freeze (software engineering)|feature freeze]], indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be [[feature complete]]. A beta test is carried out following [[acceptance testing]] at the supplier's site (alpha test) and immediately prior to general release of the software as a product.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Computer Science |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199688975 |pages=44 |edition=7th}}</ref>\n\n=== {{Anchor|BETA}}Beta ===\n{{Redirect|Beta test|the film|Beta Test (film)}}\n\nBeta, named after [[Beta|the second letter of the Greek alphabet]], is the software development phase following alpha. Software in the beta stage is also known as ''betaware''.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/betaware\n | title = Definition of betaware in the Free Online Encyclopedia\n | accessdate = 2015-04-06\n | website = thefreedictionary.com\n}}</ref> A Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=30}}</ref> Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software, speed or performance issues, and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating [[usability testing]]. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called ''beta release'' and this is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it. Software beta releases can either be public or private, depending on whether they are openly available or only available to a limited audience. Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization and to prospective customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a ''preview'', ''preview release'', ''prototype'', ''technical preview'' / ''technology preview'' (''TP''),<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview\n | title = Technology Preview Features Support Scope\n | accessdate = 2015-03-18\n | publisher = [[Red Hat]]\n}}</ref> or ''early access''. Since the introduction of [[Windows 8]], [[Microsoft]] has called pre-release software as a \"preview\", rather than beta. All pre-release builds released through the [[Windows Insider Program]] launched in 2014 are termed \"Insider Preview builds\". \"beta\" may also indicate something more like a [[#Release candidate|release candidate]], or as a form of time-limited demo, or marketing technique.<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-inconvenient-truths-behind-betas/a-2010051712402686048 The inconvenient truths behind betas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430173029/http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-inconvenient-truths-behind-betas/a-2010051712402686048 |date=2011-04-30 }}</ref>\n\n''Beta testers'' are people who actively report issues of beta software.

Web releases are becoming more common as Internet usage grows.\n\n== Support ==\nDuring its supported lifetime, software is sometimes subjected to service releases, [[patch (computing)|patches]] or [[service pack]]s, sometimes also called \"interim releases\" or \"maintenance release\" (MR). For example, Microsoft released three major service packs for the [[Microsoft Windows|32-bit]] editions of [[Windows XP]] and two service packs for the [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] editions. Such service releases contain a collection of updates, fixes, and enhancements, delivered in the form of a single installable package. They may also implement new features. Some software is released with the expectation of regular support. Classes of software that generally involve protracted support as the norm include [[Antivirus software|anti-virus suites]] and [[massively multiplayer online game]]s. Continuing with this Windows XP example, Microsoft did offer paid updates for five more years after the end of extended support.

Cycles range from its initial development to its eventual release, and include updated versions of the released version to help improve software or fix [[software bug]]s still present in the software.\n\nComputer users are most likely to be familiar with the ''beta'' phase, as software products are sometimes publicly advertised as being beta in order to reduce users' expectations of their reliability.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Google kept Gmail in \"beta\" for so many years.|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/07/why-google-kept-gmail-in-beta-for-so-many-years.html}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nUsage of the \"alpha/beta\" test terminology originated at [[IBM]]. Similar terminologies for IBM's software development were used by people involved with IBM from at least the 1950s (and probably earlier). \"A\" test was the [[software verification|verification]] of a new product before the public announcement. \"B\" test was the verification before releasing the product to be manufactured. \"C\" test was the final test before the general availability of the product. As software became a significant part of IBM's offerings, the alpha test terminology was used to denote the pre-announcement test and the beta test was used to show product readiness for general availability. Martin Belsky, a manager on some of IBM's earlier software projects claimed to have invented the terminology. IBM dropped the alpha/beta terminology during the 1960s, but by then it had received fairly wide notice. The usage of \"beta test\" to refer to testing done by customers was not done in IBM. Rather, IBM used the term \"field test\".\n\n== Stages of development ==\n=== Pre-alpha ===\nPre-alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project before formal testing. These activities can include [[requirements analysis]], [[software design]], [[software development]], and [[unit testing]]. In typical [[Open-source software|open source]] development, there are several types of pre-alpha versions. ''Milestone'' versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the feature is complete.\n\n=== {{anchor|Alpha}}Alpha ===\nThe alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin [[software testing]] (alpha is the first letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], used as the number 1). In this phase, developers generally test the software using [[white-box testing|white-box techniques]]. Additional validation is then performed using [[black-box testing|black-box]] or [[Grey box testing#Grey box testing|gray-box]] techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black-box testing inside the organization is known as ''alpha release''.<ref name=alphadef>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=alpha+version&i=37675,00.asp |title=Encyclopedia definition of alpha version |work=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2011-01-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427065905/http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0%2C2542%2Ct%3Dalpha%20version%26i%3D37675%2C00.asp |archivedate=2011-04-27 }}</ref>{{better source needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAlpha software is software that is not thoroughly tested by the developer before it is released to customers.

The alpha phase usually ends with a [[Freeze (software engineering)|feature freeze]], indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be [[feature complete]]. A beta test is carried out following [[acceptance testing]] at the supplier's site (alpha test) and immediately prior to general release of the software as a product.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Computer Science |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199688975 |pages=44 |edition=7th}}</ref>\n\n=== {{Anchor|BETA}}Beta ===\n{{Redirect|Beta test|the film|Beta Test (film)}}\n\nBeta, named after [[Beta|the second letter of the Greek alphabet]], is the software development phase following alpha.

The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating [[usability testing]]. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called ''beta release'' and this is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it. Software beta releases can either be public or private, depending on whether they are openly available or only available to a limited audience. Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization and to prospective customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a ''preview'', ''preview release'', ''prototype'', ''technical preview'' / ''technology preview'' (''TP''),<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview\n | title = Technology Preview Features Support Scope\n | accessdate = 2015-03-18\n | publisher = [[Red Hat]]\n}}</ref> or ''early access''. Since the introduction of [[Windows 8]], [[Microsoft]] has called pre-release software as a \"preview\", rather than beta. All pre-release builds released through the [[Windows Insider Program]] launched in 2014 are termed \"Insider Preview builds\". \"beta\" may also indicate something more like a [[#Release candidate|release candidate]], or as a form of time-limited demo, or marketing technique.<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-inconvenient-truths-behind-betas/a-2010051712402686048 The inconvenient truths behind betas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430173029/http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-inconvenient-truths-behind-betas/a-2010051712402686048 |date=2011-04-30 }}</ref>\n\n''Beta testers'' are people who actively report issues of beta software.
