{"title_page": "Species diversity", "text_new": "'''Species diversity''' is the number of different [[species]] that are represented in a given [[community (ecology)|community]] (a dataset). The effective number of species refers to the number of equally abundant species needed to obtain the same mean proportional species abundance as that observed in the dataset of interest (where all species may not be equally abundant). Meanings of species diversity may include [[species richness]], taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity, and/or [[species evenness]]. Species richness is a simple count of species. Taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity is the genetic relationship between different groups of species.  Species evenness quantifies how equal the [[Abundance (ecology)|abundances]] of the species are.<ref name=Hill1973>Hill, M. O. (1973) Diversity and evenness: a unifying notation and its consequences.

Defining beta diversity as a function of alpha and gamma diversity. Ecography, 33, 2-22. {{doi|10.1111/j.1600-0587.2009.05880.x}}</ref><ref name=Tuomisto2010c>Tuomisto, H. 2010. A consistent terminology for quantifying species diversity? Yes, it does exist. Oecologia 4: 853\u2013860. {{doi|10.1007/s00442-010-1812-0}}</ref>\n\n==Calculation of diversity==\n\nSpecies diversity in a dataset can be calculated by first taking the [[weighted average]] of species proportional abundances in the dataset, and then taking the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] of this. The equation is:<ref name=Hill1973 /><ref name=Tuomisto2010a /><ref name=Tuomisto2010c />\n\n:<math>{}^q\\!D={1 \\over \\sqrt[q-1]{{\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i p_i^{q-1}}}}</math>\n\nThe [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]] equals mean proportional species abundance in the dataset as calculated with the weighted [[generalized mean]] with exponent ''q'' - 1. In the equation, ''S'' is the total number of species (species richness) in the dataset, and the proportional abundance of the ''i''th species is <math>p_{i}</math>. The proportional abundances themselves are used as weights.\nThe equation is often written in the equivalent form:\n\n:<math>{}^q\\!D=\\left ( {\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i^q} \\right )^{1/(1-q)}</math>\n\nThe value of ''q'' determines which mean is used. ''q'' = 0 corresponds to the weighted [[harmonic mean]], which is 1/''S'' because the <math>p_{i}</math> values cancel out, with the result that <sup>''0''</sup>''D'' is equal to the number of species or species richness, ''S''. ''q'' = 1 is undefined, except that the limit as ''q'' approaches 1 is well defined:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{q \\rightarrow 1} {}^q\\!D = \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i \\ln p_i\\right)</math>\n''q'' = 2 corresponds to the [[arithmetic mean]]. As ''q'' approaches [[infinity]], the generalized mean approaches the maximum <math>p_{i}</math> value. In practice, ''q'' modifies species weighting, such that increasing ''q'' increases the weight given to the most abundant species, and fewer equally abundant species are hence needed to reach mean proportional abundance. Consequently, large values of ''q'' lead to smaller species diversity than small values of ''q'' for the same dataset. If all species are equally abundant in the dataset, changing the value of ''q'' has no effect, but species diversity at any value of ''q'' equals species richness.\n\nNegative values of ''q'' are not used, because then the effective number of species (diversity) would exceed the actual number of species (richness). As ''q'' approaches negative infinity, the generalized mean approaches the minimum <math>p_{i}</math> value. In many real datasets, the least abundant species is represented by a single individual, and then the effective number of species would equal the number of individuals in the dataset.<ref name=Tuomisto2010a /><ref name=Tuomisto2010c />\n\nThe same equation can be used to calculate the diversity in relation to any classification, not only species. If the individuals are classified into genera or functional types, <math>p_{i}</math> represents the proportional abundance of the ''i''th genus or functional type, and <sup>''q''</sup>''D'' equals genus diversity or functional type diversity, respectively.\n\n==Diversity indices==\n\nOften researchers have used the values given by one or more diversity indices to quantify species diversity. Such indices include [[species richness]], the [[Shannon index]], the [[Simpson index]], and the complement of the Simpson index (also known as the Gini-Simpson index).<ref>Krebs, C. J. (1999) Ecological Methodology. Second edition. Addison-Wesley, California.</ref><ref>Magurran, A. E. (2004) Measuring biological diversity. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford.</ref><ref name=Jost2006>Jost, L. (2006) Entropy and diversity. Oikos, 113, 363\u2013375</ref>\n\nWhen interpreted in ecological terms, each one of these indices corresponds to a different thing, and their values are therefore not directly comparable. Species richness quantifies the actual rather than effective number of species. The Shannon index equals log(<sup>''q''</sup>''D''), and in practice quantifies the uncertainty in the species identity of an individual that is taken at random from the dataset. The Simpson index equals 1/<sup>''q''</sup>''D'' and quantifies the probability that two individuals taken at random from the dataset (with replacement of the first individual before taking the second) represent the same species.

The effective number of species refers to the number of equally abundant species needed to obtain the same mean proportional species abundance as that observed in the dataset of interest (where all species may not be equally abundant). Meanings of species diversity may include [[species richness]], taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity, and/or [[species evenness]]. Species richness is a simple count of species. Taxonomic or phylogenetic diversity is the genetic relationship between different groups of species.  Species evenness quantifies how equal the [[Abundance (ecology)|abundances]] of the species are.<ref name=Hill1973>Hill, M. O. (1973) Diversity and evenness: a unifying notation and its consequences.

The equation is:<ref name=Hill1973 /><ref name=Tuomisto2010a /><ref name=Tuomisto2010c />\n\n:<math>{}^q\\!D={1 \\over \\sqrt[q-1]{{\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i p_i^{q-1}}}}</math>\n\nThe [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]] equals mean proportional species abundance in the dataset as calculated with the weighted [[generalized mean]] with exponent ''q'' - 1. In the equation, ''S'' is the total number of species (species richness) in the dataset, and the proportional abundance of the ''i''th species is <math>p_{i}</math>. The proportional abundances themselves are used as weights.\nThe equation is often written in the equivalent form:\n\n:<math>{}^q\\!D=\\left ( {\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i^q} \\right )^{1/(1-q)}</math>\n\nThe value of ''q'' determines which mean is used. ''q'' = 0 corresponds to the weighted [[harmonic mean]], which is 1/''S'' because the <math>p_{i}</math> values cancel out, with the result that <sup>''0''</sup>''D'' is equal to the number of species or species richness, ''S''. ''q'' = 1 is undefined, except that the limit as ''q'' approaches 1 is well defined:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{q \\rightarrow 1} {}^q\\!D = \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^S p_i \\ln p_i\\right)</math>\n''q'' = 2 corresponds to the [[arithmetic mean]]. As ''q'' approaches [[infinity]], the generalized mean approaches the maximum <math>p_{i}</math> value. In practice, ''q'' modifies species weighting, such that increasing ''q'' increases the weight given to the most abundant species, and fewer equally abundant species are hence needed to reach mean proportional abundance. Consequently, large values of ''q'' lead to smaller species diversity than small values of ''q'' for the same dataset. If all species are equally abundant in the dataset, changing the value of ''q'' has no effect, but species diversity at any value of ''q'' equals species richness.\n\nNegative values of ''q'' are not used, because then the effective number of species (diversity) would exceed the actual number of species (richness). As ''q'' approaches negative infinity, the generalized mean approaches the minimum <math>p_{i}</math> value. In many real datasets, the least abundant species is represented by a single individual, and then the effective number of species would equal the number of individuals in the dataset.<ref name=Tuomisto2010a /><ref name=Tuomisto2010c />\n\nThe same equation can be used to calculate the diversity in relation to any classification, not only species. If the individuals are classified into genera or functional types, <math>p_{i}</math> represents the proportional abundance of the ''i''th genus or functional type, and <sup>''q''</sup>''D'' equals genus diversity or functional type diversity, respectively.\n\n==Diversity indices==\n\nOften researchers have used the values given by one or more diversity indices to quantify species diversity. Such indices include [[species richness]], the [[Shannon index]], the [[Simpson index]], and the complement of the Simpson index (also known as the Gini-Simpson index).<ref>Krebs, C. J. (1999) Ecological Methodology. Second edition. Addison-Wesley, California.</ref><ref>Magurran, A. E. (2004) Measuring biological diversity. Blackwell Publishing, Oxford.</ref><ref name=Jost2006>Jost, L. (2006) Entropy and diversity. Oikos, 113, 363\u2013375</ref>\n\nWhen interpreted in ecological terms, each one of these indices corresponds to a different thing, and their values are therefore not directly comparable. Species richness quantifies the actual rather than effective number of species. The Shannon index equals log(<sup>''q''</sup>''D''), and in practice quantifies the uncertainty in the species identity of an individual that is taken at random from the dataset. The Simpson index equals 1/<sup>''q''</sup>''D'' and quantifies the probability that two individuals taken at random from the dataset (with replacement of the first individual before taking the second) represent the same species. The Gini-Simpson index equals 1 - 1/<sup>''q''</sup>''D'' and quantifies the probability that the two randomly taken individuals represent different species.<ref name=Hill1973 /><ref name=Tuomisto2010a /><ref name=Tuomisto2010c /><ref name=Jost2006 /><ref>Jost, L.
