Magda is quarantined because of her lung disease. Ewa is almost deported, but Bruno ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), who is Jewish and claims to be from the [[Travelers' Aid Society]],  notices her and her fluency in English, bribes an officer to let her go, and takes her to his house. Knowing Ewa has to make money to get Magda released, Bruno lets her dance at the Bandits' Roost theater and prostitutes her. Bruno also becomes interested in her romantically.\n\nEwa looks for her expatriate relatives living in New York, but her uncle by marriage turns her in to the authorities; he says he had heard she had gotten in trouble for engaging in illicit behavior on the ship from Europe, and he wishes to distance himself from sheltering a prostitute. Policemen take her back to Ellis Island, and once again she is slated for deportation. While at Ellis Island Ewa watches a performance by Emil ([[Jeremy Renner]]) (Bruno's cousin, making a living as a performing [[illusionist]] called Orlando); after his performance he hands her a white rose. The next morning Bruno manages to get her released. \nEwa meets Emil again at the Bandit's Roost. Emil asks Ewa to come onstage to aid him in his mind reading trick, but the men in the audience start [[catcalling]] at Ewa. The scene ends in a brawl between Bruno and Emil and with Bruno and the girls being fired from the theater. Soon after Bruno has his \"doves\" parade around [[Central Park]] to attract men to sleep with them. Another encounter between Emil and Ewa proves Emil's feelings for her. Emil falls for Ewa, much to Bruno's discontent, which causes continued and intense conflicts between the two men. One violent conflict concludes with Bruno being jailed overnight.\n\nOne day, Emil sneaks into Bruno's home to see Ewa. While there, he promises to get her the money to save her sister so they can all leave New York together. Coincidentally, shortly after making such promise, Emil hides as Bruno returns. Bruno also makes a promise to Ewa: he is to arrange for her a meeting with her sister. But Emil interrupts Bruno, as he pulls out an unloaded gun and points it at Bruno. Emil pulls the trigger just to frighten him, but his attempt at intimidating Bruno backfires, as Bruno stabs him to death in apparent self-defense.\n\nOvercoming the shock and distress of the death, Bruno and Ewa dump Emil's body in the street at night to get rid of unwanted police investigations, but the police are told by another prostitute with whom Ewa had had conflicts that Ewa killed Emil. Bruno hides Ewa from the police, who then give him a severe beating and steal a large bundle of money he had been carrying. Ewa learns Bruno had enough money to pay for her sister's release all along but was hiding it from her as he did not want her to leave him. Bruno claims he has now had a change of heart and would help Ewa and her sister if he had any money. Ewa makes another contact with her aunt and successfully pleads for her aunt to give her the money for Magda. With it, Bruno pays his contact on Ellis Island to release Ewa's sister and gives them both tickets to [[New Jersey]]. Ewa and Magda leave, while a repentant Bruno stays in New York, intending to confess to the police about Emil's killing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Ewa Cybulska\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Bruno Weiss\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Orlando the Magician / Emil\n* [[Yelena Solovey]] as Rosie Hertz\n* [[Dagmara Dominczyk]] as Belva\n* [[Maja Wampuszyc]] as Aunt Edyta\n* [[Angela Sarafyan]] as Magda Cybulska\n* [[Ilia Volok]] as Wojtek\n* [[Antoni Corone]] as Thomas MacNally\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as Dr. Knox\n* [[Kevin Cannon]] as Missionary\n* [[Sofia Black D'Elia]] as Not Magda\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nDirector James Gray said ''The Immigrant'' is \"80% based on the recollections from my grandparents, who came to the United States in 1923\", and he described it as \"my most personal and autobiographical film to date\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/international/james-gray-im-very-bad-at-directing-actors-1200917847/|title=James Gray \u2013 'I'm Very Bad at Directing Actors'|work=Variety|first=Martin|last=Dale|date=December 4, 2013}}</ref> He was also inspired by [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s operas that comprise ''[[Il Trittico]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-james-gray-immigrant-marion-526204|title=Cannes: James Gray on 'The Immigrant,' Marion Cotillard and Returning to the Fest (Q&A)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Gregg|last=Kilday|date=May 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nJames Gray wrote the movie for [[Marion Cotillard]] and [[Joaquin Phoenix]].

One of them was this what Gray describes as a \"enigmatic, screwed-up, manipulative pimp who used to go to Ellis Island and cruise for women who came to the country by themselves.\" According to Gray in the 1920s, women trying to get into the U.S. by themselves were not let in specifically because they were targets for prostitution, but through bribery, canny pimps would get around these rules. And so a movie idea was born. Gray told that he had never seen a movie of that subject. \"Lower East Side, Ellis Island, pimps; it seemed very vivid to me. So I said, 'that sounds perfect,'\" he told. However, getting Cotillard on board wasn't as easy as he'd hoped. The director described sending the screenplay to Cotillard, but then having to wait seven days for an answer after she had promised to read the script over a weekend. \"Well, Sunday came and went and it was like getting a colonoscopy over a week,\" he said of the agonizing wait for an answer.<ref name=IndieWire>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/09/james-gray-marion-cotillard-discuss-how-they-came-together-for-next-years-period-piece-the-nightingale-106346/|title=James Gray & Marion Cotillard Discuss How They Came Together For Next Year\u2019s Period Piece \u2018The Nightingale\u2019|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|first=Rodrigo|last=Perez|date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nGray also stated that Cotillard is the best actor he's ever worked with.<ref name=IndieWire />\n\nBecause Gray wrote about 20 pages of dialogue in Polish, Cotillard had to learn Polish to take on the role and speak English with a credible Polish accent.

Magda is quarantined because of her lung disease. Ewa is almost deported, but Bruno ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), who is Jewish and claims to be from the [[Travelers' Aid Society]],  notices her and her fluency in English, bribes an officer to let her go, and takes her to his house. Knowing Ewa has to make money to get Magda released, Bruno lets her dance at the Bandits' Roost theater and prostitutes her. Bruno also becomes interested in her romantically.\n\nEwa looks for her expatriate relatives living in New York, but her uncle by marriage turns her in to the authorities; he says he had heard she had gotten in trouble for engaging in illicit behavior on the ship from Europe, and he wishes to distance himself from sheltering a prostitute. Policemen take her back to Ellis Island, and once again she is slated for deportation. While at Ellis Island Ewa watches a performance by Emil ([[Jeremy Renner]]) (Bruno's cousin, making a living as a performing [[illusionist]] called Orlando); after his performance he hands her a white rose. The next morning Bruno manages to get her released. \nEwa meets Emil again at the Bandit's Roost. Emil asks Ewa to come onstage to aid him in his mind reading trick, but the men in the audience start [[catcalling]] at Ewa. The scene ends in a brawl between Bruno and Emil and with Bruno and the girls being fired from the theater. Soon after Bruno has his \"doves\" parade around [[Central Park]] to attract men to sleep with them. Another encounter between Emil and Ewa proves Emil's feelings for her. Emil falls for Ewa, much to Bruno's discontent, which causes continued and intense conflicts between the two men. One violent conflict concludes with Bruno being jailed overnight.\n\nOne day, Emil sneaks into Bruno's home to see Ewa. While there, he promises to get her the money to save her sister so they can all leave New York together. Coincidentally, shortly after making such promise, Emil hides as Bruno returns. Bruno also makes a promise to Ewa: he is to arrange for her a meeting with her sister. But Emil interrupts Bruno, as he pulls out an unloaded gun and points it at Bruno. Emil pulls the trigger just to frighten him, but his attempt at intimidating Bruno backfires, as Bruno stabs him to death in apparent self-defense.\n\nOvercoming the shock and distress of the death, Bruno and Ewa dump Emil's body in the street at night to get rid of unwanted police investigations, but the police are told by another prostitute with whom Ewa had had conflicts that Ewa killed Emil. Bruno hides Ewa from the police, who then give him a severe beating and steal a large bundle of money he had been carrying. Ewa learns Bruno had enough money to pay for her sister's release all along but was hiding it from her as he did not want her to leave him. Bruno claims he has now had a change of heart and would help Ewa and her sister if he had any money. Ewa makes another contact with her aunt and successfully pleads for her aunt to give her the money for Magda. With it, Bruno pays his contact on Ellis Island to release Ewa's sister and gives them both tickets to [[New Jersey]]. Ewa and Magda leave, while a repentant Bruno stays in New York, intending to confess to the police about Emil's killing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Marion Cotillard]] as Ewa Cybulska\n* [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as Bruno Weiss\n* [[Jeremy Renner]] as Orlando the Magician / Emil\n* [[Yelena Solovey]] as Rosie Hertz\n* [[Dagmara Dominczyk]] as Belva\n* [[Maja Wampuszyc]] as Aunt Edyta\n* [[Angela Sarafyan]] as Magda Cybulska\n* [[Ilia Volok]] as Wojtek\n* [[Antoni Corone]] as Thomas MacNally\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as Dr. Knox\n* [[Kevin Cannon]] as Missionary\n* [[Sofia Black D'Elia]] as Not Magda\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nDirector James Gray said ''The Immigrant'' is \"80% based on the recollections from my grandparents, who came to the United States in 1923\", and he described it as \"my most personal and autobiographical film to date\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/international/james-gray-im-very-bad-at-directing-actors-1200917847/|title=James Gray \u2013 'I'm Very Bad at Directing Actors'|work=Variety|first=Martin|last=Dale|date=December 4, 2013}}</ref> He was also inspired by [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s operas that comprise ''[[Il Trittico]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-james-gray-immigrant-marion-526204|title=Cannes: James Gray on 'The Immigrant,' Marion Cotillard and Returning to the Fest (Q&A)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Gregg|last=Kilday|date=May 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nJames Gray wrote the movie for [[Marion Cotillard]] and [[Joaquin Phoenix]].

One of them was this what Gray describes as a \"enigmatic, screwed-up, manipulative pimp who used to go to Ellis Island and cruise for women who came to the country by themselves.\" According to Gray in the 1920s, women trying to get into the U.S. by themselves were not let in specifically because they were targets for prostitution, but through bribery, canny pimps would get around these rules. And so a movie idea was born. Gray told that he had never seen a movie of that subject. \"Lower East Side, Ellis Island, pimps; it seemed very vivid to me. So I said, 'that sounds perfect,'\" he told. However, getting Cotillard on board wasn't as easy as he'd hoped. The director described sending the screenplay to Cotillard, but then having to wait seven days for an answer after she had promised to read the script over a weekend. \"Well, Sunday came and went and it was like getting a colonoscopy over a week,\" he said of the agonizing wait for an answer.<ref name=IndieWire>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/09/james-gray-marion-cotillard-discuss-how-they-came-together-for-next-years-period-piece-the-nightingale-106346/|title=James Gray & Marion Cotillard Discuss How They Came Together For Next Year\u2019s Period Piece \u2018The Nightingale\u2019|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|first=Rodrigo|last=Perez|date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nGray also stated that Cotillard is the best actor he's ever worked with.<ref name=IndieWire />\n\nBecause Gray wrote about 20 pages of dialogue in Polish, Cotillard had to learn Polish to take on the role and speak English with a credible Polish accent.

He served as [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Prime Minister]] between 1 and 16 November 1918 and as [[List of heads of state of Hungary|President]] between 16 November 1918 and 21 March 1919. \n\n==Background and early career==\n\n\n[[File:Karolyiyoung.jpg|thumb|left|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi in [[Franzensbad]] around 1887.]]\n\n\n\n\n===Early life===\n\nThe K\u00e1rolyi family were an illustrious, extremely wealthy, [[Roman Catholic]] aristocratic family who had played an important role in Hungarian life since the 17th century.\nMih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi was born on March 4, 1875, in the K\u00e1rolyi Palace in the aristocratic palace district of Pest. K\u00e1rolyi, born of a cousin's marriage, thus born with a severe malformation: [[Cleft lip and cleft palate]], and his illness deeply determined his entire childhood and personality development. Her mother died early in Tuberculosis and her father soon remarried. Mih\u00e1ly was considered unsuitable for a more serious career by his father, because he was incapable of normal speech training. Mih\u00e1ly was raised with great devotion by his maternal grandmother.\n\nHe was raised with overcare with his older sister in the Castle of his grandmother at F\u00f3t, because Count Julius K\u00e1rolyi,  the politician father had not enough time for Mih\u00e1ly. At the age of 14, his grandmother sent him to a Viennese clinic and he underwent a special surgery to restore his palate and mouth. [7] The surgery proved to be a sharp turning point: After some weeks Mih\u00e1ly started to speak quickly, fluently and very elaborately, despite the family and relatives formerly thought that he is too dumb to speak. By this time, he was a relatively superficial aristocrat, but his knowledge and awareness was below that of his contemporaries. He was not interested in university lectures, he managed to pass his exams with the help of a tutor. His thinking and character were shaped by extracurricular influences: the traditional hatred towards the Habsburg dynasty and anti-German sentiment of his family, his foster father, the world-view of S\u00e1ndor K\u00e1rolyi in the 1848 revolution, his idea of organizing peasants into farming cooperatives. Based on his reading experiences, including the French Encyclop\u00e9die and Verne novels, he developed an idealistic devotion to the cause of world justice, unbroken optimistic faith in the fast development of science and technology, which will solve all problems of humankind. He obtained his law degree and, at the age of 24, became a rampant adult. He wanted to make up for what he had missed as a teenager, throwing himself into the nightlife, with striking vehemence; he spent his time ruthlessly, playing cards, having fun in hunting, living in French spa towns, attended many international horse races and early automobile racings in various European countries. Known for his card battles, his lone card losses and his \"dandy\" lifestyle, the young tycoon begins to get serious and turn to politics and public life.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:F\u00f3ti K\u00e1rolyi-kast\u00e9ly.jpg|thumb|One of his grandmother's castle complex of F\u00f3t, where Mih\u00e1ly grew up\nFile:Fehervarcsurgo kastelycivertanlegi4.jpg|thumb|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1rcsurg\u00f3 Castle\nFile:Nagym\u00e1gocs - Palace.jpg|thumb|Nagym\u00e1gocs - Palace\nFile:CivertanlegifotoFuzerradvany2.jpg|thumb|F\u00fcz\u00e9rradv\u00e1ny Castle\nFile:K\u00e1rolyi-palota, Budapest.jpg|thumb|K\u00e1rolyi-palota, Budapest downtown\nFile:K\u00e1rolyi-kast\u00e9ly (Kast\u00e9lyhotel Sasv\u00e1r) (5819. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k).jpg|Par\u00e1dsasv\u00e1r Castle\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n====Early Political career ====\n\nIn his youth, he was a wastrel, but as he grew older, he became devoted to more serious pursuits. In 1909, he became the President of the OMGE (National Agricultural Society), the main rural organization of the nobility. Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, K\u00e1rolyi gradually became more progressive and [[left-wing]] during his career.\n\nIn 1910, K\u00e1rolyi was elected to Parliament as a member of the opposition Party of Independence.\n\nIn January 1913, he was challenged to a duel by [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]], after refusing to shake Tisza's hand following a political disagreement.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=1913: The Defiant Swan Song|last=Cowles|first=Virginia|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=157-158|url-status=live}}</ref> The 34-bout duel with cavalry sabres lasted an hour until Tisza cut K\u00e1rolyi's arm and the seconds ended the duel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== World War I, political campaign for the Allied Powers===\nDuring the [[First World War]], the pro-Entente K\u00e1rolyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[Robert Paxton]]|author2=Julie Hessler|title=Europe in the Twentieth Century|publisher=[[CEngage Learning]]|year=2011|page=129|ISBN=9780495913191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5wTncOaHEQC&pg=PA129&dq=%22mih%C3%A1ly+k%C3%A1rolyi%22+pacifist+party&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN0YqCj_3YAhVJPRQKHb_YDCIQ6AEIRTAG#v=onepage&q=%22mih%C3%A1ly%20k%C3%A1rolyi%22&f=false}}</ref> K\u00e1rolyi made contact with British and French Entente diplomats behind the scenes in Switzerland during the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Deborah S.

K\u00e1rolyi argued for peace with the Allies, looser ties between Austria and Hungary, abolishing the property-based franchise requirements that allowed only 5.8% of the population to vote and run for office before the war, and giving women the right to vote and hold office. In particular, K\u00e1rolyi's demand in 1915 that veterans should be granted the right to vote won so much popular support that enraged the Prime Minister, Count [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]].  In 1916 K\u00e1rolyi broke off with his party, which had found his openly pro-Entente attitude to be too radical and dangerous for a war-time pacifist fraction in the parliament. Therefore K\u00e1rolyi formed a new party, called the United Party of Independence and of 1848, and generally known as the '''K\u00e1rolyi Party'''.\n\nIn January 1918, K\u00e1rolyi proclaimed himself a follower of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]].\n\n==Marriage and family ==\nOn 7 November 1914 in [[Budapest]], K\u00e1rolyi married Countess Katalin Andr\u00e1ssy de Cs\u00edkszentkir\u00e1ly et Krasznahorka, with whom he had three children. K\u00e1rolyi's wife was a member of one of Hungary's most powerful families, and this marriage won K\u00e1rolyi the protection of his influential father-in-law.\n\n==Leading the Democratic Republic==\n\nFollowing the [[Aster Revolution]] of October 1918, K\u00e1rolyi became leader of the nation. On 25 October 1918 K\u00e1rolyi had formed an opposition National Council. His reputation as an opponent of the much-hated war had thrust him into a role for which he was not suited.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} King-Emperor [[Karl I of Austria|Charles IV]] designated him as Prime Minister as a part of a desperate attempt to hold Hungary on to the [[Habsburgs]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} K\u00e1rolyi would have preferred to keep the monarchy and some link to [[Austria]] if possible. Only after Charles's withdrawal from government on 16 November 1918 made K\u00e1rolyi proclaim the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], with himself as Provisional President. On 11 January 1919 the National Council formally recognized him as President.\n\nThe [[Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d|Hungarian Royal Honv\u00e9d army]] still had more than 1,400,000 soldiers<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Martin Kitchen]]|title=Europe Between the Wars|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|page=190|ISBN=9781317867531|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36WsAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA190}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Ign\u00e1c Romsics|title=Dismantling of Historic Hungary: The Peace Treaty of Trianon, 1920 Issue 3 of CHSP Hungarian authors series East European monographs|publisher=Social Science Monographs|year=2002|page=62|ISBN=9780880335058}}</ref> when Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi was announced as prime minister of Hungary.

The Hungarian self-disarmament made the occupation of Hungary directly possible for the relatively small armies of Romania, the Franco-Serbian army and the armed forces of the newly established Czechoslovakia. During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation.\n\nMilitary and political events changed rapidly and drastically after the Hungarian disarmament. On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed southern borders. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

K\u00e1rolyi ruled Hungary through a National Council, transformed into the government that consisted of his party in alliance with the large [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] and the small Civic Radical Party led by [[Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi]].\n\nAt the same time, there existed various revolutionary councils, which were dominated by the Social Democrats, which were not unlike the ''[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s'' (Councils) that existed in [[Russia]] in 1917.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  This situation of [[Dual Power]] gave K\u00e1rolyi responsibility without much power while giving the Social Democrats power without much responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Mihaly-karolyi-II--outlawsdiary00tormuoft.png|thumb|250px|left|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi in a speech]]\nDuring their brief periods in power, K\u00e1rolyi and J\u00e1szi, who served as Nationalities Minister, tried to create an \"Eastern Switzerland\" by persuading the non-Magyar peoples of Hungary to stay as part of the new Hungarian Democratic Republic.\n\nAdditional trouble for the new government occurred over the question of the armistice. [[Austria-Hungary]] had signed the lenient [[Armistice of villa Giusti]] (close to [[Padua]], [[Italy]]) with the Allies on 3 November 1918. Since Hungary was now independent, some in the Cabinet argued that Hungary needed to sign a new armistice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Against his better judgement, K\u00e1rolyi agreed to this idea,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and had Hungary sign in November 1918, a new armistice with the Allies in [[Belgrade]] with the Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French General [[Louis Franchet d'Esperey]].\n\nGeneral Franchet d'Esperey treated the Hungarians with open contempt and imposed a much harsher armistice on the defeated nation than the Padua Armistice had.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This was the source of much criticism of K\u00e1rolyi, who had been expected \u2013 and who himself expected \u2013 the Allies to treat Hungary as a friend, not an enemy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Moreover, K\u00e1rolyi's opponents argued that by needlessly seeking a second armistice, K\u00e1rolyi had worsened Hungary's situation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFurthermore, the Social Democrats who were Hungary's largest party by far, frequently undercut K\u00e1rolyi and imposed their decisions on him without taking responsibility for their actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} K\u00e1rolyi wished to transfer almost all of the rural lands to the peasants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} To set an example, he gave all of his own vast family estates to his tenants. But this was the only land transfer that took place; the Social Democrats blocked any measures that might give the control of those lands to the peasantry on the grounds that it was promoting capitalism. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Mihaly-karolyi-reparto-tierras--outlawsdiary00tormuoft.png|thumb|250px|right|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi distributing his lands among the peasants.]]\nIn another equally unfortunate move, the pacific-minded K\u00e1rolyi had abolished almost all the Hungarian armed forces in November 1918.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} All through the winter of 1918\u201319, the [[Romanians]], the [[Yugoslavs]] and the Czechoslovaks often broke the armistice in order to seize more territory for themselves. After January 1919, K\u00e1rolyi ordered the build-up of a Hungarian army and started to consider the idea of an alliance with Soviet Russia, through K\u00e1rolyi was opposed to the idea of Communism in Hungary itself.\n\nIn addition, as Hungary had signed an armistice, not a peace treaty, the Allied blockade continued until such time as a peace treaty was signed. Hungary had suffered from food shortages throughout the war and deaths from starvation had become common from 1917 onwards. Furthermore,  the country had been overwhelmed with refugees from [[Transylvania]] and [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].\n\nMaking things worse was the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]] which had cut Hungary off from supplies of German [[coal]]. Hungary which possessed little coal depended upon German coal imports. Without coal, most had to live without heat in the winter of 1918\u201319, and the railroad network had gradually ceased to function. The collapse of railroads in their turn caused the collapse of industry and hence mass [[unemployment]].\n\nMaking things even worse was the economic incompetence of the government which printed more and more money, leading to massive [[inflation]] and even more impoverishment. K\u00e1rolyi's failure to improve living conditions or persuade the Allies to lift the blockade led to public criticism of K\u00e1rolyi.\n\nBaron [[Lajos Hatvany]] described K\u00e1rolyi's leadership well when he noted \"From the discussions no decisions arose, and from the decisions \u2013 no actions.

K\u00e1rolyi, born of a cousin's marriage, thus born with a severe malformation: [[Cleft lip and cleft palate]], and his illness deeply determined his entire childhood and personality development. Her mother died early in Tuberculosis and her father soon remarried. Mih\u00e1ly was considered unsuitable for a more serious career by his father, because he was incapable of normal speech training. Mih\u00e1ly was raised with great devotion by his maternal grandmother.\n\nHe was raised with overcare with his older sister in the Castle of his grandmother at F\u00f3t, because Count Julius K\u00e1rolyi,  the politician father had not enough time for Mih\u00e1ly. At the age of 14, his grandmother sent him to a Viennese clinic and he underwent a special surgery to restore his palate and mouth. [7] The surgery proved to be a sharp turning point: After some weeks Mih\u00e1ly started to speak quickly, fluently and very elaborately, despite the family and relatives formerly thought that he is too dumb to speak. By this time, he was a relatively superficial aristocrat, but his knowledge and awareness was below that of his contemporaries. He was not interested in university lectures, he managed to pass his exams with the help of a tutor. His thinking and character were shaped by extracurricular influences: the traditional hatred towards the Habsburg dynasty and anti-German sentiment of his family, his foster father, the world-view of S\u00e1ndor K\u00e1rolyi in the 1848 revolution, his idea of organizing peasants into farming cooperatives. Based on his reading experiences, including the French Encyclop\u00e9die and Verne novels, he developed an idealistic devotion to the cause of world justice, unbroken faith in the fast development of science and technology. He obtained his law degree and, at the age of 24, became a rampant adult. He wanted to make up for what he had missed as a teenager, throwing himself into the nightlife, with striking vehemence; he spent his time ruthlessly, playing cards, having fun in hunting, living in French spa towns, attended many international horse races and early automobile racings in various European countries.

K\u00e1rolyi argued for peace with the Allies, looser ties between Austria and Hungary, abolishing the property-based franchise requirements that allowed only 5.8% of the population to vote and run for office before the war, and giving women the right to vote and hold office. In particular, K\u00e1rolyi's demand in 1915 that veterans should be granted the right to vote won so much popular support that enraged the Prime Minister, Count [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]].  In 1916 K\u00e1rolyi broke off with his party, which had found his openly pro-Entente attitude to be too radical and dangerous for a war-time pacifist fraction in the parliament. Therefore K\u00e1rolyi formed a new party, called the United Party of Independence and of 1848, and generally known as the '''K\u00e1rolyi Party'''.\n\nIn January 1918, K\u00e1rolyi proclaimed himself a follower of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]].\n\n==Marriage and family ==\nOn 7 November 1914 in [[Budapest]], K\u00e1rolyi married Countess Katalin Andr\u00e1ssy de Cs\u00edkszentkir\u00e1ly et Krasznahorka, with whom he had three children. K\u00e1rolyi's wife was a member of one of Hungary's most powerful families, and this marriage won K\u00e1rolyi the protection of his influential father-in-law.\n\n==Leading the Democratic Republic==\n\nFollowing the [[Aster Revolution]] of October 1918, K\u00e1rolyi became leader of the nation. On 25 October 1918 K\u00e1rolyi had formed an opposition National Council.

The Hungarian self-disarmament made the occupation of Hungary directly possible for the relatively small armies of Romania, the Franco-Serbian army and the armed forces of the newly established Czechoslovakia. During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation.\n\nMilitary and political events changed rapidly and drastically after the Hungarian disarmament. On 5 November 1918, the Serbian army, with the help of the French army, crossed southern borders. On 8 November, the Czechoslovak Army crossed the northern borders, and on 13 November, the Romanian army crossed the eastern borders of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. On 13 November, K\u00e1rolyi signed an [[armistice]] with the Allied nations in [[Belgrade]]. It limited the size of the Hungarian army to six infantry and two cavalry divisions.<ref>Krizman B.

K\u00e1rolyi ruled Hungary through a National Council, transformed into the government that consisted of his party in alliance with the large [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] and the small Civic Radical Party led by [[Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi]].\n\nAt the same time, there existed various revolutionary councils, which were dominated by the Social Democrats, which were not unlike the ''[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s'' (Councils) that existed in [[Russia]] in 1917.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  This situation of [[Dual Power]] gave K\u00e1rolyi responsibility without much power while giving the Social Democrats power without much responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Mihaly-karolyi-II--outlawsdiary00tormuoft.png|thumb|250px|left|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi in a speech]]\nDuring their brief periods in power, K\u00e1rolyi and J\u00e1szi, who served as Nationalities Minister, tried to create an \"Eastern Switzerland\" by persuading the non-Magyar peoples of Hungary to stay as part of the new Hungarian Democratic Republic.\n\nAdditional trouble for the new government occurred over the question of the armistice. [[Austria-Hungary]] had signed the lenient [[Armistice of villa Giusti]] (close to [[Padua]], [[Italy]]) with the Allies on 3 November 1918. Since Hungary was now independent, some in the Cabinet argued that Hungary needed to sign a new armistice.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Against his better judgement, K\u00e1rolyi agreed to this idea,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and had Hungary sign in November 1918, a new armistice with the Allies in [[Belgrade]] with the Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French General [[Louis Franchet d'Esperey]].\n\nGeneral Franchet d'Esperey treated the Hungarians with open contempt and imposed a much harsher armistice on the defeated nation than the Padua Armistice had.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} This was the source of much criticism of K\u00e1rolyi, who had been expected \u2013 and who himself expected \u2013 the Allies to treat Hungary as a friend, not an enemy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Moreover, K\u00e1rolyi's opponents argued that by needlessly seeking a second armistice, K\u00e1rolyi had worsened Hungary's situation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFurthermore, the Social Democrats who were Hungary's largest party by far, frequently undercut K\u00e1rolyi and imposed their decisions on him without taking responsibility for their actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} K\u00e1rolyi wished to transfer almost all of the rural lands to the peasants.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} To set an example, he gave all of his own vast family estates to his tenants. But this was the only land transfer that took place; the Social Democrats blocked any measures that might give the control of those lands to the peasantry on the grounds that it was promoting capitalism. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:Mihaly-karolyi-reparto-tierras--outlawsdiary00tormuoft.png|thumb|250px|right|Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi distributing his lands among the peasants.]]\nIn another equally unfortunate move, the pacific-minded K\u00e1rolyi had abolished almost all the Hungarian armed forces in November 1918.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} All through the winter of 1918\u201319, the [[Romanians]], the [[Yugoslavs]] and the Czechoslovaks often broke the armistice in order to seize more territory for themselves. After January 1919, K\u00e1rolyi ordered the build-up of a Hungarian army and started to consider the idea of an alliance with Soviet Russia, through K\u00e1rolyi was opposed to the idea of Communism in Hungary itself.\n\nIn addition, as Hungary had signed an armistice, not a peace treaty, the Allied blockade continued until such time as a peace treaty was signed. Hungary had suffered from food shortages throughout the war and deaths from starvation had become common from 1917 onwards. Furthermore,  the country had been overwhelmed with refugees from [[Transylvania]] and [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].\n\nMaking things worse was the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]] which had cut Hungary off from supplies of German [[coal]]. Hungary which possessed little coal depended upon German coal imports. Without coal, most had to live without heat in the winter of 1918\u201319, and the railroad network had gradually ceased to function. The collapse of railroads in their turn caused the collapse of industry and hence mass [[unemployment]].\n\nMaking things even worse was the economic incompetence of the government which printed more and more money, leading to massive [[inflation]] and even more impoverishment. K\u00e1rolyi's failure to improve living conditions or persuade the Allies to lift the blockade led to public criticism of K\u00e1rolyi.\n\nBaron [[Lajos Hatvany]] described K\u00e1rolyi's leadership well when he noted \"From the discussions no decisions arose, and from the decisions \u2013 no actions.

Although they did not want to accept this French demand, they were in no position to reject it either.  On 21 March, Berinkey resigned.  K\u00e1rolyi then announced that only the Social Democrats could form a new government.  Unknown to K\u00e1rolyi, however, the Social Democrats had merged their party with the Communists led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]].  Hours after Berinkey resigned, the newly merged Hungarian Socialist Party announced K\u00e1rolyi's resignation and the formation of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

In 1923, [[Cornell University]] announced that Teagle was their highest salaried alumnus. He served as vice president of the Cornell Club of New York and on a variety of committees.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Citations missing|section|date=June 2019}}\nHe was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] on May 1, 1878 into a wealthy oil family.<ref name=obit/> Teagle was the grandson of [[Maurice B. Clark]], one of [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s former partners in [[Standard Oil]]. Teagle's father, [[John Teagle]], headed Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle, [[Standard Oil]]'s competitor in Cleveland.\n\nTeagle entered [[Cornell University]] with the class of 1900, but graduated early in 1899 with a B.S. in chemistry. As a student, Teagle was said to have \"managed everything,\" serving as manager for two publications, the football team, class politics, and as chair of the committees for class promenades and cotillions. He was a member of the [[Quill and Dagger]] society and [[Alpha Delta Phi]].\n\nIn 1901, [[Standard Oil]] bought out the Teagle family refinery, and placed Teagle in charge. Two years later, he joined the export committee of [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]], traveling around the world for the next seven and a half years. He became a director of [[Standard Oil]] in 1910, and a vice president shortly thereafter. During this time, he acquired operations in [[Venezuela]] and [[Iran]]. At the age of 39, Teagle became the youngest president of [[Standard Oil]] of New Jersey, then known as Esso, for Standard Oil of New Jersey, and since 1972, known as  [[Exxon]].  Under his leadership, Standard Oil became the world's largest oil producer, increasing market share from 2% to 11.5%.<ref>[http://www.hbs.edu/leadership/database/leaders/888/ 20th Century American Leaders Database]</ref> He helped pioneer worker representation on refinery councils and the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour workday]].<ref>{{cite news | first =  | last =  | title = Death Notice | publisher = [[Time Magazine]] | page =  | date = January 19, 1962}} [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895874,00.html]</ref>\n\nTeagle married twice, to Edith Murray on October 3, 1903, and after her death, to Rowena Lee in 1910.<ref>[[Witzel, Morgen]].

As a director of IG Farben's American subsidiary, he allied Standard Oil with the German company and conducted research jointly. Standard Oil supplied information to IG Farben on how to manufacture [[tetraethyl lead]] and [[synthetic rubber]], both critical resources to the war effort. In 1938, under Teagle's leadership, Standard Oil and its British subsidiaries supplied five hundred tons of tetraethyl lead to Germany's Luftwaffe. Germany had very few industrial resources of its own, and without this octane booster for its aviation gas, the Luftwaffe would have been practically grounded. At the time tetraethyl lead was a rare and highly controlled commodity and it is unlikely Germany would have been able to find another source for it. Had Teagle not arranged such a massive transfer of the substance to the Luftwaffe, it is likely that the second World War would have been postponed for several years. Standard Oil, under Teagle, also supplied Japan with large quantities of this critical aviation gas component.\n\nWhen America entered the war a few years later, it was desperately short of rubber because Standard Oil, again under Teagle's leadership, refused to produce any synthetic rubber for the American military, because Teagle had transferred the patent rights for synthetic rubber to IG Farben, a German company. Because of the patents it had sold to Germany, Standard Oil also interfered with America's production of synthetic ammonia (for use in explosives), acetic acid (another crucial war material), and methanol (another fuel additive). Standard and Teagle, again protecting IG Farben's patents, had also worked to prevent the US military from obtaining paraflow, a crucial high-altitude lubricant used in fighters and bombers.\n\nThough Teagle himself had two sons in the Army Air Force, Standard Oil, through its subsidiaries, continued to supply Germany with oil. Faced with a [[United States Department of Justice]] investigation, Teagle convinced President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] that a suit would hurt the war effort, instead choosing to pay an [[out-of-court fine]]. The result was a fall in public favor for Standard Oil and the resignation of Teagle in 1942, one year short of the mandatory retirement age.<ref>{{cite news | first =  | last =  | title = Walter Teagle's Nazi Connection | publisher = [[The Cornell Daily Sun]] | page = | date = September 27, 1978}} [http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/?a=d&d=CDS19780927.2.15&e=------197-en-20--1--txt-txIN-teagle+nazi+1978------]</ref> He was replaced by [[Ralph W.

The two worked as [[plumbers]] for [[Roto-Rooter]] while moonlighting as paranormal investigators at night. As of the twelfth season, the revived show features Grant and a new investigatory team that has no discernible connection to ''TAPS'', although the series still maintains the same format and producers and frequently references past episodes.\n\nThe series, initially produced for 10 episodes as a [[docu-soap]], had later episodes shift to a more [[documentary]] focus. '' Ghost Hunters'' episodes feature the team going to [[List of reportedly haunted locations in the United States|reportedly haunted locations]] across the [[United States]], with some investigations in [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]] in earlier seasons. The latter concept led to the show's first [[spin-off (television)|spin-off]], ''[[Ghost Hunters International]]'' in 2008, which often featured ''Ghost Hunters'' investigators in lead and guest roles, including Hawes and Wilson. A second spin-off, ''[[Ghost Hunters Academy]]'' (2009\u201310), had ''TAPS'' members Dave Tango and Steve Gonsalves training prospective investigators in a competitive format. Additionally, annual Halloween specials were broadcast [[live television|live]] from 2005 to 2011 and featured celebrity guests and interactivity. \n\nThe series popularized [[paranormal television|paranormal reality television]] and [[ghost hunting]] and some members of the show have moved on to feature in their own television programs.\n\n== Premise ==\n\n[[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], along with other team members who belong to the group they founded, [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] (TAPS), investigate locations of interest by using various electronic equipment, which they believe is capable of detecting [[paranormal]] activity. The two originally worked as [[plumber]]s for [[Roto-Rooter]] as a day job while investigating locations at night.<ref>{{cite web |title=When ghosts attack - CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/10/31/boo/index.html |website=www.cnn.com |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Investigative procedures ===\n{{moresources|section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen investigating a location, TAPS team members first visit and survey the property with its owners, who describe their experiences at the site. Next, the team sets up electronic equipment in the apparent paranormal hotspots. The TAPS team then spends several hours taking [[electromagnetic field]] and temperature readings, recording audio for [[electronic voice phenomena|EVPs]], and filming with digital video cameras. Many times, they will even try to verbally coax the ghosts into responding, while recording. Afterwards, the team spends several days analyzing all of the data for evidence of possible paranormal activity.\n\nA few days after reviewing the information, Hawes and Wilson discuss their findings with the location site owners, offer suggestions for dealing with any apparent activity, and answer any questions the owners may have.\n\nThe TAPS members state that they do not believe that every phenomenon captured is evidence of the paranormal and sometimes provide reasonable explanations such as [[Cold spot (paranormal)|cold spot]]s which may be drafty windows, strange noises that may be a thumping branch or vermin in the walls, moving objects which may have been accidentally bumped or tugged, or phantom lights which can be reflections of light from a passing vehicle.\n\nSince the series began airing, TAPS has recorded thousands of hours of audio and video data. Most investigations, according to TAPS, turn up cold with very little, if any, paranormal activity occurring; however, the ghost hunters claim to have several decent recordings of [[poltergeist|moving objects]], mysterious [[will-o'-the-wisp|lights]], strange mists, and [[shadow people|shadowy figures]] that manifest before the camera and are highlighted at the end of the show.\n\n[[Syfy|Sci Fi]] initially categorized the program as a [[docu-soap]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Breaking News - NBC Goes Sci Fi with First-Time Network Broadcasts of Hit Sci Fi Channel Reality Series 'Scare Tactics' and 'Ghost Hunters' on October 30 {{!}} TheFutonCritic.com |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2004/10/26/nbc-goes-sci-fi-with-first-time-network-broadcasts-of-hit-sci-fi-channel-reality-series-scare-tactics-and-ghost-hunters-on-october-30-17146/20041026nbc01/ |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref> In addition to the investigative aspect, the show has also presented personal conflicts and relationships among members of the TAPS team. Portions of some episodes portray Hawes and Wilson involved with their plumbing job or personal lives, but this varies by episode and is not always included. As the series progressed, however, the \"behind-the-scenes\" and \"docu-soap\" aspects have been reduced, and the fifth season has so far focused primarily on the investigations, with virtually none of the docu-soap material that characterized earlier episodes.\n\n=== Equipment used ===\n\nDuring investigations, the TAPS ghost hunters team use various equipment, including digital [[thermometer]]s, [[EMF meter]]s, [[thermographic camera|thermographic]] and [[night vision]] cameras, handheld and static [[digital camera|digital]] [[video camera]]s, digital [[dictation machine|audio recorders]], and [[laptop]] computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maggwire.com/ghost-hunting-equipment/|title=\"Ghost Hunting Equipment: Tools To Get Rid Of Demons by Amy Bruni\" Maggwire.com|publisher=Maggwire|last=Tung|first=Christen|date=September 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe team has also experimented, in at least one episode, with a [[geiger counter]] during their investigation to see if it would register any anomalous readings.\n\nStarting around the third season, the team has used the K-2 (or K-II) meter,<ref>{{YouTube|ArzVZ11yXsQ|K-II meter modification demo}}</ref> a type of EMF meter that uses a series of [[LED]]s to [[EMF measurements|measure]] the strength of an energy field instead of a numerical [[LCD]] screen. During the Manson murders investigation, in particular, the team used a K-2 meter in an attempt to get \"yes\" and \"no\" responses to verbal questions posed to a supposed entity in a room.\n\nIn the fifth season's \"Edith Wharton Estate\" case, the team introduced two new pieces of equipment. One is a custom-made [[geophone]], which detects vibrations and flashes a series of LEDs that measure the intensity of the vibration. The second is a new EMF detector that makes a buzzing sound when in the presence of an [[electromagnetic field]], and the stronger the field, the louder it buzzes. In the episode, the geophones were recorded on video flashing to the vibrations of what sounds like footsteps across a floor even though no one was supposedly in the room.\n\nOther gear not typically shown on screen are an [[ion]] generator, a device that charges the air with electricity and is theorized to help spirits manifest, and the [[white noise machine|white noise generator]], an audio device that makes a static [[background noise]] and is theorized to act as a catalyst for assisting entities in making [[electronic voice phenomenon|EVPs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/GhostHunters|title=\"Steve's Gear Guide\" Video Blog on SciFi.com|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Investigators ==\n{{inc-video}}\n* [[Grant Wilson]] - lead investigator/producer/TAPS co-founder (2004\u20132012; 2014 guest; 2019\u2013present)\n* [[Ghost Mine (TV series)|Kristen Luman]] - guest investigator (2015); co-lead investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Daryl Marston - co-lead investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Mustafa Gatollari - research historian/investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Brandon Alvis - tech manager/investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Brian Murray - investigator (2019\u2013)\n* Richel Stratton - investigator (2019\u2013)\n\n=== Former ===\nThis list includes former investigators considered part of the crew, and is sorted by tenure and amount of investigations taken part in. \n{{columns\n|col1=\n* [[Jason Hawes]] \u2013 lead investigator/producer/TAPS Founder (2004\u20132016)\n* Steve Gonsalves \u2013 co-lead investigator, previously tech manager (2004\u20132016)\n* Dave Tango \u2013 tech manager/investigator (2005\u20132016)\n* [[Kindred Spirits (TV series)|Amy Bruni]] \u2013 investigator (2008\u20132014)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title=\u2018Ghost Hunters\u2019 Co-Stars Amy Bruni & Adam Berry To Depart, Develop Paranormal Series |url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/ghost-hunters-co-stars-amy-bruni-adam-berry-to-depart-develop-paranormal-series/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=23 November 2019 |language=en |date=29 May 2014}}</ref>\n* Britt Griffith \u2013 investigator (2008\u20132014)\n* Kris Williams \u2013 case manager/investigator (2007\u20132011; moved to ''[[Ghost Hunters International|GHI]]'')\n* K.J.

It has since been syndicated on [[NBC Universal]] sister cable channel [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] and also airs on the Canadian cable network, [[Outdoor Life Network|OLN]].\n\nIn the early shows, TAPS was headquartered in a trailer located behind Jason Hawes' house, and they drove one white van to investigations. Within one season, they had moved the entire operation to a storefront in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]], and acquired several new TAPS vehicles.\n\nIn addition to their successful television venture, TAPS operates a website where they share their stories, photographs, and [[ghost hunting]] videos with an ever-growing membership list. Because of the popularity of the show, TAPS cast members have signed contracts with at least two talent agencies, Escape Artistry and GP Entertainment, to manage their appearances at lectures, conferences and public events.\n\nIn addition to the success of the series, TAPS has ventured into the venue of radio broadcast, hosting a three-hour weekly show called ''Beyond Reality''. New episodes are broadcast every Saturday from 7 pm to 10 pm [[Eastern Time]], though sometimes may skip a week due to the possibility of the hosts being busy with other ventures. The radio show covers topics in a vast array of areas such as [[cryptozoology]], [[spiritualism]], [[ufology]], and [[ghost]]s. The show is hosted by Grant Wilson and Jason Hawes, and includes guest appearances from other TAPS members and special guests such as [[John Zaffis]], Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Chris Fleming, and others who specialize in certain fields. Noted paranormal author Jeff Belanger and ''Spooky Southcoast'' radio host and author Tim Weisberg served as fill-in hosts for Jason and Grant. The show also once simulcasted on ''Spooky Southcoast'', airing from the Mt. Washington Hotel in New Hampshire.\n\nOn March 3, 2010, ''Ghost Hunters''' 100th episode aired featuring their investigation of [[Alcatraz]] Prison. The two-hour special featured a live studio audience with question and answer segments, hosted by [[Josh Gates]] of ''[[Destination Truth]]''. The special also featured the ''[[Ghost Hunters International|GHI]]'' crew, the winning contestants of ''[[Ghost Hunters Academy]]'', and Craig Piligian, the creator and executive producer of ''Ghost Hunters''. On June 2, 2011, Syfy renewed ''Ghost Hunters'' for an eighth season, marking it as the longest-running reality series to air on the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetvratings.com/2011/06/02/cancelled-renewed/ghost-hunters-renewed-for-season-8-by-syfy/|title=\"Ghost Hunters\" Renewed For Season 8 By Syfy|accessdate=October 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427135411/http://insidetvratings.com/2011/06/02/cancelled-renewed/ghost-hunters-renewed-for-season-8-by-syfy|archive-date=April 27, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn June 7, 2016, Hawes announced that ''Ghost Hunters'' would be concluding on Syfy with season 11 being the last season to be produced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/jason-hawestaps/ghost-hunters-leaving-syfy/10153794588723212|title=Ghost Hunters leaving Syfy!|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn June 26, 2019, it was announced that the series would be [[revival (television)|revived]] later that year with Wilson returning with a new team.

Anyone can be a ghost investigator, \"failing to consider alternative explanations for anomalous ... phenomena\", considering emotions and feelings as \"evidence of ghostly encounters.\" \"Improper and unscientific investigation methods\", for example, \"using unproven tools and equipment\", \"sampling errors\", \"ineffectively using recording devices\" and \"focusing on the history of the location...and not the phenomena.\" In an article for ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Radford concludes that ghost hunters should care about doing a truly scientific investigation: \"I believe that if ghosts exist, they are important and deserve to be taken seriously.

The original series aired from October 6, 2004 until October 26, 2016 on [[Syfy]]. The original program spanned [[List of Ghost Hunters episodes|eleven seasons with 230 episodes, not including 10 specials.]] The series was [[revival (television)|revived]] in early 2019 and aired its twelfth season of 11 episodes, not including 2 specials, from August 21, 2019 to October 30, 2019 on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]. A thirteenth season is set to premiere on April 8, 2020.\n\nThe program featured [[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], who founded ''[[The Atlantic Paranormal Society|The Atlantic Paranormal Society (TAPS)]]'' team of [[Ghost hunting|paranormal investigators]] to investigate places that are reported to be [[ghosts|haunted]]. The two worked as [[plumbers]] for [[Roto-Rooter]] while moonlighting as paranormal investigators at night. As of the twelfth season, the revived show features Grant and a new investigatory team that has no discernible connection to ''TAPS'', although the series still maintains the same format and producers and frequently references past episodes.\n\nThe series, initially produced for 10 episodes as a [[docu-soap]], had later episodes shift to a more [[documentary]] focus. '' Ghost Hunters'' episodes feature the team going to [[List of reportedly haunted locations in the United States|reportedly haunted locations]] across the [[United States]], with some investigations in [[Ireland]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]] in earlier seasons. The latter concept led to the show's first [[spin-off (television)|spin-off]], ''[[Ghost Hunters International]]'' in 2008, which often featured ''Ghost Hunters'' investigators in lead and guest roles, including Hawes and Wilson. A second spin-off, ''[[Ghost Hunters Academy]]'' (2009\u201310), had ''TAPS'' members Dave Tango and Steve Gonsalves training prospective investigators in a competitive format. Additionally, annual Halloween specials were broadcast [[live television|live]] from 2005 to 2011 and featured celebrity guests and interactivity. \n\nThe series popularized [[paranormal television|paranormal reality television]] and [[ghost hunting]] and some members of the show have moved on to feature in their own television programs.\n\n== Premise ==\n\n[[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], along with other team members who belong to the group they founded, [[The Atlantic Paranormal Society]] (TAPS), investigate locations of interest by using various electronic equipment, which they believe is capable of detecting [[paranormal]] activity. The two originally worked as [[plumber]]s for [[Roto-Rooter]] as a day job while investigating locations at night.<ref>{{cite web |title=When ghosts attack - CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/10/31/boo/index.html |website=www.cnn.com |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Investigative procedures ===\n{{moresources|section|date=November 2019}}\nWhen investigating a location, TAPS team members first visit and survey the property with its owners, who describe their experiences at the site. Next, the team sets up electronic equipment in the apparent paranormal hotspots. The TAPS team then spends several hours taking [[electromagnetic field]] and temperature readings, recording audio for [[electronic voice phenomena|EVPs]], and filming with digital video cameras. Many times, they will even try to verbally coax the ghosts into responding, while recording. Afterwards, the team spends several days analyzing all of the data for evidence of possible paranormal activity.\n\nA few days after reviewing the information, Hawes and Wilson discuss their findings with the location site owners, offer suggestions for dealing with any apparent activity, and answer any questions the owners may have.\n\nThe TAPS members state that they do not believe that every phenomenon captured is evidence of the paranormal and sometimes provide reasonable explanations such as [[Cold spot (paranormal)|cold spot]]s which may be drafty windows, strange noises that may be a thumping branch or vermin in the walls, moving objects which may have been accidentally bumped or tugged, or phantom lights which can be reflections of light from a passing vehicle.\n\nSince the series began airing, TAPS has recorded thousands of hours of audio and video data. Most investigations, according to TAPS, turn up cold with very little, if any, paranormal activity occurring; however, the ghost hunters claim to have several decent recordings of [[poltergeist|moving objects]], mysterious [[will-o'-the-wisp|lights]], strange mists, and [[shadow people|shadowy figures]] that manifest before the camera and are highlighted at the end of the show.\n\n[[Syfy|Sci Fi]] initially categorized the program as a [[docu-soap]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Breaking News - NBC Goes Sci Fi with First-Time Network Broadcasts of Hit Sci Fi Channel Reality Series 'Scare Tactics' and 'Ghost Hunters' on October 30 {{!}} TheFutonCritic.com |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2004/10/26/nbc-goes-sci-fi-with-first-time-network-broadcasts-of-hit-sci-fi-channel-reality-series-scare-tactics-and-ghost-hunters-on-october-30-17146/20041026nbc01/ |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref> In addition to the investigative aspect, the show has also presented personal conflicts and relationships among members of the TAPS team. Portions of some episodes portray Hawes and Wilson involved with their plumbing job or personal lives, but this varies by episode and is not always included. As the series progressed, however, the \"behind-the-scenes\" and \"docu-soap\" aspects have been reduced, and the fifth season has so far focused primarily on the investigations, with virtually none of the docu-soap material that characterized earlier episodes.\n\n=== Equipment used ===\n\nDuring investigations, the TAPS ghost hunters team use various equipment, including digital [[thermometer]]s, [[EMF meter]]s, [[thermographic camera|thermographic]] and [[night vision]] cameras, handheld and static [[digital camera|digital]] [[video camera]]s, digital [[dictation machine|audio recorders]], and [[laptop]] computers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maggwire.com/ghost-hunting-equipment/|title=\"Ghost Hunting Equipment: Tools To Get Rid Of Demons by Amy Bruni\" Maggwire.com|publisher=Maggwire|last=Tung|first=Christen|date=September 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe team has also experimented, in at least one episode, with a [[geiger counter]] during their investigation to see if it would register any anomalous readings.\n\nStarting around the third season, the team has used the K-2 (or K-II) meter,<ref>{{YouTube|ArzVZ11yXsQ|K-II meter modification demo}}</ref> a type of EMF meter that uses a series of [[LED]]s to [[EMF measurements|measure]] the strength of an energy field instead of a numerical [[LCD]] screen. During the Manson murders investigation, in particular, the team used a K-2 meter in an attempt to get \"yes\" and \"no\" responses to verbal questions posed to a supposed entity in a room.\n\nIn the fifth season's \"Edith Wharton Estate\" case, the team introduced two new pieces of equipment.

The second is a new EMF detector that makes a buzzing sound when in the presence of an [[electromagnetic field]], and the stronger the field, the louder it buzzes.

It has since been syndicated on [[NBC Universal]] sister cable channel [[Oxygen (TV network)|Oxygen]] and also airs on the Canadian cable network, [[Outdoor Life Network|OLN]].\n\nIn the early shows, TAPS was headquartered in a trailer located behind Jason Hawes' house, and they drove one white van to investigations. Within one season, they had moved the entire operation to a storefront in [[Warwick, Rhode Island]], and acquired several new TAPS vehicles.\n\nIn addition to their successful television venture, TAPS operates a website where they share their stories, photographs, and [[ghost hunting]] videos with an ever-growing membership list. Because of the popularity of the show, TAPS cast members have signed contracts with at least two talent agencies, Escape Artistry and GP Entertainment, to manage their appearances at lectures, conferences and public events.\n\nIn addition to the success of the series, TAPS has ventured into the venue of radio broadcast, hosting a three-hour weekly show called ''Beyond Reality''. New episodes are broadcast every Saturday from 7 pm to 10 pm [[Eastern Time]], though sometimes may skip a week due to the possibility of the hosts being busy with other ventures. The radio show covers topics in a vast array of areas such as [[cryptozoology]], [[spiritualism]], [[ufology]], and [[ghost]]s. The show is hosted by Grant Wilson and Jason Hawes, and includes guest appearances from other TAPS members and special guests such as [[John Zaffis]], Rosemary Ellen Guiley, Chris Fleming, and others who specialize in certain fields. Noted paranormal author Jeff Belanger and ''Spooky Southcoast'' radio host and author Tim Weisberg served as fill-in hosts for Jason and Grant. The show also once simulcasted on ''Spooky Southcoast'', airing from the Mt. Washington Hotel in New Hampshire.\n\nOn March 3, 2010, ''Ghost Hunters''' 100th episode aired featuring their investigation of [[Alcatraz]] Prison. The two-hour special featured a live studio audience with question and answer segments, hosted by [[Josh Gates]] of ''[[Destination Truth]]''. The special also featured the ''[[Ghost Hunters International|GHI]]'' crew, the winning contestants of ''[[Ghost Hunters Academy]]'', and Craig Piligian, the creator and executive producer of ''Ghost Hunters''. On June 2, 2011, Syfy renewed ''Ghost Hunters'' for an eighth season, marking it as the longest-running reality series to air on the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetvratings.com/2011/06/02/cancelled-renewed/ghost-hunters-renewed-for-season-8-by-syfy/|title=\"Ghost Hunters\" Renewed For Season 8 By Syfy|accessdate=October 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427135411/http://insidetvratings.com/2011/06/02/cancelled-renewed/ghost-hunters-renewed-for-season-8-by-syfy|archive-date=April 27, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn June 7, 2016, Hawes announced that ''Ghost Hunters'' would be concluding on Syfy with season 11 being the last season to be produced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/jason-hawestaps/ghost-hunters-leaving-syfy/10153794588723212|title=Ghost Hunters leaving Syfy!|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=June 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn June 26, 2019, it was announced that the series would be [[revival (television)|revived]] later that year with Wilson returning with a new team.

Another occurs when a supposed disembodied voice tells the hunters, \"You're not supposed to be here.\" Critics{{who|date=November 2019}} have claimed the voice sounded like it was piped in from an external audio source.

Anyone can be a ghost investigator, \"failing to consider alternative explanations for anomalous ... phenomena\", considering emotions and feelings as \"evidence of ghostly encounters.\" \"Improper and unscientific investigation methods\", for example, \"using unproven tools and equipment\", \"sampling errors\", \"ineffectively using recording devices\" and \"focusing on the history of the location...and not the phenomena.\" In an article for ''Skeptical Inquirer'', Radford concludes that ghost hunters should care about doing a truly scientific investigation: \"I believe that if ghosts exist, they are important and deserve to be taken seriously.
