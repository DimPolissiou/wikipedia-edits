Katras comes under Dhanbad municipal corporation and it is very popular for its Durga puja celebration.  It is located on the bank of river Katri and is surrounded by coal mines. Lilori temple is the most important point of interest in Katras. The chief source of income is primarily from the coal mines of [[Bharat Coking Coal Limited]] (BCCL), headquartered in Dhanbad City. However, incomes from BCCL has always been limited and new sources of income have not evolved fairly, residents of Katras have begun to migrate to other cities for reasons such as job, higher studies and so on. The students of Katras mainly migrates as there isnt any educational excellence present in Katras.It is well connected via railways and roads. Nearest functional airport is in Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand. As per the reports says,Katras will soon be getting a functional airport at its nearby city, [[Bokaro Steel City]].Few years back, the city suffered the loss of its railway connectivity, as the senior of Coal India Limited came out with the reports of Coal Under the Rail Tracks. The Railways again came to function after a strike of about 700 days, the longest ever supported by many political leaders of the area.Qamar Takhyan, a well known novelist of Urdu and English also lives here. His novel The Heart of Amber was published in England, USA and in India in October 2014.\n\n==History==\nKatras is named after river  \"Katri\", which flows by Katras. It is believed that people have been living in Katras for more than 200 years. And later around 1900 AD many migrants from Bihar came and settled here, as Bihar was suffering from a severe famine. Many coal mines were founded in Katras under British Rule. New Railway route from Asansol to Ranchi via Dhanbad and Katras was created in 1894 and Katras Railway station was founded around 1900 (later it was re-established in 1953 and came to be known as Katrasgarh).\n\n==Geography==\n{{OSM Location map\n| width=450| height=230| zoom=11\n| coord={{coord|23|46|30|N|86|15|20|E}}| float=left|caption='''Cities, towns and locations in the western portion

The [[Damodar River]], the most important river of the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]], flows along the southern border. The area beyond the Damodar was once a part of Dhanbad district but was transferred to Bokaro district in 2001. Bulk of the area shown in the map is part of [[Baghmara (community development block)]]. In Baghmara CD block 67% of the population lives in rural areas and 33% in urban areas. The block has 18 [[census towns]], all marked in the map, except [[Rajganj, Dhanbad|Rajganj]], which is shown in the map for the northern portion of the district. A portion of [[Dhanbad Municipal Corporation]] extends into the region till around Katras. The places in the DMC area are marked as [[neighbourhoods]]. Most of the DMC area is shown in the maps for the central and southern portions of the district. Four operational areas of [[Bharat Coking Coal|BCCL]] operate fully within the region \u2013 [[Katras Area]], [[Govindpur Area]], [[Barora Area]] and [[Block II Area]]. The Mahuda sector of [[Western Jharia Area]] also operates in the region.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/20/2009_PART_A_DCHB_DHANBAD.pdf  | title = District Census Handbook Dhanbad | work = Series 21, Part XIIA, pages 4-5, 5-6, 8 | publisher = Directorate of Census Operations, Jharkhand  | accessdate =  4 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/pca/cdb_pca_census/Houselisting-housing-JK.html |title = 2011 Census C.D.

Most of them, however, are under threat. Telia Bandh- once a big pond is now almost extinct and same is the story of all other ponds. Population burden has created the problem of space and ponds are losing out to residential buildings. This has made the water crisis more acute. Nowadays two water tanks are made near Katras College.\n\n[[File:Katri River.jpg|thumb|Katri River near Lilori Temple]]\nKatri Nadi is a small river which passes through the area. It discharges its water into the Damodar. It is a river of rainy season so most of the time water level is very low. In Chhapulwa a small dam has been made from where water is supplied to the railways.\n\nGreen Park- A Green Park has been developed by Katras Area, BCCL which is in 3.02 Ha area over overburden dump located at Keshalpur. The primary purpose for developing the park is restoring the ecology at mining area. This park is full of greenery where one can enjoy in the lap of nature. Several swings are established in this green park\n\nKatras is also surrounded by a lots of religious pilgrimage such as Lilori Mandir, Surya Mandir, Bajrang Balj Mandir, Katras Taj Masjid,Bada Gurudwara, Sjiua Church and so on.\n\n==Demographics==\nIn 2011 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Katras had a population of 51,182. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Katras has an average literacy rate of 84%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 87%, and female literacy is 76%. In Katras, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n== Government and public services ==\n\n=== Civic administration ===\nKatras was established as a [[Notified Area Council (N.A.C.)|notified area]] in the [[Dhanbad district]] along with [[Jharia]], Chatatand, and [[Sindri]].  In 2006, the notified areas were merged into the district under the jurisdiction of the Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC).<ref>http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060610/asp/jamshedpur/story_6334372.asp</ref> It is allocated to the Baghmara development block of the district and has its own police station.<ref>http://dhanbad.nic.in/administration/structure.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dhanbad.nic.in/links/dhanbad.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927180216/http://dhanbad.nic.in/links/dhanbad.htm |archivedate=2013-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n=== Utility services ===\nWater is a perennial problem. Electricity has the same story of want and deficiency. A water project started several years back{{When|date=April 2011}} never fructified because of corruption and mis- management. The water tower constructed in Dak Bunglaw was of such low quality that experts dreaded storing water in it lest it be sagging, endangering lives of local people. Thousands of hand pumps and submersibles have led to a severe fall in ground water level. People carrying water in plastic containers on bicycles is a common sight.\n\n==Economy==\nThe chief source of income is BCCL, the coal company. It employs a large number of people.\n\nCollieries functioning in the [[Katras Area]] of [[Bharat Coking Coal|BCCL]] are: Salanpur, Angarpathar, Keshalpur, Ramkanali, Ramkanali OC, West Mudidih, Gazlitand, Keshalpur OC, Katras Chot and East Katras.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dhanbad.nic.in/mines.html | title = Dhanbad - Coal Capital of India | work = List of Coal Mines in Dhanbad | publisher = Jharkhand Government | accessdate = 18 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171013120533/http://www.dhanbad.nic.in/mines.html | archive-date = 13 October 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAgriculture is under-developed. The farm size is tiny and ancient tools are used. BCCL is now retrenching and closing its mines because of the depletion of the coal in the mines. The new professions which have emerged in the area are Coal-theft<ref>http://www.prabhatkhabar.com/news/20297-story-article.html</ref> and Dalali (Agent-ship). So in the early morning you would find hundreds of cycle-wallah carrying coal illegally to the Nischitpur Railway Halt, from where it would be carried to Gaya and other areas by Passenger trains(sic). In fact some times passengers would not be allowed to board the train so that more of the coal could be carried. Administration- both local and railway maintains a deathly silence. Railway Police people can be seen to take money from coal-thieves as their cut. Dalali is an important vocation here with increasing number of people taking to it. Mind you this is not honest. What they do is, in connivance with the local administration charge money from the public for all govt. services. You would end coughing-up several times the actual amount for getting any service. So there are Dalals of local Police Station, of Block development office, of SDM's office, of DM's office. If one goes otherwise than through Dalals, the work would be completed in such a long time that one would start feeling that perhaps the whole system is dead and this when one has made many rounds of the office.\n\nThe main reason for emergence of such vacations is the lack of employment opportunities. People either migrate outside the state or open some retail shop or start coal-theft or Dalali. Now because of the lack of any other source of money in the area most of the newly opened retail shops fail miserably. Though Lilori Temple economy provides employment to some people, even there some people have captured Public infrastructure illegally and charge money from visitors for using them.\n\nThe economy is crumbling and unless some new source of income is provided the day is not far when it would be counted as sub-Saharan area.\n\nOnce a bustling market, now shops remain empty most of the time. There are many cloth merchants ranging from Retailers to wholesalers. There are many hard coke plants as well. Apart from these there is a Rajhans Refactories providing employment to over 2500 people. During Durgapuja festival and Lagan (marriage season) retail market gets some impetus but until new source of employment emerges, it will remain a town in slumber. Recently some private insurance companies have opened their offices.\n\n== Transport ==\n{{Railways in Jharia Coalfield|collapse=yes}}\nBuses are main mode of travel, along with automobiles, trackers{{technical statement|date=September 2013}} and [[Tanga (carriage)|tongas]].\n\nThere were three railway stations: Katrasgarh, Nichitpur and Tetulmari.  Katrasgarh uptill 15 June 2017 and Tetulmari have express line stops, while Nichitpur is just a halt station. Katrasgarh was also on a loop line and extincted because of fragile underground. Due to closure of [[Dhanbad - Chandrapura line|Dhanbad - Chandrapura Rail line]] a huge population has lost connectivity from the entire world, moreover the road connecting Katras to Dhanbad is facing danger of being closed and will be closed soon.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:Base less wall.JPG|thumb|Park Lilori Park- wall without base]]\n\nKatras College was established at Katras Bazar in 1964. Affiliated with the [[Binod Bihari Mahto Koylanchal University]], it offers courses in arts, science and commerce.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.indcareer.com/jharkhand/dhanbad/katras-college-katrasgarh |title = Katras College, Katrasgarh  |publisher= IndCareer | accessdate = 15 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://vbu.ac.in/2015/08/18/katras-college-katrasgarh/ |title = Katras College, Katrasgarh  |publisher= Vinoba Bhave University | accessdate = 15 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n* Holy Mother's Academy.

There are many much fun-fare organized for each festival. The Katras Hatia is a local village market that runs every Sunday.<ref>http://wikimapia.org/11412640/katras-hatia</ref>\n\n===Lilori Temple===\n{{anchor|Lillori Sthan Mandir}}\n[[File:Road to Lilori Temple.jpg|thumb|Road to Lilori Temple]]\n[[File:Lilori Temple Park.jpg|thumb|Lilori Temple Park]]\n{{expand section|date=September 2013|1=need picture of actual temple and park area}}\n\nLocated 5&nbsp;km from the city center, Lillori Sthan Mandir (Lilori Temple) is an old temple of Goddess Lilori, family deity of local landlord (Raja), who is nowadays considered an incarnation of Goddess Kali.<ref>http://www.hoparoundindia.com/jharkhand/dhanbad-attractions/lillori-sthan-mandir.aspx</ref> Goddess Lilori, typical to Bengal and neighboring area, is non-vegetarian and daily hundreds of animals are sacrificed on her altar.\n\nThe temple is one of the few natural picnic spots in the area, even though tree felling and government neglect has ruined much of the greenery. It also attracts thousands of people daily in the summer for weddings. It neighbours local [[Shmashana|Smashan]], where dead bodies are burnt, and sometimes give it a mystic colour.\n\n===Bharatiya Club===\n{{anchor|Baharatiya Club}}\nIt is one of the oldest library in India which solely carries books from Hindi literature. The library was started by the freedom fighter Late Shri Ramanand Khaitan, who was an ardent political activist during the [[Indian independence movement|Indian freedom movement]].{{when|date=September 2013}}<!--year established?-->  During the British days, the library used to be the melting pot of pro-freedom think-tanks and activists. Today, the library serves the people of Katras and its surrounding areas, filling a necessary void in providing access to Hindi literature. It has a free and open access reading room which gets a regular supply of newspapers, magazines and journals.{{where|date=September 2013|1=is this club in Katras or Jharia??}}\n\n===Raksha Kali Temple===\nThis is a small temple of Raksha Kali in Hatiya(a small vegetable market). Raksha Kali is a very fierce form of Kali and she was supposed to be invoked only when there were calamities like war, epidemic etc. That is why the gate of the temple remains closed all the time. Earlier the gate of the temple were opened only either for the annual Mid-night Puja or on certain occasions like Kali-Puja. Nowadays its gate is being opened daily. This is perhaps either because the Local land-lord (Raja) who was earlier responsible for upkeep of this temple is not able to continue this or because the Pandit who opens its gate expects to earn some money in the way of Aarti-offering etc. Once a year the Goddess is worshiped at mid-night. Offering of some animal is given and Khichdi is cooked with the animal meat. After everybody present there has taken the Prasad of this Khichdi, all remaining materials are buried in front of the temple. There are very small temples of Goddesses like Shitla in the backside of this temple.\n\n===Rakshash Temple===\nThe oldest and most important structure by archaeological and historical point of view is Rakshas temple of Jhinjhi Pahari. This temple is made of stones only and not even small amount of any other, including sand, material has been used to join them. It is understood to be at least six hundred years old. It is said that a similar temple was situated just in front of the Lilori Temple which fell in an earth quack and that these two temples signified some treasure. There is a myth that the temple was constructed by Lord Vishwakarma in a single night.\n\n== Healthcare ==\nDespite having a fairly large population, Katras is lacking any quality medical facilities. There are several hospitals though none have any facilities for dealing with emergencies on a 24-hour basis. Katras has no facility for [[intensive-care unit|intensive care]] and the local [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic centers]] are considered unreliable. There is rampant medical corruption with doctors recommending unnecessary tests and costly medicines. Underlined tests (in the prescription) are not supposed to be carried out. They are only for cheating patients. Tilatand Hospital of BCCL used to be a centre for better treatment, now-a-days it remains empty most of the times. This when there is no better alternative. Most people either go to Dhanbad (for minor treatments) or Bokaro (for major treatment) and finally to CMC, Vellore for better treatment. The lone train from Dhanbad to Allepey (that too taken away)  was full of patients. There is an urgent need of a good hospital either in private sector or in public sector.\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Katras}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://romanbooks.co.in/quintus/9789380905945.php\n\n{{Dhanbad District}}\n\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods in Dhanbad]]\n[[Category:Mining communities in Jharkhand]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=May 2018}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=September 2011}}\n{{POV|date=May 2013}}\n{{Local|date=May 2013|reason=clean out list of banks, shops, local organizations}}\n{{advert|date=July 2013}}\n}}\n{{About|the area in Dhanbad| its namesake operational area of BCCL|Katras Area}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Katras \n| native_name             = \u0915\u0924\u0930\u093e\u0938\n| native_name_lang        =\n| other_name              = Katrasgarh\n| settlement_type         = The City of Unity in Diversity\n| image_skyline           = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| nickname                = \n| pushpin_map             = India Jharkhand\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Jharkhand, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|23.8|N|86.28|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = {{flag|India}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Jharkhand]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Dhanbad district|Dhanbad]]\n| established_title       = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| government_type         = \n| governing_body          = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_total_km2          = \n| area_rank               = \n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = 201\n| population_total        = 51,182\n| population_as_of        = 2001\n| population_footnotes    = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_rank         = \n| population_demonym      = \n| demographics_type1      = Languages\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = <!-- [[Postal Index Number|PIN]] -->\n| postal_code             = 828121,828114\n| registration_plate      = JH10(Dhanbad)\n| website                 = {{URL|dhanbad.nic.in/}}\n| footnotes               = \n}}\nKatras ''(''\u0915\u0924\u0930\u093e\u0938) (also known as Katrasgarh) is a [[neighbourhood]] in [[Dhanbad]] city in [[Dhanbad Sadar subdivision]] in the [[Jharkhand]] [[States and territories of India|state]], [[India]].\n\n==Overview==\nAn hour drive from district headquarters Dhanbad, Katras is a place where people from various religions and communities live together. Katras comes under Dhanbad municipal corporation and it is very popular for its Durga puja celebration.  It is located on the bank of river Katri and is surrounded by coal mines. Lilori temple is the most important point of interest in Katras. The chief source of income is primarily from the coal mines of [[Bharat Coking Coal Limited]] (BCCL), headquartered in Dhanbad City. However, incomes from BCCL has always been limited and new sources of income have not evolved fairly, residents of Katras have begun to migrate to other cities for reasons such as job, higher studies and so on. The students of Katras mainly migrates as there isnt any educational excellence present in Katras.It is well connected via railways and roads. Nearest functional airport is in Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand. As per the reports says,Katras will soon be getting a functional airport at its nearby city, [[Bokaro Steel City]].Few years back, the city suffered the loss of its railway connectivity, as the senior of Coal India Limited came out with the reports of Coal Under the Rail Tracks. The Railways again came to function after a strike of about 700 days, the longest ever supported by many political leaders of the area.Qamar Takhyan, a well known novelist of Urdu and English also lives here. His novel The Heart of Amber was published in England, USA and in India in October 2014.\n\n==History==\nKatras is named after river  \"Katri\", which flows by Katras. It is believed that people have been living in Katras for more than 200 years. And later around 1900 AD many migrants from Bihar came and settled here, as Bihar was suffering from a severe famine. Many coal mines were founded in Katras under British Rule. New Railway route from Asansol to Ranchi via Dhanbad and Katras was created in 1894 and Katras Railway station was founded around 1900 (later it was re-established in 1953 and came to be known as

The [[Damodar River]], the most important river of the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]], flows along the southern border. The area beyond the Damodar was once a part of Dhanbad district but was transferred to Bokaro district in 2001. Bulk of the area shown in the map is part of [[Baghmara (community development block)]]. In Baghmara CD block 67% of the population lives in rural areas and 33% in urban areas. The block has 18 [[census towns]], all marked in the map, except [[Rajganj, Dhanbad|Rajganj]], which is shown in the map for the northern portion of the district. A portion of [[Dhanbad Municipal Corporation]] extends into the region till around Katras. The places in the DMC area are marked as [[neighbourhoods]]. Most of the DMC area is shown in the maps for the central and southern portions of the district. Four operational areas of [[Bharat Coking Coal|BCCL]] operate fully within the region \u2013 [[Katras Area]], [[Govindpur Area]], [[Barora Area]] and [[Block II Area]]. The Mahuda sector of [[Western Jharia Area]] also operates in the region.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/20/2009_PART_A_DCHB_DHANBAD.pdf  | title = District Census Handbook Dhanbad | work = Series 21, Part XIIA, pages 4-5, 5-6, 8 | publisher = Directorate of Census Operations, Jharkhand  | accessdate =  4 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.censusindia.gov.in/pca/cdb_pca_census/Houselisting-housing-JK.html |title = 2011 Census C.D.

Most of them, however, are under threat. Telia Bandh- once a big pond is now almost extinct and same is the story of all other ponds. Population burden has created the problem of space and ponds are losing out to residential buildings. This has made the water crisis more acute. Nowadays two water tanks are made near Katras College.\n\n[[File:Katri River.jpg|thumb|Katri River near Lilori Temple]]\nKatri Nadi is a small river which passes through the area. It discharges its water into the Damodar. It is a river of rainy season so most of the time water level is very low. In Chhapulwa a small dam has been made from where water is supplied to the railways.\n\nGreen Park- A Green Park has been developed by Katras Area, BCCL which is in 3.02 Ha area over overburden dump located at Keshalpur. The primary purpose for developing the park is restoring the ecology at mining area. This park is full of greenery where one can enjoy in the lap of nature. Several swings are established in this green park\n\nKatras is also surrounded by a lots of religious pilgrimage such as Lilori Mandir, Surya Mandir, Bajrang Balj Mandir, Katras Taj Masjid,Bada Gurudwara, Sjiua Chruch and so on.\n\n==Demographics==\nIn 2011 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Katras had a population of 51,182. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Katras has an average literacy rate of 84%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 87%, and female literacy is 76%. In Katras, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n== Government and public services ==\n\n=== Civic administration ===\nKatras was established as a [[Notified Area Council (N.A.C.)|notified area]] in the [[Dhanbad district]] along with [[Jharia]], Chatatand, and [[Sindri]].  In 2006, the notified areas were merged into the district under the jurisdiction of the Dhanbad Municipal Corporation (DMC).<ref>http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060610/asp/jamshedpur/story_6334372.asp</ref> It is allocated to the Baghmara development block of the district and has its own police station.<ref>http://dhanbad.nic.in/administration/structure.htm</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dhanbad.nic.in/links/dhanbad.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927180216/http://dhanbad.nic.in/links/dhanbad.htm |archivedate=2013-09-27 }}</ref>\n\n=== Utility services ===\nWater is a perennial problem. Electricity has the same story of want and deficiency. A water project started several years back{{When|date=April 2011}} never fructified because of corruption and mis- management. The water tower constructed in Dak Bunglaw was of such low quality that experts dreaded storing water in it lest it be sagging, endangering lives of local people. Thousands of hand pumps and submersibles have led to a severe fall in ground water level. People carrying water in plastic containers on bicycles is a common sight.\n\n==Economy==\nThe chief source of income is BCCL, the coal company. It employs a large number of people.\n\nCollieries functioning in the [[Katras Area]] of [[Bharat Coking Coal|BCCL]] are: Salanpur, Angarpathar, Keshalpur, Ramkanali, Ramkanali OC, West Mudidih, Gazlitand, Keshalpur OC, Katras Chot and East Katras.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dhanbad.nic.in/mines.html | title = Dhanbad - Coal Capital of India | work = List of Coal Mines in Dhanbad | publisher = Jharkhand Government | accessdate = 18 October 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171013120533/http://www.dhanbad.nic.in/mines.html | archive-date = 13 October 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAgriculture is under-developed. The farm size is tiny and ancient tools are used. BCCL is now retrenching and closing its mines because of the depletion of the coal in the mines. The new professions which have emerged in the area are Coal-theft<ref>http://www.prabhatkhabar.com/news/20297-story-article.html</ref> and Dalali (Agent-ship). So in the early morning you would find hundreds of cycle-wallah carrying coal illegally to the Nischitpur Railway Halt, from where it would be carried to Gaya and other areas by Passenger trains(sic). In fact some times passengers would not be allowed to board the train so that more of the coal could be carried. Administration- both local and railway maintains a deathly silence. Railway Police people can be seen to take money from coal-thieves as their cut. Dalali is an important vocation here with increasing number of people taking to it. Mind you this is not honest. What they do is, in connivance with the local administration charge money from the public for all govt. services. You would end coughing-up several times the actual amount for getting any service. So there are Dalals of local Police Station, of Block development office, of SDM's office, of DM's office. If one goes otherwise than through Dalals, the work would be completed in such a long time that one would start feeling that perhaps the whole system is dead and this when one has made many rounds of the office.\n\nThe main reason for emergence of such vacations is the lack of employment opportunities. People either migrate outside the state or open some retail shop or start coal-theft or Dalali. Now because of the lack of any other source of money in the area most of the newly opened retail shops fail miserably. Though Lilori Temple economy provides employment to some people, even there some people have captured Public infrastructure illegally and charge money from visitors for using them.\n\nThe economy is crumbling and unless some new source of income is provided the day is not far when it would be counted as sub-Saharan area.\n\nOnce a bustling market, now shops remain empty most of the time. There are many cloth merchants ranging from Retailers to wholesalers. There are many hard coke plants as well. Apart from these there is a Rajhans Refactories providing employment to over 2500 people. During Durgapuja festival and Lagan (marriage season) retail market gets some impetus but until new source of employment emerges, it will remain a town in slumber. Recently some private insurance companies have opened their offices.\n\n== Transport ==\n{{Railways in Jharia Coalfield|collapse=yes}}\nBuses are main mode of travel, along with automobiles, trackers{{technical statement|date=September 2013}} and [[Tanga (carriage)|tongas]].\n\nThere were three railway stations: Katrasgarh, Nichitpur and Tetulmari.  Katrasgarh uptill 15 June 2017 and Tetulmari have express line stops, while Nichitpur is just a halt station. Katrasgarh was also on a loop line and extincted because of fragile underground. Due to closure of [[Dhanbad - Chandrapura line|Dhanbad - Chandrapura Rail line]] a huge population has lost connectivity from the entire world, moreover the road connecting Katras to Dhanbad is facing danger of being closed and will be closed soon.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:Base less wall.JPG|thumb|Park Lilori Park- wall without base]]\n\nKatras College was established at Katras Bazar in 1964. Affiliated with the [[Binod Bihari Mahto Koylanchal University]], it offers courses in arts, science and commerce.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.indcareer.com/jharkhand/dhanbad/katras-college-katrasgarh |title = Katras College, Katrasgarh  |publisher= IndCareer | accessdate = 15 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://vbu.ac.in/2015/08/18/katras-college-katrasgarh/ |title = Katras College, Katrasgarh  |publisher= Vinoba Bhave University | accessdate = 15 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n* Holy Mother's Academy.

There are many much fun-fare organized for each festival. The Katras Hatia is a local village market that runs every Sunday.<ref>http://wikimapia.org/11412640/katras-hatia</ref>\n\n===Lilori Temple===\n{{anchor|Lillori Sthan Mandir}}\n[[File:Road to Lilori Temple.jpg|thumb|Road to Lilori Temple]]\n[[File:Lilori Temple Park.jpg|thumb|Lilori Temple Park]]\n{{expand section|date=September 2013|1=need picture of actual temple and park area}}\n\nLocated 5&nbsp;km from the city center, Lillori Sthan Mandir (Lilori Temple) is an old temple of Goddess Lilori, family deity of local landlord (Raja), who is nowadays considered an incarnation of Goddess Kali.<ref>http://www.hoparoundindia.com/jharkhand/dhanbad-attractions/lillori-sthan-mandir.aspx</ref> Goddess Lilori, typical to Bengal and neighboring area, is non-vegetarian and daily hundreds of animals are sacrificed on her altar.\n\nThe temple is one of the few natural picnic spots in the area, even though tree felling and government neglect has ruined much of the greenery. It also attracts thousands of people daily in the summer for weddings. It neighbours local [[Shmashana|Smashan]], where dead bodies are burnt, and sometimes give it a mystic colour.\n\n===Bharatiya Club===\n{{anchor|Baharatiya Club}}\nIt is one of the oldest library in India which solely carries books from Hindi literature. The library was started by the freedom fighter Late Shri Ramanand Khaitan, who was an ardent political activist during the [[Indian independence movement|Indian freedom movement]].{{when|date=September 2013}}<!--year established?-->  During the British days, the library used to be the melting pot of pro-freedom think-tanks and activists. Today, the library serves the people of Katras and its surrounding areas, filling a necessary void in providing access to Hindi literature. It has a free and open access reading room which gets a regular supply of newspapers, magazines and journals.{{where|date=September 2013|1=is this club in Katras or Jharia??}}\n\n===Raksha Kali Temple===\nThis is a small temple of Raksha Kali in Hatiya(a small vegetable market). Raksha Kali is a very fierce form of Kali and she was supposed to be invoked only when there were calamities like war, epidemic etc. That is why the gate of the temple remains closed all the time. Earlier the gate of the temple were opened only either for the annual Mid-night Puja or on certain occasions like Kali-Puja. Nowadays its gate is being opened daily. This is perhaps either because the Local land-lord (Raja) who was earlier responsible for upkeep of this temple is not able to continue this or because the Pandit who opens its gate expects to earn some money in the way of Aarti-offering etc. Once a year the Goddess is worshiped at mid-night. Offering of some animal is given and Khichdi is cooked with the animal meat. After everybody present there has taken the Prasad of this Khichdi, all remaining materials are buried in front of the temple. There are very small temples of Goddesses like Shitla in the backside of this temple.\n\n===Rakshash Temple===\nThe oldest and most important structure by archaeological and historical point of view is Rakshas temple of Jhinjhi Pahari. This temple is made of stones only and not even small amount of any other, including sand, material has been used to join them. It is understood to be at least six hundred years old. It is said that a similar temple was situated just in front of the Lilori Temple which fell in an earth quack and that these two temples signified some treasure. There is a myth that the temple was constructed by Lord Vishwakarma in a single night.\n\n== Healthcare ==\nDespite having a fairly large population, Katras is lacking any quality medical facilities. There are several hospitals though none have any facilities for dealing with emergencies on a 24-hour basis. Katras has no facility for [[intensive-care unit|intensive care]] and the local [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic centers]] are considered unreliable. There is rampant medical corruption with doctors recommending unnecessary tests and costly medicines. Underlined tests (in the prescription) are not supposed to be carried out. They are only for cheating patients. Tilatand Hospital of BCCL used to be a centre for better treatment, now-a-days it remains empty most of the times. This when there is no better alternative. Most people either go to Dhanbad (for minor treatments) or Bokaro (for major treatment) and finally to CMC, Vellore for better treatment. The lone train from Dhanbad to Allepey (that too taken away)  was full of patients.

She issued First Great Western with a Breach Notice for misreporting cancellations and a Remedial Plan Notice as a result of exceptionally high levels of cancellations and low passenger satisfaction. As part of the Remedial Plan Notice, First Great Western was required to achieve improvement milestones, to lease five more Class 150 units to allow three-car trains to be used on Portsmouth-Cardiff services, to undertake a much more extensive refurbishment of the Thames Turbo fleet, to offer 50% higher compensation for the duration of the franchise, to offer 500,000 more cheap tickets on off-peak services, and to improve station customer information systems. Failure to do this would result in FGW losing its franchise.

She issued First Great Western with a Breach Notice for misreporting cancellations and a Remedial Plan Notice as a result of exceptionally high levels of cancellations and low passenger satisfaction. As part of the Remedial Plan Notice, First Great Western was required to achieve improvement milestones, to lease five more Class 150 units to allow three-car trains to be used on Portsmouth-Cardiff services, to undertake a much more extensive refurbishment of the Thames Turbo fleet, to offer 50% higher compensation for the duration of the franchise, to offer 500,000 more cheap tickets on off-peak services, and to improve station customer information systems. Failure to do this would result in FGW losing its franchise.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago.

Roy pressures Rachel for useful information, including pretending to be a Blue Cat bar customer. Rachel has bathroom sex with a bar pickup and calls him Marty to irritate Roy, who is monitoring her transmitter. To deflect Marty's suspicion from her, Rachel suggests the man from the Blue Cat (Roy) might be a police officer. An infuriated Roy threatens her with a violent end if she does not produce evidence. The Byrdes' planned bribe of a state gaming official ends when Wendy correctly suspects a trap. Wendy tries to provide money to Mason, who angrily refuses.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation. Ruth does not crack, and Helen tells Marty she is impressed with Ruth's willpower. Marty reminds Wendy that she cheated on him, and Charlotte overhears and informs Jonah. Charlotte and Jonah discuss using what is left of their money took to buy a van and run away. Helen tells the Snells to burn their poppies so Roy will not find any evidence, but Darlene resists.

Marty and the Snells disinter several Snell ancestors and use their remains to replace the bones the FBI found, throwing off the test results and enabling Jacob to claim authorities desecrated his family's ancient burial places. Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

The Choir, originally called The Mods and consisting of Dann Klawon, Wally Bryson, Dave Burke, Dave Smalley, and [[Jim Bonfanti]], had a more extensive repertoire of original songs. Most notable was \"It's Cold Outside\" which parlayed its massive local success (#1 in Cleveland) into a nationally-charting single (peaking at No.&nbsp;68 for [[Roulette Records]]). The Choir then went through a series of lineup changes, with Smalley and Bonfanti remaining in the various versions, until 1968, when Dave Smalley was drafted and sent to Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www99.epinions.com/review/Internal_Monologue_-_Dave_Smalley/content_112634596996 |title=Epinions.com: Read expert reviews on Books Internal_Monologue_-_Dave_Smalley |website=9.epinions.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref> As a result, The Choir disbanded, although it later reformed behind Bonfanti and ultimately survived until 1970.\n\nAlthough The Choir had the hit and a string of singles, Cyrus Erie, founded by brothers Michael and Bob McBride, became the better-drawing local act shortly after [[Eric Carmen]] joined in 1967. Carmen persuaded Bryson, who had recently left The Choir, to join. In live shows, Cyrus Erie mainly covered other artists' songs. When the group signed to [[Epic Records]] they recorded two Carmen/Bryson originals (\"Get the Message\" b/w \"Sparrow\") as a single. Following this, Bryson quit to return to The Choir, which led to Cyrus Erie disbanding. Carmen and Dann Klawon then formed a new act called The Quick. The Quick  recorded a single of two Carmen/Klawon originals for Epic which did not find much success.\n\nThe group's style arose from a variety of rock and roll groups that the members loved, especially [[The Who]]. Carmen later said:\n{{quote|Pete Townshend coined the phrase [''power pop''] to define what the Who did. For some reason, it didn't stick to the Who, but it did stick to these groups that came out in the `70s that played kind of melodic songs with crunchy guitars and some wild drumming. It just kind of stuck to us like glue, and that was OK with us because the Who were among our highest role models. We absolutely loved the Who.<ref name=\"by-myself\"/>}}\n\n=== 1970\u20131972 ===\nAfter discussions between Carmen and Bonfanti about forming a new group, the first lineup for the Raspberries was Eric Carmen (rhythm guitar, vocals, piano), Jim Bonfanti (drums), Wally Bryson (lead guitar, vocals) and John Aleksic (bass). Aleksic left the group at the end of 1970. In 1971, Dave Smalley (rhythm guitar, vocals), just back from Vietnam, became the fourth member of the original recording lineup with Carmen moving to bass.  The Raspberries' demo tape went to the desk of producer [[Jimmy Ienner]], for whom Carmen had previously done session work. After a major-label bidding war <ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the raspberries|bio=true}} '''The Raspberries''' biography] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Magazine</ref> the band signed to [[Capitol Records]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xR7MdpuSlAEC&pg=PT302&lpg=PT302&dq=%22The+Raspberries%22+history+bidding+capitol&source=web&ots=bZ5yQQl29u&sig=dKhFJ5P8AodXmZ4aAq5jDK1kdRc&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result |title='&#39;Allmusic'&#39; |author1=Vladimir Bogdanov |author2=Chris Woodstra |author3=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Raspberries wore matching ensembles on stage. The group was criticized{{whom|date=March 2020}} for making its stage entrance in tuxedos and large bouffant hairdos which, according to Carmen, \"complemented the style of our music\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queermusicheritage.com/feb2002.html |title=Queer Music heritage USA |website=Queermusicheritage.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\n=== 1972\u20131974 ===\n\"Go All the Way\" peaked at #5 in the U.S. in October 1972, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]].

After two albums, ''[[Raspberries (album)|Raspberries]]'' and ''[[Fresh (Raspberries album)|Fresh]]'', both released in 1972, creative tension came to a head sparked largely by Carmen's creative dominance (and commercial success) over the contributions of Bryson and Smalley. Accordingly, ''[[Side 3 (Raspberries album)|Side 3]]'' turned out to be a more raw, aggressive effort than its predecessors, typified by the opening track \"Tonight\". After its release, Smalley was ejected from the band, and Bonfanti departed soon afterwards. They subsequently formed their own band, Dynamite. They were replaced by bassist Scott McCarl and ex-Cyrus Erie drummer Michael McBride for what was to be the fourth and final Raspberries album, ''[[Starting Over (Raspberries album)|Starting Over]]''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r16179|pure_url=yes}} ''Starting Over''] LP information and review at AllMusic</ref>\n\n=== Post-breakup ===\nThe band broke up in April 1975, but their style continued to influence other musicians. [[Bruce Springsteen]] praised the Raspberries at several stops during his Summer 2005 tour.<ref>Bruce Springsteen semi-official fan magazine ''[[Backstreets (magazine)|Backstreets]]'', and also the Backstreets.com website</ref> Springsteen's drummer [[Max Weinberg]] said that he based his drum style in that period off of Raspberries drummer Michael McBride (particularly on the Springsteen album ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'').<ref>''Let There Be Drums Vol 3: The 70s'' liner notes</ref> [[Paul Stanley]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Axl Rose]] of [[Guns N' Roses]], have all also cited the Raspberries as an influence in their songwriting.<ref name=adams>{{cite book|title=Rock 'n' roll and the Cleveland connection|first=Deanna R.|last=Adams|pages=252\u2013261|date=January 2002|publisher=[[Kent State University Press]]|ISBN=978-0-87338-691-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Bryson joined another notable power pop band, [[Fotomaker]], led by ex-[[The Rascals|Rascals]] [[Dino Danelli]] and [[Gene Cornish]]. He left shortly after the second of the band's three albums was released. \n\nA biography of the Raspberries titled ''Overnight Sensation \u2013 The Story of the Raspberries'' by Ken Sharp was released in 1993. In 1996, a [[tribute album]] to Raspberries called ''Raspberries Preserved'' was released by Pravda Records, a Chicago-based indie record label. The album featured 21 cover versions by such acts as [[The Rubinoos]], Bill Lloyd, [[Brad Jones (musician)|Brad Jones]], [[Tiny Lights]], [[Rank Strangers]], the Gladhands, and [[The Shambles (band)|The Shambles]].\n\nSinger-guitarist and primary songwriter Eric Carmen went on to have a successful solo career as a singer and writer of romantic pop ballads. His first solo hit \"[[All by Myself]]\" (which rearranged a motif from the melody of \"Let's Pretend\") hit No.&nbsp;2 nationally, and was successfully covered by [[Celine Dion]] in 1996. His second single \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\" was also a hit, as was a spiritual sequel to both, \"[[She Did It]],\" which revived the Raspberries' power pop sound. Carmen later had additional Top Ten singles success with \"[[Hungry Eyes]]\" (from ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', 1987) and \"[[Make Me Lose Control (song)|Make Me Lose Control]]\".  He also wrote \"[[Almost Paradise]]\" (performed by [[Mike Reno]] and [[Ann Wilson]] for ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', 1984),<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=eric carmen|bio=true}} Eric Carmen in ''Billboard'' Magazine]; Artist Biography</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=eric carmen|chart=all}} Eric Carmen ''Billboard'' Chart History]</ref> as well as songs that were made major hits by [[Shaun Cassidy]] (\"That's Rock & Roll\" and \"Hey Deanie\").\n\nIn 1999, Bryson got the band back together without Carmen, but with Smalley and McBride. The trio released a six song [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''Raspberries Refreshed'' in 2000.<ref name=\"artistdirect1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1062807,00.html |title=Refreshed by The Raspberries @ARTISTdirect |website=Artistdirect.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=eric carmen|bio=true}} Billboard online] (see last paragraph)</ref>  The album's tracks, written by the three remaining members, re-created the group's original sound.<ref name=\"artistdirect1\"/>\n\nIn November 2004, the [[House of Blues]] nightclub chain opened its Cleveland branch with a Raspberries reunion concert featuring all four original members.  This led to a well-received 2005 mini-tour starting at the Chicago House of Blues, a [[VH1 Classic]] special, and a concert broadcast on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. A date from the 2005 tour was recorded, and released in 2007 as ''Live on Sunset Strip.'' The double CD and one DVD contained a foreword from Bruce Springsteen, and a 1970s photo of [[John Lennon]] wearing a Raspberries' ''Starting Over'' sweatshirt.  Capitalizing on the release, Raspberries played further shows in New York, California, and their hometown of Cleveland.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gundersen |first=Edna |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-10-11-raspberries_N.htm |title=USA Today |newspaper=USA Today |date=October 11, 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\nThe band's iconic rock tune \"Go All the Way\" attracted renewed attention in 2014 when it was notably included in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|Marvel cinematic universe]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.

The Choir, originally called The Mods and consisting of Dann Klawon, Wally Bryson, Dave Burke, Dave Smalley, and [[Jim Bonfanti]], had a more extensive repertoire of original songs. Most notable was \"It's Cold Outside\" which parlayed its massive local success (#1 in Cleveland) into a nationally-charting single (peaking at No.&nbsp;68 for [[Roulette Records]]). The Choir then went through a series of lineup changes, with Smalley and Bonfanti remaining in the various versions, until 1968, when Dave Smalley was drafted and sent to Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www99.epinions.com/review/Internal_Monologue_-_Dave_Smalley/content_112634596996 |title=Epinions.com: Read expert reviews on Books Internal_Monologue_-_Dave_Smalley |website=9.epinions.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref> As a result, The Choir disbanded, although it later reformed behind Bonfanti and ultimately survived until 1970.\n\nAlthough The Choir had the hit and a string of singles, Cyrus Erie, founded by brothers Michael and Bob McBride, became the better-drawing local act shortly after [[Eric Carmen]] joined in 1967. Carmen persuaded Bryson, who had recently left The Choir, to join. In live shows, Cyrus Erie mainly covered other artists' songs. When the group signed to [[Epic Records]] they recorded two Carmen/Bryson originals (\"Get the Message\" b/w \"Sparrow\") as a single. Following this, Bryson quit to return to The Choir, which led to Cyrus Erie disbanding. Carmen and Dann Klawon then formed a new act called The Quick. The Quick  recorded a single of two Carmen/Klawon originals for Epic which did not find much success.\n\nThe group's style arose from a variety of rock and roll groups that the members loved, especially [[The Who]]. Carmen later said:\n{{quote|Pete Townshend coined the phrase [''power pop''] to define what the Who did. For some reason, it didn't stick to the Who, but it did stick to these groups that came out in the `70s that played kind of melodic songs with crunchy guitars and some wild drumming. It just kind of stuck to us like glue, and that was OK with us because the Who were among our highest role models. We absolutely loved the Who.<ref name=\"by-myself\"/>}}\n\n=== 1970\u20131972 ===\nAfter discussions between Carmen and Bonfanti about forming a new group, the first lineup for the Raspberries was Eric Carmen (rhythm guitar, vocals, piano), Jim Bonfanti (drums), Wally Bryson (lead guitar, vocals) and John Aleksic (bass). Aleksic left the group at the end of 1970. In 1971, Dave Smalley (rhythm guitar, vocals), just back from Vietnam, became the fourth member of the original recording lineup with Carmen moving to bass.  The Raspberries' demo tape went to the desk of producer [[Jimmy Ienner]], for whom Carmen had previously done session work. After a major-label bidding war <ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the raspberries|bio=true}} '''The Raspberries''' biography] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Magazine</ref> the band signed to [[Capitol Records]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xR7MdpuSlAEC&pg=PT302&lpg=PT302&dq=%22The+Raspberries%22+history+bidding+capitol&source=web&ots=bZ5yQQl29u&sig=dKhFJ5P8AodXmZ4aAq5jDK1kdRc&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result |title='&#39;Allmusic'&#39; |author1=Vladimir Bogdanov |author2=Chris Woodstra |author3=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Raspberries wore matching ensembles on stage. The group was criticized{{whom|date=March 2020}} for making its stage entrance in tuxedos and large bouffant hairdos which, according to Carmen, \"complemented the style of our music\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queermusicheritage.com/feb2002.html |title=Queer Music heritage USA |website=Queermusicheritage.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\n=== 1972\u20131974 ===\n\"Go All the Way\" peaked at #5 in the U.S. in October 1972, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]].

After two albums, ''[[Raspberries (album)|Raspberries]]'' and ''[[Fresh (Raspberries album)|Fresh]]'', both released in 1972, creative tension came to a head sparked largely by Carmen's creative dominance (and commercial success) over the contributions of Bryson and Smalley. Accordingly, ''[[Side 3 (Raspberries album)|Side 3]]'' turned out to be a more raw, aggressive effort than its predecessors, typified by the opening track \"Tonight\". After its release, Smalley was ejected from the band, and Bonfanti departed soon afterwards. They subsequently formed their own band, Dynamite. They were replaced by bassist Scott McCarl and ex-Cyrus Erie drummer Michael McBride for what was to be the fourth and final Raspberries album, ''[[Starting Over (Raspberries album)|Starting Over]]''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r16179|pure_url=yes}} ''Starting Over''] LP information and review at AllMusic</ref>\n\n=== Post-breakup ===\nThe band broke up in April 1975, but their style continued to influence other musicians. [[Bruce Springsteen]] praised the Raspberries at several stops during his Summer 2005 tour.<ref>Bruce Springsteen semi-official fan magazine ''[[Backstreets (magazine)|Backstreets]]'', and also the Backstreets.com website</ref> Springsteen's drummer [[Max Weinberg]] said that he based his drum style in that period off of Raspberries drummer Michael McBride (particularly on the Springsteen album ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'').<ref>''Let There Be Drums Vol 3: The 70s'' liner notes</ref> [[Paul Stanley]] of [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Axl Rose]] of [[Guns N' Roses]], have all also cited the Raspberries as an influence in their songwriting.<ref name=adams>{{cite book|title=Rock 'n' roll and the Cleveland connection|first=Deanna R.|last=Adams|pages=252\u2013261|date=January 2002|publisher=[[Kent State University Press]]|ISBN=978-0-87338-691-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Bryson joined another notable power pop band, [[Fotomaker]], led by ex-[[The Rascals|Rascals]] [[Dino Danelli]] and [[Gene Cornish]]. He left shortly after the second of the band's three albums was released. \n\nA biography of the Raspberries titled ''Overnight Sensation \u2013 The Story of the Raspberries'' by Ken Sharp was released in 1993. In 1996, a [[tribute album]] to Raspberries called ''Raspberries Preserved'' was released by Pravda Records, a Chicago-based indie record label. The album featured 21 cover versions by such acts as [[The Rubinoos]], Bill Lloyd, [[Brad Jones (musician)|Brad Jones]], [[Tiny Lights]], [[Rank Strangers]], the Gladhands, and [[The Shambles (band)|The Shambles]].\n\nSinger-guitarist and primary songwriter Eric Carmen went on to have a successful solo career as a singer and writer of romantic pop ballads. His first solo hit \"[[All by Myself]]\" (which rearranged a motif from the melody of \"Let's Pretend\") hit No.&nbsp;2 nationally, and was successfully covered by [[Celine Dion]] in 1996. His second single \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\" was also a hit, as was a spiritual sequel to both, \"[[She Did It]],\" which revived the Raspberries' power pop sound. Carmen later had additional Top Ten singles success with \"[[Hungry Eyes]]\" (from ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', 1987) and \"[[Make Me Lose Control (song)|Make Me Lose Control]]\".  He also wrote \"[[Almost Paradise]]\" (performed by [[Mike Reno]] and [[Ann Wilson]] for ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]'', 1984),<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=eric carmen|bio=true}} Eric Carmen in ''Billboard'' Magazine]; Artist Biography</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=eric carmen|chart=all}} Eric Carmen ''Billboard'' Chart History]</ref> as well as songs that were made major hits by [[Shaun Cassidy]] (\"That's Rock & Roll\" and \"Hey Deanie\").\n\nIn 1999, Bryson got the band back together without Carmen, but with Smalley and McBride. The trio released a six song [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''Raspberries Refreshed'' in 2000.<ref name=\"artistdirect1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,1062807,00.html |title=Refreshed by The Raspberries @ARTISTdirect |website=Artistdirect.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=eric carmen|bio=true}} Billboard online] (see last paragraph)</ref>  The album's tracks, written by the three remaining members, re-created the group's original sound.<ref name=\"artistdirect1\"/>\n\nIn November 2004, the [[House of Blues]] nightclub chain opened its Cleveland branch with a Raspberries reunion concert featuring all four original members.  This led to a well-received 2005 mini-tour starting at the Chicago House of Blues, a [[VH1 Classic]] special, and a concert broadcast on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. A date from the 2005 tour was recorded, and released in 2007 as ''Live on Sunset Strip.'' The double CD and one DVD contained a foreword from Bruce Springsteen, and a 1970s photo of [[John Lennon]] wearing a Raspberries' ''Starting Over'' sweatshirt.  Capitalizing on the release, Raspberries played further shows in New York, California, and their hometown of Cleveland.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gundersen |first=Edna |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-10-11-raspberries_N.htm |title=USA Today |newspaper=USA Today |date=October 11, 2007 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\nThe band's iconic rock tune \"Go All the Way\" attracted renewed attention in 2014 when it was notably included in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe|Marvel cinematic universe]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.
