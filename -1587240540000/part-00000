Six \"Down\" (towards Wigan) trains called from Manchester Central. In addition, one \"express\" called at Glazebrook only and passed Lower Ince without stopping. Of the six, three called at all stations, the remaining three missed some stations between Manchester and Glazebrook. With the exception of the \"express\" all trains called at all stations between Glazebrook and Wigan. The \"Up\" service was similar.{{sfn|Dow|1962|p=354}}\n\nIn 1922 six \"Down\" trains called, All Stations from Manchester Central on \"Weekdays\" (Mondays to Saturdays), with a further evening train from Lowton St Mary's only. Three other trains called, apparently All Stations from Culcheth, but it is possible they originated from [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] or Warrington Central and turned west to north at Glazebrook West Junction. One of these trains ran on Fridays and Saturdays Only and the other two ran on Saturdays Only. The \"Up\" service was broadly similar, but the mix of Saturday Only trains was even more complicated. There was no Sunday service.{{sfn|Bradshaw|1985|pp=714-715}}\n\nThe line through Bickershaw and Abram was also a diversionary route and a route by which traffic such as Summer Saturday holiday specials could bipass busy spots, such as Wigan. Pixton, for example, has a fine 1961 shot of a Summer Saturday Sheffield to Blackpool train at Lowton St Mary's which will pass through the station then bear right immediately north of [[Hindley South railway station|Hindley South]] onto the Whelley Loop, joining the WCML at Standish, bypassing Wigan altogether.{{sfn|Pixton|1996|p=119}}\n\n==Opening, naming and closure== \nThe line and station opened in 1884. The station closed on 2 November 1964, when the line closed to passengers.{{sfn|Butt|1995|pp=120-121}} The line closed to goods in 1968 and has since been lifted.\n\n==After closure==\nBy 2006 the site had been razed to the ground.

Six \"Down\" (towards Wigan) trains called from Manchester Central. In addition, one \"express\" called at Glazebrook only and passed Lower Ince without stopping. Of the six, three called at all stations, the remaining three missed some stations between Manchester and Glazebrook. With the exception of the \"express\" all trains called at all stations between Glazebrook and Wigan. The \"Up\" service was similar.{{sfn|Dow|1962|p=354}}\n\nIn 1922 six \"Down\" trains called, All Stations from Manchester Central on \"Weekdays\" (Mondays to Saturdays), with a further evening train from Lowton St Mary's only. Three other trains called, apparently All Stations from Culcheth, but it is possible they originated from [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] or Warrington Central and turned west to north at Glazebrook West Junction. One of these trains ran on Fridays and Saturdays Only and the other two ran on Saturdays Only. The \"Up\" service was broadly similar, but the mix of Saturday Only trains was even more complicated. There was no Sunday service.{{sfn|Bradshaw|1922|pp=714-715}}\n\nThe line through Bickershaw and Abram was also a diversionary route and a route by which traffic such as Summer Saturday holiday specials could bipass busy spots, such as Wigan. Pixton, for example, has a fine 1961 shot of a Summer Saturday Sheffield to Blackpool train at Lowton St Mary's which will pass through the station then bear right immediately north of [[Hindley South railway station|Hindley South]] onto the Whelley Loop, joining the WCML at Standish, bypassing Wigan altogether.{{sfn|Pixton|1996|p=119}}\n\n==Opening, naming and closure== \nThe line and station opened in 1884.
