It was incorporated as a district municipality in 1892, growing to include additional villages and rural areas over the years, adding the original Town of '''Mission City''', long an independent core of the region, in 1969.\n\nIt is situated on the north bank of the [[Fraser River]], backing onto mountains and lakes overlooking the [[Fraser Valley|Central Fraser Valley]], {{convert|80|km|miles|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.\n\n==Geography==\nUnlike the other [[Fraser Valley]] municipalities, Mission is mostly forested upland with only small floodplains lining the shore of the Fraser River. Some benches of farmland rise in succession northwards above the core developed area of the city. Mission was once the heart of the berry industry in the Fraser Valley, with \"Home of the Big Red Strawberry\" as Mission's slogan in the 1930s and into the 1940s.\n\nThe more southerly portion of the municipality is bounded on the west by the lower reaches of the [[Stave River]], which consists mostly of the lakewaters of two hydroelectric reservoirs, [[Stave Lake]] and [[Hayward Lake]]. Although the vast majority of the population of Mission lives well to the east of the Stave, over 50% of the northern land area of the municipality is west and north of that river; its extreme northwest corner is on the far side of upper [[Alouette Lake]]. A small portion of the lower Stave still runs free in its last two miles before its confluence with the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]]; its last three-quarters of a mile forms the border with the larger municipality of [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Snow-capped mountain.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mount Robie Reid lies just past Mission's northern boundary.]]Over 40% of Mission is actually tree farm, making it only one of two communities with municipal [[tree farm]]s. (Revelstoke BC, with a much smaller and newer farm, is the second.) Mission's tree farm celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008.  It comprises much of the northern part of the district, including the area west of the Stave River, up to the district's northern boundary near the foot of [[Mount Robie Reid]]; a small sliver of Mission District is at the head of [[Alouette Lake]] (normally thought of as being in Maple Ridge).\n\nThe eastern boundary of the municipality roughly coincides with the division between the Mission upland and the alluvial floodplain of Hatzic Prairie, which resembles much of the rest of the Fraser Valley Lowland. The unincorporated communities from Hatzic eastwards through [[Dewdney, British Columbia|Dewdney]] and [[Nicomen Island]] to [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]] are part of the social and commercial matrix centred on Mission but have never joined the municipality, as is also the case with areas north of Hatzic and Dewdney such as [[McConnell Creek, British Columbia|McConnell Creek]] and [[Durieu, British Columbia|Durieu]]; the local economy and societies are built on dairy, berry and corn farming as well as a large [[First Nations]] community at the Indian Reserves of the [[Leq' a: mel First Nation]], formerly known as the Lakahahmen First Nation, on [[Nicomen Island]] and [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]].\n\n==Government==\nMission was incorporated in 1892 and is {{convert|225.78|km2|abbr=on}} in size. In 1922 the District of Mission was partitioned by the creation of the Village of Mission, which later became the Village of Mission City, then the Town of Mission City, until amalgamated with the District by plebiscite in 1969.\n\nThe District of Mission uses the current Council-Manager system of local government. The present Mayor and Council, was elected on November 15, 2018. The current mayor is [[Pam Alexis]]. A notable past mayor is [[Randy Hawes]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mission Junction (HS85-10-22902).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mission's old CPR train station in 1910]]\nThe Town of Mission City began as a land promotion. The town's core commercial properties and residential streets were auctioned off through [[James Welton Horne|James Horne's]] auction, the \"Great Land Sale\" May 19, 1891<ref>https://missionmuseum.com/local-history/the-great-land-sale/</ref>, with buyers brought in via the CPR mainline from Vancouver as well as from Eastern Canada. Soon afterwards, Harry Brown French, an American from New York, came to the city and founded the [[Mission Regional Chamber of Commerce]] on June 19, 1893.<ref name=\"Old Document\">\"Old Document Reveals Board Founded in '93\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 19 April 1945.</ref> It was the first [[Board of Trade]] in B.C.\"<ref name=\"First Board\">Kask, Glen. \"First board of trade in B.C.\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 16 June 1993.</ref> Some of the early houses and commercial buildings were, in fact, specifically designed to be reminiscent of small towns in southern Ontario in order to encourage buyers. Hailed at the time as a new metropolis, the fledgling town's location at the junction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] mainline with a northward extension of the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] brought name suggestions that included East Vancouver and North Seattle. The name Mission City was chosen due to the site's proximity to the historic [[St. Mary's Indian Residential School|St. Mary's Mission]] of the [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] order just east of town, which was founded in 1868 (now the [[Peckquaylis Indian Reserve]]).\n\nAt the time of founding, the swing-span [[Mission Railway Bridge]] opened in 1891 was the only crossing of the Fraser River in the Fraser Valley below the [[Alexandra Bridge (Trans-Canada)|Alexandra Bridge]], and all rail traffic between Vancouver and the United States was necessarily routed through Mission until the [[New Westminster Bridge]] at [[New Westminster]] was built in 1904. The rail bridge at Mission doubled duty as a one-way alternating vehicular bridge until 1973, when a long-promised new [[Mission Bridge]] was finally completed. The bridge's location is geographically important at the head of the tidal bore on the Fraser River, and its water level gauge is an important measure of the Fraser's annual and sometimes dangerously large spring [[freshet]].\n\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Laurier at Mission City, British Columbia (HS85-10-22903).jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] visiting Mission City, 1910]]\nMission City's original retail core was in the small area of lowland between the CPR mainline and the river. Following the great flood of 1894 a few years after the town's founding, the core was relocated just north of the rail line at the foot of the hillside rising above the rail junction. This small commercial strip, originally named Washington Avenue, later Main Street and since the 1980s called First Avenue, is only four or five blocks long and was one of the principal commercial centres of the Fraser Valley for many decades and had a lively retail trade and social life.  Following the 1894 flood, abandoned buildings and lots in the old downtown were taken over by Chinese merchants and workers, creating a Chinatown which lasted until the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missionmuseum.com/ |title=From public display at the Mission Museum |publisher=Missionmuseum.com |date=2012-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe western part of the district, the [[Stave Valley]], is largely rural and forested but its watercourse is home to what was the largest hydroelectric project in British Columbia until the [[Bridge River Power Project]] opened in 1961. It was built by the [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] (BCER) to provide power to the electric street railway and interurban system in Vancouver. The [[Stave Falls Power Co.]] operated a light-gauge railway for passenger and freight service up the lower canyon of the river to the [[Stave Falls Dam|dam]] at [[Stave Falls]]. During the construction of the [[Ruskin Dam]] (completed 1931) the railway was rebuilt at a higher elevation so as to skirt the new Hayward Lake reservoir. The rail line has long been discontinued, but the old grade and its trestles are now part of a recreation trail circling the reservoir.\n\nFlanking the outraces of the powerhouse at Stave Falls there was once a fairly large community (300 houses), which was served by the railway via connections to the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] line at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]], although the (then very rough) Dewdney Trunk Road used the dam to cross the [[Stave River]]. Population in the Stave Falls area is now away from the dams, west along the Dewdney Trunk towards Maple Ridge, in a rural farm-and-wilderness area south of [[Rolley Lake Provincial Park]].\n\nUp against the Maple Ridge boundary near the waterfront on the west side of the Stave, and halfway between the dam and the mills at Ruskin, was a large drive-in theatre for many years. It is now a large trailer park, and the most populated of Ruskin's neighbourhoods.\n\nThe building of the Highway 1 freeway on the south side of the Fraser in the early 1960s brought huge population growth and large shopping malls to formerly rural Abbotsford, Matsqui, Sumas and Langley; as a result Mission lost its \"anchor\", the main Eaton's department store in the Valley, and the town's Main Street businesses lost much of their business to the new shopping malls a few minutes away across the river. This process was accelerated with the opening of the new bridge in the mid-1970s.\n\n[[File:Mission Post Office British Columbia Canada.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Mission Post Office, First Avenue at Welton Avenue in the heart of Mission's commercial core]]Despite a cohesive business community and new retail malls on the edges of the old core, Mission's retail community has never regained its former prominence in the [[Fraser Valley]]. Burgeoning \"[[Commuter town|exurban]]\" population growth connected with the rapid growth of the population of the [[Lower Mainland]] and encouraged by a new [[commuter rail]] line direct to downtown Vancouver, the [[West Coast Express]], has reversed this trend.\nOutside of the core \"urban\" area, most of which had been the Town of Mission City, the former District of Mission was a collection of distinct rural communities, each with their own history and sometimes distinct ethnic flavour. Silverdale, 7 kilometres west of Mission on the east bank of the lower Stave River, was homesteaded in the 1880s by Italian immigrants (including the Gagliardi family); their descendants reside there to this day. Neighbouring Silverhill was founded by a Finnish Utopian sect who were superseded by Scandinavian and German settlers following a forest fire that virtually wiped out the Finns.\n\nSteelhead, in the northern part of the district, was originally a weekend retreat for some of Vancouver's press community. Other localities such as Ferndale, Cedar Valley and Hatzic were farming communities of mixed origin, with Europeans and anglicized French-Canadians alongside the usual English-Scottish Canadian mix typical of much of the Fraser Valley. Throughout the Mission area before [[World War II]], there was a large Japanese-Canadian population involved in berry farming, logging and milling and in the fishery on the river.\n\n[[File:Seminary of Christ the King & Westminster Abbey, Mission, BC 01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Westminster Abbey]]In 1954, [[Benedictine]] [[monk]]s obtained land near Mission, where they set up their [[Westminster Abbey (British Columbia)|Westminster Abbey]] and Seminary of Christ the King. They have lived there ever since, running their own farm and teaching high school and college men at the seminary.\n\nThe berry industry, formerly the district's largest and most important, formed the heart of the town's annual summer party, the Strawberry Festival. The Strawberry Festival began in 1946, when it was suggested by the Board of Trade. But with the impacts on this industry ([[Japanese Canadian Internment|relocation]] of the Japanese during wartime and the devastating [[Fraser River#Flooding|flood]] of 1948), the strawberry theme was abandoned. The town acquired the rights to the Western Canada championships of the [[Soap Box Derby]], which were held annually in a specially built facility until 1973; the Derby has been revived in the new millennium.\n\nMission's other major industry was logging, and the town's several mills were noted for being the world's largest suppliers of red cedar [[shake (shingle)|shake]]s and shingles. The District of Mission has operated for many years its own [[tree farm]], covering most of its northern and northwestern mountainous forests. This tree farm served as a model for silvicultural management on a larger scale throughout British Columbia as well as provided a unique income source for the municipality. From 1967 through the 1970s the Soap Box Derby shared [[Dominion Day]] with a large [[Loggers Sports]] event, one of the largest in British Columbia and important on the [[North American Loggers Sports Association]] circuit.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there was a large cluster of productive mills on the waterfront in Mission, for many years world capital of red cedar shake production (the mill at [[Whonnock, British Columbia|Whonnock]] outproduced the largest of the Mission mills, but Mission's city of mills was the largest overall producer). Nearby Eddy Match Co., between Mission and Hatzic, was the largest matchstick-making plant in the world until it closed in the 1960s; its only rival was in [[Hull, Quebec]].\n\nAdjoining it was the Empress Foods Co. cannery, the survivor of the struggles of the berry industry in the Central Fraser Valley, and dating from the days of Mission's supremacy as strawberry capital of the valley before the 1948 [[Fraser River]] flood wiped it out. In more recent times one of these buildings was for a while converted into the province's largest [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] [[grow-op]], in a scandal involving one of the town's wealthiest families.\n\nMission is noted as the home of a long-established professional dragstrip, [[Mission Raceway Park]], which was moved in relatively recent times outside the dyking of the lower part of town to reduce noise in residential and commercial areas nearby.\n\nIn 1972 a large tract of land in central Mission's Ferndale area, flat upland at the top of the slope above downtown, was acquired by the federal government and developed into two large penal facilities. One is a [[Ferndale Institution|minimum]] security facility, and the other is a [[Mission Institution|medium security]] prison. The northern part of the district, and the wilds of the Stave River basin to the north of it, are home to a few wilderness work camps for young offenders and low-risk convicts; these camps have over recent decades participated in the ongoing clearing of vast forests of flooded-out trees from the inundated areas of [[Stave Lake]], opening the lake to water recreation and public exploration.\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, [[forestry]], hydroelectricity and agriculture were Mission's chief resource sectors and provided the basis for varied related retail and service activities. In recent history, transportation improvements have enabled the manufacturing sector to expand beyond sawmilling and food processing.\n\nForest and wood related industries dominate the manufacturing sector, with an emphasis on [[Western Redcedar|redcedar]] shake and shingle mills. Mission also holds the only municipal tree farm license in British Columbia.\n\n[[Agriculture]] is mostly restricted to a narrow belt along the Fraser River, and the unincorporated Dewdney-Deroche district east of Mission contains the majority of the farms in the area. There are about 96 commercial and hobby farms in the area. Dairy is the chief agricultural enterprise; other income sources include poultry, hogs, beef and vegetables.\n\nMission's largest employer is the local school district, School District #75, and its second largest employer is the District (i.e. the municipality) itself.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mission City railway station (5993731063).jpg|thumb|left|The West Coast Express station in 2011]]\nTransportation infrastructure includes [[British Columbia Highway 11|Abbotsford-Mission Highway 11]], and the [[British Columbia Highway 7|Lougheed Highway 7]]. Mission is also accessible through commuter rail, the [[West Coast Express]], which runs five trains in each direction a day, five days a week, between [[Vancouver]] and [[Mission City Station]].  Bus service in Mission is served by the [[Central Fraser Valley Transit System]] connecting with the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|City of Abbotsford]], as well as [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] with service to [[Coquitlam Central Station]] via route 701.\nThree days per week [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[The Canadian]]'' provides eastbound flag stop service from [[Mission Harbour railway station]].\n\nMission differs from some of the other Fraser Valley communities because of its access to the Fraser River. The Fraser near Mission is for the most part undeveloped and unspoiled which makes Mission the launch point for many water based activities that happen year round.

Organizations established in Mission included the  Japanese Farmer's Association (Nokai), established in 1916; the Mission Judo Club; the Mission Buddhist Church; and a Japanese Language School.

territories of Canada|province]] of [[British Columbia]], Canada.  It was incorporated as a district municipality in 1892, growing to include additional villages and rural areas over the years, adding the original Town of '''Mission City''', long an independent core of the region, in 1969.\n\nIt is situated on the north bank of the [[Fraser River]], backing onto mountains and lakes overlooking the [[Fraser Valley|Central Fraser Valley]], {{convert|80|km|miles|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.\n\n==Geography==\nUnlike the other [[Fraser Valley]] municipalities, Mission is mostly forested upland with only small floodplains lining the shore of the Fraser River. Some benches of farmland rise in succession northwards above the core developed area of the city. Mission was once the heart of the berry industry in the Fraser Valley, with \"Home of the Big Red Strawberry\" as Mission's slogan in the 1930s and into the 1940s.\n\nThe more southerly portion of the municipality is bounded on the west by the lower reaches of the [[Stave River]], which consists mostly of the lakewaters of two hydroelectric reservoirs, [[Stave Lake]] and [[Hayward Lake]]. Although the vast majority of the population of Mission lives well to the east of the Stave, over 50% of the northern land area of the municipality is west and north of that river; its extreme northwest corner is on the far side of upper [[Alouette Lake]]. A small portion of the lower Stave still runs free in its last two miles before its confluence with the [[Fraser River|Fraser]] at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]]; its last three-quarters of a mile forms the border with the larger municipality of [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]] to the west.\n\n[[File:Snow-capped mountain.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mount Robie Reid lies just past Mission's northern boundary.]]Over 40% of Mission is actually tree farm, making it only one of two communities with municipal [[tree farm]]s. (Revelstoke BC, with a much smaller and newer farm, is the second.) Mission's tree farm celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008.  It comprises much of the northern part of the district, including the area west of the Stave River, up to the district's northern boundary near the foot of [[Mount Robie Reid]]; a small sliver of Mission District is at the head of [[Alouette Lake]] (normally thought of as being in Maple Ridge).\n\nThe eastern boundary of the municipality roughly coincides with the division between the Mission upland and the alluvial floodplain of Hatzic Prairie, which resembles much of the rest of the Fraser Valley Lowland. The unincorporated communities from Hatzic eastwards through [[Dewdney, British Columbia|Dewdney]] and [[Nicomen Island]] to [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]] are part of the social and commercial matrix centred on Mission but have never joined the municipality, as is also the case with areas north of Hatzic and Dewdney such as [[McConnell Creek, British Columbia|McConnell Creek]] and [[Durieu, British Columbia|Durieu]]; the local economy and societies are built on dairy, berry and corn farming as well as a large [[First Nations]] community at the Indian Reserves of the [[Leq' a: mel First Nation]], formerly known as the Lakahahmen First Nation, on [[Nicomen Island]] and [[Deroche, British Columbia|Deroche]].\n\n==Government==\nMission was incorporated in 1892 and is {{convert|225.78|km2|abbr=on}} in size. In 1922 the District of Mission was partitioned by the creation of the Village of Mission, which later became the Village of Mission City, then the Town of Mission City, until amalgamated with the District by plebiscite in 1969.\n\nThe District of Mission uses the current Council-Manager system of local government. The present Mayor and Council, was elected on November 15, 2018. The current mayor is [[Pam Alexis]]. A notable past mayor is [[Randy Hawes]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mission Junction (HS85-10-22902).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mission's old CPR train station in 1910]]\nThe Town of Mission City began as a land promotion. The town's core commercial properties and residential streets were auctioned off through [[James Welton Horne|James Horne's]] auction, the \"Great Land Sale\" May 19, 1891<ref>https://missionmuseum.com/local-history/the-great-land-sale/</ref>, with buyers brought in via the CPR mainline from Vancouver as well as from Eastern Canada. Soon afterwards, Harry Brown French, an American from New York, came to the city and founded the [[Mission Regional Chamber of Commerce]] on June 19, 1893.<ref name=\"Old Document\">\"Old Document Reveals Board Founded in '93\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 19 April 1945.</ref> It was the first [[Board of Trade]] in B.C.\"<ref name=\"First Board\">Kask, Glen. \"First board of trade in B.C.\", ''[[The Fraser Valley Record]]'', Mission, BC, Canada, 16 June 1993.</ref> Some of the early houses and commercial buildings were, in fact, specifically designed to be reminiscent of small towns in southern Ontario in order to encourage buyers. Hailed at the time as a new metropolis, the fledgling town's location at the junction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] mainline with a northward extension of the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] brought name suggestions that included East Vancouver and North Seattle. The name Mission City was chosen due to the site's proximity to the historic [[St. Mary's Indian Residential School|St. Mary's Mission]] of the [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]] order just east of town, which was founded in 1868 (now the [[Peckquaylis Indian Reserve]]).\n\nAt the time of founding, the swing-span [[Mission Railway Bridge]] opened in 1891 was the only crossing of the Fraser River in the Fraser Valley below the [[Alexandra Bridge (Trans-Canada)|Alexandra Bridge]], and all rail traffic between Vancouver and the United States was necessarily routed through Mission until the [[New Westminster Bridge]] at [[New Westminster]] was built in 1904. The rail bridge at Mission doubled duty as a one-way alternating vehicular bridge until 1973, when a long-promised new [[Mission Bridge]] was finally completed. The bridge's location is geographically important at the head of the tidal bore on the Fraser River, and its water level gauge is an important measure of the Fraser's annual and sometimes dangerously large spring [[freshet]].\n\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Laurier at Mission City, British Columbia (HS85-10-22903).jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] visiting Mission City, 1910]]\nMission City's original retail core was in the small area of lowland between the CPR mainline and the river. Following the great flood of 1894 a few years after the town's founding, the core was relocated just north of the rail line at the foot of the hillside rising above the rail junction. This small commercial strip, originally named Washington Avenue, later Main Street and since the 1980s called First Avenue, is only four or five blocks long and was one of the principal commercial centres of the Fraser Valley for many decades and had a lively retail trade and social life.  Following the 1894 flood, abandoned buildings and lots in the old downtown were taken over by Chinese merchants and workers, creating a Chinatown which lasted until the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missionmuseum.com/ |title=From public display at the Mission Museum |publisher=Missionmuseum.com |date=2012-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThe western part of the district, the [[Stave Valley]], is largely rural and forested but its watercourse is home to what was the largest hydroelectric project in British Columbia until the [[Bridge River Power Project]] opened in 1961. It was built by the [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] (BCER) to provide power to the electric street railway and interurban system in Vancouver. The [[Stave Falls Power Co.]] operated a light-gauge railway for passenger and freight service up the lower canyon of the river to the [[Stave Falls Dam|dam]] at [[Stave Falls]]. During the construction of the [[Ruskin Dam]] (completed 1931) the railway was rebuilt at a higher elevation so as to skirt the new Hayward Lake reservoir. The rail line has long been discontinued, but the old grade and its trestles are now part of a recreation trail circling the reservoir.\n\nFlanking the outraces of the powerhouse at Stave Falls there was once a fairly large community (300 houses), which was served by the railway via connections to the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] line at [[Ruskin, British Columbia|Ruskin]], although the (then very rough) Dewdney Trunk Road used the dam to cross the [[Stave River]]. Population in the Stave Falls area is now away from the dams, west along the Dewdney Trunk towards Maple Ridge, in a rural farm-and-wilderness area south of [[Rolley Lake Provincial Park]].\n\nUp against the Maple Ridge boundary near the waterfront on the west side of the Stave, and halfway between the dam and the mills at Ruskin, was a large drive-in theatre for many years. It is now a large trailer park, and the most populated of Ruskin's neighbourhoods.\n\nThe building of the Highway 1 freeway on the south side of the Fraser in the early 1960s brought huge population growth and large shopping malls to formerly rural Abbotsford, Matsqui, Sumas and Langley; as a result Mission lost its \"anchor\", the main Eaton's department store in the Valley, and the town's Main Street businesses lost much of their business to the new shopping malls a few minutes away across the river. This process was accelerated with the opening of the new bridge in the mid-1970s.\n\n[[File:Mission Post Office British Columbia Canada.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Mission Post Office, First Avenue at Welton Avenue in the heart of Mission's commercial core]]Despite a cohesive business community and new retail malls on the edges of the old core, Mission's retail community has never regained its former prominence in the [[Fraser Valley]]. Burgeoning \"[[Commuter town|exurban]]\" population growth connected with the rapid growth of the population of the [[Lower Mainland]] and encouraged by a new [[commuter rail]] line direct to downtown Vancouver, the [[West Coast Express]], has reversed this trend.\nOutside of the core \"urban\" area, most of which had been the Town of Mission City, the former District of Mission was a collection of distinct rural communities, each with their own history and sometimes distinct ethnic flavour. Silverdale, 7 kilometres west of Mission on the east bank of the lower Stave River, was homesteaded in the 1880s by Italian immigrants (including the Gagliardi family); their descendants reside there to this day. Neighbouring Silverhill was founded by a Finnish Utopian sect who were superseded by Scandinavian and German settlers following a forest fire that virtually wiped out the Finns.\n\nSteelhead, in the northern part of the district, was originally a weekend retreat for some of Vancouver's press community. Other localities such as Ferndale, Cedar Valley and Hatzic were farming communities of mixed origin, with Europeans and anglicized French-Canadians alongside the usual English-Scottish Canadian mix typical of much of the Fraser Valley. Throughout the Mission area before [[World War II]], there was a large Japanese-Canadian population involved in berry farming, logging and milling and in the fishery on the river.\n\n[[File:Seminary of Christ the King & Westminster Abbey, Mission, BC 01.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Westminster Abbey]]In 1954, [[Benedictine]] [[monk]]s obtained land near Mission, where they set up their [[Westminster Abbey (British Columbia)|Westminster Abbey]] and Seminary of Christ the King. They have lived there ever since, running their own farm and teaching high school and college men at the seminary.\n\nThe berry industry, formerly the district's largest and most important, formed the heart of the town's annual summer party, the Strawberry Festival. The Strawberry Festival began in 1946, when it was suggested by the Board of Trade. But with the impacts on this industry ([[Japanese Canadian Internment|relocation]] of the Japanese during wartime and the devastating [[Fraser River#Flooding|flood]] of 1948), the strawberry theme was abandoned. The town acquired the rights to the Western Canada championships of the [[Soap Box Derby]], which were held annually in a specially built facility until 1973; the Derby has been revived in the new millennium.\n\nMission's other major industry was logging, and the town's several mills were noted for being the world's largest suppliers of red cedar [[shake (shingle)|shake]]s and shingles. The District of Mission has operated for many years its own [[tree farm]], covering most of its northern and northwestern mountainous forests. This tree farm served as a model for silvicultural management on a larger scale throughout British Columbia as well as provided a unique income source for the municipality. From 1967 through the 1970s the Soap Box Derby shared [[Dominion Day]] with a large [[Loggers Sports]] event, one of the largest in British Columbia and important on the [[North American Loggers Sports Association]] circuit.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there was a large cluster of productive mills on the waterfront in Mission, for many years world capital of red cedar shake production (the mill at [[Whonnock, British Columbia|Whonnock]] outproduced the largest of the Mission mills, but Mission's city of mills was the largest overall producer). Nearby Eddy Match Co., between Mission and Hatzic, was the largest matchstick-making plant in the world until it closed in the 1960s; its only rival was in [[Hull, Quebec]].\n\nAdjoining it was the Empress Foods Co. cannery, the survivor of the struggles of the berry industry in the Central Fraser Valley, and dating from the days of Mission's supremacy as strawberry capital of the valley before the 1948 [[Fraser River]] flood wiped it out. In more recent times one of these buildings was for a while converted into the province's largest [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] [[grow-op]], in a scandal involving one of the town's wealthiest families.\n\nMission is noted as the home of a long-established professional dragstrip, [[Mission Raceway Park]], which was moved in relatively recent times outside the dyking of the lower part of town to reduce noise in residential and commercial areas nearby.\n\nIn 1972 a large tract of land in central Mission's Ferndale area, flat upland at the top of the slope above downtown, was acquired by the federal government and developed into two large penal facilities. One is a [[Ferndale Institution|minimum]] security facility, and the other is a [[Mission Institution|medium security]] prison. The northern part of the district, and the wilds of the Stave River basin to the north of it, are home to a few wilderness work camps for young offenders and low-risk convicts; these camps have over recent decades participated in the ongoing clearing of vast forests of flooded-out trees from the inundated areas of [[Stave Lake]], opening the lake to water recreation and public exploration.\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, [[forestry]], hydroelectricity and agriculture were Mission's chief resource sectors and provided the basis for varied related retail and service activities. In recent history, transportation improvements have enabled the manufacturing sector to expand beyond sawmilling and food processing.\n\nForest and wood related industries dominate the manufacturing sector, with an emphasis on [[Western Redcedar|redcedar]] shake and shingle mills. Mission also holds the only municipal tree farm license in British Columbia.\n\n[[Agriculture]] is mostly restricted to a narrow belt along the Fraser River, and the unincorporated Dewdney-Deroche district east of Mission contains the majority of the farms in the area. There are about 96 commercial and hobby farms in the area. Dairy is the chief agricultural enterprise; other income sources include poultry, hogs, beef and vegetables.\n\nMission's largest employer is the local school district, School District #75, and its second largest employer is the District (i.e. the municipality) itself.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Mission City railway station (5993731063).jpg|thumb|left|The West Coast Express station in 2011]]\nTransportation infrastructure includes [[British Columbia Highway 11|Abbotsford-Mission Highway 11]], and the [[British Columbia Highway 7|Lougheed Highway 7]]. Mission is also accessible through commuter rail, the [[West Coast Express]], which runs five trains in each direction a day, five days a week, between [[Vancouver]] and [[Mission City Station]].  Bus service in Mission is served by the [[Central Fraser Valley Transit System]] connecting with the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|City of Abbotsford]], as well as [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] with service to [[Coquitlam Central Station]] via route 701.\nThree days per week [[Via Rail]]'s ''[[The Canadian]]'' provides eastbound flag stop service from [[Mission Harbour railway station]].\n\nMission differs from some of the other Fraser Valley communities because of its access to the Fraser River. The Fraser near Mission is for the most part undeveloped and unspoiled which makes Mission the launch point for many water based activities that happen year round. Boat tours run from Mission's docks on Harbour Avenue, which are also home to sport and commercial fishing vessels; the Fraser has famous salmon runs and population of [[green sturgeon]].\n\n[[File:Missionbridge.jpg|thumb|300px|The Mission Bridge carries Highway 11.  Following this bridge's opening much of the town's retail business was lost to Abbotsford.]]\n\n==Climate==\nMission has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb'') due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. However, Mission has plentiful rainfall all year round, with a drying trend in the summer.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Mission\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 15.6\n|Feb record high C = 20.6\n|Mar record high C = 22.5\n|Apr record high C = 28.0\n|May record high C = 36.5\n|Jun record high C = 36.0\n|Jul record high C = 37.8\n|Aug record high C = 36.5\n|Sep record high C = 36.0\n|Oct record high C = 27.0\n|Nov record high C = 18.9\n|Dec record high C = 17.5\n|year record high C = 37.8\n|Jan high C = 5.1\n|Feb high C = 8.0\n|Mar high C = 10.9\n|Apr high C = 14.6\n|May high C = 17.4\n|Jun high C = 19.9\n|Jul high C = 23.5\n|Aug high C = 23.4\n|Sep high C = 20.9\n|Oct high C = 14.9\n|Nov high C = 8.9\n|Dec high C = 6.0\n|year high C = 14.5\n|Jan mean C = 2.5\n|Feb mean C = 4.7\n|Mar mean C = 6.8\n|Apr mean C = 9.7\n|May mean C = 12.6\n|Jun mean C = 15.1\n|Jul mean C = 17.9\n|Aug mean C = 18.0\n|Sep mean C = 15.6\n|Oct mean C = 10.9\n|Nov mean C = 6.1\n|Dec mean C = 3.5\n|year mean C = 10.3\n|Jan low C = \u22120.2\n|Feb low C = 1.3\n|Mar low C = 2.7\n|Apr low C = 4.8\n|May low C = 7.7\n|Jun low C = 10.3\n|Jul low C = 12.3\n|Aug low C = 12.5\n|Sep low C = 10.4\n|Oct low C = 6.7\n|Nov low C = 3.2\n|Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C = 6.1\n|Jan record low C = \u221214.4\n|Feb record low C = \u221215.5\n|Mar record low C = \u221212.2\n|Apr record low C = \u22122.8\n|May record low C = \u22122.2\n|Jun record low C = 2.2\n|Jul record low C = 4.4\n|Aug record low C = 5.0\n|Sep record low C = 0.6\n|Oct record low C = \u22123.5\n|Nov record low C = \u221213.3\n|Dec record low C = \u221219.4\n|year record low C = \u221219.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 217.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 190.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 154.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 129.7\n|May precipitation mm = 102.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 100.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 63.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 74.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 77.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 141.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 252.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 260.1\n|year precipitation mm = 1764.5\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 197.3\n|Feb rain mm = 178.8\n|Mar rain mm = 151.2\n|Apr rain mm = 129.5\n|May rain mm = 102.5\n|Jun rain mm = 100.6\n|Jul rain mm = 63.6\n|Aug rain mm = 74.0\n|Sep rain mm = 77.9\n|Oct rain mm = 141.1\n|Nov rain mm = 249.1\n|Dec rain mm = 242.9\n|year rain mm = 1708.5\n|Jan snow cm = 19.7\n|Feb snow cm = 11.9\n|Mar snow cm = 3.4\n|Apr snow cm = 0.2\n|May snow cm = 0\n|Jun snow cm = 0\n|Jul snow cm = 0\n|Aug snow cm = 0\n|Sep snow cm = 0\n|Oct snow cm = 0.1\n|Nov snow cm = 3.6\n|Dec snow cm = 17.2\n|year snow cm = 56.0\n|unit precipitation days= 0.2 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 19.3\n|Feb precipitation days = 16.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 18.0\n|Apr precipitation days = 15.0\n|May precipitation days = 15.6\n|Jun precipitation days = 14.4\n|Jul precipitation days = 9.7\n|Aug precipitation days = 9.6\n|Sep precipitation days = 9.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 15.4\n|Nov precipitation days = 20.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 21.6\n|year precipitation days= 186.0\n|unit rain days= 0.2 mm\n|Jan rain days = 17.3\n|Feb rain days = 15.8\n|Mar rain days = 17.6\n|Apr rain days = 15.0\n|May rain days = 15.6\n|Jun rain days = 14.4\n|Jul rain days = 9.7\n|Aug rain days = 9.6\n|Sep rain days = 9.8\n|Oct rain days = 15.4\n|Nov rain days = 20.4\n|Dec rain days = 19.5\n|year rain days= 180.1\n|unit snow days= 0.2 cm\n|Jan snow days = 4.2\n|Feb snow days = 2.3\n|Mar snow days = 1.1\n|Apr snow days = 0.17\n|May snow days = 0.03\n|Jun snow days = 0\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 0\n|Oct snow days = 0.06\n|Nov snow days = 0.82\n|Dec snow days = 3.7\n|year snow days= 12.4\n|source 1 = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"climate\">[[Environment Canada]]\u2014[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=809&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000], accessed 24 November 2012</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nMission offers few jobs, so many residents (more than 6 out of 10) commute to work in other locales.

Later, he, Aoba and a group of their peers go downtown to city hall to collect information for the Meteorite Festival. Then, after spending the day in the city, they get lost and stray into a district called the Black Market, where Legoshi is horrified to see herbivores selling their own body parts to passing carnivores. While running away through the market, Legoshi is overcome by the scent of meat and passes out in a back alley. There he is picked up by the Black Market's psychotherapist and guardian, who explains to Legoshi that his feelings for Haru are actually his predatory instincts disguised as romantic feelings.

Later, he, Aoba and a group of their peers go downtown to city hall to collect information for the Meteorite Festival. Then, after spending the day in the city, they get lost and stray into a district called the Black Market, where Legoshi is horrified to see herbivores selling their own body parts to passing carnivores. While running away through the market, Legoshi is overcome by the scent of meat and passes out in a back alley. There he is picked up by the Black Market's psychotherapist and guardian, who explains to Legoshi that his feelings for Haru are actually his predatory instincts disguised as romantic feelings. When Legoshi explains to him that he has no prior experience with love, he gives him a rabbit-themed erotic magazine to test whether those feelings are based on love or predatory instincts. On his way back to school, Legoshi runs into Aoba, who was likewise disgusted by the Black Market, and the two reconcile.

There are no ''ahadith'' (plural of hadith) support this interpretation.

After Muhammad meets with Abraham, he continues on to meet Allah without Gabriel. Allah tells Muhammad that his people must pray 50 times a day, but as Muhammad descends back to Earth, he meets Moses who tells Muhammad to go back to God and ask for fewer prayers because 50 is too many. Muhammad goes between Moses and God nine times, until the prayers are reduced to the five daily prayers, which God will reward tenfold.<ref>{{cite book|last1=al-Tabari|title=The History of al-Tabari volume VI: Muhammad at Mecca|date=1989|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=0-88706-706-9}}</ref> That again, Moses told Muhammad to ask for even lesser but Muhammad felt ashamed and said that even with lesser prayer times, his followers might not even perform diligently and said he is thankful for the five.\n\n[[Al-Tabari]] is a classic and authentic source for Islamic research. His description of the Mi\u02bfraj is just as simplified as the description given above, which is where other narratives and hadiths of the Mi\u02bfraj stem from, as well as word of mouth. While this is the simplest description of the Mi\u02bfraj, others include more details about the prophets that Muhammad meets. In accounts written by Muslim, [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], [[Ibn Ishaq]], Ahmad b. Hanbal and others, physical descriptions of the prophets are given. [[Adam]] is described first as being Muhammad's father, which establishes a link between them as first and last prophets.<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{cite book|last1=Vuckovic|first1=Brooke Olsen|title=Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi\u02bfraj in the Formation of Islam|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96785-6}}</ref> Physical descriptions of Adam show him as tall and handsome with long hair. Idris, who is not mentioned as much as the other prophets Muhammad meets, is described as someone who was raised to a higher status by God. Joseph, is described as the most beautiful man who is like the moon. His presence in the Mi\u02bfraj is to show his popularity and how it relates to Muhammad's. Aaron is described as Muhammad's brother who is older and one of the most beautiful men that Muhammad had met. Again, the love for Aaron by his people relates to Muhammad and his people. Abraham is described with likeness to Muhammad in ways that illustrate him to be Muhammad's father. Jesus is usually linked to John the Baptist, who is not mentioned much. The physical descriptions of Jesus vary, but he is said to be tall with long hair and either red or white skin. Moses is different than the other prophets that Muhammad meets in that Moses stands as a point of difference rather than similarities.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nSome narratives also record events that preceded the heavenly ascent. Some scholars believe that the opening of Muhammad's chest was a cleansing ritual that purified Muhammad before he ascended into heaven. Muhammad's chest was opened up and water of Zamzam was poured on his heart giving him wisdom, belief, and other necessary characteristics to help him in his ascent. This purification is also seen in the trial of the drinks. It is debated when it took place\u2014before or after the ascent\u2014but either way it plays an important role in determining Muhammad's spiritual righteousness.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\n====Ibn \u2018Abbas' Primitive Version====\nIbn \u02bfAbbas' Primitive Version narrates all that Muhammad encounters throughout his journey through heaven. This includes seeing other angels, and seas of light, darkness, and fire. With Gabriel as his companion, Muhammad meets four key angels as he travels through the heavens. These angels are the Rooster angel (whose call influences all earthly roosters), [[Ishim (angel)#In Islam|Half-Fire Half-Snow angel]] (who provides an example of God's power to bring fire and ice in harmony), the [[Azrael|Angel of Death]] (who describes the process of death and the sorting of souls), and the [[Maalik|Guardian of Hellfire]] (who shows Muhammad what hell looks like). These four angels are met in the beginning of Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative. They are mentioned in other accounts of Muhammad's ascension, but they are not talked about with as much detail as Ibn \u02bfAbbas provides. As the narrative continues, Ibn Abbas focuses mostly on the angels that Muhammad meets rather than the prophets. There are rows of angels that Muhammad encounters throughout heaven, and he even meets certain deeply devoted angels called [[cherub]]im. These angels instill fear in Muhammad, but he later sees them as God's creation, and therefore not harmful. Other important details that Ibn \u2018Abbas adds to the narrative are the Heavenly Host Debate, the Final Verses of the Cow Chapter, and the Favor of the Prophets.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\">{{cite book|last1=Colby|first1=Frederick S|title=Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey: Tracing the Development of the Ibn 'Abbas Ascension Discourse|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7518-8}}</ref> These important topics help to outline the greater detail that Ibn \u2018Abbas uses in his Primitive Version.\n\nSome debates that Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative brings about have to do with his description of Muhammad's encounter with God. Ibn \u02bfAbbas illustrates God as [[Anthropomorphization|anthropomorphed]] being who touches and speaks to Muhammad as a human would. This is seen as an abomination and thus takes away Ibn \u02bfAbbas's authenticity. In an attempt to reestablish Ibn \u2018Abbas as authentic, it seems as though a translator added the descent of Muhammad and the meeting with the prophets. The narrative only briefly states the encounters with the prophets, and does so in a way that is in chronological order rather than the normal order usually seen in ascension narratives. Ibn \u02bfAbbas may have left out the meeting of the prophets and the encounter with Moses that led to the reduction of daily prayers because those events were already written elsewhere. Whether he included that in his original narrative or if it was added by a later translator is unknown, but often a point of contention when discussing Ibn \u2018Abbas's Primitive Version.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\"/>\n\n==Modern Muslim observance==\nThe ''Lailat al-Mi\u02bfraj'' ({{lang-ar|\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|ar|Lailatu 'l-Mi\u02bfr\u0101j}}), also known as ''Shab-e-Mi'raj'' ({{lang-bn|\u09b6\u09ac\u09c7 \u09ae\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u099c|\u0160obe Meraj}}, {{lang-fa|\u0634\u0628 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|fa|\u0160ab-e Mi'r\u00e2j}}) in Iran, [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], and ''Mira\u00e7 Kandili'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is the [[Muslim holidays|Muslim holiday]] celebrating the Isra and Mi\u02bfraj.

[[Adam]] is described first as being Muhammad's father, which establishes a link between them as first and last prophets.<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{cite book|last1=Vuckovic|first1=Brooke Olsen|title=Heavenly Journeys, Earthly Concerns: The Legacy of the Mi\u02bfraj in the Formation of Islam|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96785-6}}</ref> Physical descriptions of Adam show him as tall and handsome with long hair. Idris, who is not mentioned as much as the other prophets Muhammad meets, is described as someone who was raised to a higher status by God. Joseph, is described as the most beautiful man who is like the moon. His presence in the Mi\u02bfraj is to show his popularity and how it relates to Muhammad's. Aaron is described as Muhammad's brother who is older and one of the most beautiful men that Muhammad had met. Again, the love for Aaron by his people relates to Muhammad and his people. Abraham is described with likeness to Muhammad in ways that illustrate him to be Muhammad's father. Jesus is usually linked to John the Baptist, who is not mentioned much. The physical descriptions of Jesus vary, but he is said to be tall with long hair and either red or white skin. Moses is different than the other prophets that Muhammad meets in that Moses stands as a point of difference rather than similarities.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nSome narratives also record events that preceded the heavenly ascent. Some scholars believe that the opening of Muhammad's chest was a cleansing ritual that purified Muhammad before he ascended into heaven. Muhammad's chest was opened up and water of Zamzam was poured on his heart giving him wisdom, belief, and other necessary characteristics to help him in his ascent. This purification is also seen in the trial of the drinks. It is debated when it took place\u2014before or after the ascent\u2014but either way it plays an important role in determining Muhammad's spiritual righteousness.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\n====Ibn \u2018Abbas' Primitive Version====\nIbn \u02bfAbbas' Primitive Version narrates all that Muhammad encounters throughout his journey through heaven. This includes seeing other angels, and seas of light, darkness, and fire. With Gabriel as his companion, Muhammad meets four key angels as he travels through the heavens. These angels are the Rooster angel (whose call influences all earthly roosters), [[Ishim (angel)#In Islam|Half-Fire Half-Snow angel]] (who provides an example of God's power to bring fire and ice in harmony), the [[Azrael|Angel of Death]] (who describes the process of death and the sorting of souls), and the [[Maalik|Guardian of Hellfire]] (who shows Muhammad what hell looks like). These four angels are met in the beginning of Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative. They are mentioned in other accounts of Muhammad's ascension, but they are not talked about with as much detail as Ibn \u02bfAbbas provides. As the narrative continues, Ibn Abbas focuses mostly on the angels that Muhammad meets rather than the prophets. There are rows of angels that Muhammad encounters throughout heaven, and he even meets certain deeply devoted angels called [[cherub]]im. These angels instill fear in Muhammad, but he later sees them as God's creation, and therefore not harmful. Other important details that Ibn \u2018Abbas adds to the narrative are the Heavenly Host Debate, the Final Verses of the Cow Chapter, and the Favor of the Prophets.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\">{{cite book|last1=Colby|first1=Frederick S|title=Narrating Muhammad's Night Journey: Tracing the Development of the Ibn 'Abbas Ascension Discourse|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-7518-8}}</ref> These important topics help to outline the greater detail that Ibn \u2018Abbas uses in his Primitive Version.\n\nSome debates that Ibn \u02bfAbbas' narrative brings about have to do with his description of Muhammad's encounter with God. Ibn \u02bfAbbas illustrates God as [[Anthropomorphization|anthropomorphed]] being who touches and speaks to Muhammad as a human would. This is seen as an abomination and thus takes away Ibn \u02bfAbbas's authenticity. In an attempt to reestablish Ibn \u2018Abbas as authentic, it seems as though a translator added the descent of Muhammad and the meeting with the prophets. The narrative only briefly states the encounters with the prophets, and does so in a way that is in chronological order rather than the normal order usually seen in ascension narratives. Ibn \u02bfAbbas may have left out the meeting of the prophets and the encounter with Moses that led to the reduction of daily prayers because those events were already written elsewhere. Whether he included that in his original narrative or if it was added by a later translator is unknown, but often a point of contention when discussing Ibn \u2018Abbas's Primitive Version.<ref name=\"State University of New York Press\"/>\n\n==Modern Muslim observance==\nThe ''Lailat al-Mi\u02bfraj'' ({{lang-ar|\u0644\u06cc\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|ar|Lailatu 'l-Mi\u02bfr\u0101j}}), also known as ''Shab-e-Mi'raj'' ({{lang-bn|\u09b6\u09ac\u09c7 \u09ae\u09c7\u09b0\u09be\u099c|\u0160obe Meraj}}, {{lang-fa|\u0634\u0628 \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c}}, {{transl|fa|\u0160ab-e Mi'r\u00e2j}}) in Iran, [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]], and ''Mira\u00e7 Kandili'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], is the [[Muslim holidays|Muslim holiday]] celebrating the Isra and Mi\u02bfraj. Some Muslims celebrate this event by offering optional prayers during this night, and in some Muslim countries, by illuminating cities with electric lights and candles. The celebrations around this day tend to focus on every Muslim who wants to celebrate it. Worshippers gather into mosques and perform prayer and supplication. Some people may pass their knowledge on to others by telling them the story on how Muhammad's heart was purified by the [[Gabriel|archangel Gabriel]], who filled him with knowledge and faith in preparation to enter the seven levels of heaven. After [[salah]], food and treats are served.<ref name=times/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/holydays/lailatalmiraj.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Religions \u2013 Islam: Lailat al Miraj|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0191/9101056.htm|title=WRMEA \u2013 Islam in America|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs}}</ref>\n\n[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to [[heaven]]. The exact date of the Journey is not clear, but is celebrated as though it took place before the [[Hegira]] and after Muhammad's visit to the people of [[Ta'if]]. It is considered by some to have happened just over a year before the Hijrah, on the 27th of [[Rajab]]; but this date is not always recognized. This date would correspond to the [[Julian calendar|Julian date]] of 26 February 621, or, if from the previous year, 8 March 620. In [[Twelver]] [[Iran]] for example, Rajab 27 is the day of Muhammad's first calling or ''Mab'as''. The al-Aqsa Mosque and surrounding area, marks the place from which Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven, is the third-holiest place on earth for Muslims.<ref name=\"BloomBlair2009\">{{cite book|author1=Jonathan M.

Furthermore, Roman general Titus and his Roman soldiers leveled the Second Temple in AD&nbsp;70, more than five centuries before this alleged night journey to Jerusalem took place. However, after the initially successful [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius]], the Jewish population resettled in Jerusalem for a short period of time from 614\u2013630 and immediately started to restore the temple on the Temple Mount and build synagogues in Jerusalem.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem Today: What Future for the Peace Process?|last=Ghada|first=Karmi|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=115\u2013116}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the Byzantine Jews: A Microcosmos in the Thousand Year Empire|last=Kohen|first=Elli|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36|chapter=5}}</ref> Furthermore, after the Jewish population was expelled a second time from Jerusalem and shortly before Heraclius retook Jerusalem (630), a small Synagogue was already in place on the Temple Mount.

The Victorian branch comprises two major wings: the parliamentary wing and the organisational wing. The parliamentary wing comprising all elected party members in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] and [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], which when they meet collectively constitute the [[Caucus#In Commonwealth nations|party caucus]]. The parliamentary leader is elected from and by the caucus, and party factions have a strong influence in the election of the leader. The leader's position is dependent on the continuing support of the caucus (and party factions) and the leader may be deposed by failing to win a vote of confidence of parliamentary members. By convention, the premier sits in the Legislative Assembly, and is the leader of the party controlling a majority in that house. The party leader also typically is a member of the Assembly, though this is not a strict party constitutional requirement.\n\nWhen the Labor party wins sufficient seats to be able to control a majority in the Legislative Assembly, the party leader becomes the [[Premier of Victoria|State Premier]] and Labor will form the [[Government of Victoria|government]]. When the party is not in government, the party leader becomes the [[Leader of the Opposition (Victoria)|Leader of the Opposition]]. To become a Premier or Opposition Leader, the party leader must be or within a short period of time become a member of the Legislative Assembly.\n\n[[Daniel Andrews]] has been the leader of the party since 3 December 2010 and [[James Merlino]] has been deputy party leader since February 2012. At the [[2014 Victorian state election|2014 state election]] the ALP in Victoria obtained a majority with 47 of the 88 seats in the Legislative Assembly and formed the [[Government of Victoria]]. They then increased their share of seats in the Assembly to 55 after the [[2018 Victorian state election|2018 election]]. Andrews has been the [[Premier of Victoria]] and Merlino [[Deputy Premier of Victoria|Deputy Premier]] since 4 December 2014. The party currently has 18 of the 40 seats in the Legislative Council. The [[Andrews Ministry]] comprises 22 ministers.\n\n==Relationship with national party==\nWhile the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive of the ALP]] is responsible for national campaign strategy, each state and territory is an autonomous branch and is responsible for campaigning in its own jurisdiction for federal, state and local elections. Although many National ALP ideologies were influenced by Victorian Branch.\n\n==Membership==\nLike all ALP State and territory branches, the membership of the Victorian branch consists of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, and elect its governing bodies. Subject to national executive oversight powers, local branches choose candidates for public office, in a process called [[preselection]].<ref>[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-18/victorian-labor-party-factional-war-escalates-over-fundraising/10006624 Bill Shorten asks ALP's national executive to decide Victorian preselections as tensions rise]</ref><ref>[https://legalanswers.sl.nsw.gov.au/hot-topics-84-voting-and-elections/how-parties-choose-candidates How parties choose candidates]</ref><ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/labor-faces-three-contested-preselections-as-pressure-ramps-up-20180815-p4zxn5.html Labor faces three contested preselections as pressure ramps up]</ref>\n\nThe members and unions elect delegates to state conferences, which decide policy, and elect the state executive, state president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state secretary, which is a full-time professional position. There are also full-time assistant secretary and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Formative years===\nWhile struggling to balance an uneasy alliance of trade unionists and progressive social reformers during the 1890s, the political labor movement in Victoria underwent several changes of name. It was called the Progressive Political League between 1891 and 1894, the United Labor and Liberal Party of Victoria from June 1894, the United Labor Party from 1896 and the Political Labor Council of Victoria from 1901; before becoming the Victorian Branch of the [[Australian Labor Party]].<ref>[http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00124b.htm Australian Labor Party]</ref>\n\nLabor members were first elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] in 1894, but the actual numbers are uncertain. They stood as part of the United Labor and Liberal Party, formed in 1894 to replace the Progressive Political League, which won 18 of the 95 seats.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=879 | title=Australian Politics and Elections Database: 14 October 1894 | publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] | accessdate= 9 November 2018}}</ref> At the [[1897 Victorian state election|1897 election]] Labor candidates stood as the United Labor Party and won 8 of the 95 seats, all of which had to be contested.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=880 | title=Australian Politics and Elections Database: 14 October 1897 | publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] | accessdate= 14 January 2016}}</ref> Its representation went to 9 of the 95 seats at the [[1900 Victorian state election|1900 election]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=881 | title=Australian Politics and Elections Database: 1 November 1900 | publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] | accessdate= 14 January 2016}}</ref> Labor candidates contested the [[1902 Victorian state election|1902 election]] as the Political Labor Council of Victoria and won 12 of the 95 seats.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=882 | title=Australian Politics and Elections Database: 1 October 1902 | publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] | accessdate= 14 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===George Prendergast and George Elmslie===\n[[George Prendergast]] became the first leader of the parliamentary Labor party in only 1904. At the [[1904 Victorian state election|1904 election]] Labor won 17 of the 67 seats, becoming the second largest party in the Assembly, and became the Opposition. At the [[1907 Victorian state election|1907 election]] it slipped to 14 of 65 seats; and increased to 21 of 65 seats at the [[1908 Victorian state election|1908 election]]. At the [[1911 Victorian state election|1911 election]] Labor won 20 of the 65 seats, to 43 for the various factions of the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party|Liberal Party]]. Prendergast resigned the leadership because of ill-health in 1913, to be succeeded by [[George Elmslie (Australian politician)|George Elmslie]], who had been elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1902 and became deputy leader in 1912.\n\nIn December 1913, the Liberal Premier, [[William Watt (Australian politician)|William Watt]], resigned after a dispute with the rural faction of his own party. The acting [[Governor of Victoria|Governor]], [[John Madden (Australian politician)|John Madden]], surprised the Liberals by sending for Elmslie, who on 9 December formed Victoria's first Labor government. Elmslie's tenure as Premier lasted only 14 days, by which time the Liberal factions re-united, and Watt moved a no-confidence motion in Elmslie and resumed office on 22 December. Watt resigned in June 1914 to enter federal politics, and [[Alexander Peacock]] returned to leadership. The [[1914 Victorian state election|1914 election]] was fought after World War I was declared, and Labor increased its seats to 22, while the Liberals retained 43.\n\nThe [[Australian Labor Party split of 1916|1916 Labor split]] occurred over the issue of [[World War I conscription in Australia]] which saw pro-conscription Labor members expelled from the party and running as [[National Labor Party|National Labor]] candidates at the [[1917 Victorian state election|1917 election]]. That election also saw the emergence of the [[Victorian Farmers' Union]] (the forerunner of the [[National Party of Australia \u2013 Victoria|Country Party]]) as a party. There was also a split in the Nationalist party into rural and city factions and both factions fielded their own candidates. However, Victoria introduced compulsory [[Instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]] before this election, and most of the preferences resulting from multiple Nationalist candidates were kept within the party. At that election, of the 65 seats, the pro-Ministerial city faction of the Nationalists won 13 seats, while the rural faction won 27. Labor won 18 seats, National Labor won 3 and the VFU won 4. After the election the rural Nationalist faction took control of the party, ousting Premier [[Alexander Peacock]]. The Nationalists reunited under Bowser. Elmslie died in 1918 and Prendergast returned to the party's leadership. At the [[1920 Victorian state election|1920 election]] Labor won 20 seats to the Nationalists' 30. VFU became a force, holding the balance of power in the Legislative Assembly with 13 seats, a position it held until 1952. In 1920, it supported the conservative [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]] government. In 1921, the VFU voted with Labor against the Nationalist government when it abolished the compulsory wheat pool operating in the state, leading to a dissolution of Parliament and the [[1921 Victorian state election|1921 election]], which maintained the same balance of power.\n\nIn April 1924, the VFU, now called the Country Party, again withdrew its support from the Nationalist government when it tried to legislate a reduction in the [[Australian electoral system#Gerrymandering and malapportionment|rural over-representation]]. Peacock, back in government, called the [[1924 Victorian state election|1924 election]] in June, at which Labor won 27 seats, the Nationalists 20 and the Country Party 13. The Country Party supported the minority Labor government in exchange for a number of policy concessions. Prendergast became Premier at the age of 70 \u2013 the oldest man ever to take the office for the first time. The only real talents in his government were [[Edmond Hogan]] as Minister for Agriculture and Railways and [[Bill Slater (politician)|William Slater]] as Attorney-General. [[John Cain (senior)|John Cain]] was an Assistant Minister.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The Prendergast government was the first Labor government in Victoria able actually to govern. Immediate action was taken to provide shelter for unemployed Victorians, while the government set up royal commissions into the causes of a major police strike in 1923, the prices of bread and flour, and the soldier settlement scheme. Increased expenditure was made available for rural roads, while reductions were made on rail freights and fares. With the support of the Country Party, he was able to pass several bills assisting farmers, but the Country Party would not support anything which benefited Labor's urban working-class base. This was a frustrating situation for Labor ministers, and several urged Prendergast to call another election in the hope of improving their position, but Prendergast was too timid to run the risk. In November the Country Party patched up its differences with the Nationalists, and the two parties joined forces to defeat Prendergast in the Assembly. The Country Party leader, [[John Allan (Australian politician)|John Allan]], succeeded him as Premier.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nLabor in Victoria in the early federal period was much weaker than in the other states, and there had never been a majority Labor state government. This was partly due to the continuing attraction of [[Alfred Deakin|Deakinite]] liberalism among middle-class voters in Melbourne, partly because Victoria did not have the huge pastoral and mining areas that the other mainland states had. The Parliamentary Labor Party remained small and contained limited talent. Victoria was Labor's weakest state throughout the 1920s, due to the gross over-representation of rural areas in the Legislative Assembly, and the strength of the Country Party in rural areas and the Nationalist Party in middle-class Melbourne seats. Labor's parliamentary representation was confined to the industrial areas of Melbourne and a few provincial towns. There was little talent in the Parliamentary Labor Party and few regarded Prendergast as likely ever to win a state election.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Most notably, however, the lack of a Labor majority government was due to the high degree of rural over-representation existing in the state's electoral system, which strongly favoured rural electorates to the disadvantage of inner-city electorates, where Labor's vote was concentrated.\n\n===Edmond Hogan===\nHogan had been elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1913. His was not a natural Labor seat, but it was heavily Irish-Catholic, which helped Hogan, an active Catholic, retain it. In 1914 he was elected to the Labor Party's state executive and in 1922 he became State President. Prendergast resigned as Labor leader in 1926 and was succeeded by Hogan.\n\nHogan was a fine speaker and soon became a leading figure in a parliamentary party which was thin on talent. Victoria was Labor's weakest state and in the 1920s there seemed little chance it would ever win a state election. When Prendergast stepped down in 1926, Hogan was the obvious choice to succeed him. His main drawback was his close association with the Melbourne horse-racing, boxing and gambling identity [[John Wren]], who was widely suspected of corruption. The Wren connection alienated many middle-class voters from Labor through the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nNevertheless, at the [[1927 Victorian state election|1927 election]] Hogan was able to capitalise on resentment against rural over-representation in the state Parliament and consequent domination by the Country Party. Labor won 28 seats to the Nationalists 15 and the Country Party's ten. Hogan was able to form a minority government with the support of the four [[Country Progressive Party (Victoria)|Country Progressive Party]] and two Liberal members. But this alliance broke down in 1928 in the face a prolonged and violent industrial dispute on the Melbourne waterfront, and in November he was defeated in a confidence vote and resigned, being succeeded by the Nationalist [[William Murray McPherson|William McPherson]] with the support of the Country Party.\n\nIn 1929 the Country Party withdrew its support from the McPherson government, resulting in the [[1929 Victorian state election|1929 election]], fought just as the [[Great Depression]] was breaking over Australia. Hogan led Labor to its best result yet, winning 30 seats to the Nationalists' 17 and the Country Party's 11. A collection of Country Progressives, Liberals and independents held the balance, and they agreed to support a second Hogan government. [[Tom Tunnecliffe]] was Chief Secretary, [[John Cain (senior)|John Cain]] was Minister for Railways and [[Bill Slater (politician)|William Slater]] was Attorney-General.\n\nThe [[Great Depression in Australia]] had a devastating effect on Victoria's economy and society, since the state was heavily dependent on agricultural exports, mainly wheat and wool, for its income, and these industries collapsed almost completely as demand in Britain dried up. By 1931 most Victorian farmers were bankrupt and about 25 percent of the workforce was unemployed. Hogan's government, in common with all other governments, had no solution to this disaster. Even if the Labor government was minded to attempt radical solutions, it was dependent on Country Progressive support in the Assembly, and had only six members in the [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]].\n\nHogan adopted the orthodox economic view that governments must balance their budgets, and since the Council would not permit any increases in taxation, the only way to do this in the face of falling government revenue was to cut expenditure. This increased the burdens on the poor and unemployed, while providing no stimulus to the economy. There was little possibility of effective unemployment relief, although there were some government works to soak up unemployment, such as the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] and the [[Great Ocean Road]].\n\nIn August 1930 Hogan attended a conference with the other Premiers and the Labor Prime Minister, [[James Scullin]], to consider what to do. On the advice of Sir [[Otto Niemeyer]], a senior official of the [[Bank of England]] (which controlled most of Victoria's access to credit in the [[City of London]]), they agreed to radical cuts to government spending and borrowing. This provoked a storm of protest in the Labor Party and trade unions, who regarded Scullin and Hogan as traitors.\n\nA second conference in June 1931 produced the [[Premiers' Plan]], which entailed further cuts in government spending, accompanied by increases in taxation on the wealthy. In the circumstances both of these measures further depressed the economy, while not satisfying either side of politics. The [[Australian Labor Party split of 1931|1931 Labor split]] occurred, with a breakaway [[Australian Labor Party (NSW)|NSW Labor Party]] led by [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] rebelled and brought down the Scullin government in November, but Hogan survived with Country Party continued support from the cross benches. In any case the Nationalists, now renamed the [[United Australia Party]] (UAP) preferred to see Hogan implement the Premiers' Plan.\n\nIn February 1932 Hogan traveled to London to talk to the banks about Victoria's desperate economic plight. While he was away [[Tom Tunnecliffe]] was acting Premier, and he was much more willing than Hogan to reject the Premiers' Plan. As a result, the Country Party withdrew its support, and in April the government was defeated in a confidence vote. Tunnecliffe replaced Hogan as Labor leader and led the Labor campaign in [[1932 Victorian state election|May 1932 election]], now rejecting the Premiers' Plan completely. The Labor Party Executive expelled everyone who had supported the Premiers' Plan, including Hogan, although it did not run a candidate against him. At the elections the UAP won 31 seats to Labor's 16 and the reunited Country Party's 14. Hogan and one of his ex-ministers were elected as \"Premiers' Plan Labor\" candidates. UAP leader [[Stanley Argyle]] became Premier.\n\nAfter sitting as an independent for four years, Hogan joined the Country Party in 1935, and formed a close relationship with the Country Party leader [[Albert Dunstan]]. The result was a renewed alliance between the Country Party and Labor, brokered by Hogan, John Wren and the Victorian Labor State President, [[Arthur Calwell]]. In April 1935 Dunstan walked out of Argyle's government, and became Premier with Labor support. Hogan became Minister for Agriculture and Mines, and held these posts through Dunstan's record term as Premier until September 1943.\n\n===John Cain I===\n[[John Cain (senior)|John Cain I]] was assistant minister for agriculture in the short-lived minority Prendergast Labor government in 1924, a minister without portfolio in the first minority Hogan Labor government (1927\u201328), and minister for railways and for electrical undertakings in the second Hogan government (1929\u201332). When Hogan's government collapsed during the [[Great Depression]] and Hogan himself was expelled from the Labor Party, Cain became party deputy leader under Tunnecliffe. Cain succeeded Tunnecliffe as Labor leader in 1937. Under both Tunnecliffe and Cain, Labor supported the Dunstan minority Country Party government from 1935 to 1943. At the [[1943 Victorian state election|1943 election]], Labor, now led by John Cain, benefiting from the popularity of [[John Curtin]]'s wartime federal government, won 22 of the 65 seats.\n\nDunstan resigned on 14 September 1943 and John Cain formed government, which lasted only 4 days.<ref name=ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_JohnCain>\n{{cite book\n| url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130378b.htm\n| title= Cain, John (1882\u20131957)\n| accessdate = 5 January 2009\n| publisher=  Australian Dictionary of Biography Online, Australian National University\n}}</ref> The conservative parties resolved their differences and Dunstan resumed office and retained it with Labor support until November 1945, when Dunstan resigned again. Cain again became premier on 21 November 1945. Labor's lower house parliamentary position was much better than it had been in 1943, since the [[1945 Victorian state election|1945 election]] had given Labor 31 seats to the Country Party's 18 and the Liberals' 13, with three independents. With a [[Minority government|majority in neither House]], Cain's government was unable to pass much legislation. On 2 October 1947 the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] [[Loss of supply|blocked his government's budget]] to show its opposition to the federal Labor government of [[Ben Chifley]], which had announced plans to [[nationalization|nationalise]] the private banks. Although this issue had nothing to do with state politics, Cain was forced to resign and call the [[1947 Victorian state election|1947 election]] for 8 November, at which Labor was heavily defeated.<ref name=ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_JohnCain/> The [[1950 Victorian state election|1950 election]] gave Labor 24 seats to the Liberals' 27 and the Country Party's 13. Since the Liberals and Country Party hated each other, no stable majority government was possible, and this, together with the unpopularity of the new federal Liberal government, gave Cain his opportunity. In October 1952 the Country Party premier, [[John McDonald (Victorian politician)|John McDonald]], resigned and called the [[1952 Victorian state election|1952 election]]. Labor won 37 seats, the first time it had won a majority in the lower house, and Cain formed his third government.\n\nCain's government was hampered by the hostility of the Legislative Council (which until 1950 had been elected on a restricted property-based franchise and so always had a conservative majority), and also by tensions within his own party. During the war the Communist Party had grown greatly in strength in the trade unions which controlled and funded the Labor Party, leading a faction of anti-Communist Catholics to form within the party to fight Communist influence. (This body, known as The Movement, was organised by [[B. A. Santamaria]] and supported by the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, [[Daniel Mannix]]). Conflict between left and right in the Labor Party grew increasingly bitter in the [[Cold War]] atmosphere of the 1950s.\n\nNevertheless, the Cain government was able to pass more legislation than any previous Labor government in Victoria had done. Major reforms were carried out in the areas of workers' compensation, tenancy law, long service leave, hospitals, public transport, housing, charities and the Crimes Act. Changes included the provision on long-service leave to railway workers, increased eligibility to workers' compensation, alterations to the Shops and Factories Act and the Landlord and Tenant Act, and the introduction of legislation \"to penalize rogues who resorted to fraudulent misrepresentation in soliciting corporate investment from the public.\"\n\nThe government had also reformed wage determination procedures and public service administration, while constructive initiatives were carried out in adult education and soil conservation.<ref>[[Ross McMullin]], The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891\u20131991</ref> Even some reforms to the electoral system were carried through the Council, where Labor and Liberal members united to reduce the [[Gerrymander|malapportionment]] which had given the Country Party disproportionate representation since the 1920s. In its first two years the Cain government won the approval of the Melbourne daily papers ''[[The Age]]'', ''[[The Herald (Melbourne)|The Herald]]'' and ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]''. Nevertheless, Cain's third Government fell on 19 April 1955 when 19 expelled Labor lower house members aligned to \"The Movement\" \"[[Cross the floor#Voting against party lines|crossed the floor]]\" against the government in a no-confidence vote.<ref name=ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_JohnCain/>\n\nThe [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955|1955 Labor split]] began in October 1954 after the federal leader, [[H.V. Evatt|Dr H. V. Evatt]], blamed Santamaria and his supporters in the Victorian Labor Party for Labor's loss of seats at the [[1954 Australian federal election|1954 federal election]]. Santamaria exercised strong influence in the Cain government through \"Movement\" linked ministers such as [[Bill Barry (politician)|Bill Barry]] and [[Frank Scully (politician)|Frank Scully]]. Protestant and left-wing ministers strongly opposed the Movement faction. In December 1953 the Lands Minister, [[Robert Holt]], resigned rather than introduce a Santamaria-influenced bill which would have promoted the settlement of Italian immigrants as small farmers in [[Gippsland]].\n\nIn early 1955 the Labor Party's federal executive dissolved the state executive and began to expel Santamaria's supporters from the party. The Victorian branch then split between pro-Evatt and pro-Santamaria factions, and in March the pro-Evatt State Executive suspended 24 members of State Parliament suspected of being Santamaria supporters. Four ministers were forced to resign from the government. When the Parliament met on 19 April 19 expelled Labor members crossed over to vote with the Liberal and Country Party members to defeat the government. At the ensuing [[1955 Victorian state election|May 1955 election]], the expelled members and others stood as the [[Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist)]], later the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]]. Their strategy was to draw votes from the Labor Party and direct preferences to the Liberal Party. Labor was heavily defeated, winning only 20 seats, from the 37 at the [[1952 Victorian state election|1952 election]], to the Liberals' 34 and the Country Party's ten. Only one of the expelled Labor members was re-elected.\n\nCain suffered a stroke on 9 August 1957 and died, aged 75. [[Ernie Shepherd (politician)|Alfred Ernest \"Ernie\" Shepherd]] (1901\u201358) succeeded Cain as party leader, only to die himself little more than a year afterwards. From 1958 to 1967 [[Clive Stoneham]] was Labor and Opposition Leader. He lost the [[1961 Victorian state election|1961]], [[1964 Victorian state election|1964]] and [[1967 Victorian state election|1967]] elections to the incumbent Liberal Premier, [[Henry Bolte]], with the electoral assistance of the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]], which directed its preferences to the Liberals.\n\n===Clyde Holding===\n[[Clyde Holding]] became party leader in 1967. During the 1970 state election campaign, which some commentators suggested Labor could win as a result of [[voter fatigue]] with the Liberals after their 15 years in power, Holding campaigned on the new federal policy of supporting state aid to non-government schools. However, in the week before the election, the left-wing state president, [[George Crawford (Australian politician)|George Crawford]] and state secretary, [[Bill Hartley (activist)|Bill Hartley]], issued a statement saying that a Victorian Labor government would not support state aid. As a result, federal leader [[Gough Whitlam]] refused to campaign for Labor in Victoria, and Holding was forced to repudiate his own policy. At the election, the Bolte government.was returned.\n\nThis episode led directly to federal intervention in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. In 1971 the left-wing leadership was overturned by the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] and allies of Whitlam, Hawke and Holding took control. The left then formed an organised faction, the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]], to agitate for socialist policies, supported by some unions. This continuing conflict in the party made it difficult for Holding to oppose the Liberal government effectively.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The surge in support for federal Labor which saw Whitlam elected Prime Minister in 1972 was not reflected in Victorian state politics. Bolte retired in 1972, and his successor, [[Dick Hamer]], comfortably won the 1973 and 1976 state elections. [[Frank Wilkes]] became party leader in 1977. At the 1979 state election, Labor under Wilkes gained eleven seats, the party's best showing for many years,<ref>Michael O'Grady (1979), 'The party leaders: Hamer and Wilkes,' in Peter Hay, Ian Ward, John Warhurst (eds.), ''Anatomy of an Election'', Hill of Content, Melbourne, Victoria, pages 91\u2013104.</ref> though not sufficient to form government.\n\n===John Cain II===\n[[John Cain (junior)|John Cain II]], son of the former Labor premier, became party leader in September 1981, and won the [[1982 Victorian state election|1982 election]], winning 49 of the 81 seats in the Legislative Assembly, forming a Labor government for the first time since 1955. In 1984 the Labor government legalised [[Prostitution in Australia#Victoria|prostitution in Victoria]].\n\nAt the [[1985 Victorian state election|1985 election]] Labor won 47 of the 88 seats; and 46 seats at the [[1988 Victorian state election|1988 election]]. Cain's political support collapsed in August 1990. By this time the Labor government was in deep crisis, with some of the state's financial institutions on the brink of insolvency, the budget deficit unsustainably high and growing and the Labor Party deeply divided on how to respond to the situation.\n\n===Joan Kirner===\nCain resigned and Joan Kirner was elected Labor leader, becoming the party's first female leader and Victoria's first female [[Premier of Victoria|premier]]. The party hoped that the elevation of a popular woman as its new leader would improve its position, but Kirner never succeeded in gaining control of the crisis into which the state had plunged. The conservative-leaning Melbourne newspaper, the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', reacted unfavourably to a premier from the Socialist Left, dubbing her \"Mother Russia\". She was lampooned alternatively as a sinister [[commissar]] and as a frumpy housewife in a polka dot dress. She seemed unfazed by the ''Herald Sun'' and gradually won some respect, though she was unable to improve significantly the government's standing.\n\nDuring 1991 and 1992 Kirner took several decisions to cut government spending and raise revenue to some extent. However, her government failed to cut spending in many areas including education. Most of the Kirner government's attempts to cut spending were actively opposed by trade unions and some members of the government. The interest bill alone was $3.5&nbsp;billion per year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houserefinancing.com.au/news/1992/9/16/labor-and-coalition-at-odds-over-reduction-in-state-debt/ |title=Labor And Coalition at Odds Over Reduction in State Debt |work=houserefinancing.com.au |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023123319/http://www.houserefinancing.com.au/news/1992/9/16/labor-and-coalition-at-odds-over-reduction-in-state-debt/ |archivedate=23 October 2015 }}</ref> the government sold off trains and trams and leased them back.

Kirner went into 1992 knowing she faced a statutory general election, one which opinion polls gave her virtually no chance of winning. She waited as long as she could, finally calling [[1992 Victorian state election|an election for October]]. It was obvious as soon as the writs were dropped that Labor would not win a fourth term. Although she remained personally more popular than Kennett, it was not nearly enough to overcome the electorate's anger at her party. The Coalition's \"Guilty Party\" campaign did much to stoke this anger, targeting many ministers in the Kirner Government and providing examples of concerns in their portfolios. The Coalition won the election in a landslide, scoring a 19-seat swing \u2013 the second-worst defeat that a sitting government has ever suffered in Victoria. The Liberals won enough seats that they could have governed in their own right. Kirner remained Opposition Leader until March 1993 and resigned from Parliament in May 1994.\n\n[[Jim Kennan]] was a member of parliament between 1982 and 1993, initially in the Victorian Legislative Council, and then in the Legislative Assembly and was Deputy Premier of Victoria from 1990 to 1992. He became the Leader of the Opposition after Kirner resigned in March 1993, until his shock retirement from Parliament three months later.\n\n===Brumby and Bracks period===\nKennan was succeeded as leader by [[John Brumby]], who was a member of the Legislative Council at the time. Brumby transferred to the Legislative Assembly in a by-election for Kennan's seat. The defeat of the federal Labor government in March 1996 prompted Kennett to call an [[1996 Victorian state election|early state election three weeks later]]. Labor led by Brumby only managed a net two-seat gain, leaving it 20 seats behind the Coalition. Brumby was replaced as Labor leader in March 1999 by [[Steve Bracks]]. To everyone's surprise, Bracks won the [[1999 Victorian state election|September 1999 election]],<ref name=Woodward>{{cite journal|author1=Woodward, Dennis |author2=Costar, Brian |title=The Victorian Election of 18 September 1999: Another Case of Electoral Volatility?|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|volume=35|issue=1|pages=125\u2013133|date=9 June 2010|doi=10.1080/10361140050002881}}</ref> which produced a [[hung parliament]] and the independents agreed to support the minority Labor government. Labor won the [[2002 Victorian state election|2002 state election]] in a landslide, taking 62 seats out of 88 in the Legislative Assembly, also winning a slim majority in the Legislative Council. In 2002, Labor reformed the Legislative Council and brought in four-year fixed-term parliaments.<ref>''Electoral Act 2002'' (Vic) and ''The Constitution (Parliamentary Reform) Act 2003''</ref> Labor made inroads towards [[LGBT history in Australia|same-sex equality in Victoria]]. Since 2001, Victorian Labor governments have amended 60 Acts to advance same-sex equality.\n\nLabor won a third term at the [[2006 Victorian state election|2006 state election]]. Bracks resigned as party leader and Premier on 27 July 2007, and Labor deputy leader, [[John Thwaites (Australian politician)|John Thwaites]] also announced his resignation on the same day. John Brumby was elected unopposed Labor leader on 30 July 2007 and became Premier. One notable achievement of the Brumby government was [[Abortion Law Reform Act 2008 (Victoria)|abortion law reform in 2008]]. It also signed contracts for the [[Wonthaggi desalination plant]] in 2009, to drought-proof the State.\n\nAt the [[2010 Victorian state election|2010 state election]] Labor was narrowly defeated, winning only 43 of the 88 Legislative Assembly seats.\n\n===Daniel Andrews===\nBrumby resigned as party leader soon after Labor loss at the 2010 state election, to be replaced by [[Daniel Andrews]] on 3 December 2010.\n\nAfter being in Opposition for one term, Labor won the [[2014 Victorian state election|2014 state election]] from the [[Napthine Ministry|Napthine Government]], winning 47 seats in the Legislative Assembly. On winning office, the Andrews government cancelled the [[East West Link (Melbourne)|East West Link project]] and initiated the [[Level Crossing Removal Authority|level crossing removal project]] and the [[Melbourne Metro Rail Project]].

The Victorian branch comprises two major wings: the parliamentary wing and the organisational wing. The parliamentary wing comprising all elected party members in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] and [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], which when they meet collectively constitute the [[Caucus#In Commonwealth nations|party caucus]]. The parliamentary leader is elected from and by the caucus, and party factions have a strong influence in the election of the leader. The leader's position is dependent on the continuing support of the caucus (and party factions) and the leader may be deposed by failing to win a vote of confidence of parliamentary members. By convention, the premier sits in the Legislative Assembly, and is the leader of the party controlling a majority in that house. The party leader also typically is a member of the Assembly, though this is not a strict party constitutional requirement.\n\nWhen the Labor party wins sufficient seats to be able to control a majority in the Legislative Assembly, the party leader becomes the [[Premier of Victoria|State Premier]] and Labor will form the [[Government of Victoria|government]]. When the party is not in government, the party leader becomes the [[Leader of the Opposition (Victoria)|Leader of the Opposition]]. To become a Premier or Opposition Leader, the party leader must be or within a short period of time become a member of the Legislative Assembly.\n\n[[Daniel Andrews]] has been the leader of the party since 3 December 2010 and [[James Merlino]] has been deputy party leader since February 2012. At the [[2014 Victorian state election|2014 state election]] the ALP in Victoria obtained a majority with 47 of the 88 seats in the Legislative Assembly and formed the [[Government of Victoria]]. They then increased their share of seats in the Assembly to 55 after the [[2018 Victorian state election|2018 election]]. Andrews has been the [[Premier of Victoria]] and Merlino [[Deputy Premier of Victoria|Deputy Premier]] since 4 December 2014. The party currently has 18 of the 40 seats in the Legislative Council. The [[Andrews Ministry]] comprises 22 ministers.\n\n==Relationship with national party==\nWhile the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive of the ALP]] is responsible for national campaign strategy, each state and territory is an autonomous branch and is responsible for campaigning in its own jurisdiction for federal, state and local elections. Although many National ALP ideologies were influenced by Victorian Branch.\n\n==Membership==\nLike all ALP State and territory branches, the membership of the Victorian branch consists of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, and elect its governing bodies. Subject to national executive oversight powers, local branches choose candidates for public office, in a process called [[preselection]].<ref>[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-18/victorian-labor-party-factional-war-escalates-over-fundraising/10006624 Bill Shorten asks ALP's national executive to decide Victorian preselections as tensions rise]</ref><ref>[https://legalanswers.sl.nsw.gov.au/hot-topics-84-voting-and-elections/how-parties-choose-candidates How parties choose candidates]</ref><ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/labor-faces-three-contested-preselections-as-pressure-ramps-up-20180815-p4zxn5.html Labor faces three contested preselections as pressure ramps up]</ref>\n\nThe members and unions elect delegates to state conferences, which decide policy, and elect the state executive, state president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state secretary, which is a full-time professional position. There are also full-time assistant secretary and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Formative years===\nWhile struggling to balance an uneasy alliance of trade unionists and progressive social reformers during the 1890s, the political labor movement in Victoria underwent several changes of name. It was called the Progressive Political League between 1891 and 1894, the United Labor and Liberal Party of Victoria from June 1894, the United Labor Party from 1896 and the Political Labor Council of Victoria from 1901; before becoming the Victorian Branch of the [[Australian Labor Party]].<ref>[http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00124b.htm Australian Labor Party]</ref>\n\nLabor members were first elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly]] in 1894, but the actual numbers are uncertain. They stood as part of the United Labor and Liberal Party, formed in 1894 to replace the Progressive Political League, which won 18 of the 95 seats.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=879 | title=Australian Politics and Elections Database: 14 October 1894 | publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] | accessdate= 9 November 2018}}</ref> At the [[1897 Victorian state election|1897 election]] Labor candidates stood as the United Labor Party and won 8 of the 95 seats, all of which had to be contested.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=880 | title=Australian Politics and Elections Database: 14 October 1897 | publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] | accessdate= 14 January 2016}}</ref> Its representation went to 9 of the 95 seats at the [[1900 Victorian state election|1900 election]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=881 | title=Australian Politics and Elections Database: 1 November 1900 | publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] | accessdate= 14 January 2016}}</ref> Labor candidates contested the [[1902 Victorian state election|1902 election]] as the Political Labor Council of Victoria and won 12 of the 95 seats.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=882 | title=Australian Politics and Elections Database: 1 October 1902 | publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] | accessdate= 14 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===George Prendergast and George Elmslie===\n[[George Prendergast]] became the first leader of the parliamentary Labor party in only 1904. At the [[1904 Victorian state election|1904 election]] Labor won 17 of the 67 seats, becoming the second largest party in the Assembly, and became the Opposition. At the [[1907 Victorian state election|1907 election]] it slipped to 14 of 65 seats; and increased to 21 of 65 seats at the [[1908 Victorian state election|1908 election]]. At the [[1911 Victorian state election|1911 election]] Labor won 20 of the 65 seats, to 43 for the various factions of the [[Commonwealth Liberal Party|Liberal Party]]. Prendergast resigned the leadership because of ill-health in 1913, to be succeeded by [[George Elmslie (Australian politician)|George Elmslie]], who had been elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1902 and became deputy leader in 1912.\n\nIn December 1913, the Liberal Premier, [[William Watt (Australian politician)|William Watt]], resigned after a dispute with the rural faction of his own party. The acting [[Governor of Victoria|Governor]], [[John Madden (Australian politician)|John Madden]], surprised the Liberals by sending for Elmslie, who on 9 December formed Victoria's first Labor government. Elmslie's tenure as Premier lasted only 14 days, by which time the Liberal factions re-united, and Watt moved a no-confidence motion in Elmslie and resumed office on 22 December. Watt resigned in June 1914 to enter federal politics, and [[Alexander Peacock]] returned to leadership. The [[1914 Victorian state election|1914 election]] was fought after World War I was declared, and Labor increased its seats to 22, while the Liberals retained 43.\n\nThe [[Australian Labor Party split of 1916|1916 Labor split]] occurred over the issue of [[World War I conscription in Australia]] which saw pro-conscription Labor members expelled from the party and running as [[National Labor Party|National Labor]] candidates at the [[1917 Victorian state election|1917 election]]. That election also saw the emergence of the [[Victorian Farmers' Union]] (the forerunner of the [[National Party of Australia \u2013 Victoria|Country Party]]) as a party. There was also a split in the Nationalist party into rural and city factions and both factions fielded their own candidates. However, Victoria introduced compulsory [[Instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]] before this election, and most of the preferences resulting from multiple Nationalist candidates were kept within the party. At that election, of the 65 seats, the pro-Ministerial city faction of the Nationalists won 13 seats, while the rural faction won 27. Labor won 18 seats, National Labor won 3 and the VFU won 4. After the election the rural Nationalist faction took control of the party, ousting Premier [[Alexander Peacock]]. The Nationalists reunited under Bowser. Elmslie died in 1918 and Prendergast returned to the party's leadership. At the [[1920 Victorian state election|1920 election]] Labor won 20 seats to the Nationalists' 30. VFU became a force, holding the balance of power in the Legislative Assembly with 13 seats, a position it held until 1952. In 1920, it supported the conservative [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]] government. In 1921, the VFU voted with Labor against the Nationalist government when it abolished the compulsory wheat pool operating in the state, leading to a dissolution of Parliament and the [[1921 Victorian state election|1921 election]], which maintained the same balance of power.\n\nIn April 1924, the VFU, now called the Country Party, again withdrew its support from the Nationalist government when it tried to legislate a reduction in the [[Australian electoral system#Gerrymandering and malapportionment|rural over-representation]]. Peacock, back in government, called the [[1924 Victorian state election|1924 election]] in June, at which Labor won 27 seats, the Nationalists 20 and the Country Party 13. The Country Party supported the minority Labor government in exchange for a number of policy concessions. Prendergast became Premier at the age of 70 \u2013 the oldest man ever to take the office for the first time. The only real talents in his government were [[Edmond Hogan]] as Minister for Agriculture and Railways and [[Bill Slater (politician)|William Slater]] as Attorney-General. [[John Cain (senior)|John Cain]] was an Assistant Minister.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The Prendergast government was the first Labor government in Victoria able actually to govern. Immediate action was taken to provide shelter for unemployed Victorians, while the government set up royal commissions into the causes of a major police strike in 1923, the prices of bread and flour, and the soldier settlement scheme. Increased expenditure was made available for rural roads, while reductions were made on rail freights and fares. With the support of the Country Party, he was able to pass several bills assisting farmers, but the Country Party would not support anything which benefited Labor's urban working-class base. This was a frustrating situation for Labor ministers, and several urged Prendergast to call another election in the hope of improving their position, but Prendergast was too timid to run the risk. In November the Country Party patched up its differences with the Nationalists, and the two parties joined forces to defeat Prendergast in the Assembly. The Country Party leader, [[John Allan (Australian politician)|John Allan]], succeeded him as Premier.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nLabor in Victoria in the early federal period was much weaker than in the other states, and there had never been a majority Labor state government. This was partly due to the continuing attraction of [[Alfred Deakin|Deakinite]] liberalism among middle-class voters in Melbourne, partly because Victoria did not have the huge pastoral and mining areas that the other mainland states had. The Parliamentary Labor Party remained small and contained limited talent. Victoria was Labor's weakest state throughout the 1920s, due to the gross over-representation of rural areas in the Legislative Assembly, and the strength of the Country Party in rural areas and the Nationalist Party in middle-class Melbourne seats. Labor's parliamentary representation was confined to the industrial areas of Melbourne and a few provincial towns. There was little talent in the Parliamentary Labor Party and few regarded Prendergast as likely ever to win a state election.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Most notably, however, the lack of a Labor majority government was due to the high degree of rural over-representation existing in the state's electoral system, which strongly favoured rural electorates to the disadvantage of inner-city electorates, where Labor's vote was concentrated.\n\n===Edmond Hogan===\nHogan had been elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1913. His was not a natural Labor seat, but it was heavily Irish-Catholic, which helped Hogan, an active Catholic, retain it. In 1914 he was elected to the Labor Party's state executive and in 1922 he became State President. Prendergast resigned as Labor leader in 1926 and was succeeded by Hogan.\n\nHogan was a fine speaker and soon became a leading figure in a parliamentary party which was thin on talent. Victoria was Labor's weakest state and in the 1920s there seemed little chance it would ever win a state election. When Prendergast stepped down in 1926, Hogan was the obvious choice to succeed him. His main drawback was his close association with the Melbourne horse-racing, boxing and gambling identity [[John Wren]], who was widely suspected of corruption. The Wren connection alienated many middle-class voters from Labor through the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nNevertheless, at the [[1927 Victorian state election|1927 election]] Hogan was able to capitalise on resentment against rural over-representation in the state Parliament and consequent domination by the Country Party. Labor won 28 seats to the Nationalists 15 and the Country Party's ten. Hogan was able to form a minority government with the support of the four [[Country Progressive Party (Victoria)|Country Progressive Party]] and two Liberal members. But this alliance broke down in 1928 in the face a prolonged and violent industrial dispute on the Melbourne waterfront, and in November he was defeated in a confidence vote and resigned, being succeeded by the Nationalist [[William Murray McPherson|William McPherson]] with the support of the Country Party.\n\nIn 1929 the Country Party withdrew its support from the McPherson government, resulting in the [[1929 Victorian state election|1929 election]], fought just as the [[Great Depression]] was breaking over Australia. Hogan led Labor to its best result yet, winning 30 seats to the Nationalists' 17 and the Country Party's 11. A collection of Country Progressives, Liberals and independents held the balance, and they agreed to support a second Hogan government. [[Tom Tunnecliffe]] was Chief Secretary, [[John Cain (senior)|John Cain]] was Minister for Railways and [[Bill Slater (politician)|William Slater]] was Attorney-General.\n\nThe [[Great Depression in Australia]] had a devastating effect on Victoria's economy and society, since the state was heavily dependent on agricultural exports, mainly wheat and wool, for its income, and these industries collapsed almost completely as demand in Britain dried up. By 1931 most Victorian farmers were bankrupt and about 25 percent of the workforce was unemployed. Hogan's government, in common with all other governments, had no solution to this disaster. Even if the Labor government was minded to attempt radical solutions, it was dependent on Country Progressive support in the Assembly, and had only six members in the [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]].\n\nHogan adopted the orthodox economic view that governments must balance their budgets, and since the Council would not permit any increases in taxation, the only way to do this in the face of falling government revenue was to cut expenditure. This increased the burdens on the poor and unemployed, while providing no stimulus to the economy. There was little possibility of effective unemployment relief, although there were some government works to soak up unemployment, such as the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] and the [[Great Ocean Road]].\n\nIn August 1930 Hogan attended a conference with the other Premiers and the Labor Prime Minister, [[James Scullin]], to consider what to do. On the advice of Sir [[Otto Niemeyer]], a senior official of the [[Bank of England]] (which controlled most of Victoria's access to credit in the [[City of London]]), they agreed to radical cuts to government spending and borrowing. This provoked a storm of protest in the Labor Party and trade unions, who regarded Scullin and Hogan as traitors.\n\nA second conference in June 1931 produced the [[Premiers' Plan]], which entailed further cuts in government spending, accompanied by increases in taxation on the wealthy. In the circumstances both of these measures further depressed the economy, while not satisfying either side of politics. The [[Australian Labor Party split of 1931|1931 Labor split]] occurred, with a breakaway [[Australian Labor Party (NSW)|NSW Labor Party]] led by [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] rebelled and brought down the Scullin government in November, but Hogan survived with Country Party continued support from the cross benches. In any case the Nationalists, now renamed the [[United Australia Party]] (UAP) preferred to see Hogan implement the Premiers' Plan.\n\nIn February 1932 Hogan traveled to London to talk to the banks about Victoria's desperate economic plight. While he was away [[Tom Tunnecliffe]] was acting Premier, and he was much more willing than Hogan to reject the Premiers' Plan. As a result, the Country Party withdrew its support, and in April the government was defeated in a confidence vote. Tunnecliffe replaced Hogan as Labor leader and led the Labor campaign in [[1932 Victorian state election|May 1932 election]], now rejecting the Premiers' Plan completely. The Labor Party Executive expelled everyone who had supported the Premiers' Plan, including Hogan, although it did not run a candidate against him. At the elections the UAP won 31 seats to Labor's 16 and the reunited Country Party's 14. Hogan and one of his ex-ministers were elected as \"Premiers' Plan Labor\" candidates. UAP leader [[Stanley Argyle]] became Premier.\n\nAfter sitting as an independent for four years, Hogan joined the Country Party in 1935, and formed a close relationship with the Country Party leader [[Albert Dunstan]]. The result was a renewed alliance between the Country Party and Labor, brokered by Hogan, John Wren and the Victorian Labor State President, [[Arthur Calwell]]. In April 1935 Dunstan walked out of Argyle's government, and became Premier with Labor support. Hogan became Minister for Agriculture and Mines, and held these posts through Dunstan's record term as Premier until September 1943.\n\n===John Cain I===\n[[John Cain (senior)|John Cain I]] was assistant minister for agriculture in the short-lived minority Prendergast Labor government in 1924, a minister without portfolio in the first minority Hogan Labor government (1927\u201328), and minister for railways and for electrical undertakings in the second Hogan government (1929\u201332). When Hogan's government collapsed during the [[Great Depression]] and Hogan himself was expelled from the Labor Party, Cain became party deputy leader under Tunnecliffe. Cain succeeded Tunnecliffe as Labor leader in 1937. Under both Tunnecliffe and Cain, Labor supported the Dunstan minority Country Party government from 1935 to 1943. At the [[1943 Victorian state election|1943 election]], Labor, now led by John Cain, benefiting from the popularity of [[John Curtin]]'s wartime federal government, won 22 of the 65 seats.\n\nDunstan resigned on 14 September 1943 and John Cain formed government, which lasted only 4 days.<ref name=ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_JohnCain>\n{{cite book\n| url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130378b.htm\n| title= Cain, John (1882\u20131957)\n| accessdate = 5 January 2009\n| publisher=  Australian Dictionary of Biography Online, Australian National University\n}}</ref> The conservative parties resolved their differences and Dunstan resumed office and retained it with Labor support until November 1945, when Dunstan resigned again. Cain again became premier on 21 November 1945. Labor's lower house parliamentary position was much better than it had been in 1943, since the [[1945 Victorian state election|1945 election]] had given Labor 31 seats to the Country Party's 18 and the Liberals' 13, with three independents. With a [[Minority government|majority in neither House]], Cain's government was unable to pass much legislation. On 2 October 1947 the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] [[Loss of supply|blocked his government's budget]] to show its opposition to the federal Labor government of [[Ben Chifley]], which had announced plans to [[nationalization|nationalise]] the private banks. Although this issue had nothing to do with state politics, Cain was forced to resign and call the [[1947 Victorian state election|1947 election]] for 8 November, at which Labor was heavily defeated.<ref name=ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_JohnCain/> The [[1950 Victorian state election|1950 election]] gave Labor 24 seats to the Liberals' 27 and the Country Party's 13. Since the Liberals and Country Party hated each other, no stable majority government was possible, and this, together with the unpopularity of the new federal Liberal government, gave Cain his opportunity. In October 1952 the Country Party premier, [[John McDonald (Victorian politician)|John McDonald]], resigned and called the [[1952 Victorian state election|1952 election]]. Labor won 37 seats, the first time it had won a majority in the lower house, and Cain formed his third government.\n\nCain's government was hampered by the hostility of the Legislative Council (which until 1950 had been elected on a restricted property-based franchise and so always had a conservative majority), and also by tensions within his own party. During the war the Communist Party had grown greatly in strength in the trade unions which controlled and funded the Labor Party, leading a faction of anti-Communist Catholics to form within the party to fight Communist influence. (This body, known as The Movement, was organised by [[B. A. Santamaria]] and supported by the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, [[Daniel Mannix]]). Conflict between left and right in the Labor Party grew increasingly bitter in the [[Cold War]] atmosphere of the 1950s.\n\nNevertheless, the Cain government was able to pass more legislation than any previous Labor government in Victoria had done. Major reforms were carried out in the areas of workers' compensation, tenancy law, long service leave, hospitals, public transport, housing, charities and the Crimes Act. Changes included the provision on long-service leave to railway workers, increased eligibility to workers' compensation, alterations to the Shops and Factories Act and the Landlord and Tenant Act, and the introduction of legislation \"to penalize rogues who resorted to fraudulent misrepresentation in soliciting corporate investment from the public.\"\n\nThe government had also reformed wage determination procedures and public service administration, while constructive initiatives were carried out in adult education and soil conservation.<ref>[[Ross McMullin]], The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891\u20131991</ref> Even some reforms to the electoral system were carried through the Council, where Labor and Liberal members united to reduce the [[Gerrymander|malapportionment]] which had given the Country Party disproportionate representation since the 1920s. In its first two years the Cain government won the approval of the Melbourne daily papers ''[[The Age]]'', ''[[The Herald (Melbourne)|The Herald]]'' and ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]''. Nevertheless, Cain's third Government fell on 19 April 1955 when 19 expelled Labor lower house members aligned to \"The Movement\" \"[[Cross the floor#Voting against party lines|crossed the floor]]\" against the government in a no-confidence vote.<ref name=ANU_AustralianDictionaryofBiographyOnline_JohnCain/>\n\nThe [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955|1955 Labor split]] began in October 1954 after the federal leader, [[H.V. Evatt|Dr H. V. Evatt]], blamed Santamaria and his supporters in the Victorian Labor Party for Labor's loss of seats at the [[1954 Australian federal election|1954 federal election]]. Santamaria exercised strong influence in the Cain government through \"Movement\" linked ministers such as [[Bill Barry (politician)|Bill Barry]] and [[Frank Scully (politician)|Frank Scully]]. Protestant and left-wing ministers strongly opposed the Movement faction. In December 1953 the Lands Minister, [[Robert Holt]], resigned rather than introduce a Santamaria-influenced bill which would have promoted the settlement of Italian immigrants as small farmers in [[Gippsland]].\n\nIn early 1955 the Labor Party's federal executive dissolved the state executive and began to expel Santamaria's supporters from the party. The Victorian branch then split between pro-Evatt and pro-Santamaria factions, and in March the pro-Evatt State Executive suspended 24 members of State Parliament suspected of being Santamaria supporters. Four ministers were forced to resign from the government. When the Parliament met on 19 April 19 expelled Labor members crossed over to vote with the Liberal and Country Party members to defeat the government. At the ensuing [[1955 Victorian state election|May 1955 election]], the expelled members and others stood as the [[Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist)]], later the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]]. Their strategy was to draw votes from the Labor Party and direct preferences to the Liberal Party. Labor was heavily defeated, winning only 20 seats, from the 37 at the [[1952 Victorian state election|1952 election]], to the Liberals' 34 and the Country Party's ten. Only one of the expelled Labor members was re-elected.\n\nCain suffered a stroke on 9 August 1957 and died, aged 75. [[Ernie Shepherd (politician)|Alfred Ernest \"Ernie\" Shepherd]] (1901\u201358) succeeded Cain as party leader, only to die himself little more than a year afterwards. From 1958 to 1967 [[Clive Stoneham]] was Labor and Opposition Leader. He lost the [[1961 Victorian state election|1961]], [[1964 Victorian state election|1964]] and [[1967 Victorian state election|1967]] elections to the incumbent Liberal Premier, [[Henry Bolte]], with the electoral assistance of the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]], which directed its preferences to the Liberals.\n\n===Clyde Holding===\n[[Clyde Holding]] became party leader in 1967. During the 1970 state election campaign, which some commentators suggested Labor could win as a result of [[voter fatigue]] with the Liberals after their 15 years in power, Holding campaigned on the new federal policy of supporting state aid to non-government schools. However, in the week before the election, the left-wing state president, [[George Crawford (Australian politician)|George Crawford]] and state secretary, [[Bill Hartley (activist)|Bill Hartley]], issued a statement saying that a Victorian Labor government would not support state aid. As a result, federal leader [[Gough Whitlam]] refused to campaign for Labor in Victoria, and Holding was forced to repudiate his own policy. At the election, the Bolte government.was returned.\n\nThis episode led directly to federal intervention in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. In 1971 the left-wing leadership was overturned by the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] and allies of Whitlam, Hawke and Holding took control. The left then formed an organised faction, the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]], to agitate for socialist policies, supported by some unions. This continuing conflict in the party made it difficult for Holding to oppose the Liberal government effectively.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The surge in support for federal Labor which saw Whitlam elected Prime Minister in 1972 was not reflected in Victorian state politics. Bolte retired in 1972, and his successor, [[Dick Hamer]], comfortably won the 1973 and 1976 state elections. [[Frank Wilkes]] became party leader in 1977. At the 1979 state election, Labor under Wilkes gained eleven seats, the party's best showing for many years,<ref>Michael O'Grady (1979), 'The party leaders: Hamer and Wilkes,' in Peter Hay, Ian Ward, John Warhurst (eds.), ''Anatomy of an Election'', Hill of Content, Melbourne, Victoria, pages 91\u2013104.</ref> though not sufficient to form government.\n\n===John Cain II===\n[[John Cain (junior)|John Cain II]], son of the former Labor premier, became party leader in September 1981, and won the [[1982 Victorian state election|1982 election]], winning 49 of the 81 seats in the Legislative Assembly, forming a Labor government for the first time since 1955. In 1984 the Labor government legalised [[Prostitution in Australia#Victoria|prostitution in Victoria]].\n\nAt the [[1985 Victorian state election|1985 election]] Labor won 47 of the 88 seats; and 46 seats at the [[1988 Victorian state election|1988 election]]. Cain's political support collapsed in August 1990. By this time the Labor government was in deep crisis, with some of the state's financial institutions on the brink of insolvency, the budget deficit unsustainably high and growing and the Labor Party deeply divided on how to respond to the situation.\n\n===Joan Kirner===\nCain resigned and Joan Kirner was elected Labor leader, becoming the party's first female leader and Victoria's first female [[Premier of Victoria|premier]]. The party hoped that the elevation of a popular woman as its new leader would improve its position, but Kirner never succeeded in gaining control of the crisis into which the state had plunged. The conservative-leaning Melbourne newspaper, the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', reacted unfavourably to a premier from the Socialist Left, dubbing her \"Mother Russia\". She was lampooned alternatively as a sinister [[commissar]] and as a frumpy housewife in a polka dot dress. She seemed unfazed by the ''Herald Sun'' and gradually won some respect, though she was unable to improve significantly the government's standing.\n\nDuring 1991 and 1992 Kirner took several decisions to cut government spending and raise revenue to some extent. However, her government failed to cut spending in many areas including education. Most of the Kirner government's attempts to cut spending were actively opposed by trade unions and some members of the government. The interest bill alone was $3.5&nbsp;billion per year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houserefinancing.com.au/news/1992/9/16/labor-and-coalition-at-odds-over-reduction-in-state-debt/ |title=Labor And Coalition at Odds Over Reduction in State Debt |work=houserefinancing.com.au |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023123319/http://www.houserefinancing.com.au/news/1992/9/16/labor-and-coalition-at-odds-over-reduction-in-state-debt/ |archivedate=23 October 2015 }}</ref> the government sold off trains and trams and leased them back.

Kirner went into 1992 knowing she faced a statutory general election, one which opinion polls gave her virtually no chance of winning. She waited as long as she could, finally calling [[1992 Victorian state election|an election for October]]. It was obvious as soon as the writs were dropped that Labor would not win a fourth term. Although she remained personally more popular than Kennett, it was not nearly enough to overcome the electorate's anger at her party. The Coalition's \"Guilty Party\" campaign did much to stoke this anger, targeting many ministers in the Kirner Government and providing examples of concerns in their portfolios. The Coalition won the election in a landslide, scoring a 19-seat swing \u2013 the second-worst defeat that a sitting government has ever suffered in Victoria. The Liberals won enough seats that they could have governed in their own right. Kirner remained Opposition Leader until March 1993 and resigned from Parliament in May 1994.\n\n[[Jim Kennan]] was a member of parliament between 1982 and 1993, initially in the Victorian Legislative Council, and then in the Legislative Assembly and was Deputy Premier of Victoria from 1990 to 1992. He became the Leader of the Opposition after Kirner resigned in March 1993, until his shock retirement from Parliament three months later.\n\n===Brumby and Bracks period===\nKennan was succeeded as leader by [[John Brumby]], who was a member of the Legislative Council at the time. Brumby transferred to the Legislative Assembly in a by-election for Kennan's seat. The defeat of the federal Labor government in March 1996 prompted Kennett to call an [[1996 Victorian state election|early state election three weeks later]]. Labor led by Brumby only managed a net two-seat gain, leaving it 20 seats behind the Coalition. Brumby was replaced as Labor leader in March 1999 by [[Steve Bracks]]. To everyone's surprise, Bracks won the [[1999 Victorian state election|September 1999 election]],<ref name=Woodward>{{cite journal|author1=Woodward, Dennis |author2=Costar, Brian |title=The Victorian Election of 18 September 1999: Another Case of Electoral Volatility?|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|volume=35|issue=1|pages=125\u2013133|date=9 June 2010|doi=10.1080/10361140050002881}}</ref> which produced a [[hung parliament]] and the independents agreed to support the minority Labor government. Labor won the [[2002 Victorian state election|2002 state election]] in a landslide, taking 62 seats out of 88 in the Legislative Assembly, also winning a slim majority in the Legislative Council. In 2002, Labor reformed the Legislative Council and brought in four-year fixed-term parliaments.<ref>''Electoral Act 2002'' (Vic) and ''The Constitution (Parliamentary Reform) Act 2003''</ref> Labor made inroads towards [[LGBT history in Australia|same-sex equality in Victoria]]. Since 2001, Victorian Labor governments have amended 60 Acts to advance same-sex equality.\n\nLabor won a third term at the [[2006 Victorian state election|2006 state election]]. Bracks resigned as party leader and Premier on 27 July 2007, and Labor deputy leader, [[John Thwaites (Australian politician)|John Thwaites]] also announced his resignation on the same day. John Brumby was elected unopposed Labor leader on 30 July 2007 and became Premier. One notable achievement of the Brumby government was [[Abortion Law Reform Act 2008 (Victoria)|abortion law reform in 2008]]. It also signed contracts for the [[Wonthaggi desalination plant]] in 2009, to drought-proof the State.\n\nAt the [[2010 Victorian state election|2010 state election]] Labor was narrowly defeated, winning only 43 of the 88 Legislative Assembly seats.\n\n===Daniel Andrews===\nBrumby resigned as party leader soon after Labor loss at the 2010 state election, to be replaced by [[Daniel Andrews]] on 3 December 2010.\n\nAfter being in Opposition for one term, Labor won the [[2014 Victorian state election|2014 state election]] from the [[Napthine Ministry|Napthine Government]], winning 47 seats in the Legislative Assembly. On winning office, the Andrews government cancelled the [[East West Link (Melbourne)|East West Link project]] and initiated the [[Level Crossing Removal Authority|level crossing removal project]] and the [[Melbourne Metro Rail Project]].
