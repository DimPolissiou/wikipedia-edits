These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.<ref name=\"Santullano\">{{cite book|jstor=j.ctvbcd2vs.12|title=Mirada al Caribe|first=Luis A.|last=Santullano|date=10 March 2019|publisher=Colegio de Mexico|volume=54|pages=75\u201378|doi=10.2307/j.ctvbcd2vs.12}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{gnis|2415595}}\n\n[[Category:Barrios of Lo\u00edza, Puerto Rico]]\n\n\n{{PuertoRico-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "The Eloquent Peasant", "label": "safe", "comment": "add List of communities in Puerto Rico to See also section", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lo%C3%ADza_barrio-pueblo"}

The AIADMK government distributed free cycles to class 11 and class 12 students during its tenure of 2001\u201306. The DMK, in competition, promised free color televisions in its manifesto in 2006 assembly elections.

It was set up as a breakaway faction of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) led by [[M.

MGR used his fan network to build the party cadre with claims his party recruited more than a million members in the first two months. [[C. N. Annadurai]]'s ideologue and movie mogul R. M. Veerppan was the key architect in unifying the MGR fan clubs and further consolidating the party structure in the 70s. Other key leaders such as Nanjil K. Manoharan and S. D. Somasundaram played major roles in consolidation.<ref name=\"Murali81\">[[#Murali|Murali 2007]], p. 81</ref> The party's first victories were the [[Dindigul (Lok Sabha constituency)|Dindigul]] parliamentary by-election in 1973 and the [[Coimbatore]] assembly by-election a year later.<ref name=\"Murali81\" /> On 2 April 1973, AIADMK emerged as the third largest political party in Tamil Nadu, represented by 11 MLAs in the Assembly. By 31 January 1976, AIADMMK emerged as the second largest political party in Tamil Nadu with 16 MLAs in the Assembly. AIADMK grew close to the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] Party by supporting the [[The Emergency (India)|National Emergency]] between 1975 and 1977.\n\nThe DMK-led government was dismissed by a Central promulgation on corruption charges in 1976. The AIADMK swept to power in 1977, defeating the DMK in the [[1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|assembly elections]]. MGR was sworn in as the 7th Chief Minister of the state on 30 June 1977.

In the [[1980 Indian general election|mid-term parliamentary elections of January 1980]], the Congress aligned with the DMK and the alliance won 37 out of the 39 state parliamentary seats.  The AIADMK won just two seats.<ref name=\"Murali82\">[[#Murali|Murali 2007]], p. 82</ref> After returning to power, the new prime minister, [[Indira Gandhi]], dismissed a number of state governments belonging to the opposition parties, including the AIADMK government.\n\n[[1980 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|Elections to the state assembly were held in late May 1980]] with the opposition DMK continuing the electoral alliance with the Congress.

Ramachandran|MGR]]'s death, his wife, actress-turned-politician [[V. N. Janaki|Janaki Ramachandran]], rose to the party's leadership under support of R. M. Veerappan and 98 MLAs. She led the government for 24 days as the state's 1st woman chief minister from 7 January 1988 until the state assembly was suspended on 30 January 1988 and [[President's rule (India)|President's rule]] imposed. The party began to crumble due to infighting and broke into two factions, one under [[V. N. Janaki|Janaki Ramachandran]] and the other under J. Jayalalithaa, an associate of MGR and another film actress-turned-politician who had starred with MGR. The [[1989 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1989 assembly election]] saw the DMK regain power after 12 years in the opposition with [[M. Karunanidhi]] returning as the Chief Minister for the third time. AIADMK, due to its split, suffered heavily in the elections, with the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions winning only 2 and 27 seats, respectively.<ref name=\"Murali83\" /> Following AIADMK's rout in the elections, the factions led by Jayalalithaa and Janaki merged under the former's leadership. The DMK government was dismissed in 1991 by the Central Government led by Prime Minister [[Chandra Shekhar]], an ally of the AIADMK at that time, on charges that the constitutional machinery in the state had broken down.\n\n===J. Jayalalithaa era (February 1989 - 5 December 2016)===\nThe AIADMK allied with the Congress and swept to power in the [[1991 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1991 assembly election]] under the leadership of [[J. Jayalalithaa]] who became the second female chief minister and the 10th chief minister of the state. Political observers have ascribed the landslide victory to the anti-incumbent wave arising out of the assassination of the former prime minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]<ref name=\"Murali83\" /> by suspected Tamil separatists fighting for a homeland in neighbouring [[Sri Lanka]]. The ensuing government, was accused of large-scale corruption, but Jayalalithaa held on to power for a full term of five years. In the [[1996 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1996 assembly election]], AIADMK continued its alliance with the Congress but suffered a massive rout, winning only four out of the 234 assembly seats, with even Jayalalithaa losing from [[Bargur]].<ref name=\"Murali84\">[[#Murali|Murali 2007]], p. 84</ref><ref name=\"Murali87\">Murali 2007, p. 87</ref>\n[[File:J Jayalalithaa.jpg|thumb|left|Former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Dr. J.

Following this, the AIADMK once again allied with the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]].\n\nIn the [[2001 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|2001 assembly election]], the AIADMK-led alliance, consisting of the Congress, the [[Tamil Maanila Congress]] (TMC), the [[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|Left Front]] and the [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]] (PMK), regained power, winning 197 seats, with AIADMK winning 132.<ref name=\"CM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tn.gov.in/tnassembly/cmlist-1920.html|title=List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu from 1920|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423150027/http://www.tn.gov.in/tnassembly/cmlist-1920.htm|archivedate=23 April 2013}}</ref> Due to the proceedings in a disproportionate assets case which occurred in her previous tenure, Jayalalithaa was prevented from holding office.

Once the Supreme Court overturned Jayalalithaa's conviction and sentence in the case, [[O Panneerselvam]] resigned on 2 March 2002, and Jayalalithaa was again sworn in as Chief Minister.<ref name=\"CM\" />\n\nUnlike her first term, her second term was not marred by corruption scandals. She took many popular decisions such as banning of lottery tickets, restricting the liquor and sand quarrying business to government agencies and banning tobacco product sales near schools and colleges. She encouraged women to join the state police force by setting up all women-police stations and commissioning 150 women into the elite level police commandos in 2003, a first in India. The women had the same training as men and included handling weapons, detection and disposal of bombs, driving, horseriding, and adventure sports.<ref>{{cite news|title=Indian women join elite police|last=Haviland|first=Charles |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2976142.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> She sent a special task force to the [[Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary|Sathyamangalam forests]] in October 2004 to hunt down notorious sandalwood smuggler [[Veerappan]].

The [[Democratic Progressive Alliance]] (DPA), a DMK-led alliance consisting of all the major opposition parties in the state, swept the election.\n\nLater, in the [[2006 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|2006 assembly election]], in spite of media speculations of a hung assembly, the AIADMK, contesting with only the support of MDMK and a few other smaller parties, won 61 seats compared to the DMK's 96 and was pushed out of power by the DMK-led congressional alliance of the PMK and the Left Front. The AIADMK's electoral reversals continued in the [[2009 Indian general election|2009 Lok Sabha election]]. However, the party's performance was better than its debacle in 2004, and it managed to win nine seats.\n[[File:Swearing-in Ceremony of the Council of Ministers headed by Dr. J.

However, it did not join the newly elected AINRC-led government. The AIADMK's good electoral performance continued in the 2014 Lok Sabha election.

But, the election commission canceled the by-polls after evidence of large-scale bribing by the ruling AIADMK (AMMA) surfaced.  On 17 April 2017, Delhi police registered a case against Dhinakaran who was also the candidate for AIADMK (AMMA) for the by-poll at [[Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar|RK Nagar]] regarding an allegation of attempting to bribe the Election Commission of India (ECI) for the AIADMK's election symbol. However the Tis Hazari Special Court granted him bail on the grounds that the police failed to identify the public official allegedly bribed. T.T.V.

It was set up as a breakaway faction of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK) led by [[M. Karunanidhi]], then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, owing to differences between the two.<ref name=\"Kohli157\">[[#Kohli|Kohli 1990]], p. 157</ref> Later, MGR prefixed the ''All India (AI)'' tag to the party's name.<ref name=\"Rana400\">[[#Rana|Rana 2006]], p. 400</ref> Since its inception, the relationship between the AIADMK and DMK has been marked by mutual contempt. MGR used his fan network to build the party cadre with claims his party recruited more than a million members in the first two months. [[C. N. Annadurai]]'s ideologue and movie mogul R. M. Veerppan was the key architect in unifying the MGR fan clubs and further consolidating the party structure in the 70s. Other key leaders such as Nanjil K. Manoharan and S. D. Somasundaram played major roles in consolidation.<ref name=\"Murali81\">[[#Murali|Murali 2007]], p. 81</ref> The party's first victories were the [[Dindigul (Lok Sabha constituency)|Dindigul]] parliamentary by-election in 1973 and the [[Coimbatore]] assembly by-election a year later.<ref name=\"Murali81\" /> On 2 April 1973, AIADMK emerged as the third largest political party in Tamil Nadu, represented by 11 MLAs in the Assembly. By 31 January 1976, AIADMMK emerged as the second largest political party in Tamil Nadu with 16 MLAs in the Assembly. AIADMK grew close to the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] Party by supporting the [[The Emergency (India)|National Emergency]] between 1975 and 1977.\n\nThe DMK-led government was dismissed by a Central promulgation on corruption charges in 1976. The AIADMK swept to power in 1977, defeating the DMK in the [[1977 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|assembly elections]]. MGR was sworn in as the 7th Chief Minister of the state on 30 June 1977. MGR remained in power until his death on 24 December 1987, winning consecutive assembly elections held in 1977, 1980 and 1984.<ref name=\"Kohli157\" />\nIn 1979, AIADMK became the first [[Dravidian parties|Dravidian]] and regional party to be part of the [[Union Council of Ministers|Union Cabinet]], when two AIADMK [[Member of Parliament (India)|MP]]'s, [[Sathyavani Muthu]] and Aravinda Bala Pajanor, joined the short-lived [[Charan Singh]] Ministry which followed the [[Morarji Desai]]-led [[Janata Party]] [[Premiership of Morarji Desai|government (1977\u20131979)]].<ref name=\"Rana400\" />\n\nRelations between the Congress and the AIADMK slowly became strained. In the [[1980 Indian general election|mid-term parliamentary elections of January 1980]], the Congress aligned with the DMK and the alliance won 37 out of the 39 state parliamentary seats.  The AIADMK won just two seats.<ref name=\"Murali82\">[[#Murali|Murali 2007]], p. 82</ref> After returning to power, the new prime minister, [[Indira Gandhi]], dismissed a number of state governments belonging to the opposition parties, including the AIADMK government.\n\n[[1980 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|Elections to the state assembly were held in late May 1980]] with the opposition DMK continuing the electoral alliance with the Congress. In a massive reversal of fortunes following the Lok Sabha elections, the AIADMK won a comfortable majority in the [[Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly|state assembly]] with 129 of 234 seat.  MGR was sworn in as chief minister for the second time on 9 June 1980.<ref name=\"Murali82\" />\n\nIn 1984, even with MGR's failing health and hospitalization, the party won the [[1984 Tamil Nadu legislative assembly election|assembly elections]] in alliance with the Congress. Many political historians consider MGR's persona and charisma at this point of time as \"infallible\", and a logical continuation of his on-screen \"good lad\" image, strengthened by his \"mythical status\" in the minds of the masses.<ref name=\"Murali83\">[[#Murali|Murali 2007]], p. 83</ref> MGR continued to enjoy popular support in his third tenure until his death on 24 December 1987.<ref name=\"Murali83\" />\n[[File:VNJanaki.jpg|thumb|right|[[M.

Ramachandran|MGR]]'s death, his wife, actress-turned-politician [[V. N. Janaki|Janaki Ramachandran]], rose to the party's leadership under support of R. M. Veerappan and 98 MLAs. She led the government for 24 days as the state's 1st woman chief minister from 7 January 1988 until the state assembly was suspended on 30 January 1988 and [[President's rule (India)|President's rule]] imposed. The party began to crumble due to infighting and broke into two factions, one under [[V. N. Janaki|Janaki Ramachandran]] and the other under J. Jayalalithaa, an associate of MGR and another film actress-turned-politician who had starred with MGR. The [[1989 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1989 assembly election]] saw the DMK regain power after 12 years in the opposition with [[M. Karunanidhi]] returning as the Chief Minister for the third time. AIADMK, due to its split, suffered heavily in the elections, with the Janaki and Jayalalithaa factions winning only 2 and 27 seats, respectively.<ref name=\"Murali83\" /> Following AIADMK's rout in the elections, the factions led by Jayalalithaa and Janaki merged under the former's leadership. The DMK government was dismissed in 1991 by the Central Government led by Prime Minister [[Chandra Shekhar]], an ally of the AIADMK at that time, on charges that the constitutional machinery in the state had broken down.\n\n===J. Jayalalithaa era (February 1989 - 5 December 2016)===\nThe AIADMK allied with the Congress and swept to power in the [[1991 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1991 assembly election]] under the leadership of [[J. Jayalalithaa]] who became the second female chief minister and the 10th chief minister of the state. Political observers have ascribed the landslide victory to the anti-incumbent wave arising out of the assassination of the former prime minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]]<ref name=\"Murali83\" /> by suspected Tamil separatists fighting for a homeland in neighbouring [[Sri Lanka]]. The ensuing government, was accused of large-scale corruption, but Jayalalithaa held on to power for a full term of five years.

Once the Supreme Court overturned Jayalalithaa's conviction and sentence in the case, [[O Panneerselvam]] resigned on 2 March 2002, and Jayalalithaa was again sworn in as Chief Minister.<ref name=\"CM\" />\n\nUnlike her first term, her second term was not marred by corruption scandals. She took many popular decisions such as banning of lottery tickets, restricting the liquor and sand quarrying business to government agencies and banning tobacco product sales near schools and colleges. She encouraged women to join the state police force by setting up all women-police stations and commissioning 150 women into the elite level police commandos in 2003, a first in India.

The [[Democratic Progressive Alliance]] (DPA), a DMK-led alliance consisting of all the major opposition parties in the state, swept the election.\n\nLater, in the [[2006 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|2006 assembly election]], in spite of media speculations of a hung assembly, the AIADMK, contesting with only the support of MDMK and a few other smaller parties, won 61 seats compared to the DMK's 96 and was pushed out of power by the DMK-led congressional alliance of the PMK and the Left Front. The AIADMK's electoral reversals continued in the [[2009 Indian general election|2009 Lok Sabha election]].

However, it did not join the newly elected AINRC-led government. The AIADMK's good electoral performance continued in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. Contesting without allies, the AIADMK won an unprecedented 37 out of 39 seats in the state of Tamil Nadu, emerging as the third-largest party in parliament.\n\nOn 27 September 2014, Jayalalithaa was convicted in the [[Disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa|Disproportionate assets case]] by a Special Court along with her associates [[V.

Palaniswami became chief minister of Tamil Nadu.\n\nOn 23 March 2017, the election commission of India gave separate party symbols to the two factions; [[O. Panneerselvam]]'s faction known as AIADMK (PURATCHI THALAIVI AMMA), while [[Edappadi K. Palaniswami]]'s faction known as AIADMK (AMMA).\n\nBy-polls were announced at the [[Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar|RK Nagar constituency]] which was vacated due to Jayalalitha's death. But, the election commission canceled the by-polls after evidence of large-scale bribing by the ruling AIADMK (AMMA) surfaced.  On 17 April 2017, Delhi police registered a case against Dhinakaran who was also the candidate for AIADMK (AMMA) for the by-poll at [[Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar|RK Nagar]] regarding an allegation of attempting to bribe the Election Commission of India (ECI) for the AIADMK's election symbol. However the Tis Hazari Special Court granted him bail on the grounds that the police failed to identify the public official allegedly bribed. T.T.V. Dhinakaran started his party work on 5 August 2017. However, the chief minister Edappadi Palaniswamy had a fallout with Dhinakaran and announced that the appointment of T.T.V. Dinakaran as deputy general secretary was invalid. So T.T.V. Dhinakaran claims that's \" We are the real AIADMK and 95% of its cadres are with us \".\n\n===O. Panneerselvam & Edappadi K.
