{"title_page": "Hydroxyl tagging velocimetry", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=October 2015}}\n'''Hydroxyl tagging velocimetry''' ('''HTV''') is a [[velocimetry]] method used in humid air flows. The\nmethod is often used in high-speed combusting flows because the high velocity and temperature\naccentuate its advantages over similar methods.  HTV uses a laser (often an argon-fluoride\n[[excimer laser]] operating at ~193&nbsp;nm) to dissociate the water in the flow into H + OH.  Before entering the flow [[optics]] are\nused to create a grid of laser beams.  The water in the flow is dissociated only where beams of\nsufficient energy pass through the flow, thus creating a grid in the flow where the\nconcentrations of [[hydroxyl]] (OH) are higher than in the surrounding flow.  Another laser beam (at either ~248&nbsp;nm or ~308&nbsp;nm) in\nthe form of a sheet is also passed through the flow in the same plane as the grid.  This laser\nbeam is tuned to a [[wavelength]] that causes the hydroxyl molecules to fluoresce in the [[UV spectrum]].  The [[fluorescence]] is then captured by a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera.  Using\nelectronic timing methods the picture of the grid can be captured at nearly the same instant\nthat the grid is created.\n\nBy delaying the pulse of the fluorescence laser and the camera shot an image of the grid that\nhas now displaced downstream can be captured.  Computer programs are then used to compare the\ntwo images and determine the displacement of the grid.  By dividing the displacement by the known\ntime delay the two dimensional velocity field (in the plane of the grid) can be determined.\n\nOther [[molecular tagging velocimetry]] (MTV) methods have used [[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>), excited oxygen and nitric oxide as the tag instead of hydroxyl.  In the case of [[ozone]] the method is known as '''ozone tagging velocimetry''' or OTV. OTV has been developed and tested in many room air temperature applications with very accurate test results. OTV consists of an initial \"write\" step, where a 193-nm pulsed [[excimer laser]] creates [[ozone]] grid lines via [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) [[UV]] absorption, and a subsequent \"read\" step, where a 248-nm [[excimer laser]] photodissociates the formed O<sub>3</sub> and fluoresces the vibrationally excited O<sub>2</sub> product thus revealing the grid lines' displacement.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal\n |author1=L.A.

On the same day he addressed a bull of appointment to Bishop Camillo Daddeo, transferring him to Fossano from the diocese of Brugnano. He also addressed a letter to the Archbishop of Turin, notifying him of the transfer of a number of parishes from his jurisdiction to that of the new diocese. He addressed another to the people of Fossano, notifying them of the promotion of their town (''oppidum'') to the status of a city (''civitas''). Finally, the Pope wrote to [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]], officially notifying him of the creation of the diocese and the appointment of Bishop Daddeo. In the letter to Bishop Daddeo, Pope Clement notes that he has assigned the right of presentation to the vacant See of Fossano to the Dukes of Savoy, and that the Dukes are to continue to enjoy the rights of patronage which they possessed in the territory before the diocese was erected. In fact, the initiative for the creation of the new diocese had come from Charles Emanuel himself, who had recently (1588) seized the Marqisate of Saluzzo in an effort to free himself from the political grasp of his French cousins.<ref>Ughelli, pp. 1080-1083.

Then, in 1595, he conducted the first diocesan synod in the new diocese. The decrees of the synod, along with a selection of papal bulls and decrees of the [[Council of Trent]] were immediately published. The decrees contained theological, liturgical, and disciplinary clauses, both for the clergy and for the laity. The regular and correct conduct of religious services and the proper administration of the sacraments was a major concern. Bishop Federico Sandri-Trotti (1627\u20131646) presided over another synod. A synod was held in 1642 by Bishop Clemente Sandri-Trotti (1658\u20131675), and its decrees too were immediately published; the bishop held another synod in April 1663, and published the decrees, along with a republication of those of Bishop Daddeo and Bishop Frederico Sandri-Trotti. He held another synod in 1669. In September 1748, Bishop Giambattista Pensa (1741\u20131754) held his first diocesan synod, and in August 1778 Bishop Carlo Giuseppe Morozzo (1762\u20131800) presided over another.

On the same day he addressed a bull of appointment to Bishop Camillo Daddeo, transferring him to Fossano from the diocese of Brugnano. He also addressed a letter to the Archbishop of Turin, notifying him of the transfer of a number of parishes from his jurisdiction to that of the new diocese. He addressed another to the people of Fossano, notifying them of the promotion of their town (''oppidum'') to the status of a city (''civitas''). Finally, the Pope wrote to [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]], officially notifying him of the creation of the diocese and the appointment of Bishop Daddeo. In the letter to Bishop Daddeo, Pope Clement notes that he has assigned the right of presentation to the vacant See of Fossano to the Dukes of Savoy, and that the Dukes are to continue to enjoy the rights of patronage which they possessed in the territory before the diocese was erected. In fact, the initiative for the creation of the new diocese had come from Charles Emanuel himself, who had recently (1588) seized the Marqisate of Saluzzo in an effort to free himself from the political grasp of his French cousins.<ref>Ughelli, pp. 1080-1083.

As in metropolitan France, the government program also included reducing the number of bishoprics, making them conform as far as possible with the civil administration's [[Departments of France|\"departments\"]].

Then, in 1595, he conducted the first diocesan synod in the new diocese. The decrees of the synod, along with a selection of papal bulls and decrees of the [[Council of Trent]] were immediately published. The decrees contained theological, liturgical, and disciplinary clauses, both for the clergy and for the laity. The regular and correct conduct of religious services and the proper administration of the sacraments was a major concern. Bishop Federico Sandri-Trotti (1627\u20131646) presided over another synod. A synod was held in 1642 by Bishop Clemente Sandri-Trotti (1658\u20131675), and its decrees too were immediately published; the bishop held another synod in April 1663, and published the decrees, along with a republication of those of Bishop Daddeo and Bishop Frederico Sandri-Trotti.

He was regarded as \"The King of the Violin\", or, as [[Nathan Milstein]] put it, the \"tsar\".\n\n==Legend of the Ysa\u00ffe violin==\n'''Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe''' came from a background of \"artisans\", though a large part of his family played instruments. As violinist [[Arnold Steinhardt]] recounts, a legend was passed down through the Ysa\u00ffe family about the first violin brought to the lineage:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt was told of a boy whom some woodcutters found in the forest and brought to the village. The boy grew up to be a blacksmith. Once, at a village festival, he astonished everyone by playing the [[viol]] beautifully. From then on the villagers took pleasure in dancing and singing to the strains of his viol. One day an illustrious stranger stopped in front of the smithy to have his horse shod. The count's servant saw the viol inside and told the young smith that he had heard a new Italian instrument played by some minstrels at the count's court. That instrument, called the violin, was much better than the viol \u2013 its tone was like the human voice and could express every feeling and passion. From that moment the young man no longer took pleasure in his viol. Day and night he was thinking of that wonderful new instrument that could express joy and sorrow and whose tones went straight to the human heart.\nThen he had a dream: he saw before him a young woman of indescribable beauty, not unlike his own love, Biethline. She came to him and kissed his brow. The young man awoke and looked at the wall his broken and neglected viol used to hang on and could barely believe his eyes: there, instead of the viol, was a new instrument of beautiful proportions. He put it against his shoulder and drew the bow over the strings, producing sounds that were truly divine. The violin sang in a heartwarming tone: it rejoiced and wept for happiness \u2013 and so did the musician. Thus, goes the legend, came the first violin to the Ardennes and to the Ysa\u00ffe family.<ref name=Steinhardt>Arnold Steinhardt, ''Violin Dreams'' (Mariner Books 2008), pp33, 34.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Early years==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nBorn in [[Li\u00e8ge]], Ysa\u00ffe began [[violin]] lessons at age five with his father. He would later recognize his father's teaching as the foundation of everything he knew on his instrument, even though he went on to study with highly reputed masters. At seven he entered the Conservatoire at Li\u00e8ge studying with D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Heynberg (from 1865\u201369), although soon afterwards he was asked to leave the conservatory because of lack of progress. This was because, in order to support his family, young Eug\u00e8ne had to play full-time in two local orchestras, one conducted by his father.\nHe had big pp\nEug\u00e8ne went on playing in these ensembles, though he studied by himself and learned the repertoire of the violin. By the time he was twelve, he was playing so well that one day he was practicing in a cellar when the legendary [[Henri Vieuxtemps]], passing in the street, was so impressed with the sound of his violin that he took an interest in the boy. He arranged for Ysa\u00ffe to be re-admitted to the conservatory studying with Vieuxtemps's assistant, the noted [[Henryk Wieniawski]]. Ysa\u00ffe would later also study with Vieuxtemps, and both \"master and disciple\", as Ysa\u00ffe would call the roles of teacher and pupil, were very fond of each other. In his last years, Vieuxtemps asked Ysa\u00ffe to come to the countryside just to play for him.\n\nStudying with these teachers meant that he was part of the so-called Franco-Belgian school of violin playing, which dates back to the development of the modern violin bow by [[Fran\u00e7ois Tourte]]. Qualities of this \"\u00c9cole\" included elegance, a full tone with a sense of drawing a \"long\" bow with no jerks, precise left hand techniques, and bowing using the whole forearm while keeping both the wrist and upper arm quiet (as opposed to [[Joseph Joachim]]'s German school of wrist bowing and [[Leopold Auer]]'s Russian concept of using the whole arm.)\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Ber Zalkind. \u201cCartoon of Violinist Eugene Isaya.\u201d 1913.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ber Zalkind]]. \"Cartoon of Violinist Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe\". 1913]]\n\nAfter his graduation from the [[Royal Conservatory of Li\u00e8ge]], Ysa\u00ffe was the principal violin of the [[Benjamin Bilse]] beer-hall orchestra, which later developed into the [[Berlin Philharmonic]]. Many musicians of note and influence came regularly to hear this orchestra and Ysa\u00ffe in particular, among whom figured [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Clara Schumann]], and [[Anton Rubinstein]], who asked that Ysa\u00ffe be released from his contract to accompany him on tour.\n\nWhen Ysa\u00ffe was twenty-seven years old, he was recommended as a soloist for one of the [[Concerts Colonne]] in Paris, which was the start of his great success as a concert artist. The next year, Ysa\u00ffe received a professorship at the [[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussels)|Brussels Conservatoire]] in his native Belgium. This began his career as a teacher, which was to remain one of his main occupations after leaving the Conservatoire in 1898 and into his last years. Among his notable pupils are [[Josef Gingold]], the [[viola]] virtuoso [[William Primrose]], the violin virtuoso [[Nathan Milstein]] (who primarily studied with [[Pyotr Stolyarsky]]), [[Louis Persinger]], [[Mathieu Crickboom]], [[Jonny Heykens]], [[Charles Houdret]], [[Jascha Brodsky]], [[Oscar Shumsky]], [[Julia Klumpke]], and [[Aldo Ferraresi]]. ({{See LMST|Eug\u00e8ne|Ysa\u00ffe}})\n\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe in Russia, 1883.jpg|thumb|Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe in Russia, 1883]]\nDuring his tenure as professor at the Conservatoire, Ysa\u00ffe continued to tour an ever-broadening section of the world, including all of Europe, Russia, and the United States. Despite health concerns, particularly regarding the condition of his hands, Ysa\u00ffe was at his best when performing, and many prominent composers dedicated major works to him, including [[Claude Debussy]], [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[C\u00e9sar Franck]], and [[Ernest Chausson]]. He arranged for violin and orchestra Saint-Sa\u00ebns's ''\u00c9tude en forme de valse'', which had originally been written for solo piano.\n\nMention should be made of Franck's [[Violin Sonata (Franck)|Violin Sonata in A]], written as a wedding present for Ysa\u00ffe and his wife in 1886, which Ysa\u00ffe played wherever he went for the rest of his life; and of Chausson's ''[[Po\u00e8me (Chausson)|Po\u00e8me]]'', which was his response to a request for a concerto.  [[Joseph Szigeti]] considered those two dedications particularly stand out in demonstrating the enormous respect in which Ysa\u00ffe was held.\n\nIn 1886, he established the [[Ysa\u00ffe Quartet (1886)|Ysa\u00ffe Quartet]], which premiered Debussy's ''[[String Quartet (Debussy)|String Quartet]]''.\n\n==Teaching and composing==\n\nAs his physical ailments grew more prohibitive, Ysa\u00ffe turned more to teaching, conducting and an early love, composition. Among his most famous works are the six ''Sonatas for Solo Violin'' op. 27, the unaccompanied ''Sonata for Cello'', op. 28, one ''Sonata for Two Violins'', eight ''Po\u00e8mes'' for various instruments (one or two violins, violin and cello, string quartet) and orchestra (''Po\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9giaque'', ''Po\u00e8me de l'Extase'', ''Chant d'hiver'', ''Po\u00e8me nocturne'', among others), pieces for string orchestra without [[Double bass|basses]] (including ''Po\u00e8me de l'Exil''), two piano trios, a string quintet, and an [[opera]], ''Peter the Miner'', written near the end of his life in the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] language.\n\nYsa\u00ffe had been offered the post of music director of the [[New York Philharmonic]] in 1898, but declined it due to his busy solo performance schedule. In 1918, he accepted the music director's position with the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]], where he remained until 1922 and with which he made several recordings.\n\nFinally, in 1931, suffering from the extreme ravages of [[diabetes]] that had necessitated the amputation of his left foot, Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe died in his house in Brussels and was interred in the [[Ixelles Cemetery]] in [[Brussels]].\n\n==Performing career==\n[[File:Ysaye.jpg|thumb|Ysa\u00ffe with violin]]\n\nAs a performer, Ysa\u00ffe was compelling and highly original. [[Pablo Casals]] claimed never to have heard a violinist play in tune before Ysa\u00ffe, and [[Carl Flesch]] called him \"the most outstanding and individual violinist I have ever heard in my life.\"\n\nYsa\u00ffe possessed a large and flexible tone, influenced by a considerable variety of [[vibrato]] \u2014 from no vibrato at all to very intense. He said, \"Don't always vibrate, but always be vibrating\". His ''[[modus operandi]]'' was, in his own words: \"Nothing which wouldn't have for goal emotion, poetry, heart.\" The conductor Sir [[Henry Wood]] said, \"The quality of tone was ravishingly beautiful.... He seemed to get more colour out of a violin than any of his contemporaries.\"<ref name=wood>Sir Henry Wood, ''My Life of Music'' (Victor Gollancz 1938), pp171, 173.</ref>\n\nPossibly the most distinctive feature of Ysa\u00ffe's interpretations was his masterful [[rubato]]. Sir Henry Wood said, \"Whenever he stole time from one note, he faithfully paid it back within four bars\",<ref name=wood/> allowing his accompanist to maintain strict tempo under his free cantilena. Incidentally, this kind of rubato fits the description of [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s rubato.\n\nAlthough Ysa\u00ffe was a great interpreter of late Romantic and early modern composers \u2014 [[Max Bruch]], [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], and [[C\u00e9sar Franck]], who said he was their greatest interpreter{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} \u2014 he was admired for his [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] interpretations. His technique was brilliant and finely honed, and in this respect he is the first modern violinist, whose technique was without the shortcomings of some earlier artists.\n\nAn international violin competition in Brussels was created in his memory: in 1951, this became the violin section of the [[Queen Elisabeth Music Competition]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:S\u00e9pulture Eugene Ysaye 01.jpg|thumb|<center>Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe's grave in Brussels ([[Ixelles Cemetery]])<ref>the text on the front side of the tomb stone reads: ''Monument \u00e9rig\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9 National Belge de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Auteurs Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique.'' Which translates into: Monument erected by the Belgian National Committee of the Society of authors, composers and music publishers.</ref></center>]]\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ysaye a Li\u00e8ge.jpg|thumb|Bust of Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe in [[Li\u00e8ge]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Boulevard Piercot|fr|3=Boulevard Piercot}} gardens)]]\n\nYsa\u00ffe was married twice.  His first marriage, on 28 September 1886 in Arlon, was to Louise Bourdau (from [[Dendermonde]]), with whom he had three sons and two daughters: Gabriel (1887\u20131961), Carry (1889\u20131930), Th\u00e9r\u00e8se called Th\u00e9sy (1890\u20131956), Antoine (1894\u20131979) and Th\u00e9odore (1898\u20131934). [[C\u00e9sar Franck]] presented his [[Violin Sonata (Franck)|Violin Sonata in A]] to them as a gift on the morning of the wedding, and after a hurried rehearsal Ysa\u00ffe performed the piece at the marriage celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/acc/ysaye.php|title=Classical Net \u2013 Composers \u2013 Ysa\u00ffe|work=Classical Net}}</ref> The sonata had its formal concert premiere in Brussels on 15 December 1886 with Franck in the audience.\n\nAfter Louise's death (9 February 1924) he married a pupil of his, Jeanette Dincin (1902\u20131967), 44 years his junior. She was a violinist who in her teens had studied with prominent teachers such as [[Franz Kneisel]], [[Leopold Auer]], and [[Otakar \u0160ev\u010d\u00edk]]. Ysa\u00ffe met her in 1922 while conductor of the Cincinnati Orchestra. She cared for him in his ailing years. Eugene's only request of her after he died was that she carry on her performances under his name.\n\nHis brother was [[pianist]] and composer [[Th\u00e9o Ysa\u00ffe]] (1865\u20131918), and his great-grandson is Marc Ysa\u00ffe, founder-controller of radio [[Classic 21]] and drummer of rock band [[Machiavel (band)|Machiavel]]. Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe was also close friends with [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876\u20131965)|Queen Elisabeth of Belgium]], whom he taught violin despite her lack of talent. His widow took over the royal teaching herself after his death, and the queen began the competition in his honor. His granddaughter, Nadine Ysaye Mosbaugh, was a noted concert pianist who toured Europe with Jose Iturbi before settling down in Canada. She also hosted and performed on a classical radio program on CKAR Radio in Huntsville, Ontario. Ysaye's great-grandson, Franc Mosbaugh, is a Canadian musician/singer and award-winning commercial jingle composer.\n\nYsa\u00ffe was also a friend of [[Claude Debussy]] and would sometimes correspond with him by letter.<ref>Weintraub, Stanley. 2001. ''Whistler: a biography'' (New York: Da Capo Press). {{ISBN|978-0-306-80971-2}}. p, 351</ref> The two had great respect for each other and Ysa\u00ffe was a significant supporter of the younger composer's early career.  Debussy dedicated his only [[String Quartet (Debussy)|string quartet]] to the violinist, who studied the score with great care.<ref>Seroff, Victor. Debussy; Musician of France.

Ysa\u00ffe, very ill with diabetes, listened to the performance from his hospital room. The Queen,  informed of the seriousness of Ysa\u00ffe's condition, had organised a radio broadcast of the work and Ysa\u00ffe addressed the audience from his room. The work was then performed in Brussels on 25 April. Ysa\u00ffe, transported on a stretcher to a box in the theater, was able to view the performance. He died 18 days later.\nThe critics were appreciative but the opera did not find a place in the standard repertoire. It was performed again by Op\u00e9ra Royal de Wallonie in Liege, 25 November 2006. This performance was recorded and is published by the non-profit association  [http://www.musiwall.ulg.ac.be/ \"Musique en Wallonie\"] under the reference MEW 0884 \u2013 0885 in a two CD set accompanied by a book containing the Walloon text and its French, Dutch and English translations, and introductory texts in French, Dutch, German and English.

He was regarded as \"The King of the Violin\", or, as [[Nathan Milstein]] put it, the \"tsar\".\n\n==Legend of the Ysa\u00ffe violin==\n'''Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe''' came from a background of \"artisans\", though a large part of his family played instruments. As violinist [[Arnold Steinhardt]] recounts, a legend was passed down through the Ysa\u00ffe family about the first violin brought to the lineage:\n\n<blockquote>\nIt was told of a boy whom some woodcutters found in the forest and brought to the village. The boy grew up to be a blacksmith. Once, at a village festival, he astonished everyone by playing the [[viol]] beautifully. From then on the villagers took pleasure in dancing and singing to the strains of his viol. One day an illustrious stranger stopped in front of the smithy to have his horse shod. The count's servant saw the viol inside and told the young smith that he had heard a new Italian instrument played by some minstrels at the count's court. That instrument, called the violin, was much better than the viol \u2013 its tone was like the human voice and could express every feeling and passion. From that moment the young man no longer took pleasure in his viol. Day and night he was thinking of that wonderful new instrument that could express joy and sorrow and whose tones went straight to the human heart.\nThen he had a dream: he saw before him a young woman of indescribable beauty, not unlike his own love, Biethline. She came to him and kissed his brow. The young man awoke and looked at the wall his broken and neglected viol used to hang on and could barely believe his eyes: there, instead of the viol, was a new instrument of beautiful proportions. He put it against his shoulder and drew the bow over the strings, producing sounds that were truly divine. The violin sang in a heartwarming tone: it rejoiced and wept for happiness \u2013 and so did the musician. Thus, goes the legend, came the first violin to the Ardennes and to the Ysa\u00ffe family.<ref name=Steinhardt>Arnold Steinhardt, ''Violin Dreams'' (Mariner Books 2008), pp33, 34.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Early years==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\nBorn in [[Li\u00e8ge]], Ysa\u00ffe began [[violin]] lessons at age five with his father. He would later recognize his father's teaching as the foundation of everything he knew on his instrument, even though he went on to study with highly reputed masters. At seven he entered the Conservatoire at Li\u00e8ge studying with D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Heynberg (from 1865\u201369), although soon afterwards he was asked to leave the conservatory because of lack of progress. This was because, in order to support his family, young Eug\u00e8ne had to play full-time in two local orchestras, one conducted by his father.\n\nEug\u00e8ne went on playing in these ensembles, though he studied by himself and learned the repertoire of the violin. By the time he was twelve, he was playing so well that one day he was practicing in a cellar when the legendary [[Henri Vieuxtemps]], passing in the street, was so impressed with the sound of his violin that he took an interest in the boy. He arranged for Ysa\u00ffe to be re-admitted to the conservatory studying with Vieuxtemps's assistant, the noted [[Henryk Wieniawski]]. Ysa\u00ffe would later also study with Vieuxtemps, and both \"master and disciple\", as Ysa\u00ffe would call the roles of teacher and pupil, were very fond of each other. In his last years, Vieuxtemps asked Ysa\u00ffe to come to the countryside just to play for him.\n\nStudying with these teachers meant that he was part of the so-called Franco-Belgian school of violin playing, which dates back to the development of the modern violin bow by [[Fran\u00e7ois Tourte]]. Qualities of this \"\u00c9cole\" included elegance, a full tone with a sense of drawing a \"long\" bow with no jerks, precise left hand techniques, and bowing using the whole forearm while keeping both the wrist and upper arm quiet (as opposed to [[Joseph Joachim]]'s German school of wrist bowing and [[Leopold Auer]]'s Russian concept of using the whole arm.)\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Ber Zalkind. \u201cCartoon of Violinist Eugene Isaya.\u201d 1913.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ber Zalkind]]. \"Cartoon of Violinist Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe\". 1913]]\n\nAfter his graduation from the [[Royal Conservatory of Li\u00e8ge]], Ysa\u00ffe was the principal violin of the [[Benjamin Bilse]] beer-hall orchestra, which later developed into the [[Berlin Philharmonic]]. Many musicians of note and influence came regularly to hear this orchestra and Ysa\u00ffe in particular, among whom figured [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Clara Schumann]], and [[Anton Rubinstein]], who asked that Ysa\u00ffe be released from his contract to accompany him on tour.\n\nWhen Ysa\u00ffe was twenty-seven years old, he was recommended as a soloist for one of the [[Concerts Colonne]] in Paris, which was the start of his great success as a concert artist. The next year, Ysa\u00ffe received a professorship at the [[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussels)|Brussels Conservatoire]] in his native Belgium. This began his career as a teacher, which was to remain one of his main occupations after leaving the Conservatoire in 1898 and into his last years. Among his notable pupils are [[Josef Gingold]], the [[viola]] virtuoso [[William Primrose]], the violin virtuoso [[Nathan Milstein]] (who primarily studied with [[Pyotr Stolyarsky]]), [[Louis Persinger]], [[Mathieu Crickboom]], [[Jonny Heykens]], [[Charles Houdret]], [[Jascha Brodsky]], [[Oscar Shumsky]], [[Julia Klumpke]], and [[Aldo Ferraresi]]. ({{See LMST|Eug\u00e8ne|Ysa\u00ffe}})\n\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe in Russia, 1883.jpg|thumb|Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe in Russia, 1883]]\nDuring his tenure as professor at the Conservatoire, Ysa\u00ffe continued to tour an ever-broadening section of the world, including all of Europe, Russia, and the United States. Despite health concerns, particularly regarding the condition of his hands, Ysa\u00ffe was at his best when performing, and many prominent composers dedicated major works to him, including [[Claude Debussy]], [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], [[C\u00e9sar Franck]], and [[Ernest Chausson]]. He arranged for violin and orchestra Saint-Sa\u00ebns's ''\u00c9tude en forme de valse'', which had originally been written for solo piano.\n\nMention should be made of Franck's [[Violin Sonata (Franck)|Violin Sonata in A]], written as a wedding present for Ysa\u00ffe and his wife in 1886, which Ysa\u00ffe played wherever he went for the rest of his life; and of Chausson's ''[[Po\u00e8me (Chausson)|Po\u00e8me]]'', which was his response to a request for a concerto.  [[Joseph Szigeti]] considered those two dedications particularly stand out in demonstrating the enormous respect in which Ysa\u00ffe was held.\n\nIn 1886, he established the [[Ysa\u00ffe Quartet (1886)|Ysa\u00ffe Quartet]], which premiered Debussy's ''[[String Quartet (Debussy)|String Quartet]]''.\n\n==Teaching and composing==\n\nAs his physical ailments grew more prohibitive, Ysa\u00ffe turned more to teaching, conducting and an early love, composition. Among his most famous works are the six ''Sonatas for Solo Violin'' op. 27, the unaccompanied ''Sonata for Cello'', op. 28, one ''Sonata for Two Violins'', eight ''Po\u00e8mes'' for various instruments (one or two violins, violin and cello, string quartet) and orchestra (''Po\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9giaque'', ''Po\u00e8me de l'Extase'', ''Chant d'hiver'', ''Po\u00e8me nocturne'', among others), pieces for string orchestra without [[Double bass|basses]] (including ''Po\u00e8me de l'Exil''), two piano trios, a string quintet, and an [[opera]], ''Peter the Miner'', written near the end of his life in the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] language.\n\nYsa\u00ffe had been offered the post of music director of the [[New York Philharmonic]] in 1898, but declined it due to his busy solo performance schedule. In 1918, he accepted the music director's position with the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]], where he remained until 1922 and with which he made several recordings.\n\nFinally, in 1931, suffering from the extreme ravages of [[diabetes]] that had necessitated the amputation of his left foot, Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe died in his house in Brussels and was interred in the [[Ixelles Cemetery]] in [[Brussels]].\n\n==Performing career==\n[[File:Ysaye.jpg|thumb|Ysa\u00ffe with violin]]\n\nAs a performer, Ysa\u00ffe was compelling and highly original. [[Pablo Casals]] claimed never to have heard a violinist play in tune before Ysa\u00ffe, and [[Carl Flesch]] called him \"the most outstanding and individual violinist I have ever heard in my life.\"\n\nYsa\u00ffe possessed a large and flexible tone, influenced by a considerable variety of [[vibrato]] \u2014 from no vibrato at all to very intense. He said, \"Don't always vibrate, but always be vibrating\". His ''[[modus operandi]]'' was, in his own words: \"Nothing which wouldn't have for goal emotion, poetry, heart.\" The conductor Sir [[Henry Wood]] said, \"The quality of tone was ravishingly beautiful.... He seemed to get more colour out of a violin than any of his contemporaries.\"<ref name=wood>Sir Henry Wood, ''My Life of Music'' (Victor Gollancz 1938), pp171, 173.</ref>\n\nPossibly the most distinctive feature of Ysa\u00ffe's interpretations was his masterful [[rubato]]. Sir Henry Wood said, \"Whenever he stole time from one note, he faithfully paid it back within four bars\",<ref name=wood/> allowing his accompanist to maintain strict tempo under his free cantilena. Incidentally, this kind of rubato fits the description of [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s rubato.\n\nAlthough Ysa\u00ffe was a great interpreter of late Romantic and early modern composers \u2014 [[Max Bruch]], [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]], and [[C\u00e9sar Franck]], who said he was their greatest interpreter{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} \u2014 he was admired for his [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] interpretations. His technique was brilliant and finely honed, and in this respect he is the first modern violinist, whose technique was without the shortcomings of some earlier artists.\n\nAn international violin competition in Brussels was created in his memory: in 1951, this became the violin section of the [[Queen Elisabeth Music Competition]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:S\u00e9pulture Eugene Ysaye 01.jpg|thumb|<center>Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe's grave in Brussels ([[Ixelles Cemetery]])<ref>the text on the front side of the tomb stone reads: ''Monument \u00e9rig\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9 National Belge de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Auteurs Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique.''

His first marriage, on 28 September 1886 in Arlon, was to Louise Bourdau (from [[Dendermonde]]), with whom he had three sons and two daughters: Gabriel (1887\u20131961), Carry (1889\u20131930), Th\u00e9r\u00e8se called Th\u00e9sy (1890\u20131956), Antoine (1894\u20131979) and Th\u00e9odore (1898\u20131934). [[C\u00e9sar Franck]] presented his [[Violin Sonata (Franck)|Violin Sonata in A]] to them as a gift on the morning of the wedding, and after a hurried rehearsal Ysa\u00ffe performed the piece at the marriage celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/acc/ysaye.php|title=Classical Net \u2013 Composers \u2013 Ysa\u00ffe|work=Classical Net}}</ref> The sonata had its formal concert premiere in Brussels on 15 December 1886 with Franck in the audience.\n\nAfter Louise's death (9 February 1924) he married a pupil of his, Jeanette Dincin (1902\u20131967), 44 years his junior. She was a violinist who in her teens had studied with prominent teachers such as [[Franz Kneisel]], [[Leopold Auer]], and [[Otakar \u0160ev\u010d\u00edk]]. Ysa\u00ffe met her in 1922 while conductor of the Cincinnati Orchestra. She cared for him in his ailing years. Eugene's only request of her after he died was that she carry on her performances under his name.\n\nHis brother was [[pianist]] and composer [[Th\u00e9o Ysa\u00ffe]] (1865\u20131918), and his great-grandson is Marc Ysa\u00ffe, founder-controller of radio [[Classic 21]] and drummer of rock band [[Machiavel (band)|Machiavel]]. Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe was also close friends with [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876\u20131965)|Queen Elisabeth of Belgium]], whom he taught violin despite her lack of talent. His widow took over the royal teaching herself after his death, and the queen began the competition in his honor. His granddaughter, Nadine Ysaye Mosbaugh, was a noted concert pianist who toured Europe with Jose Iturbi before settling down in Canada. She also hosted and performed on a classical radio program on CKAR Radio in Huntsville, Ontario. Ysaye's great-grandson, Franc Mosbaugh, is a Canadian musician/singer and award-winning commercial jingle composer.\n\nYsa\u00ffe was also a friend of [[Claude Debussy]] and would sometimes correspond with him by letter.<ref>Weintraub, Stanley. 2001. ''Whistler: a biography'' (New York: Da Capo Press). {{ISBN|978-0-306-80971-2}}. p, 351</ref> The two had great respect for each other and Ysa\u00ffe was a significant supporter of the younger composer's early career.

Ysa\u00ffe, very ill with diabetes, listened to the performance from his hospital room. The Queen,  informed of the seriousness of Ysa\u00ffe's condition, had organised a radio broadcast of the work and Ysa\u00ffe addressed the audience from his room. The work was then performed in Brussels on 25 April. Ysa\u00ffe, transported on a stretcher to a box in the theater, was able to view the performance. He died 18 days later.\nThe critics were appreciative but the opera did not find a place in the standard repertoire. It was performed again by Op\u00e9ra Royal de Wallonie in Liege, 25 November 2006. This performance was recorded and is published by the non-profit association  [http://www.musiwall.ulg.ac.be/ \"Musique en Wallonie\"] under the reference MEW 0884 \u2013 0885 in a two CD set accompanied by a book containing the Walloon text and its French, Dutch and English translations, and introductory texts in French, Dutch, German and English.

Laurence Bruce was the half brother of [[Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney]]. Earl Robert was the recognized [[illegitimate]] son of [[James V]], King of Scotland, and Eupheme Elphinstone.\n\nAbout 1571 Laurence Bruce was appointed [[sheriff]] (the anglicised equivalent to the actual Norn-Scottish title of Foud or \"faud\", coming from the Norse term 'fogde', meaning approximately bailiff) of the [[Shetland Islands]] by Earl Robert. Accompanied by his nephew William Bruce of [[Crail]] (son of his full-brother Robert Bruce: although he may have been a son of Laurence) and other officials and armed men, Laurence Bruce moved to his new domain and set up his seat on the island of [[Unst]]. Once there he rapidly became unpopular due to his oppressive and corrupt rule. For example, it was alleged that he took bribes and that he had altered the official weights and measures to enhance the revenues of Earl Robert. His armed men felt free to seize control of ships and to billet themselves in the homes of the local people. Evidently Laurence Bruce helped himself to the local women, and is believed to have fathered approximately twenty-four illegitimate children beyond his ten legitimate children by his wives Helen Kennedy and Elizabeth Gray. Escalating conflict with the local Shetland Islanders resulted in a petition being sent to the royal court in [[Edinburgh]]. In response, a royal commission, the 'Mudy commission', travelled to Shetland and in February 1577 took evidence from 700 male Shetlanders. As a result, Laurence Bruce was removed from office. But by June of the following year, he had returned to the islands as \"sheriff-depute\".\n\nLaurence Bruce is best known as the builder of [[Muness Castle]], which was completed around 1598. Muness Castle, now a ruin, is the most northerly castle in [[Great Britain]]. It was built at the southeast end of [[Unst]], just east of the town of [[Uyeasound]], after Earl Robert was succeeded by his son [[Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney]] in 1593. Later events proved that Laurence Bruce had good reason to fear the aggression of Earl Patrick. In 1608 Earl Patrick sent a force to besiege the castle, but the attackers abandoned their assault. In 1610 Laurence Bruce testified against Earl Patrick before the [[Privy Council]] in Edinburgh. Following a rebellion in Orkney, in August 1614 the Privy Council appointed Laurence Bruce a Commissioner and charged him with apprehending any rebels who might seek shelter in Shetland.\n\nLaurence Bruce died at Muness castle in August 1617 and was buried inside the old church at nearby [[Sandwick, Shetland|Sandwick]]. Ownership of the castle passed to his second eldest son Andrew Bruce of Muness, a quieter and more popular man than his father. Laurence Bruce's eldest son, Alexander Bruce of Cultmalindie, returned to the mainland of Scotland to run the family's property in Perthshire.\n\nIllegitimate sons include Scipio Bruce of Meikleure. William Bruce of Symbister, his nephew (possible son) married Marjorie Stewart, a daughter of John Stewart (an illegitimate son of James V) and Jean Hepburn.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Clark, John, ''Genealogy, Records and Intermarriages of the Fordyce, Bruce & Clark Families at Uyeasound, Unst, Shetland, 2nd ed.''

In response, a royal commission, the 'Mudy commission', travelled to Shetland and in February 1577 took evidence from 700 male Shetlanders. As a result, Laurence Bruce was removed from office. But by June of the following year, he had returned to the islands as \"sheriff-depute\".\n\nLaurence Bruce is best known as the builder of [[Muness Castle]], which was completed around 1598. Muness Castle, now a ruin, is the most northerly castle in [[Great Britain]]. It was built at the southeast end of [[Unst]], just east of the town of [[Uyeasound]], after Earl Robert was succeeded by his son [[Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney]] in 1593. Later events proved that Laurence Bruce had good reason to fear the aggression of Earl Patrick. In 1608 Earl Patrick sent a force to besiege the castle, but the attackers abandoned their assault. In 1610 Laurence Bruce testified against Earl Patrick before the [[Privy Council]] in Edinburgh. Following a rebellion in Orkney, in August 1614 the Privy Council appointed Laurence Bruce a Commissioner and charged him with apprehending any rebels who might seek shelter in Shetland.\n\nLaurence Bruce died at Muness castle in August 1617 and was buried inside the old church at nearby [[Sandwick, Shetland|Sandwick]]. Ownership of the castle passed to his second eldest son Andrew Bruce of Muness, a quieter and more popular man than his father. Laurence Bruce's eldest son, Alexander Bruce of Cultmalindie, returned to the mainland of Scotland to run the family's property in Perthshire.\n\nIllegitimate sons include Scipio Bruce of Meikleure. William Bruce of Symbister, his nephew (possible son) married Marjorie Stewart, a daughter of John Stewart (an illegitimate son of James V) and Jean Hepburn.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Clark, John, ''Genealogy, Records and Intermarriages of the Fordyce, Bruce & Clark Families at Uyeasound, Unst, Shetland, 2nd ed.''

As early as 1870 [[Claude Marie Dubuis]], the second bishop of the [[Diocese of Galveston]] (which diocese encompassed all of Texas at that time), had begun sending Father Vincent Perrier twice a year to visit [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. At that time several Catholic families were meeting in the Carrico home. Fort Worth's first parish church was a frame structure built at 1212 Throckmorton Street and called St. Stanislaus Church. It stood until 1907. The cornerstone of St. Patrick's Church, which eventually became [[St. Patrick Cathedral in Fort Worth|St. Patrick Cathedral]], was laid in 1888; the church was built just north of St. Stanislaus Church and dedicated in 1892. When Dallas was made a diocese the region that eventually became the Diocese of Fort Worth had seven parishes &ndash; Fort Worth, [[Cleburne, Texas|Cleburne]], [[Gainesville, Texas|Gainesville]], [[Henrietta, Texas|Henrietta]], [[Hillsboro, Texas|Hillsboro]], [[Muenster, Texas|Muenster]], and [[Weatherford, Texas|Weatherford]].\n\nThe decade of the 1870s witnessed the earliest Catholic education in the area. In 1879 Father Thomas Loughrey, pastor of St. Stanislaus Church, opened a boys' school that operated in the church until 1907. In 1885 the Sisters of Saint Mary of Namur established Saint Ignatius Academy in Fort Worth and Xavier Academy in [[Denison, Texas|Denison]]. In 1910 the same [[religious institute]] founded Fort Worth's first Catholic college, [[Our Lady of Victory College]]. Other Catholic schools opened in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]] (1874) Weatherford (1880), Muenster (1890 and 1895), Gainesville (1892), [[Pilot Point, Texas|Pilot Point]] (1893), and Cleburne (1896). St. Joseph's Infirmary (now St. Joseph's Hospital) opened in 1885 in Fort Worth.[[File:St Joseph Infirmary.jpg|thumb|Firemen in front of St Joseph Infirmary]]\n\nIn 1953 [[Pope Pius XII]] changed the name of the Diocese of Dallas to Diocese of Dallas&ndash;Fort Worth, and Saint Patrick's Church in Fort Worth was elevated to the status of a co-cathedral. In 1985 St. Patrick Cathedral, St. Ignatius Church, and the St. Ignatius rectory were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nOn August 22, 1969, [[Pope Paul VI]] separated 28 counties of north central Texas from the Catholic Diocese of Dallas&ndash;Fort Worth to form the Diocese of Fort Worth (the remaining territory went back to the \"Diocese of Dallas\" designation). Two months later, on October 21, Bishop John J. Cassata, a native of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], was installed in St. Patrick Cathedral as Fort Worth's first ordinary. From 1969, when the Diocese of Fort Worth was established, to 1986 the Catholic population increased from 67,000 to 120,000. Meanwhile, in 1981 Bishop Cassata retired, and [[Pope John Paul II]] named as his successor a native of [[Massachusetts]] who had previously worked in [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], Bishop Joseph P. Delaney.\n\nUnder Bishop Delaney the diocese continued to mature. In 1986, it had fourteen primary schools, three secondary schools, the Cassata Learning Center (dedicated in 1975 as an institution offering nontraditional, personalized instruction to the underprivileged of Fort Worth), and a new Catholic Center. The center, a {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} edifice, brought together under one roof all of the pastoral and administrative offices of the diocese. Guided by Bishop Delaney, the diocese continued to underscore the principles of the [[Second Vatican Council]], especially a commitment to the poor, to [[ecumenism]], and to an increased role in the church for the laity. In May 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] appointed Msgr. Kevin Vann as coadjutor bishop. A coadjutor bishop has right of succession upon the death or retirement of a bishop. On July 12, 2005, Bishop Delaney was found dead at his home, apparently passing away in his sleep. On July 13, 2005, Kevin Vann was ordained bishop as previously scheduled and, because of Bishop Delaney's death, immediately assumed the cathedra of the Diocese.\n\nBishop Vann was installed as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange|Bishop of Orange]] on December 10, 2012.\n\nOn November 19, 2013, [[Pope Francis]] named Msgr. Michael F. Olson as the fourth bishop of Fort Worth. He was ordained and installed on January 29, 2014.\n\n==Bishops==\n===Bishops of Fort Worth===\nList of bishops and their tenures of service:\n# [[John Joseph Cassata]] (1969&ndash;1980)\n# [[Joseph

At present, the diocese has more than 1 million Catholics in 90 parishes and missions, served by 123 priests, 110 deacons, 24 sisters, and 5 brothers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fwdioc.org/about/Pages/statistics.aspx|title=Roman Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth - Statistics|accessdate=March 30, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404123139/http://www.fwdioc.org/about/Pages/statistics.aspx|archivedate=April 4, 2011}}</ref>  It is made up of 28 counties of [[North Texas|North Central Texas]]: [[Archer County, Texas|Archer]], [[Baylor County, Texas|Baylor]], [[Bosque County, Texas|Bosque]], [[Clay County, Texas|Clay]], [[Comanche County, Texas|Comanche]], [[Cooke County, Texas|Cooke]], [[Denton County, Texas|Denton]], [[Eastland County, Texas|Eastland]], [[Erath County, Texas|Erath]], [[Foard County, Texas|Foard]], [[Hardeman County, Texas|Hardeman]], [[Hill County, Texas|Hill]], [[Hood County, Texas|Hood]], [[Jack County, Texas|Jack]], [[Johnson County, Texas|Johnson]], [[Knox County, Texas|Knox]], [[Montague County, Texas|Montague]], [[Palo Pinto County, Texas|Palo Pinto]], [[Parker County, Texas|Parker]], [[Shackelford County, Texas|Shackelford]], [[Somervell County, Texas|Somervell]], [[Stephens County, Texas|Stephens]], [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]], [[Throckmorton County, Texas|Throckmorton]], [[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita]], [[Wilbarger County, Texas|Wilbarger]], [[Wise County, Texas|Wise]], and [[Young County, Texas|Young]] with a total of 23,950&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1890 the Catholic population of the area of the [[Brazos River|Brazos]] and [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity]] rivers had grown large enough that [[Pope Leo XIII]] established the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas|Diocese of Dallas]]. As early as 1870 [[Claude Marie Dubuis]], the second bishop of the [[Diocese of Galveston]] (which diocese encompassed all of Texas at that time), had begun sending Father Vincent Perrier twice a year to visit [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. At that time several Catholic families were meeting in the Carrico home. Fort Worth's first parish church was a frame structure built at 1212 Throckmorton Street and called St. Stanislaus Church. It stood until 1907. The cornerstone of St. Patrick's Church, which eventually became [[St. Patrick Cathedral in Fort Worth|St. Patrick Cathedral]], was laid in 1888; the church was built just north of St. Stanislaus Church and dedicated in 1892. When Dallas was made a diocese the region that eventually became the Diocese of Fort Worth had seven parishes &ndash; Fort Worth, [[Cleburne, Texas|Cleburne]], [[Gainesville, Texas|Gainesville]], [[Henrietta, Texas|Henrietta]], [[Hillsboro, Texas|Hillsboro]], [[Muenster, Texas|Muenster]], and [[Weatherford, Texas|Weatherford]].\n\nThe decade of the 1870s witnessed the earliest Catholic education in the area. In 1879 Father Thomas Loughrey, pastor of St. Stanislaus Church, opened a boys' school that operated in the church until 1907. In 1885 the Sisters of Saint Mary of Namur established Saint Ignatius Academy in Fort Worth and Xavier Academy in [[Denison, Texas|Denison]]. In 1910 the same [[religious institute]] founded Fort Worth's first Catholic college, [[Our Lady of Victory College]]. Other Catholic schools opened in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]] (1874) Weatherford (1880), Muenster (1890 and 1895), Gainesville (1892), [[Pilot Point, Texas|Pilot Point]] (1893), and Cleburne (1896). St. Joseph's Infirmary (now St. Joseph's Hospital) opened in 1885 in Fort Worth.[[File:St Joseph Infirmary.jpg|thumb|Firemen in front of St Joseph Infirmary]]\n\nIn 1953 [[Pope Pius XII]] changed the name of the Diocese of Dallas to Diocese of Dallas&ndash;Fort Worth, and Saint Patrick's Church in Fort Worth was elevated to the status of a co-cathedral. In 1985 St. Patrick Cathedral, St. Ignatius Church, and the St. Ignatius rectory were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nOn August 22, 1969, [[Pope Paul VI]] separated 28 counties of north central Texas from the Catholic Diocese of Dallas&ndash;Fort Worth to form the Diocese of Fort Worth (the remaining territory went back to the \"Diocese of Dallas\" designation). Two months later, on October 21, Bishop John J. Cassata, a native of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], was installed in St. Patrick Cathedral as Fort Worth's first ordinary. From 1969, when the Diocese of Fort Worth was established, to 1986 the Catholic population increased from 67,000 to 120,000. Meanwhile, in 1981 Bishop Cassata retired, and [[Pope John Paul II]] named as his successor a native of [[Massachusetts]] who had previously worked in [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]], Bishop Joseph P. Delaney.\n\nUnder Bishop Delaney the diocese continued to mature. In 1986, it had fourteen primary schools, three secondary schools, the Cassata Learning Center (dedicated in 1975 as an institution offering nontraditional, personalized instruction to the underprivileged of Fort Worth), and a new Catholic Center. The center, a {{convert|20000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} edifice, brought together under one roof all of the pastoral and administrative offices of the diocese. Guided by Bishop Delaney, the diocese continued to underscore the principles of the [[Second Vatican Council]], especially a commitment to the poor, to [[ecumenism]], and to an increased role in the church for the laity. In May 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] appointed Msgr. Kevin Vann as coadjutor bishop. A coadjutor bishop has right of succession upon the death or retirement of a bishop. On July 12, 2005, Bishop Delaney was found dead at his home, apparently passing away in his sleep. On July 13, 2005, Kevin Vann was ordained bishop as previously scheduled and, because of Bishop Delaney's death, immediately assumed the cathedra of the Diocese.\n\nBishop Vann was installed as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange|Bishop of Orange]] on December 10, 2012.\n\nOn November 19, 2013, [[Pope Francis]] named Msgr. Michael F. Olson as the fourth bishop of Fort Worth. He was ordained and installed on January 29, 2014.\n\n==Bishops==\n===Bishops of Fort Worth===\nList of bishops and their tenures of service:\n# [[John Joseph Cassata]] (1969&ndash;1980)\n# [[Joseph

The bite appears to have vanished and when Katrina takes Clara to the hospital, it seems that everything is fine.\n\nThe doctor suggests it was just a hallucination. A mysterious man visits Katrina at the hospital to talk about her \"payment\" for Clara's recovery, declaring her soul was spared and must be repaid; the only conditions being that the soul Katrina takes must be human, and it must be paid on time. He gives her until sunset to repay the debt, otherwise Clara will die from the rattlesnake bite. Katrina doesn't initially believe it, but when she goes back to the desert road, the trailer has disappeared and she sees a trucker with a missing eye, warning that Clara is going to die.\n\nKatrina discovers that the city of Tulia, Texas where she's ended up has been linked to a series of brutal murders and mysterious disappearances. Any time there's a photo or video of the crime scene, there's a mysterious shadowy figure in the background.\n\nThe guy who visited her at the hospital is actually a lawyer who was fatally stabbed by a school teacher with the teacher saying \"a soul for a soul\" as he stabbed the lawyer, while a creepy kid who spooks Katrina actually went missing back in 2010. After an aborted attempt to kill a dying old man in the hospital, Katrina sets her sights on Billy, an abusive boyfriend she sees criticising his girlfriend in a bar.\n\nShe breaks into their home and forces Billy to drive to a remote canyon in the desert. Before Katrina can kill him, though, he fights back and runs away. With time running out before sunset, Katrina prepares to kill herself, but as she films a goodbye message to Clara, Billy hits her with a rock and she blacks out.\n\nShe wakes up just in time and when Billy is bitten by a rattlesnake, Katrina takes the opportunity to kill him to save her daughter. As she's watched over by mysterious figures on top of the canyon, Katrina leaves the canyon and on the way home, the doctor calls to say Clara is fine.\n\nWhen Katrina reunites with her daughter, she sees that Clara has drawn a picture of the mysterious figure and the sun, seemingly aware of what her mother had to do.\nAnd when the pair get back on the road, Clara spots a hitchhiker by the road, who Katrina sees is actually Billy.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Carmen Ejogo]] as Katrina Ridgeway\n* [[Theo Rossi]] as Billy\n* [[Emma Greenwell]] as Abbie\n* Richard Lippert as Dying Man\n* [[David Yow]] as Charlie\n* Joy Jacobson as Loraine\n* Arianna Ortiz as Francine\n* Catherine Haun as Loraine's Sister\n* Debrianna Mansini as The Woman\n* Sean Dillingham as Dr. Hayes\n* [[Stephanie Hill]] as Neighbor\n* Jenna Doolittle as Female Nurse\n* Alexandra Nell as Hiker\n* Melissa Chambers as Disheveled Woman\n* [[Tim Stafford]] as Male Nurse\n* Apollonia Pratt as Clara\n*Bruce Davis as The Suit/ Donald Covington\n\n== Critical response ==\nReview aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a 28% approval rating, based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 4.47/10.<ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Rattlesnake (2019)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rattlesnake|work=Rotten Tomatoes|volume=|pages=|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}} R</ref>\n\nReviewing the film for [[RogerEbert.com]], Brian Tallerico praised the \"game performance from the always-good Carmen Ejogo\", but felt that the film's \"biggest issue is the pacing\" and director Zak Hilditch's failure to \"find the tension to keep his story moving.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rattlesnake-movie-review-2019|title=Rattlesnake movie review & film summary (2019) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Tallerico|first=Brian|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Benjamin Lee described the \"undeniably talented\" Ejogo as \"adrift\", Hilditch's direction as \"bland\", and the film overall as \"strangely boring\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lee|first=Benjamin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/25/rattlesnake-review-netflix-carmen-ejogo|title=Rattlesnake review \u2013 disposable supernatural Netflix thriller lacks bite|date=2019-10-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Netflix title|81018455}}\n* {{IMDb title|9257484}}\n\n[[Category:2019 films]]\n[[Category:2010s drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Netflix original films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Crime, drama, mystery film}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Rattlesnake\n| image          = Rattlesnake (2019) Film Poster.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = [[Film poster]]\n| director       = {{ubl|[[Zak Hilditch]]}}\n| producer       =\n| writer         = {{ubl|[[Zak Hilditch]]}}\n| starring       = {{ubl|[[Carmen Ejogo]]|[[Theo Rossi]]|[[Emma Greenwell]]}}\n| screenplay     = \n| story          = \n| based on       = \n| narrator       = \n| music          = \n| cinematography = \n| editing        = \n| studio         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Campfire]]\n* [[Netflix]]\n}}\n| distributor    = [[Netflix]]\n| released       = {{Film date|2019|10|25}}\n| runtime        = 85 minutes\n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n'''''Rattlesnake''''' is a [[crime (genre)|crime]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] [[mystery (genre)|mystery]] film written and directed by [[Zak Hilditch]] and starring [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Theo Rossi]] and [[Emma Greenwell]].
