While studying at the conservatory, Russell repeatedly clashed with [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning serialist composer and instructor [[Charles Wuorinen]], who disparaged the composition \"City Park\" (a minimalist, non-narrative suite incorporating readings from the works of [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]) as \"the most unattractive thing I've ever heard\".<ref name=\"lawrence2\">{{citation |url=http://www.timlawrence.info/articles/2007/arthurrussellliminalities.php |title=Arthur Russell and Rhizomatic Musicianship |first=Tim |last=Lawrence |accessdate=December 31, 2008 |periodical=Liminalities |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110030819/http://www.timlawrence.info/articles/2007/arthurrussellliminalities.php |archivedate=January 10, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEmbittered by his experience, Russell briefly considered transferring to [[Dartmouth College]] at the behest of experimental composer [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], whom he had sought out and befriended upon arriving in the Northeast. But after a chance meeting at a Wolff concert in Manhattan, he became close with [[Rhys Chatham]], who arranged for Russell to succeed him as music director of [[The Kitchen]], a downtown avant-garde performance space. As a result, he abandoned his studies and remained in New York.<ref name=\"lawrence2\"/> Russell and Chatham later briefly roomed together in a sixth-story walkup apartment at 437 East 12th Street in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]; Ginsberg (who maintained his primary residence in the building from 1975 to 1996 and helped Russell secure the apartment) supplied electricity to the impoverished composers through an extension cord. Russell resided in the apartment for the rest of his life. During his tenure at The Kitchen (from the autumn of 1974 to the summer of 1975), he greatly expanded the breadth and purview of the venue's offerings, crafting a program that \"support[ed] other local and relatively low profile composers rather than... accentuat[ing] the work of composers who were beginning to acquire an international reputation.\" This approach elicited controversy when Russell booked Boston-based [[proto-punk]] band [[The Modern Lovers]] for an engagement at the venue, widely regarded as a leading bastion of [[minimalist music|minimalism]]. Russell's booking of Fluxus stalwart [[Henry Flynt]]'s \"punkabilly\" ensemble Nova'billy, concluding his season as director, was likewise unsettling to the avant-garde establishment. According to biographer Tim Lawrence, \"the decision to program the Modern Lovers and [[Talking Heads]] was Russell\u2019s way of demonstrating that minimalism could be found outside of compositional music, as well as his belief that pop music could be arty, energetic and fun at the same time.\" <ref name=\"lawrence2\"/>\n\nFrom 1975 to 1979, Russell was a member of The Flying Hearts, recorded by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], which consisted of Russell (keyboards/vocals), ex-[[Modern Lovers]] member Ernie Brooks<ref name=\"PitchWorld\" /> (bass/vocals), Larry Saltzman (guitar), and [[David Van Tieghem]] (drums, vocals); a later incarnation in the 1980s included Joyce Bowden (vocals) and Jesse Chamberlain (drums). This ensemble was frequently augmented in live and studio performances by the likes of Chatham, [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], Jon Gibson, [[Peter Gordon (composer)|Peter Gordon]], [[Jerry Harrison]], [[Garrett List]] (who succeeded Russell as musical director of The Kitchen), [[Andy Paley]], Lenny Pickett and [[Peter Zummo]]. During the same period, various permutations of this ensemble, together with Glenn Iamaro, Bill Ruyle and Jon Sholle, performed & recorded excerpts from ''Instrumentals'', a 48-hour-long orchestral work that constituted Russell's first major work in the idiom. Selections from the ''Instrumentals'' sessions were eventually collected on an eponymously titled album, released by Belgian label Disques du Crepuscule in 1984. The collaboration among Russell (once again as a keyboardist), Brooks, and Chamberlain extended into The Necessaries, a [[power pop]] quartet fronted by guitarist Ed Tomney. Their lone 1981 album on [[Sire Records]] (initially released as ''Big Sky'' before being tweaked and re-released as ''Event Horizon'') featured few songwriting contributions from Russell, who abruptly left the band at the approach to the [[Holland Tunnel]] before an important concert in Washington, D.C.\n\n===1976\u20131980: Discovery of disco and early singles===\nAround 1976, Russell became a habitue of New York's nascent underground disco scene, namely [[Nicky Siano]]'s Gallery on Houston Street in [[SoHo]]. In a 2007 interview with ''Wax Poetics'' magazine, Siano downplayed the popular myth that Russell's interest in the genre solidified over the course of a single night, noting that \"Louis [Aquilone, Siano's best friend and Russell's then-lover] was at the Gallery every single Saturday night.

The song's main hook was [[Interpolation (music)|interpolated]] by [[Desmond Child]] (who was acquainted with Russell via Larry Salzman) on his minor 1979 hit \"Our Love Is Insane,\" leading Russell to accuse the musician of infringement among his friends.

While studying at the conservatory, Russell repeatedly clashed with [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning serialist composer and instructor [[Charles Wuorinen]], who disparaged the composition \"City Park\" (a minimalist, non-narrative suite incorporating readings from the works of [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]) as \"the most unattractive thing I've ever heard\".<ref name=\"lawrence2\">{{citation |url=http://www.timlawrence.info/articles/2007/arthurrussellliminalities.php |title=Arthur Russell and Rhizomatic Musicianship |first=Tim |last=Lawrence |accessdate=December 31, 2008 |periodical=Liminalities |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110030819/http://www.timlawrence.info/articles/2007/arthurrussellliminalities.php |archivedate=January 10, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEmbittered by his experience, Russell briefly considered transferring to [[Dartmouth College]] at the behest of experimental composer [[Christian Wolff (composer)|Christian Wolff]], whom he had sought out and befriended upon arriving in the Northeast. But after a chance meeting at a Wolff concert in Manhattan, he became close with [[Rhys Chatham]], who arranged for Russell to succeed him as music director of [[The Kitchen]], a downtown avant-garde performance space. As a result, he abandoned his studies and remained in New York.<ref name=\"lawrence2\"/> Russell and Chatham later briefly roomed together in a sixth-story walkup apartment at 437 East 12th Street in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]; Ginsberg (who maintained his primary residence in the building from 1975 to 1996 and helped Russell secure the apartment) supplied electricity to the impoverished composers through an extension cord. Russell resided in the apartment for the rest of his life. During his tenure at The Kitchen (from the autumn of 1974 to the summer of 1975), he greatly expanded the breadth and purview of the venue's offerings, crafting a program that \"support[ed] other local and relatively low profile composers rather than... accentuat[ing] the work of composers who were beginning to acquire an international reputation.\" This approach elicited controversy when Russell booked Boston-based [[proto-punk]] band [[The Modern Lovers]] for an engagement at the venue, widely regarded as a leading bastion of [[minimalist music|minimalism]]. Russell's booking of Fluxus stalwart [[Henry Flynt]]'s \"punkabilly\" ensemble Nova'billy, concluding his season as director, was likewise unsettling to the avant-garde establishment. According to biographer Tim Lawrence, \"the decision to program the Modern Lovers and [[Talking Heads]] was Russell\u2019s way of demonstrating that minimalism could be found outside of compositional music, as well as his belief that pop music could be arty, energetic and fun at the same time.\" <ref name=\"lawrence2\"/>\n\nFrom 1975 to 1979, Russell was a member of The Flying Hearts, recorded by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]], which consisted of Russell (keyboards/vocals), ex-[[Modern Lovers]] member Ernie Brooks<ref name=\"PitchWorld\" /> (bass/vocals), Larry Saltzman (guitar), and [[David Van Tieghem]] (drums, vocals); a later incarnation in the 1980s included Joyce Bowden (vocals) and Jesse Chamberlain (drums). This ensemble was frequently augmented in live and studio performances by the likes of Chatham, [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], Jon Gibson, [[Peter Gordon (composer)|Peter Gordon]], [[Jerry Harrison]], [[Garrett List]] (who succeeded Russell as musical director of The Kitchen), [[Andy Paley]], Lenny Pickett and [[Peter Zummo]]. During the same period, various permutations of this ensemble, together with Glenn Iamaro, Bill Ruyle and Jon Sholle, performed & recorded excerpts from ''Instrumentals'', a 48-hour-long orchestral work that constituted Russell's first major work in the idiom. Selections from the ''Instrumentals'' sessions were eventually collected on an eponymously titled album, released by Belgian label Disques du Crepuscule in 1984. The collaboration among Russell (once again as a keyboardist), Brooks, and Chamberlain extended into The Necessaries, a [[power pop]] quartet fronted by guitarist Ed Tomney. Their lone 1981 album on [[Sire Records]] (initially released as ''Big Sky'' before being tweaked and re-released as ''Event Horizon'') featured few songwriting contributions from Russell, who abruptly left the band at the approach to the [[Holland Tunnel]] before an important concert in Washington, D.C.\n\n===1976\u20131980: Discovery of disco and early singles===\nAround 1976, Russell became a habitue of New York's nascent underground disco scene, namely [[Nicky Siano]]'s Gallery on Houston Street in [[SoHo]]. In a 2007 interview with ''Wax Poetics'' magazine, Siano downplayed the popular myth that Russell's interest in the genre solidified over the course of a single night, noting that \"Louis [Aquilone, Siano's best friend and Russell's then-lover] was at the Gallery every single Saturday night.

The song's main hook was [[Interpolation (music)|interpolated]] by [[Desmond Child]] (who was acquainted with Russell via Larry Salzman) on his minor 1979 hit \"Our Love Is Insane,\" leading Russell to accuse the musician of infringement among his friends.

In fact, in a colloquial or non-academic or non-linguist context, \u201cNeapolitan language\u201d, ''napulitano'', or ''napoletano'' generally refers specifically to the [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the language spoken in [[Naples]] and the surrounding area; however, this variety is usually [[mutually intelligible]] with other related \u201cNeapolitan language\u201d varieties throughout Southern Italy.{{Citation needed |date=November 2019}}\n\n== Distribution ==\n[[File:WIKITONGUES- Foffo speaking Neapolitan.webm|thumb|A young man speaking Neapolitan.]]\nThe Neapolitan dialects are distributed throughout most of continental [[southern Italy]], historically united during the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], specifically southern [[Lazio]] ([[Gaeta]] and [[Sora, Lazio|Sora]] districts), southern [[Marche]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Basilicata]], [[Campania]] (Naples), northern and central [[Apulia]], and northernmost [[Calabria]]. The dialects are part of a varied [[dialect continuum]], so the varieties in southern Lazio, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia, Lucania and Calabria can typically be recognizable as regional groups of dialects. In western Abruzzo and Lazio the dialects give way to [[Central Italian]] dialects such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. In central Calabria and southern Apulia, the dialects give way to the [[Sicilian language]]. Largely due to massive southern Italian migration in the late 19th century and early 20th century, there are also numbers of speakers in [[Italian diaspora]] communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]]. However, in the [[United States]] traditional Neapolitan has had considerable contact with English, and is significantly different from contemporary Neapolitan spoken in [[Naples]]. English words are often used in place of Neapolitan words, especially among second-generation speakers. On the other hand, the effect on Neapolitan in Italy has been similar due to displacement by [[Italian language|Standard Italian]].\n\nThe following dialects constitute Neapolitan; numbers refer to the map:<ref>''[http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/mappe/flash/regionalok.htm Carta dei Dialetti d'Italia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003072247/http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/mappe/flash/regionalok.htm |date=3 October 2012 }}'' (Mapping of dialects of Italy) by Giovan Battista Pellegrini, 1977 (in [[Italian language|Italian]])</ref>\n\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman\n|Abruzzese and Southern Marchigiano:\n:Ia.

[http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ital1286 \"Italo-Dalmatian\" Glottolog 2.3]. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.</ref> There are notable differences among the various dialects, but they are all generally mutually intelligible.\n\n[[Italian language|Italian]] and Neapolitan are of variable mutual comprehensibility, depending on factors that are both affective and linguistic. There are notable grammatical differences, such as Neapolitan having nouns in the neuter form and a unique plural formation as well as historical phonological developments, which often obscure the cognacy of lexical items.\n\nIts evolution has been similar to that of Italian and other Romance languages from their roots in [[Vulgar Latin]]. It may reflect a pre-Latin [[Oscan language|Oscan]] [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]], as in the pronunciation of the ''d'' sound as an ''r'' sound ([[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]) at the beginning of a word or between two vowels: e.g. ''doje'' (feminine) or ''duje'' (masculine), meaning \"two\", is pronounced, and often spelled, as ''roje''/''ruje''; ''ved\u00e9'' (\"to see\") as ''ver\u00e9'', and often spelled so; also ''cad\u00e9''/''car\u00e9'' (\"to fall\") and ''[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]]''/''Maronna''). Another purported Oscan influence is the historical assimilation of the consonant cluster {{IPA|/nd/}} as {{IPA|/nn/}}, pronounced {{IPA|[n\u02d0]}} (this is generally reflected in spelling more consistently: {{wiktnap|munno}} vs Italian {{wiktita|mondo}} \"world\"; {{wiktnap|quanno}} vs \nItalian {{wiktita|quando}} \"when\"), along with the development of {{IPA|/mb/}} as {{IPA|/mm/}}~{{IPA|[m\u02d0]}} ({{wiktnap|tammuro}} vs Italian {{wiktit|tamburo}} \"drum\"), also consistently reflected in spelling. Other effects of the Oscan [[substratum]] are postulated, but substratum claims are highly controversial. As in many other languages in the [[Italian Peninsula]], Neapolitan has an [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstratum]] greatly influenced by other [[Romance languages]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Franco-Proven\u00e7al]] above all), [[Germanic languages]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (both ancient and modern) and [[Arabic]]. The language had never been standardised, and the word for ''tree'' has three different spellings: {{wiktnap|arbero}}, {{wiktnap|arvero}} and {{wiktnap|\u00e0varo}}.\n\nNeapolitan has enjoyed a rich literary, [[Neapolitan music|musical]] and theatrical history (notably [[Giambattista Basile]], [[Eduardo De Filippo]], [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] and [[Tot\u00f2]]). Thanks to this heritage and the musical work of [[Renato Carosone]] in the 1950s, Neapolitan is still in use in popular music, even gaining national popularity in the songs of [[Pino Daniele]] and the [[Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare]].\n\nThe language has no official status within Italy and is not taught in schools. The [[University of Naples Federico II]] offers (from 2003) courses in Campanian Dialectology at the faculty of Sociology, whose actual aim is not teaching students to speak the language, but studying its history, usage, literature and social role. There are also ongoing legislative attempts at the national level to have it recognized as an official [[minority language]] of Italy. It is however a recognized [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 639 Joint Advisory Committee language with the language code of ''nap''.\n\nHere is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] pronunciation of the Neapolitan spoken in the city of Naples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Much like [[Italian orthography]], it does not contain ''k,'' ''w,'' ''x,'' or ''y'' even though these letters might be found in some foreign words; unlike traditional Italian, it does contain the letter ''j''. The English pronunciation guidelines that follow are based on [[General American]] pronunciation and the values used may not be applicable to other dialects. (See also: [[International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects]].)\n\nAll Romance languages are closely related. Although Neapolitan shares a high degree of its vocabulary with Italian, the official language of Italy, differences in pronunciation often make the connection unrecognizable to those without knowledge of Neapolitan. The most striking phonological difference is the Neapolitan weakening of unstressed vowels into [[schwa]] (''schwa'' is pronounced like the ''a'' in ''about'' or the ''u'' in ''upon''). However it is also possible (and quite common for some Neapolitans) to speak standard Italian with a \"Neapolitan accent\"; that is, by pronouncing un-stressed vowels as schwa but by otherwise using only entirely standard words and grammatical forms. This is not Neapolitan proper, but a mere difference in Italian pronunciation.\n\nTherefore, while pronunciation presents the strongest barrier to comprehension, the grammar of Neapolitan is what sets it apart from Italian. In Neapolitan, for example, the gender and number of a word is expressed by a change in the accented vowel, whereas in Italian it is expressed by a change in the final vowel (e.g. ''l'''uo'''ngo'' {{IPA-nap|\u02c8lwo\u014b\u0261\u0259|}}, ''l'''o'''nga'' {{IPA-nap|\u02c8lo\u014b\u0261\u0259|}}; Italian ''lung'''o''''', ''lung'''a'''''; masc. \"long\", fem. \"long\"). These and other morpho-syntactic differences distinguish the Neapolitan language from the Italian language and the Neapolitan accent.\n\nNeapolitan has had a significant influence on the intonation of [[Rioplatense Spanish]], of the [[Buenos Aires]] region of [[Argentina]], and the whole of [[Uruguay]].<ref>Colantoni, Laura, and Jorge Gurlekian.[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=43F6CF4CEB6223AA2ED40C7926999F70.tomcat1?fromPage=online&aid=236145 \"Convergence and intonation: historical evidence from Buenos Aires Spanish\"], ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'', Volume 7, Issue 02, August 2004, pp. 107\u2013119, Cambridge Journals Online</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nWhile there are only five graphic vowels in Neapolitan, phonemically, there are eight.  Stressed vowels ''e'' and ''o'' can be either \"[[Close vowel|closed]]\" or \"[[Open vowel|open]]\" and the pronunciation is different for the two.  The grave accent (''\u00e0'', ''\u00e8'', ''\u00f2'') is used to denote open vowels, and the acute accent (''\u00e9'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00fa'') is used to denote closed vowels, with alternative ''\u00ec'' and ''\u00f9''.  However, accent marks are not commonly used in the actual spelling of words except when they occur on the final syllable of a word, such as ''Tot\u00f2'', ''arriv\u00e0'', or ''pecch\u00e9'' and when they appear here in other positions it is only to demonstrate where the stress, or accent, falls in some words. Also, the [[circumflex]] is used to mark a long vowel where it wouldn't normally occur (e.g. ''s\u00ee'' \"you are\").\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Letter\n!

Modern Neapolitan uses, almost entirely, shortened forms of these articles which are:\n\nBefore a word beginning with a consonant:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| '''Masculine'''\n| ''\u2019o''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | ''\u2019e''\n|-\n| '''Feminine'''\n| ''\u2019a''\n|-\n| '''Neuter'''\n| ''\u2019o''\n| \u2013\n|}\n\nThese definite articles are always pronounced distinctly.\n\nBefore a word beginning with a vowel, ''l\u2019'' or ''ll\u2019'' are used \nfor both masculine and feminine, for both singular and plural. Although both forms can be found, the ''ll\u2019'' form is by far the most common.\n\nIt is well to note that in Neapolitan the [[Grammatical gender|gender]] of a noun is not easily determined by the article, so other means must be used.  In the case of ''\u2019o'' which can be either masculine singular or neuter singular (there is no neuter plural in Neapolitan), when it is neuter the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, the name of a language in Neapolitan is always neuter, so if we see ''\u2019o nnapulitano'' we know it refers to the Neapolitan language, whereas ''\u2019o napulitano'' would refer to a Neapolitan man.\n\nLikewise, since ''\u2019e'' can be either masculine plural or feminine plural, when it is feminine plural, the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, consider ''\u2019a lista'' which in Neapolitan is feminine singular for \"list.\"  In the plural it becomes ''\u2019e lliste''.\n\nThere can also be problems with nouns whose singular form ends in ''e''.  Since plural nouns usually end in ''e'' whether masculine or feminine, the masculine plural is often formed by orthographically changing the spelling.  As an example, consider the word ''guaglione'' (which means \"boy\", or \"girl\" in the feminine form):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| '''Masculine'''\n| ''\u2019o guaglione''\n| ''\u2019e guagliune''\n|-\n| '''Feminine'''\n| ''\u2019a guagliona''\n| ''\u2019e gguaglione''\n|}\n\nMore will be said about these orthographically changing nouns in the section on Neapolitan nouns.\n\nA couple of notes about consonant doubling:\n\n*Doubling is a function of the article (and certain other words), and these same words may be seen in other contexts without the consonant doubled.  More will be said about this in the section on consonant doubling.\n*Doubling only occurs when the consonant is followed by a vowel.  If it is followed by another consonant, such as in the word ''spagnuolo (Spanish)'', no doubling occurs.\n\n=== Indefinite articles ===\nThe Neapolitan indefinite articles, corresponding to the English ''a'' or ''an'', are presented in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n|-\n| '''Before words beginning with a consonant'''\n| ''nu''\n| ''na''\n|-\n| '''Before words beginning with a vowel'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | ''n\u2019''\n|}\n\n=== Verbal conjugation ===\nIn Neapolitan there are four finite moods: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]], and three non-finite modes: [[infinitive]], [[gerund]] and [[participle]]. Each mood has an [[active voice|active]] and a [[passive voice|passive]] form. The only auxiliary verbs used in the active form is {{wiktnap|av\u00e9|(h)av\u00e9}} (Eng. \"to have\", It. ''avere''), which contrasts with Italian in which the intransitive and reflexive verbs take ''\u00e8ssere'' for their auxiliary. For example, we have:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Nap. || Aggio stato a Nnapule ajere. || AUX-HAVE-1st-SING-PRES \"be\"-PART-PAST \"in\"-PREP \"Naples\"-NOUN \"yesterday\"-ADVERB\n|-\n| It. || Sono stato a Napoli ieri. || AUX-BE-1st-SING-PRES \"be\"-PART-PAST \"in\"-PREP \"Naples\"-NOUN \"yesterday\"-ADVERB\n|-\n| Eng. || I was in Naples yesterday.\n|}\n\n=== Doubled initial consonants ===\nIn Neapolitan, many times the initial consonant of a word is doubled.  This is called ''[[raddoppiamento sintattico]]'' in Italian as it also applies to the [[Italian phonology]].\n* All feminine plural nouns, when preceded by the feminine plural definite article, ''\u2019e'', or by any feminine plural adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.\n* All neuter singular nouns, when preceded by the neuter singular definite article, ''\u2019o'', or by a neuter singular adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.\n* In addition, other words also trigger this doubling. Below is a list of words that trigger the doubling of the initial consonant of the word that follows.\nHowever, when there is a pause after the \"trigger\" word, the phonological doubling does not occur (e.g. ''tu s\u00ee (g)guaglione'', [You are a boy], where ''s\u00ee'' is a \"trigger\" word causing doubling of the initial consonant in ''guaglione'' but in the phrase ''\u2019e do s\u00ee, guagli\u00f3?'' [Where are you from, boy?] no doubling occurs). Neither does doubling occur when the initial consonant is followed by another consonant (e.g. ''\u2019o ttaliano'' [the Italian language], but ''\u2019o spagnuolo'' [the Spanish language], where ''\u2019o'' is the neuter definite article).\nThis is what happens phonologically and no orthographic change is required. The same thing happens in Italian, where multiple words trigger first-consonant doubling, e.g. ''la casa'' but ''a (c)casa'', ''io e (t)te'', etc.\n\n==== Words that trigger doubling in pronunciation ====\n\n* The conjunctions '''''e''''' and '''''n\u00e9''''' but not '''''o''''' (e.g. ''pane e ccaso''; ''n\u00e9 (p)pane n\u00e9 (c)caso''; but ''pane o caso'')\n* The prepositions '''''a''''', '''''pe''''', '''''cu''''' (e.g. ''a (m)me''; ''pe (t)te''; ''cu (v)vuje'')\n* The negation '''''nu''''', short for ''nun'' (e.g. ''nu ddicere niente'')\n* The indefinites '''''ogne''''', '''''cocche''''' (e.g. ''ogne (c)casa''; ''cocche (c)cosa'')\n* Interrogative '''''che''''' and relative '''''che''''' but not '''''ca''''' (e.g. ''che (p)piense?''

L'ultimo sovrano delle Due Sicilie</ref>\n\nWhile the term \"Neapolitan language\" is used in this article to refer to the language group of related dialects found in southern continental Italy, it may also refer more specifically to the dialect of the Neapolitan language spoken in the [[Naples metropolitan area|Naples area]] or in [[Campania]]. In fact, in a colloquial or non-academic or non-linguist context, \u201cNeapolitan language\u201d, ''napulitano'', or ''napoletano'' generally refers specifically to the [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the language spoken in [[Naples]] and the surrounding area; however, this variety is usually [[mutually intelligible]] with other related \u201cNeapolitan language\u201d varieties throughout Southern Italy.{{Citation needed |date=November 2019}}\n\n== Distribution ==\n[[File:WIKITONGUES- Foffo speaking Neapolitan.webm|thumb|A young man speaking Neapolitan.]]\nThe Neapolitan dialects are distributed throughout most of continental [[southern Italy]], historically united during the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], specifically southern [[Lazio]] ([[Gaeta]] and [[Sora, Lazio|Sora]] districts), southern [[Marche]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Basilicata]], [[Campania]] (Naples), northern and central [[Apulia]], and northernmost [[Calabria]]. The dialects are part of a varied [[dialect continuum]], so the varieties in southern Lazio, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia, Lucania and Calabria can typically be recognizable as regional groups of dialects. In western Abruzzo and Lazio the dialects give way to [[Central Italian]] dialects such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. In central Calabria and southern Apulia, the dialects give way to the [[Sicilian language]]. Largely due to massive southern Italian migration in the late 19th century and early 20th century, there are also numbers of speakers in [[Italian diaspora]] communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]]. However, in the [[United States]] traditional Neapolitan has had considerable contact with English, and is significantly different from contemporary Neapolitan spoken in [[Naples]]. English words are often used in place of Neapolitan words, especially among second-generation speakers. On the other hand, the effect on Neapolitan in Italy has been similar due to displacement by [[Italian language|Standard Italian]].\n\nThe following dialects constitute Neapolitan; numbers refer to the map:<ref>''[http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/mappe/flash/regionalok.htm Carta dei Dialetti d'Italia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003072247/http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/mappe/flash/regionalok.htm |date=3 October 2012 }}'' (Mapping of dialects of Italy) by Giovan Battista Pellegrini, 1977 (in [[Italian language|Italian]])</ref>\n\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman\n|Abruzzese and Southern Marchigiano:\n:Ia.

[http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/ital1286 \"Italo-Dalmatian\" Glottolog 2.3]. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.</ref> There are notable differences among the various dialects, but they are all generally mutually intelligible.\n\n[[Italian language|Italian]] and Neapolitan are of variable mutual comprehensibility, depending on factors that are both affective and linguistic. There are notable grammatical differences, such as Neapolitan having nouns in the neuter form and a unique plural formation as well as historical phonological developments, which often obscure the cognacy of lexical items.\n\nIts evolution has been similar to that of Italian and other Romance languages from their roots in [[Vulgar Latin]]. It may reflect a pre-Latin [[Oscan language|Oscan]] [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]], as in the pronunciation of the ''d'' sound as an ''r'' sound ([[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]) at the beginning of a word or between two vowels: e.g. ''doje'' (feminine) or ''duje'' (masculine), meaning \"two\", is pronounced, and often spelled, as ''roje''/''ruje''; ''ved\u00e9'' (\"to see\") as ''ver\u00e9'', and often spelled so; also ''cad\u00e9''/''car\u00e9'' (\"to fall\") and ''[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]]''/''Maronna''). Another purported Oscan influence is the historical assimilation of the consonant cluster {{IPA|/nd/}} as {{IPA|/nn/}}, pronounced {{IPA|[n\u02d0]}} (this is generally reflected in spelling more consistently: {{wiktnap|munno}} vs Italian {{wiktita|mondo}} \"world\"; {{wiktnap|quanno}} vs \nItalian {{wiktita|quando}} \"when\"), along with the development of {{IPA|/mb/}} as {{IPA|/mm/}}~{{IPA|[m\u02d0]}} ({{wiktnap|tammuro}} vs Italian {{wiktit|tamburo}} \"drum\"), also consistently reflected in spelling. Other effects of the Oscan [[substratum]] are postulated, but substratum claims are highly controversial. As in many other languages in the [[Italian Peninsula]], Neapolitan has an [[Stratum (linguistics)#Adstratum|adstratum]] greatly influenced by other [[Romance languages]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Franco-Proven\u00e7al]] above all), [[Germanic languages]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (both ancient and modern) and [[Arabic]]. The language had never been standardised, and the word for ''tree'' has three different spellings: {{wiktnap|arbero}}, {{wiktnap|arvero}} and {{wiktnap|\u00e0varo}}.\n\nNeapolitan has enjoyed a rich literary, [[Neapolitan music|musical]] and theatrical history (notably [[Giambattista Basile]], [[Eduardo De Filippo]], [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] and [[Tot\u00f2]]). Thanks to this heritage and the musical work of [[Renato Carosone]] in the 1950s, Neapolitan is still in use in popular music, even gaining national popularity in the songs of [[Pino Daniele]] and the [[Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare]].\n\nThe language has no official status within Italy and is not taught in schools. The [[University of Naples Federico II]] offers (from 2003) courses in Campanian Dialectology at the faculty of Sociology, whose actual aim is not teaching students to speak the language, but studying its history, usage, literature and social role. There are also ongoing legislative attempts at the national level to have it recognized as an official [[minority language]] of Italy. It is however a recognized [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 639 Joint Advisory Committee language with the language code of ''nap''.\n\nHere is the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] pronunciation of the Neapolitan spoken in the city of Naples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Much like [[Italian orthography]], it does not contain ''k,'' ''w,'' ''x,'' or ''y'' even though these letters might be found in some foreign words; like traditional Italian, it does contain the letter ''j''. The English pronunciation guidelines that follow are based on [[General American]] pronunciation and the values used may not be applicable to other dialects. (See also: [[International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects]].)\n\nAll Romance languages are closely related. Although Neapolitan shares a high degree of its vocabulary with Italian, the official language of Italy, differences in pronunciation often make the connection unrecognizable to those without knowledge of Neapolitan. The most striking phonological difference is the Neapolitan weakening of unstressed vowels into [[schwa]] (''schwa'' is pronounced like the ''a'' in ''about'' or the ''u'' in ''upon''). However it is also possible (and quite common for some Neapolitans) to speak standard Italian with a \"Neapolitan accent\"; that is, by pronouncing un-stressed vowels as schwa but by otherwise using only entirely standard words and grammatical forms. This is not Neapolitan proper, but a mere difference in Italian pronunciation.\n\nTherefore, while pronunciation presents the strongest barrier to comprehension, the grammar of Neapolitan is what sets it apart from Italian. In Neapolitan, for example, the gender and number of a word is expressed by a change in the accented vowel, whereas in Italian it is expressed by a change in the final vowel (e.g. ''l'''uo'''ngo'' {{IPA-nap|\u02c8lwo\u014b\u0261\u0259|}}, ''l'''o'''nga'' {{IPA-nap|\u02c8lo\u014b\u0261\u0259|}}; Italian ''lung'''o''''', ''lung'''a'''''; masc. \"long\", fem. \"long\"). These and other morpho-syntactic differences distinguish the Neapolitan language from the Italian language and the Neapolitan accent.\n\nNeapolitan has had a significant influence on the intonation of [[Rioplatense Spanish]], of the [[Buenos Aires]] region of [[Argentina]], and the whole of [[Uruguay]].<ref>Colantoni, Laura, and Jorge Gurlekian.[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=43F6CF4CEB6223AA2ED40C7926999F70.tomcat1?fromPage=online&aid=236145 \"Convergence and intonation: historical evidence from Buenos Aires Spanish\"], ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition'', Volume 7, Issue 02, August 2004, pp. 107\u2013119, Cambridge Journals Online</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nWhile there are only five graphic vowels in Neapolitan, phonemically, there are eight.  Stressed vowels ''e'' and ''o'' can be either \"[[Close vowel|closed]]\" or \"[[Open vowel|open]]\" and the pronunciation is different for the two.  The grave accent (''\u00e0'', ''\u00e8'', ''\u00f2'') is used to denote open vowels, and the acute accent (''\u00e9'', ''\u00ed'', ''\u00f3'', ''\u00fa'') is used to denote closed vowels, with alternative ''\u00ec'' and ''\u00f9''.  However, accent marks are not commonly used in the actual spelling of words except when they occur on the final syllable of a word, such as ''Tot\u00f2'', ''arriv\u00e0'', or ''pecch\u00e9'' and when they appear here in other positions it is only to demonstrate where the stress, or accent, falls in some words. Also, the [[circumflex]] is used to mark a long vowel where it wouldn't normally occur (e.g. ''s\u00ee'' \"you are\").\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! Letter\n!

Modern Neapolitan uses, almost entirely, shortened forms of these articles which are:\n\nBefore a word beginning with a consonant:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| '''Masculine'''\n| ''\u2019o''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | ''\u2019e''\n|-\n| '''Feminine'''\n| ''\u2019a''\n|-\n| '''Neuter'''\n| ''\u2019o''\n| \u2013\n|}\n\nThese definite articles are always pronounced distinctly.\n\nBefore a word beginning with a vowel, ''l\u2019'' or ''ll\u2019'' are used \nfor both masculine and feminine, for both singular and plural. Although both forms can be found, the ''ll\u2019'' form is by far the most common.\n\nIt is well to note that in Neapolitan the [[Grammatical gender|gender]] of a noun is not easily determined by the article, so other means must be used.  In the case of ''\u2019o'' which can be either masculine singular or neuter singular (there is no neuter plural in Neapolitan), when it is neuter the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, the name of a language in Neapolitan is always neuter, so if we see ''\u2019o nnapulitano'' we know it refers to the Neapolitan language, whereas ''\u2019o napulitano'' would refer to a Neapolitan man.\n\nLikewise, since ''\u2019e'' can be either masculine plural or feminine plural, when it is feminine plural, the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, consider ''\u2019a lista'' which in Neapolitan is feminine singular for \"list.\"  In the plural it becomes ''\u2019e lliste''.\n\nThere can also be problems with nouns whose singular form ends in ''e''.  Since plural nouns usually end in ''e'' whether masculine or feminine, the masculine plural is often formed by orthographically changing the spelling.  As an example, consider the word ''guaglione'' (which means \"boy\", or \"girl\" in the feminine form):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n| '''Masculine'''\n| ''\u2019o guaglione''\n| ''\u2019e guagliune''\n|-\n| '''Feminine'''\n| ''\u2019a guagliona''\n| ''\u2019e gguaglione''\n|}\n\nMore will be said about these orthographically changing nouns in the section on Neapolitan nouns.\n\nA couple of notes about consonant doubling:\n\n*Doubling is a function of the article (and certain other words), and these same words may be seen in other contexts without the consonant doubled.  More will be said about this in the section on consonant doubling.\n*Doubling only occurs when the consonant is followed by a vowel.  If it is followed by another consonant, such as in the word ''spagnuolo (Spanish)'', no doubling occurs.\n\n=== Indefinite articles ===\nThe Neapolitan indefinite articles, corresponding to the English ''a'' or ''an'', are presented in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!\n! Masculine\n! Feminine\n|-\n| '''Before words beginning with a consonant'''\n| ''nu''\n| ''na''\n|-\n| '''Before words beginning with a vowel'''\n| colspan=\"2\" | ''n\u2019''\n|}\n\n=== Verbal conjugation ===\nIn Neapolitan there are four finite moods: [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]], and three non-finite modes: [[infinitive]], [[gerund]] and [[participle]]. Each mood has an [[active voice|active]] and a [[passive voice|passive]] form. The only auxiliary verbs used in the active form is {{wiktnap|av\u00e9|(h)av\u00e9}} (Eng. \"to have\", It. ''avere''), which contrasts with Italian in which the intransitive and reflexive verbs take ''\u00e8ssere'' for their auxiliary. For example, we have:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Nap. || Aggio stato a Nnapule ajere. || AUX-HAVE-1st-SING-PRES \"be\"-PART-PAST \"in\"-PREP \"Naples\"-NOUN \"yesterday\"-ADVERB\n|-\n| It. || Sono stato a Napoli ieri. || AUX-BE-1st-SING-PRES \"be\"-PART-PAST \"in\"-PREP \"Naples\"-NOUN \"yesterday\"-ADVERB\n|-\n| Eng. || I was in Naples yesterday.\n|}\n\n=== Doubled initial consonants ===\nIn Neapolitan, many times the initial consonant of a word is doubled.  This is called ''[[raddoppiamento sintattico]]'' in Italian as it also applies to the [[Italian phonology]].\n* All feminine plural nouns, when preceded by the feminine plural definite article, ''\u2019e'', or by any feminine plural adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.\n* All neuter singular nouns, when preceded by the neuter singular definite article, ''\u2019o'', or by a neuter singular adjective, have their initial consonant doubled.\n* In addition, other words also trigger this doubling. Below is a list of words that trigger the doubling of the initial consonant of the word that follows.\nHowever, when there is a pause after the \"trigger\" word, the phonological doubling does not occur (e.g. ''tu s\u00ee (g)guaglione'', [You are a boy], where ''s\u00ee'' is a \"trigger\" word causing doubling of the initial consonant in ''guaglione'' but in the phrase ''\u2019e do s\u00ee, guagli\u00f3?'' [Where are you from, boy?] no doubling occurs). Neither does doubling occur when the initial consonant is followed by another consonant (e.g. ''\u2019o ttaliano'' [the Italian language], but ''\u2019o spagnuolo'' [the Spanish language], where ''\u2019o'' is the neuter definite article).\nThis is what happens phonologically and no orthographic change is required.

The cathedrals are notable particularly for their great height, and their extensive use of [[stained glass]] to fill the interiors with light.  They were the tallest and largest buildings of their time, and the most prominent examples of [[Gothic architecture]]. The appearance of the Gothic Cathedral was not only a revolution in architecture;  it also introduced new forms in decoration, sculpture, and art.\n\n[[Cathedrals]] were by definition churches where a [[bishop]] presided.  Abbeys were the churches attached to monasteries.  Many smaller [[parish]] churches were also built in the Gothic style. The appearance of the great cathedrals in the 12th century was a response to the dramatic increase of population and wealth in some parts of Europe, and the need for larger and more imposing buildings.  Technical advances, such an innovative uses of the  [[pointed arch]], [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], allowed the churches and cathedral to become much  taller, stronger, with larger windows and more light.\n\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France at the  [[Abbey of Saint Denis]], near Paris, with the rebuilding of the ambulatory and west facade  of the Abbey church by the Abbot [[Suger]] (1135\u201340).<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\">Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobile'' (2006), p. 36</ref>. The first Gothic cathedral in France,  [[Sens Cathedral]],  was begun between 1135 and 1140, and consecrated in 1164.  <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\nThe style quickly appeared in England, where it was called simply \"The French style.\"   The Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt by a French master builder from Sens,   [[William of Sens]] between 1174 and 1184.     Other elements of the style were imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also brought finely-cut stones from Normandy for their construction. \n\n[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] was begun in 1163, and consecrated in 1177.<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\"/>  The later part of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century saw a more refined style, characterised by [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  A third period, called ''Rayonnante'' in France, more highly decorated, as characterised by [[Sainte Chapelle]] (1241-1248) and [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France.  The fourth and final period, called ''Flamboyante'', appeared in the second half of the 14th century, taking its name from the flamelike motifs of decoration.  [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370), with its walls of stained glass, is a good example.\n\nRenaissance cathedrals and churches gradually replaced Gothic cathedrals, and the original cathedrals, such as Notre Dame, experienced many modifications or fell into ruin.   However, in the mid-19th century, in large part due to the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'', better known in English as [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], by  [[Victor Hugo]], there was a new wave of interest in the Gothic cathedral. Many Gothic cathedrals and churches were restored, with greater or lesser  accuracy.\n\n==Name==\nThe term [[cathedral]] came from the Greek ''cathedra'', or \"seat\", since it was the official seat of the Bishop, or ''Eveque'', and the principal church of the [[diocese]].   His title came from the Greek term ''Episkopos'', or \"he who sees.\"  As the leader of the [[diocese]]. The Bishop was considered the direct descendant of the [[Apostles]] or disciples of Christ, and had three missions: to direct the affairs of the church within the diocese, to administer the sacraments, and teach the [[Gospels]], or the message of Christ. The Bishop of a cathedral was assisted by the [[Canon (priest)|Canon]]s, or ''Chanoines' in French,   who formed a council called the Chapter.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'', (2015), pg. 4</ref>\n\nAt its time, it was called \"The French Style\"   The term \"Gothic\" was a very negative term invented in the late Renaissance by its critics, including the art historian and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].  They considered the style was barbaric, the opposite of the new Renaissance style that they favored.\n\n== Early Gothic - France (Mid-12th century }==\t\n===Abbot Suger and [[St Denis Basilica]]===\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France in the mid-12th century in an [[Abbey]], [[St Denis Basilica]], built by Abbot [[Suger]] (1081-1151).  The old Basilica was the traditional burial place of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and of the Kings of France, and was also a very popular pilgrimage destination, so much so that pilgrims were sometimes crushed by the crowds.   Suger became the abbot of Saint Denis in 1122.  He became the friend and confident of two French Kings [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and  He served the Regent for Louis VII during the absence of the King for the [[Second Crusade]] (1147-49).  \n \t\nSuger, with the full support of the King, decided to enlarge the church and reconstruct it on a new model.  <ref name = universalis>''Dictionnaire des Architectes'', Encyclopedia Universalis (1999), pp. 659-663</ref>   His first modification was a new west facade, inspired in part by new churches is Normandy,  with two towers and three deep portals.   Each of the portals had a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of sculpture, telling a Biblical or inspiring story.  the tympana installed by Sugar depicted the Last Judgement over the main door and the Martyrdom of Saint Denis over the other door.   The tympana  over the east portals became a characteristic feature of later Gothic cathedrals. <ref>Mignon, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drale Gothiques'' (205), p. 9</ref> \n\nWhen the new facade was complete, Suger turned his attention to the choir and the ambulatory in the west of thehe Suger was also a scholar of the philosophy of [[Plato]], and he believed thet light was a way by which the faithful could be elevated from the material to the immaterial and the divine. The ambulatory of old church was very dark, since Romanesque architecture, with barrel vaults,  required thick walls and supporting walls  between the small chapels.  Suger decided to use a new form of vault, the [[rib vault]], with [[Pointed arch|pointed arches]], which was higher and stronger.  This allowed him to remove the walls between the chapels, and opened the space for seventy stained glass windows in the choir, filling the church with light. {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|page=9}} \n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration.

Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine, Aisne|Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n\n* '''[[Laon Cathedral]]''' was begun in about 1160. Like many early Gothic cathedrals, it retained some romanesque features, including tribunes over the side aisles, a use of both round a pointed arches, and a two story chapel on each arm of the transept. Like most early Gothic churches, it was not exceptionally bigh, but it was exceptional long, with eleven bays in the nave, and ten in the choir. Because it was not high, it was possible to build a square tower over the crossing of the transept, in addition to four shorter towers on the corners, each with long lancet openings. One curious feature are the sixteen life-sized sculpted oxen on towers, each under its own canopy, symbolizing the animals which hauled the stones to the site.  <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]] {begun 1160)\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]''' begun in 1163 by the archbishop [[Maurice de Sully]], was the largest and highest of the new French cathedrals. The nave was 122 meters long and the vaulted ceiling was 35 meters high, twelve meters higher than Laon Cathedral.  It used the older six-part [[rib vault]] in the ceiling, but replaced the alternating pillars and columns of earlier cathedrals with a single type of pillar, creating greater harmony. It made innovative use of [[flying buttress]] to counterbalance the weight of the higher vaults, so the walls could be thinner and have more windows. It had four levels, like the earlier cathedrals, but the old [[triforium]] was replaced by small rose windows. Unlike Laon Cathedral, the facade of Notre Dame, with its two towers, expressed a remarkable calm and harmony.Notre-Dame was modified in the later Gothic period, with the addition of the rose windows in the transepts (1250-1260) and double flying buttresses.    {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp. 18-19}}\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris 2013-07-24.jpg|The facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (begun 1163)\nFile:Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 22 June 2014 002.jpg|Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 122 meters long\n\n</gallery>\n\n== Early Gothic - England ==\nGothic elements, often called \"The French style\". soon appeared in English cathedrals and abbeys.  While English cathedrals tended to follow the French style, they had a few special charactersics of their own,  Unlike French cathedrals, they tended to great length rather than great height.  They also made extensive of [[Purbeck Marble]]  for columns, floors and wall panels, which added colour and reflection to the interiors.  The early English style lasted from the late 12th century to the mid-14th century. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Early Gothic Architecture'', (retrieved April 19, 2020)</ref>\n* '''[[Canterbury Cathedral]]''' (Early Gothic portion - 1174-85) One of the earliest to use Gothic features in the French way was [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Following a fire in 1174 which destroyed much of the choir, a French master builder, [[William of Sens]], who probably had participated in the construction of [[Sens Cathedral]], was selected to conduct the reconstruction.  It was rebuilt between 1174 and 1184.  William of Sens himself fell fifty feet from the scaffolding and was seriously injured, and had to return to France, where he died in 1180. It was completed by sn English builder, [[William the Englishman]]. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line edition, \"William of Sens\", retrieved April 19, 2020</ref> While the choir is not as high some French cathedrals, it makes up for the difference by its dramatic length. The choir is 180 ft (55 m) long and 71 ft (22 m) high. \n\nThe nave and much of the rest of the cathedral were rebuilt into the [[perpendicular style]] beginning in the late 14th century. The new transepts and aisles were given the more decorative  [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]], where ribs were connected to each other for decorative rather than structural effect.  The crossing tower was begun in 1433, and is 23t feet (72 metes) high. Alterations to the Cathedral continued until 1834. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury-cathedral-wyrdlight.jpg|[[Canterbury Cathedral (1174-1834) The exterior was largely rebuilt into the perpendicular style in the 14th and 15th century. \nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]] (1174\u201384).

The builders made use of the Gothic [[rib vault]] in constructing the new nave and choir. These were replaced by the  more decorative [[lierne (vault)|lierne vault]] in the late 13th century.  Two  [[rose windows]], called the Bishops's Eye and the Dean's Eye, were added at about there same time.   The original cathedral had two towers on the wsst facade, and then  a central tower was built in the 14th century,  topped by a wooden spire, which made it the tallest structure in the world for two hundred years.  The other two towers were also given spires and raised in height.

Rievaulx Abbey was begun in 1132 in the Romanesque style.  All he monasteries were closed by Henry VIII in 1538, as part of his [[dissolution of monasteries]].

He transformed the country from a small feudal state to the most prosperous and powerful nation in Europe. He was also a great builder, constructing the [[Louvre Palace]] and the first wall around Paris, and founding the [[University of Paris]] (1215). <ref>''Petit Robert Dictipnnaire Universel des Noms Propres'' (1988), pg. 1409 </ref>   The new structures were larger and taller, and their forms were simplified and more balanced. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}  He was succeeded by [[Louis IX of France]], whose reign saw the construction of several great cathedrals, and his own remarkable chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]].  <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-century cathedral style in France is often called [[Rayonnant]]. The objective of the architects was larger windows and more lavish decoration rather than simply greater size.  The mid-level triforium gradually disappeared, and stained glass windows seemed to cover entire walls. The great monuments of the style included [[Amiens Cathedral]], the modified  [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and especially the royal chapel of Louis IX of France, [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (consecrated 1248). <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\n* ''' [[Chartres Cathedral]] ''' was constructed following the destruction by fire of the Romanesque cathedral in 1194, which left only the crypt, royal total an apse  intact. It was rapidly reconstructed, and was largely finished by 1221. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|pages=20-21}}. It surpassed Notre Dame de Paris both in length (130.2 meters) and height (36 meters). It had an immense transept which had its own collateral chapels. The choir was extended by a double disambulatory with three radiating chapels.  Chartres has a number of innovative features.  The traditional level of tribunes on both sides of the nave were removed, thanks to the strength and reach of the flying buttresses, reducing the number of levels from four to three.  This made room for a row of large windows, the same height as the ground-floor arcades, bringing much more light into the church, and a greater sensation of harmony.

Like Chartres, the elevation has just three levels, giving more space for windows. The traditional tympanum on the facade was replaced by a large rose window, while the sculpture usually on the tympanum was moved to the inside of the facade.  Another innovation at the Reims was the placement of each stained glass windows in a large separate ''chassis'', or frame, rather than directly into the wall, which allowed much more complex patterns.

Construction began in about 1175, after the Bishop, Reginald de Bohan, visited France and saw the early Gothic works. It was the first English cathedral to be Gothic from the beginning. Following the early Gothic style, it originally stressed width rather than height. The major achievement was the west front (1225-1240, decorated with 400 statues, of which 3200 still exist, depicting the [[Day of Judgement]] from the [[Book of Revelation]]. The statues were originally painted in bright colours. In the early 14th century, following changes in the liturgy, the Cathedral saw major additions in the decorated style, which were finished in 1326.  These included the addition of a new octagonal chapel, and a retro-choir with unusual scissor arches, built in 1338-48 to strengthen the support of the tower above.  . A major new building program began at Wells in the fourteenth  century, finishing in 1326.

The rebuilding began in the original Romanesque style, but when the builders saw the new French style at Chartres,  they changed their plans and began anew.  The south transept was completed first, then the nave, completed in 1275. They built on top of the original Romanesque foundations, which accounts for the unusual wide spacing of the pillars of the grand arcades. The facade was begun in 1277, using the reddish [[sandstone]] of the [[Vosges]] mountains. A spire was added to the north tower, completed in 1439.

The cathedrals are notable particularly for their great height, and their extensive use of [[stained glass]] to fill the interiors with light.  They were the tallest and largest buildings of their time, and the most prominent examples of [[Gothic architecture]]. The appearance of the Gothic Cathedral was not only a revolution in architecture;  it also introduced new forms in decoration, sculpture, and art.\n\n[[Cathedrals]] were by definition churches where a [[bishop]] presided.  Abbeys were the churches attached to monasteries.  Many smaller [[parish]] churches were also built in the Gothic style. The appearance of the great cathedrals in the 12th century was a response to the dramatic increase of population and wealth in some parts of Europe, and the need for larger and more imposing buildings.  Technical advances, such an innovative uses of the  [[pointed arch]], [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], allowed the churches and cathedral to become much  taller, stronger, with larger windows and more light.\n\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France at the  [[Abbey of Saint Denis]], near Paris, with the rebuilding of the ambulatory and west facade  of the Abbey church by the Abbot [[Suger]] (1135\u201340).<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\">Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobile'' (2006), p. 36</ref>. The first Gothic cathedral in France,  [[Sens Cathedral]],  was begun between 1135 and 1140, and consecrated in 1164.  <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\nThe style quickly appeared in England, where it was called simply \"The French style.\"   The Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt by a French master builder from Sens,   [[William of Sens]] between 1174 and 1184.     Other elements of the style were imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also brought finely-cut stones from Normandy for their construction. \n\n[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] was begun in 1163, and consecrated in 1177.<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\"/>  The later part of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century saw a more refined style, characterised by [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  A third period, called ''Rayonnante'' in France, more highly decorated, as characterized by [[Sainte Chapelle]] (1241-1248) and [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France.  The fourth and final period, called ''Flamboyante'', appeared in the second half of the 14th century, taking its name from the flamelike motifs of decoration.  [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370), with its walls of stained glass, is a good example.\n\nRenaissance cathedrals and churches gradually replaced Gothic cathedrals, and the original cathedrals, such as Notre Dame, experienced many modifications or fell into ruin.   However, in the mid-19th century, in large part due to the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'', better known in English as [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], by  [[Victor Hugo]], there was a new wave of interest in the Gothic cathedral. Many Gothic cathedrals and churches were restored, with greater or lesser  accuracy.\n\n==Name==\nThe term [[cathedral]] came from the Greek ''cathedra'', or \"seat\", since it was the official seat of the Bishop, or ''Eveque'', and the principal church of the [[diocese]].   His title came from the Greek term ''Episkopos'', or \"he who sees.\"  As the leader of the [[diocese]]. The Bishop was considered the direct descendant of the [[Apostles]] or disciples of Christ, and had three missions: to direct the affairs of the church within the diocese, to administer the sacraments, and teach the [[Gospels]], or the message of Christ. The Bishop of a cathedral was assisted by the [[Canon (priest)|Canon]]s, or ''Chanoines' in French,   who formed a council called the Chapter.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'', (2015), pg. 4</ref>\n\nAt its time, it was called \"The French Style\"   The term \"Gothic\" was a very negative term invented in the late Renaissance by its critics, including the art historian and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].  They considered the style was barbaric, the opposite of the new Renaissance style that they favored.\n\n== Early Gothic - France (Mid-12th century }==\t\n===Abbot Suger and [[St Denis Basilica]]===\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France in the mid-12th century in an [[Abbey]], [[St Denis Basilica]], built by Abbot [[Suger]] (1081-1151).  The old Basilica was the traditional burial place of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and of the Kings of France, and was also a very popular pilgrimage destination, so much so that pilgrims were sometimes crushed by the crowds.   Suger became the abbot of Saint Denis in 1122.  He became the friend and confident of two French Kings [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and  He served the Regent for Louis VII during the absence of the King for the [[Second Crusade]] (1147-49).  \n \t\nSuger, with the full support of the King, decided to enlarge the church and reconstruct it on a new model.  <ref name = universalis>''Dictionnaire des Architectes'', Encyclopedia Universalis (1999), pp. 659-663</ref>   His first modification was a new west facade, inspired in part by new churches is Normandy,  with two towers and three deep portals.   Each of the portals had a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of sculpture, telling a Biblical or inspiring story.  the tympana installed by Sugar depicted the Last Judgement over the main door and the Martyrdom of Saint Denis over the other door.   The tympana  over the east portals became a characteristic feature of later Gothic cathedrals. <ref>Mignon, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drale Gothiques'' (205), p. 9</ref> \n\nWhen the new facade was complete, Suger turned his attention to the choir and the ambulatory in the west of thehe Suger was also a scholar of the philosophy of [[Plato]], and he believed thet light was a way by which the faithful could be elevated from the material to the immaterial and the divine. The ambulatory of old church was very dark, since Romanesque architecture, with barrel vaults,  required thick walls and supporting walls  between the small chapels.  Suger decided to use a new form of vault, the [[rib vault]], with [[Pointed arch|pointed arches]], which was higher and stronger.  This allowed him to remove the walls between the chapels, and opened the space for seventy stained glass windows in the choir, filling the church with light. {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|page=9}} \n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration.

Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine, Aisne|Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n\n* '''[[Laon Cathedral]]''' was begun in about 1160. Like many early Gothic cathedrals, it retained some romanesque features, including tribunes over the side aisles, a use of both round a pointed arches, and a two story chapel on each arm of the transept. Like most early Gothic churches, it was not exceptionally bigh, but it was exceptional long, with eleven bays in the nave, and ten in the choir. Because it was not high, it was possible to build a square tower over the crossing of the transept, in addition to four shorter towers on the corners, each with long lancet openings. One curious feature are the sixteen life-sized sculpted oxen on towers, each under its own canopy, symbolizing the animals which hauled the stones to the site.  <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]] {begun 1160)\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]''' begun in 1163 by the archbishop [[Maurice de Sully]], was the largest and highest of the new French cathedrals. The nave was 122 meters long and the vaulted ceiling was 35 meters high, twelve meters higher than Laon Cathedral.  It used the older six-part [[rib vault]] in the ceiling, but replaced the alternating pillars and columns of earlier cathedrals with a single type of pillar, creating greater harmony. It made innovative use of [[flying buttress]] to counterbalance the weight of the higher vaults, so the walls could be thinner and have more windows. It had four levels, like the earlier cathedrals, but the old [[triforium]] was replaced by small rose windows. Unlike Laon Cathedral, the facade of Notre Dame, with its two towers, expressed a remarkable calm and harmony.Notre-Dame was modified in the later Gothic period, with the addition of the rose windows in the transepts (1250-1260) and double flying buttresses.    {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp. 18-19}}\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris 2013-07-24.jpg|The facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (begun 1163)\nFile:Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 22 June 2014 002.jpg|Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 122 meters long\n\n</gallery>\n\n== Early Gothic - England ==\nGothic elements, often called \"The French style\". soon appeared in English cathedrals and abbeys.  While English cathedrals tended to follow the French style, they had a few special charactersics of their own,  Unlike French cathedrals, they tended to great length rather than great height.  They also made extensive of [[Purbeck Marble]]  for columns, floors and wall panels, which added color and reflection to the interiors.  The early English style lasted from the late 12th century to the mid-14th century. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Early Gothic Architecture'', (retrieved April 19, 2020)</ref>\n* '''[[Canterbury Cathedral]]''' (Early Gothic portion - 1174-85) One of the earliest to use Gothic features in the French way was [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Following a fire in 1174 which destroyed much of the choir, a French master builder, [[William of Sens]], who probably had participated in the construction of [[Sens Cathedral]], was selected to conduct the reconstruction.  It was rebuilt between 1174 and 1184.  William of Sens himself fell fifty feet from the scaffolding and was seriously injured, and had to return to France, where he died in 1180. It was completed by sn English builder, [[William the Englishman]]. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line edition, \"William of Sens\", retrieved April 19, 2020</ref> While the choir is not as high some French cathedrals, it makes up for the difference by its dramatic length. The choir is 180 ft (55 m) long and 71 ft (22 m) high. \n\nThe nave and much of the rest of the cathedral were rebuilt into the [[perpendicular style]] beginning in the late 14th century. The new transepts and aisles were given the more decorative  [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]], where ribs were connected to each other for decorative rather than structural effect.  The crossing tower was begun in 1433, and is 23t feet (72 metes) high. Alterations to the Cathedral continued until 1834. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury-cathedral-wyrdlight.jpg|[[Canterbury Cathedral (1174-1834) The exterior was largely rebuilt into the perpendicular style in the 14th and 15th century. \nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]] (1174\u201384).

The builders made use of the Gothic [[rib vault]] in constructing the new nave and choir. These were replaced by the  more decorative [[lierne (vault)|lierne vault]] in the late 13th century.  Two  [[rose windows]], called the Bishops's Eye and the Dean's Eye, were added at about there same time.   The original cathedral had two towers on the wsst facade, and then  a central tower was built in the 14th century,  topped by a wooden spire, which made it the tallest structure in the world for two hundred years.  The other two towers were also given spires and raised in height.

He transformed the country from a small feudal state to the most prosperous and powerful nation in Europe. He was also a great builder, constructing the [[Louvre Palace]] and the first wall around Paris, and founding the [[University of Paris]] (1215). <ref>''Petit Robert Dictipnnaire Universel des Noms Propres'' (1988), pg. 1409 </ref>   The new structures were larger and taller, and their forms were simplified and more balanced. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}  He was succeeded by [[Louis IX of France]], whose reign saw the construction of several great cathedrals, and his own remarkable chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]].  <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-century cathedral style in France is often called [[Rayonnant]]. The objective of the architects was larger windows and more lavish decoration rather than simply greater size.  The mid-level triforium gradually disappeared, and stained glass windows seemed to cover entire walls. The great monuments of the style included [[Amiens Cathedral]], the modified  [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and especially the royal chapel of Louis IX of France, [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (consecrated 1248). <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\n* ''' [[Chartres Cathedral]] ''' was constructed following the destruction by fire of the Romanesque cathedral in 1194, which left only the crypt, royal total an apse  intact. It was rapidly reconstructed, and was largely finished by 1221. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|pages=20-21}}. It surpassed Notre Dame de Paris both in length (130.2 meters) and height (36 meters). It had an immense transept which had its own collateral chapels. The choir was extended by a double disambulatory with three radiating chapels.  Chartres has a number of innovative features.  The traditional level of tribunes on both sides of the nave were removed, thanks to the strength and reach of the flying buttresses, reducing the number of levels from four to three.  This made room for a row of large windows, the same height as the ground-floor arcades, bringing much more light into the church, and a greater sensation of harmony.  Another innovation was the use of the simpler but stronger quadripartite [[rib vault]] instead of the six-part vaults of Notre Dame, which allowed greater height and a simpler arrangement of columns and pillars on the ground floor. {The cathedral was originally planned to have seven towers, but in the end had only two, from different periods.  {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}.  Another feature of Chartres was the use of walls painted white or in different colors. As of 2020, after the walls had been cleaned of soot and dirt, these colors are in the processs of being restored or recreated, a measure that has drawn some criticism. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/chartres-cathedral-clean-up-row-experts-divided-over-whether-dirt-should-be-left-in-place-to-keep-a6706627.html|title=Let there be light?

At Amiens the arcades on the ground floor are a full eighteen meters high, equaling the combined height of the triforium and clerestory above.  Amiens adopted the system of stained glass windows in chassis that was used at Reims, but went a step further. The high clerestory windows in the nave are composed of four lancet windows topped by two rosettes, while those in the transept have as many as eight lancets in single window. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=28}}   \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (1).JPG|[[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1220)\nFile:Amiens Cathedral choir Wikimedia Commons.jpg|Choir and altar of Amiens Cathedral\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Sainte-Chapelle]]''' (1241-48)  was the royal chapel constructed by [[Louis IX of France]] at his palace on the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]] in Paris to shelter the relics of the [[Passion of Christ]].

The Romanesque cathedral was destroyed by a fire in 1210. The Archbishop Aubrey de Humbert began a new cathedral in the Gothic style in 1211. The choir was finished in 1241.  Work on the facade did not begin until 1251, and was not finished until the 16th century.  It was heavily damaged in the [[First World War]], but restored  and reconsecrated in 1937. Like Chartres, the elevation has just three levels, giving more space for windows. The traditional tympanum on the facade was replaced by a large rose window, while the sculpture usually on the tympanum was moved to the inside of the facade.  Another innovation at the Reims was the placement of each stained glass windows in a large separate ''chassis'', or frame, rather than directly into the wall, which allowed much more complex patterns.   Another innovation was the placement of statues of angels sheltered in the pinnacles atop the flying buttresses.

It lasted from about the mid-thirteenth to the mid-fourteenth century.  The simple and functional quadrapartite [[rib vault]] was  replaced by more elaborate [[lierne]] vault and fan fault, whose ribs were largely decorative. <ref>Encyclop\u00e6edia Britannica on-line, \"High Gothic\" (retrieved April 20, 2020)</ref>\n\n[[Henry III of England]] (1207-72) was an important patron of this new style, both with additions to [[Westminster Abbey]] (after 1245) and in the east end of [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]] (1258).

Construction began in about 1175, after the Bishop, Reginald de Bohan, visited France and saw the early Gothic works. It was the first English cathedral to be Gothic from the beginning. Following the early Gothic style, it originally stressed width rather than height. The major achievement was the west front (1225-1240, decorated with 400 statues, of which 3200 still exist, depicting the [[Day of Judgement]] from the [[Book of Revelation]]. The statues were originally painted in bright colors. In the early 14th century, following changes in the liturgy, the Cathedral saw major additions in the decorated style, which were finished in 1326.  These included the addition of a new octagonal chapel, and a retro-choir with unusual scissor arches, built in 1338-48 to strengthen the support of the tower above.  . A major new building program began at Wells in the fourteenth  century, finishing in 1326.

The rebuilding began in the original Romanesque style, but when the builders saw the new French style at Chartres,  they changed their plans and began anew.  The south transept was completed first, then the nave, completed in 1275. They built on top of the original Romanesque foundations, which accounts for the unusual wide spacing of the pillars of the grand arcades. The facade was begun in 1277, using the reddish [[sandstone]] of the [[Vosges]] mountains. A spire was added to the north tower, completed in 1439.

After his death in 1353, the King of [[Bohemia]], Charles IV, selected a young Bohemian builder, [[Petr Parler]], twenty-three years old, to continue the work. The south tower and spire followed the model of the cathedrals of the [[Rhineland]].

Also, building available building materials were different;  Italian cathedrals were usually built of brick, not stone, and marble was abundant. Italian architects did adapt the some aspects of the northern style, including the rib vault and columns attached to the walls.

The architects also experimented with various kinds of decorative vaults, such as the [[fan vault]], where most of the thin ribs, springing upward  from slender columns, were purely decorative.

It was like that when James McLean, an Englishman who had come to [[Valparaiso]] few years earlier, proposed sending uniforms from [[England]], where they already manufactured especially for football teams. In McLean's return, Wanderers received twenty green kits and twenty white shorts, besides a black uniform for the goalkeepers. The explanation of the design change was that McLean, of [[Irish people|Irish origin]], decided to send kits with the colors of the [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Irish Football Association team]]. The first time which Wanderers used that uniform was on 18 September 1908.<ref name=\"Irlanda\"/>\n\nSince then the team has maintained its home kit with some exceptions, where it was used a white shirt with thin green stripes in late 60s or in 2001 when Wanderers won its third league title.\n\nIn 2007 was released a similar uniform to the used in 1965 and 1966, as a way to honor the 115 years of the institution.\n\n===Kit manufacturers & shirt sponsors===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Period\n!Kit manufacturer\n!Shirt sponsor\n|-\n| 1892\u20131975\n|rowspan=2|None\n|-\n|1976\u20131980\n|Costa\n|-\n|1983\n|Haddad\n|La Estrella de Valpara\u00edso\n|-\n|1988\n| [[Le Coq Sportif]]\n|\u00d3ptica Naranjo Internacional New York\n|-\n| 1989\n|rowspan=2|[[Adidas]]\n|Pilsener Dorada\n|-\n|1990\u20131992\n|[[Empresa Nacional del Petr\u00f3leo|ENAP]]\n|-\n|1993\u20131994\n|Avia\n|rowspan=5|Cristal\n|-\n|1995\u20131997\n|[[Uhlsport]]\n|-\n|1998\n|Avia\n|-\n|1999\n|Sauro\n|-\n|1999\u20132000\n|Avia\n|-\n| 2001\n|Corre Corre\n|None\n|-\n| 2001\u20132002\n|Wanderers Sport\n|Metalpar\n|-\n| 2003\n|[[Adidas]]\n|None\n|-\n| 2004\n|Training\n|Promepar\n|-\n| 2005\n|[[Lotto Sport Italia|Lotto]]\n|Pullman Bus\n|-\n| 2006\u20132008\n|rowspan=2|Training\n|None\n|-\n| 2008\n| rowspan=5|TPS\n|-\n| 2009\u20132015\n| [[Mitre]]\n|-\n|2016\u2013\n| [[Macron (sportswear)|Macron]]\n|}\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{Main|Football rivalries in Chile#Cl\u00e1sico Porte\u00f1o (The Seaport Derby)}}\n[[File:WanderersEverton1925.jpg|thumb|200px|Wanderers and Everton in 1925.]]\nSantiago Wanderers' traditional rivals are [[Everton de Vi\u00f1a del Mar]] and both teams dispute the [[Football rivalries in Chile#Cl\u00e1sico Porte\u00f1o|Cl\u00e1sico Porte\u00f1o]]. Although the first games between both date from 1910s, in that age the rival of Wanderers was La Cruz Football Club from [[Valpara\u00edso, Chile|Valpara\u00edso]] too. The rivalry with Everton began to take shape towards mid-1930s and was intensified with the transfer of that club to [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]].\n\nDuring the amateurism Wanderers dominated the historial of facings against Everton, but today the club hasn't been able to reverse that difference in the professional era, which explains the current historical's disadvantage (only overcomed in early 1970s). Deepening in the last point, both have faced 165 times, of which 40 have been draws, 68 have been victories for Everton and 57 have been for Wanderers, whilst for [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Chile|top-tier]], the greens have won 32 times, Everton do it in 38 times, having a registered 27 ties.\n\nThe first professional match between Wanderers and Everton team took place on 9 July 1944 with a 2\u20130 win for Vina del Mar's team. Nevertheless, it was in these times where the biggest win for derbies came, with a 7\u20130 victory for Santiago Wanderers on 2 October 1949.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{Main|Estadio El\u00edas Figueroa Brander}}\n\n{{Wide image|Panor\u00e1mica Estadio El\u00edas Figueroa Brander.jpg|960px|{{center|A panorama of [[Estadio El\u00edas Figueroa Brander]]}}}}\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{Santiago Wanderers squad|format=table}}\n\n===2020 Winter transfers===\n\n====In====\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=--|nat=CHI|pos=MF|name=[[\u00c1ngelo Qui\u00f1ones]]|other=back from [[Uni\u00f3n La Calera]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=--|nat=CHI|pos=MF|name=[[Juan Pablo Mi\u00f1o]]|other=from [[Deportes Iquique]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=--|nat=CHI|pos=FW|name=[[Sebasti\u00e1n Ubilla]]|other=from [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]]}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n====Out====\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=CHI|pos=GK|name=[[El\u00edas Hartard]]|other=Released}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=PAR|pos=DF|name=[[Mario L\u00f3pez Quintana|Mario L\u00f3pez]]|other=to [[Aldosivi]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=CHI|pos=DF|name=[[Nelson Rebolledo]]|other=to [[Rangers de Talca|Rangers]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=CHI|pos=MF|name=[[Kevin Valenzuela]]|other=to [[\u00d1ublense]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=CHI|pos=DF|name=[[Jorge Ampuero]]|other=Released}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=CHI|pos=FW|name=[[Francisco Castro (footballer, born 1990)|Francisco Castro]]|other=to [[A.C.
