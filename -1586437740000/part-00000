As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due.\n\nBut the other is the elder daughter of dark Night ([[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]), and the son of Cronus  [i.e. [[Zeus]]] who sits above and dwells in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel.</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' (226\u2013232), Strife, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:\n\n:And hateful Eris bore painful [[Ponos]] (\"Hardship\"),\n:[[Lethe]] (\"Forgetfulness\") and [[Limos (mythology)|Limos]] (\"Starvation\") and the tearful [[Algos|Algea]] (\"Pains\"),\n:[[Hysminai]] (\"Battles\"), [[Makhai]] (\"Wars\"), [[Phonoi]] (\"Murders\"), and [[Androctasiai|Androktasiai]] (\"Manslaughters\");\n:[[Neikea]] (\"Quarrels\"), Pseudea (\"Lies\"), Logoi (\"Stories\"), [[Amphillogiai]] (\"Disputes\")\n:[[Dysnomia (mythology)|Dysnomia]] (\"Anarchy\") and [[At\u00eb|Ate]] (\"Ruin\"), near one another,\n:and [[Horkos]] (\"Oath\"), who most afflicts men on earth,\n:Then willing swears a false oath.<ref>Caldwell, p. 42 lines 226-232, with the meanings of the names (in parentheses), as given by Caldwell, p. 40 on lines 212&ndash;232.</ref>\n\n\nThe other Strife is presumably she who appears in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Book&nbsp;IV; equated with [[Enyo]] as sister of [[Ares]] and so presumably daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]]:\n\n<blockquote>Strife whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. She also has [[Enyalius|a son whom she named Strife]].</blockquote>\n\nEnyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] in Book 11, of the same work.\n\nThe most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the [[Trojan War]] by causing the [[Judgement of Paris]]. The goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and [[Aphrodite]] had been invited along with the rest of [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]] to the forced wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], who would become the parents of [[Achilles]], but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.\n\nShe therefore (as mentioned at the ''[[Cypria|Kypria]]'' according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and [[Themis]]) tossed into the party the [[Apple of Discord]], a golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]] inscribed {{lang-grc|[[Kallisti|\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3]]|translit=t\u0113(i) kallist\u0113(i)}} &nbsp;\u2013 \"For the most beautiful one\", or \"To the Fairest One\"&nbsp;\u2013 provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of [[Troy]], was appointed to select the fairest by [[Zeus]]. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris's decision, and also attempted to bribe him. [[Hera]] offered political power; [[Athena]] promised infinite wisdom; and [[Aphrodite]] tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta]]. While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.\n\nIn [[Nonnus]]'s ''Dionysiaca'', 2.356, when [[Typhon]] prepares to battle with Zeus:\n\n<blockquote>Eris (\"Strife\") was Typhon's escort in the mel\u00e9e, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (\"Victory\") led Zeus to battle.</blockquote>\n\nAnother story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of [[Polytekhnos]] and [[Aedon]]. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, \"Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!\" Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos's son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.\n\n==Cultural influences==\n===Discordianism===\n{{Main|Discordianism}}\nEris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern [[Discordianism|Discordian]] religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Gregory Hill]] and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] under the [[pen name]]s of \"[[Malaclypse the Younger]]\" and \"Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst\". The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original, wherein she is depicted as a positive (albeit mischievous) force of chaotic creation.\n\nA quote from the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', the first holy book of Discordianism, attempts to clear up the matter:\n\n{{quote|One day Mal-2 consulted his [[Pineal gland|Pineal Gland]] and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things.

The inclusion of the [[Depeche Mode]] cover, \"Everything Counts\", is a poignant way to imply that the people who built then destroyed their society realized their folly after it was too late.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n==Track listing==\nAll lyrics written by [[Niklas Sundin]] and [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]]\n{{tracklist\n| title1 = Jotun\n| music1 = [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] & [[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]]\n| length1 = 3:53\n| title2 = Food for the Gods\n| music2 = [[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]], Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length2 = 4:21\n| title3 = Gyroscope \n| music3 = Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length3 = 3:26\n| title4 = Dialogue with the Stars\n| music4 = Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length4 = 3:00\n| note4 = Instrumental\n| title5 = The Hive\n| music5 = Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length5 = 4:03 \n| title6 = Jester Script Transfigured\n| music6 = Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length6 = 5:46\n| title7 = Morphing into Primal\n| music7 = Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte, Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m, Anders Frid\u00e9n & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length7 = 3:05\n| title8 = Worlds Within the Margin\n| music8 = Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length8 = 5:06\n| title9 = Episode 666\n| music9 = Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length9 = 3:45\n| title10 = [[Everything Counts]]\n| music10 = Martin Lee Gore\n| note10 = [[Depeche Mode]] cover\n| length10 = 3:17\n| title11 = Whoracle\n| music11 = Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length11 = 2:44\n| note11 = Instrumental\n|all_writing=|title12=|length12=|title13=|length13=|title14=|length14=|title15=|length15=|title16=|length16=|title17=|length17=|title18=|length18=|title19=|length19=|title20=|length20=|total_length=42:29}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Deluxe edition\n| collapsed = yes\n| title12 = Clad in Shadows '99\n| length12 = 2:25\n|total_length=44:54\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Japanese & korean  edition\n| collapsed = yes\n| title12 = Goliaths Disarm Their Davids\n| title13 = Acoustic Medley\n| title14 = Behind Space - Live\n}}<br>\n{{tracklist\n| headline = LP bonus track\n| collapsed = yes\n| title12 = Re-cycles\n| note12 = Acoustic Medley renamed\n}}<br>\n {{tracklist\n| headline = 2010 re-issue\n| collapsed = yes\n| title12 = Goliaths Disarm Their Davids\n| length12 = 4:58\n| title13 = Jotun (Live)\n| length13 = 3:38\n| title14 = Food for the Gods (Live)\n| length14 = 4:11\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n;In Flames\n*[[Anders Frid\u00e9n]] - [[Singing|vocals]], additional [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]\n*[[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] - [[lead guitar]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], additional percussion\n*[[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]] - [[rhythm guitar]]\n*[[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]] - [[bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]] - [[Drum kit|drums]], percussion & additional lead guitar\n\n;Other personnel\n*Ulrika Netterdahl - female vocals on \"Whoracle\"\n*The ''Whoracle'' concept conjured and verbalized by [[Niklas Sundin]] and Anders Frid\u00e9n.\n*Lyrics written by Niklas Sundin following original synopsis by Anders Frid\u00e9n.\n*All music composed and arranged by In Flames except \"Everything Counts\" by [[Martin Lee Gore]] of [[Depeche Mode]].\n*Recorded and produced by [[Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m]] with assistance from In Flames.\n*Engineered by Anders Frid\u00e9n and Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m.\n*Mixed by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m and Anders Frid\u00e9n.\n*Mastered by Goran Finnberg and Fredrik Nordstrom at the Mastering Room Gbg.\n*Cover artwork by Andreas Marschall.\n*Photos by [[Kenneth Johansson]].\n*All songs published by Prophecies Publishing Hamburg except \"Everything Counts\".\n*\"Everything Counts\" published by Grabbing Hands Music Ltd, sub-published by [[EMI|EMI Music Germany]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{In Flames}}\n\n[[Category:In Flames albums]]\n[[Category:Nuclear Blast albums]]\n[[Category:1997 albums]]\n[[Category:Concept albums]]\n[[Category:Albums recorded at Studio Fredman]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m]]\n", "name_user": "Urgal", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoracle"}

During his time at the Academy, he held several high-ranking midshipman offices, including Commander of the Brigade of Midshipmen, President of the Class of 1951, while also graduating 8th academically out of a class of 725. His other major accomplishments included helping to establish the honor concept governing midshipmen's conduct. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] in 1951. [[Ensign]] Lawrence continued on at the Naval Academy as Aide to the [[Commandant of Midshipmen]] until September 1951, when he reported to flight training.\n\nLawrence became a [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] in 1952.<ref name=LAT/> After completing advanced flight training, All Weather Flight School, and Jet Training, then-[[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Lawrence served as an [[F2H Banshee]] pilot with [[VF-193]] at [[NAS Moffett Field]] from March 1953 to October 1955. During this time, he deployed to Korea aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Oriskany|CVA-34|6}} from March to April 1953.

Bailey, were flying an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4B Phantom II]] aircraft, Bureau Number 152242, while leading an anti-aircraft suppression section during a raid northwest of [[Nam Dinh]], [[North Vietnam]]. Their aircraft was struck by an 85&nbsp;mm round while rolling in on target. Despite failing hydraulics, Lawrence and Bailey released their bombs, but part of the aircraft{{'}}s tail section separated while attempting to pull out of a dive. Both officers were forced to eject, were captured, and were held as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] at the [[H\u1ecfa L\u00f2 Prison]] (the ''Hanoi Hilton'') \u2013 until 1973, during which time they suffered repeated torture and beatings.

He developed a code by [[Tap code|tapping]] on the prison walls to communicate with other prisoners. Bailey was released on 18 February 1973 and Lawrence on 4 March 1973.<ref>Vietnam Air Losses, Chris Hobson, Midland Publishing, Hinckley, UK, c2001, p. 106, {{ISBN|1-85780-115-6}}</ref> Another fellow inmate was future presidential candidate and Senator [[John McCain]].

The Portuguese reached this area by sea in the mid-15th century, and began to dominate overseas trade.\n\nIn 1588, the claimant to the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese throne]], [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]], sold exclusive trade rights on the [[Gambia River]] to English merchants. [[Letters patent]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] confirmed the grant. In 1618, King [[James I of England]] granted a charter to an English company for trade with the Gambia and the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]). Between 1651 and 1661, some parts of the Gambia were under the rule of the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] belonging to [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\u2014modern-day [[Lithuania]]\u2014and were bought by Prince [[Jacob Kettler]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yevstratyev|first=O|date=2018|title=Chronological Dating of the Duchy of Courland's Colonial Policy|url=https://www.lvi.lu.lv/lv/LVIZ_2018_files/3_numurs/O_Yevstratyev_Chronological_LVIZ_2018_3.pdf|journal=Latvijas V\u0113stures Instit\u016bta \u017durn\u0101ls|volume=3|pages=34\u201372|access-date=22 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223074148/https://www.lvi.lu.lv/lv/LVIZ_2018_files/3_numurs/O_Yevstratyev_Chronological_LVIZ_2018_3.pdf|archive-date=23 February 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century, the [[British Empire]] and the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] struggled continually for political and commercial supremacy in the regions of the Senegal River and the Gambia River. The British Empire occupied the Gambia when an expedition led by [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] landed there following the [[Capture of Senegal]] in 1758. The 1783 [[Peace of Paris (1783)|First Treaty of Versailles]] gave Great Britain possession of the Gambia River, but the French retained a tiny enclave at [[Albreda]] on the river's north bank. This was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1856.\n\nAs many as three million people may have been taken as [[slavery|slaves]] from this general region during the three centuries that the [[transatlantic slave trade]] operated. It is not known how many people were taken as slaves by intertribal wars or Muslim traders before the transatlantic slave trade began. Most of those taken were sold by other Africans to Europeans: some were prisoners of intertribal wars; some were victims sold because of unpaid debts; and many others were simply victims of kidnapping.<ref>Park, Mungo ''Travels in the Interior of Africa'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5305 v.

From 1965 to 1994, the country was ostensibly a multi-party [[liberal democracy]]. It was ruled by [[Dawda Jawara]] and his [[People's Progressive Party (Gambia)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP). However, the country never experienced political turnover during this period and its commitment to succession by the ballot box was never tested.<ref>Edie, p. 162</ref> In 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] propelled a commission of military officers to power, known as the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC). After two years of direct rule, a new constitution was written and in 1996, the leader of the AFPRC, [[Yahya Jammeh]], was elected as President. He ruled in an authoritarian style until the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], which was won by [[Adama Barrow]], backed by a coalition of opposition parties.\n\n=== Political history ===\nDuring the Jawara era, there were initially four political parties, the PPP, the [[United Party (Gambia)|United Party]] (UP), the [[Democratic Party (Gambia)|Democratic Party]] (DP), and the [[Muslim Congress Party]] (MCP). The 1960 constitution had established a [[House of Representatives of the Gambia|House of Representatives]], and in the [[Gambian legislative election, 1960|1960 election]] no party won a majority of seats. However, in 1961 the British Governor chose UP leader [[Pierre Sarr N'Jie]] to serve as the country's first head of government, in the form of a Chief Minister. This was an unpopular decision, and the [[Gambian legislative election, 1962|1962 election]] was notable as parties were able to appeal to ethnic and religious differences across The Gambia. The PPP won a majority, and formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Congress Alliance]] (DCA; a merger of the DP and MCP). They invited the UP to the coalition in 1963, but it left in 1965.<ref name=\":0\">Edie, pp. 162\u2013164</ref>\n\nThe UP was seen as the main opposition party, but it lost power from 1965 to 1970. In 1975, the [[National Convention Party (Gambia)|National Convention Party]] (NCP) was formed by [[Sheriff Mustapha Dibba]], and became the new main opposition party to the PPP's dominance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both the PPP and NCP were ideologically similar, so in the 1980s a new opposition party emerged, in the form of the radical socialist [[People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism]] (PDOIS). However, between the 1966 and 1992 elections, the PPP was \"overwhelmingly dominant\", winning between 55% and 70% of the vote in each election and a large majority of seats continually.<ref>Edie, p. 165</ref>\n\nIn principle, competitive politics existed during the Jawara era, however, it was stated that there was in reality a \"one-party monopoly of state power centred around the dominant personality of Dawda Jawara.\" Civil society was limited post-independence, and opposition parties were weak and at the risk of being declared subversive. The opposition did not have equal access to resources, as the business class refused to finance them. The government had control over when they could make public announcements and press briefings, and there were also allegations of [[Electoral fraud|vote-buying]] and improprieties in the preparation of the [[Electoral roll|electoral register]]. A 1991 court challenge by the PDOIS against irregularities on the electoral register in Banjul was dismissed on a technicality.<ref>Edie, pp. 168\u2013170</ref>\n\nIn July 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought an end to the Jawara era. The [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC), led by [[Yahya Jammeh]], ruled dictatorially for two years. The council suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the populace.<ref>Edie, p. 182</ref> A transition back to democracy occurred in 1996, and a new constitution was written, though the process was manipulated to benefit Jammeh.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\">Edie, p. 185</ref> In a 1996 referendum, 70% of voters approved the constitution, and in December 1996 Jammeh was elected as President. All but PDOIS of the pre-coup parties were banned, and former ministers were barred from public office.<ref>Edie, p. 186</ref>\n\nDuring Jammeh's rule, the opposition was again fragmented. An example was the infighting between members of the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]] (NADD) that was formed in 2005. Jammeh used the police forces to harass opposition members and parties. Jammeh was also accused of human rights abuses, especially towards human rights activists, civil society organisations, political opponents, and the media. Their fates included being sent into exile, harassment, arbitrary imprisonment, murder, and forced disappearance. Particular examples include the murder of journalist [[Deyda Hydara]] in 2004, a [[April 2000 Gambian student massacre|student massacre at a protest]] in 2000, public threats to kill human rights defenders in 2009, and public threats towards homosexuals in 2013. Furthermore, Jammeh made threats to the religious freedom of non-Muslims, used 'mercenary judges' to weaken the judiciary, and faced numerous accusations of election rigging.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://cddwestafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/democratictransitioninthegambia.pdf|title=Democratic Transition in the Gambia: The Burden of Leadership and Consolidation|date=2017|website=Centre for Democracy and Development|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615004701/http://cddwestafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/democratictransitioninthegambia.pdf|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|December 2016 presidential election]], Jammeh was beaten by [[Adama Barrow]], who was backed by a [[Coalition 2016|coalition of opposition parties]].

They describe a \"fragile peace\" with tensions in rural areas between farmers and the larger communities. They also reported on tensions between ethnic groups developing. An example is that in February 2017, 51 supporters of Jammeh were arrested for harassing supporters of Barrow. Although his election was initially met with enthusiasm, the Centre notes that this has been dampened by Barrow's initial constitutional faux pas with his Vice President, the challenge of inclusion, and high expectations post-Jammeh.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Constitution ===\nThe Gambia has had a number of constitutions in its history. The two most significant are the 1970 constitution, which established The Gambia as a presidential republic, and the 1996 constitution, which served as a basis for Jammeh's rule and was kept following Barrow's victory in 2016. Jammeh manipulated the 1996 constitutional reform process to benefit himself. No reference was made to term limits, indicating Jammeh's preference to stay in power for an extended period of time.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\"/> According to the 1996 constitution, the President is the head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Jammeh and Barrow have also both taken on the role of Minister of Defence.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.easo.europa.eu/sites/default/files/coi-gambia.pdf|title=The Gambia: Country Focus|date=December 2017|website=European Asylum Support Office|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615004602/https://www.easo.europa.eu/sites/default/files/coi-gambia.pdf|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Presidency ===\nThe president appoints the vice president and cabinet of ministers and also chairs the cabinet. The office of Prime Minister was abolished in 1970. Total executive power is vested in the president. They can also appoint five members of the National Assembly, the judges of the superior courts, regional governors, and district chiefs. In terms of the civil service, they can appoint the Public Service Commission, the ombudsman, and the Independent Electoral Commission. The president is directly elected for five-year terms based on a simple majority of votes. There are no term limits.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Constitution is under review as of 2018 and a two-term limit and other changes required to enhance the governance structures are expected.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n\n{{Main|Foreign relations of The Gambia}}\n\n[[File:Yahya Jammeh with Obamas 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Yahya Jammeh]] and Mrs. Zeineb Jammeh with [[Barack Obama|Barack]] and [[Michelle Obama]] in the [[White House]], August 2014]]\n\nThe Gambia followed a formal policy of non-alignment throughout most of former President Jawara's tenure. It maintained close relations with the United Kingdom, Senegal, and other African countries. The July 1994 coup strained The Gambia's relationship with Western powers, particularly the United States, which until 2002 suspended most non-humanitarian assistance in accordance with Section 508 of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]]. After 1995 President Jammeh established diplomatic relations with several additional countries, including [[Libya]] (suspended in 2010), and [[Cuba]].<ref name=\"bn\">[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5459.htm \"Background note: The Gambia\"] .

It originally consisted of the Gambia National Army (GNA), trained by the British, and Gambia National Gendarmerie (GNG), trained by the Senegalese. The GNG was merged into the police in 1992, and in 1997 Jammeh created a Gambia Navy (GN). Attempts to create a [[Gambian Air Force|Gambia Air Force]] in the mid 2000s ultimately fell through. In 2008, Jammeh created a National Republican Guard, composed of special forces units. The GNA has a strength of roughly 900, in two infantry battalions and an engineering company. It makes use of [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] and [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured cars. The GN is equipped with patrol vessels, and [[Taiwan]] donated a number of new vessels to the force in 2013.\n\nSince the GAF was formed in 1985, it has been active in UN and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions. It has been classed as a Tier 2 peacekeeping contributor<ref name=\"BellamyWilliams\">Bellamy, Alex J. and Williams, Paul D.

It has since contributed troops to [[ECOMIL]], [[United Nations Mission in Liberia|UNMIL]], and [[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]. Responsibility for the military has rested directly with the President since Jammeh seized power at the head of a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup in 1994]]. Jammeh also created the role of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (The Gambia)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], who is the senior military officer responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Gambia Armed Forces. Between 1958 and 1985, the Gambia did not have a military, but the Gambia Field Force existed as a paramilitary wing of the police. The military tradition of the Gambia can be traced to the [[Gambia Regiment]] of the [[British Army]], that existed from 1901 to 1958 and fought in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In 2017, Gambia signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Gambia Armed Forces is and has been the recipient of a number of equipment and training agreements with other countries. In 1992, a contingent of Nigerian soldiers helped lead the GNA. Between 1991 and 2005, the Turkish armed forces helped train Gambian soldiers.

Serer religion encompasses cosmology and a belief in a supreme deity called [[Roog]]. Some of its religious festivals include the ''[[Xooy]]'', ''Mbosseh'', and ''Randou Rande''.

The national borders outline a narrow strip on either side of the River Gambia, a body of water that has played a vital part in the nation's destiny and is known locally simply as \"the River\". Without natural barriers, the Gambia has become home to most of the ethnic groups that are present throughout western Africa, especially those in Senegal.\n\nEuropeans also figure prominently in Gambian history because the River Gambia is navigable deep into the continent, a geographic feature that made this area one of the most profitable sites for the slave trade from the 15th through the 17th centuries. (It also made it strategic to the halt of this trade once it was outlawed in the 19th century.) Some of this history was popularised in the [[Alex Haley]] book and TV series ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'', which was set in the Gambia.\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Further|Music of the Gambia}}\n\nThe music of the Gambia is closely linked musically with [[Music of Senegal|that of its neighbour, Senegal]], which surrounds its inland frontiers completely. It fuses popular Western music and dance, with ''[[sabar]]'', the traditional drumming and dance music of the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] and [[Serer people]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n{{Main|Gambian cuisine}}\n\nThe cuisine of the Gambia includes peanuts, rice, fish, meat, onions, tomatoes, cassava, chili peppers and oysters from the River Gambia that are harvested by women.

The British Empire occupied the Gambia when an expedition led by [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] landed there following the [[Capture of Senegal]] in 1758. The 1783 [[Peace of Paris (1783)|First Treaty of Versailles]] gave Great Britain possession of the Gambia River, but the French retained a tiny enclave at [[Albreda]] on the river's north bank. This was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1856.\n\nAs many as three million people may have been taken as [[slavery|slaves]] from this general region during the three centuries that the [[transatlantic slave trade]] operated. It is not known how many people were taken as slaves by intertribal wars or Muslim traders before the transatlantic slave trade began. Most of those taken were sold by other Africans to Europeans: some were prisoners of intertribal wars; some were victims sold because of unpaid debts; and many others were simply victims of kidnapping.<ref>Park, Mungo ''Travels in the Interior of Africa'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5305 v.

From 1965 to 1994, the country was ostensibly a multi-party [[liberal democracy]]. It was ruled by [[Dawda Jawara]] and his [[People's Progressive Party (Gambia)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP). However, the country never experienced political turnover during this period and its commitment to succession by the ballot box was never tested.<ref>Edie, p. 162</ref> In 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] propelled a commission of military officers to power, known as the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC). After two years of direct rule, a new constitution was written and in 1996, the leader of the AFPRC, [[Yahya Jammeh]], was elected as President. He ruled in an authoritarian style until the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], which was won by [[Adama Barrow]], backed by a coalition of opposition parties.\n\n=== Political history ===\nDuring the Jawara era, there were initially four political parties, the PPP, the [[United Party (Gambia)|United Party]] (UP), the [[Democratic Party (Gambia)|Democratic Party]] (DP), and the [[Muslim Congress Party]] (MCP). The 1960 constitution had established a [[House of Representatives of the Gambia|House of Representatives]], and in the [[Gambian legislative election, 1960|1960 election]] no party won a majority of seats. However, in 1961 the British Governor chose UP leader [[Pierre Sarr N'Jie]] to serve as the country's first head of government, in the form of a Chief Minister. This was an unpopular decision, and the [[Gambian legislative election, 1962|1962 election]] was notable as parties were able to appeal to ethnic and religious differences across The Gambia. The PPP won a majority, and formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Congress Alliance]] (DCA; a merger of the DP and MCP). They invited the UP to the coalition in 1963, but it left in 1965.<ref name=\":0\">Edie, pp. 162\u2013164</ref>\n\nThe UP was seen as the main opposition party, but it lost power from 1965 to 1970. In 1975, the [[National Convention Party (Gambia)|National Convention Party]] (NCP) was formed by [[Sheriff Mustapha Dibba]], and became the new main opposition party to the PPP's dominance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both the PPP and NCP were ideologically similar, so in the 1980s a new opposition party emerged, in the form of the radical socialist [[People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism]] (PDOIS). However, between the 1966 and 1992 elections, the PPP was \"overwhelmingly dominant\", winning between 55% and 70% of the vote in each election and a large majority of seats continually.<ref>Edie, p. 165</ref>\n\nIn principle, competitive politics existed during the Jawara era, however, it was stated that there was in reality a \"one-party monopoly of state power centred around the dominant personality of Dawda Jawara.\" Civil society was limited post-independence, and opposition parties were weak and at the risk of being declared subversive. The opposition did not have equal access to resources, as the business class refused to finance them. The government had control over when they could make public announcements and press briefings, and there were also allegations of [[Electoral fraud|vote-buying]] and improprieties in the preparation of the [[Electoral roll|electoral register]]. A 1991 court challenge by the PDOIS against irregularities on the electoral register in Banjul was dismissed on a technicality.<ref>Edie, pp. 168\u2013170</ref>\n\nIn July 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought an end to the Jawara era. The [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC), led by [[Yahya Jammeh]], ruled dictatorially for two years. The council suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the populace.<ref>Edie, p. 182</ref> A transition back to democracy occurred in 1996, and a new constitution was written, though the process was manipulated to benefit Jammeh.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\">Edie, p. 185</ref> In a 1996 referendum, 70% of voters approved the constitution, and in December 1996 Jammeh was elected as President. All but PDOIS of the pre-coup parties were banned, and former ministers were barred from public office.<ref>Edie, p. 186</ref>\n\nDuring Jammeh's rule, the opposition was again fragmented. An example was the infighting between members of the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]] (NADD) that was formed in 2005. Jammeh used the police forces to harass opposition members and parties. Jammeh was also accused of human rights abuses, especially towards human rights activists, civil society organisations, political opponents, and the media.

Particular examples include the murder of journalist [[Deyda Hydara]] in 2004, a [[April 2000 Gambian student massacre|student massacre at a protest]] in 2000, public threats to kill human rights defenders in 2009, and public threats towards homosexuals in 2013. Furthermore, Jammeh made threats to the religious freedom of non-Muslims, used 'mercenary judges' to weaken the judiciary, and faced numerous accusations of election rigging.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://cddwestafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/democratictransitioninthegambia.pdf|title=Democratic Transition in the Gambia: The Burden of Leadership and Consolidation|date=2017|website=Centre for Democracy and Development|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615004701/http://cddwestafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/democratictransitioninthegambia.pdf|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|December 2016 presidential election]], Jammeh was beaten by [[Adama Barrow]], who was backed by a [[Coalition 2016|coalition of opposition parties]].

They describe a \"fragile peace\" with tensions in rural areas between farmers and the larger communities. They also reported on tensions between ethnic groups developing. An example is that in February 2017, 51 supporters of Jammeh were arrested for harassing supporters of Barrow. Although his election was initially met with enthusiasm, the Centre notes that this has been dampened by Barrow's initial constitutional faux pas with his Vice President, the challenge of inclusion, and high expectations post-Jammeh.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Constitution ===\nThe Gambia has had a number of constitutions in its history. The two most significant are the 1970 constitution, which established The Gambia as a presidential republic, and the 1996 constitution, which served as a basis for Jammeh's rule and was kept following Barrow's victory in 2016. Jammeh manipulated the 1996 constitutional reform process to benefit himself. No reference was made to term limits, indicating Jammeh's preference to stay in power for an extended period of time.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\"/> According to the 1996 constitution, the President is the head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

The office of Prime Minister was abolished in 1970. Total executive power is vested in the president. They can also appoint five members of the National Assembly, the judges of the superior courts, regional governors, and district chiefs. In terms of the civil service, they can appoint the Public Service Commission, the ombudsman, and the Independent Electoral Commission. The president is directly elected for five-year terms based on a simple majority of votes.

It maintained close relations with the United Kingdom, Senegal, and other African countries. The July 1994 coup strained The Gambia's relationship with Western powers, particularly the United States, which until 2002 suspended most non-humanitarian assistance in accordance with Section 508 of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]].

It originally consisted of the Gambia National Army (GNA), trained by the British, and Gambia National Gendarmerie (GNG), trained by the Senegalese. The GNG was merged into the police in 1992, and in 1997 Jammeh created a Gambia Navy (GN). Attempts to create a [[Gambian Air Force|Gambia Air Force]] in the mid 2000s ultimately fell through. In 2008, Jammeh created a National Republican Guard, composed of special forces units. The GNA has a strength of roughly 900, in two infantry battalions and an engineering company. It makes use of [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] and [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured cars. The GN is equipped with patrol vessels, and [[Taiwan]] donated a number of new vessels to the force in 2013.\n\nSince the GAF was formed in 1985, it has been active in UN and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions. It has been classed as a Tier 2 peacekeeping contributor<ref name=\"BellamyWilliams\">Bellamy, Alex J. and Williams, Paul D.

It has since contributed troops to [[ECOMIL]], [[United Nations Mission in Liberia|UNMIL]], and [[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]. Responsibility for the military has rested directly with the President since Jammeh seized power at the head of a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup in 1994]]. Jammeh also created the role of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (The Gambia)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], who is the senior military officer responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Gambia Armed Forces. Between 1958 and 1985, the Gambia did not have a military, but the Gambia Field Force existed as a paramilitary wing of the police. The military tradition of the Gambia can be traced to the [[Gambia Regiment]] of the [[British Army]], that existed from 1901 to 1958 and fought in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In 2017, Gambia signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Gambia Armed Forces is and has been the recipient of a number of equipment and training agreements with other countries. In 1992, a contingent of Nigerian soldiers helped lead the GNA. Between 1991 and 2005, the Turkish armed forces helped train Gambian soldiers.

The national borders outline a narrow strip on either side of the River Gambia, a body of water that has played a vital part in the nation's destiny and is known locally simply as \"the River\". Without natural barriers, the Gambia has become home to most of the ethnic groups that are present throughout western Africa, especially those in Senegal.\n\nEuropeans also figure prominently in Gambian history because the River Gambia is navigable deep into the continent, a geographic feature that made this area one of the most profitable sites for the slave trade from the 15th through the 17th centuries. (It also made it strategic to the halt of this trade once it was outlawed in the 19th century.) Some of this history was popularised in the [[Alex Haley]] book and TV series ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'', which was set in the Gambia.\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Further|Music of the Gambia}}\n\nThe music of the Gambia is closely linked musically with [[Music of Senegal|that of its neighbour, Senegal]], which surrounds its inland frontiers completely.

General [[theory of relativity|relativity]] generalizes [[special relativity]] and refines [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[time in physics|time]], or [[spacetime]]. In particular, the ''{{vanchor|[[curvature]] of spacetime|Spacetime curvature|curvature of spacetime}}'' is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s.\n\nSome predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of [[classical physics]], especially concerning the passage of time, the [[geometry]] of space, the motion of bodies in [[free fall]], and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational lens]]ing, the [[gravitational redshift]] of light, and the [[Shapiro delay|gravitational time delay]]. The predictions of general relativity in relation to classical physics have been [[tests of general relativity|confirmed]] in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity is [[Alternatives to general relativity|not the only relativistic theory of gravity]], it is the [[Occam's razor|simplest theory]] that is consistent with [[experimental data]]. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how ''general relativity'' can be reconciled with the laws of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of [[quantum gravity]].\n\nEinstein's theory has important [[astrophysical]] implications. For example, it implies the existence of black holes\u2014regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape\u2014as an end-state for [[massive star]]s. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes. For example, [[microquasar]]s and [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] result from the presence of [[stellar black hole]]s and [[supermassive black hole]]s, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of [[gravitational wave]]s, which have since been [[List of gravitational wave observations|observed directly]] by the physics collaboration [[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory|LIGO]]. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of a consistently [[Metric expansion of space|expanding universe]].\n\n<!-- Before any further attempt of deleting the following claim, please, note its sources in the History-section, and the conclusive consensus on the TP. -->\nWidely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary beauty, general relativity has often been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of general relativity|Classical theories of gravitation}}\n\nSoon after publishing the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate [[gravity]] into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple [[thought experiment]] involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the [[Prussian Academy of Science]] in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations.<ref>O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.

Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist [[Karl Schwarzschild]] found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the [[Schwarzschild metric]]. This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to [[electrical charge|electrically charged]] objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], now associated with [[charged black hole|electrically charged black holes]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916a}}, {{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916b}} and {{Harvnb|Reissner|1916}} (later complemented in {{Harvnb|Nordstr\u00f6m|1918}})</ref> In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the [[universe]] as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations\u2014the [[cosmological constant]]\u2014to match that observational presumption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Einstein|1917}}, cf. {{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 15e}}</ref> By 1929, however, the work of [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]] in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre]] used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the [[Big Bang]] models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state.<ref>Hubble's original article is {{Harvnb|Hubble|1929}}; an accessible overview is given in {{Harvnb|Singh|2004|loc=ch. 2\u20134}}</ref> Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.<ref>As reported in {{Harvnb|Gamow|1970}}. Einstein's condemnation would prove to be premature, cf. the section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]], below</ref>\n\nDuring that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to [[Newtonian gravity]], being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous perihelion advance]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] without any arbitrary parameters (\"[[wikt:fudge factor|fudge factors]]\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|pp=253\u2013254}}</ref> Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by [[Arthur Eddington|Eddington]] confirmed general relativity's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Kennefick|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Kennefick|2007}}</ref> making Einstein instantly famous.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 16}}</ref> Yet the theory entered the mainstream of [[theoretical physics]] and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now known as the [[History of general relativity#More about GR history|golden age of general relativity]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The future of theoretical physics and cosmology: celebrating Stephen Hawking's 60th birthday |first1=Kip |last1=Thorne |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-82081-3 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC|ref=harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC&pg=PA74 Extract of page 74]</ref> Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify [[quasar]]s as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Israel|1987|loc=ch. 7.8\u20137.10}}, {{Harvnb|Thorne|1994|loc=ch. 3\u20139}}</ref> Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power,<ref>Sections [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|Orbital effects and the relativity of direction]], [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]] and [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|Light deflection and gravitational time delay]], and references therein</ref> and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.<ref>Section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]] and references therein; the historical development is in {{Harvnb|Overbye|1999}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, general relativity has acquired a reputation as a theory of extraordinary beauty.<ref name=\":0\">{{Harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1975|loc=p. 228}} \"...the ''general theory of relativity''...was established by Einstein, and represents probably the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.\"</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=p. 3}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rovelli|2015|loc=pp. 1\u20136}} \"General relativity is not just an extraordinarily beautiful physical theory providing the best description of the gravitational interaction we have so far.

It juxtaposes fundamental concepts (space and time ''versus'' matter and motion) which had previously been considered as entirely independent. Chandrasekhar also noted that Einstein's only guides in his search for an exact theory were the principle of equivalence and his sense that a proper description of gravity should be geometrical at its basis, so that there was an \"element of revelation\" in the manner in which Einstein arrived at his theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1984|loc=p. 6}}</ref> Other elements of beauty associated with the general theory of relativity are its simplicity, symmetry, the manner in which it incorporates invariance and unification, and its perfect logical consistency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Engler|2002}}</ref>\n\n==From classical mechanics to general relativity==\nGeneral relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.<ref>The following exposition re-traces that of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1}}</ref>\n\n===Geometry of Newtonian gravity<!--'Einstein's elevator experiment' redirects here-->===\n[[File:Elevator gravity.svg|thumb|According to general relativity, objects in a gravitational field behave similarly to objects within an accelerating enclosure. For example, an observer will see a ball fall the same way in a rocket (left) as it does on Earth (right), provided that the acceleration of the rocket is equal to 9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth).]]\nAt the base of [[classical mechanics]] is the notion that a [[physical body|body]]'s motion can be described as a combination of free (or [[inertia]]l) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second [[Newton's laws of motion|law of motion]], which states that the net [[force]] acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) [[mass]] multiplied by its [[acceleration]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnold|1989|loc=ch. 1}}</ref> The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard [[frame of reference|reference frames]] of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are [[geodesic]]s, straight [[world lines]] in curved spacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=5f}}</ref>\n\nConversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[friction]]), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time [[coordinate]]. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]] and its successors (see [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak [[equivalence principle]], or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a [[test body]] in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=sec. 2.4}}, {{Harvnb|Will|2006|loc=sec. 2}}</ref> A simplified version of this is embodied in '''Einstein's elevator experiment'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}</ref>\n\nGiven the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time\u2014in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] which depends on the [[gradient]] of the [[gravitational potential]]. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]]. However, space''time'' as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not [[integrable systems|integrable]]. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting [[Newton\u2013Cartan theory]] is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors#Informal usage|covariant]] concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.2}}, {{Harvnb|Havas|1964}}, {{Harvnb|K\u00fcnzle|1972}}. The simple thought experiment in question was first described in {{Harvnb|Heckmann|Sch\u00fccking|1959}}</ref> In this geometric description, [[tidal effect]]s\u2014the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall\u2014are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=10f}}</ref>\n\n===Relativistic generalization===\n[[File:Light cone.svg|thumb|left|upright|[[Light cone]]]]\nAs intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a [[limiting case (philosophy of science)|limiting case]] of (special) relativistic mechanics.<ref>Good introductions are, in order of increasing presupposed knowledge of mathematics, {{Harvnb|Giulini|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005}}, and {{Harvnb|Rindler|1991}}; for accounts of precision experiments, cf. part IV of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|L\u00e4mmerzahl|2006}}</ref> In the language of [[symmetry]]: where gravity can be neglected, physics is [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] as in special relativity rather than [[Galilean invariance|Galilei invariant]] as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the [[speed of light]], and with high-energy phenomena.<ref>An in-depth comparison between the two symmetry groups can be found in {{Harvnb|Giulini|2006}}</ref>\n\nWith Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play. They are defined by the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each [[event (relativity)|event]] {{math|A}}, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by {{math|A}} via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event {{math|B}} in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event {{math|C}} in the image). These sets are observer-independent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|1991|loc=sec. 22}}, {{Harvnb|Synge|1972|loc=ch. 1 and 2}}</ref> In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space\u2013time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a [[conformal structure]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 2.3}}</ref> or conformal geometry.\n\nSpecial relativity is defined in the absence of gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global [[inertial frame]]s. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight [[time-like]] lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}}, {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 5.1}}</ref>\n\nA priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold\u2014that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|below]]). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=17ff}}; a derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005|loc=ch. 12}}. For the experimental evidence, cf. the section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]], below</ref> The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the [[Equivalence Principle#The Einstein equivalence principle|Einstein equivalence principle]], a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 1.13}}; for an elementary account, see {{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}; there are, however, some differences between the modern version and Einstein's original concept used in the historical derivation of general relativity, cf. {{Harvnb|Norton|1985}}</ref>\n\nThe same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field\u2014[[proper time]], to give the technical term\u2014does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the [[Minkowski metric]]. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] that defines the geometry\u2014in particular, how lengths and angles are measured\u2014is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or [[pseudo-Riemannian]] metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the [[Levi-Civita connection]], and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable [[Local reference frame|locally inertial coordinates]], the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}} for the experimental evidence, see once more section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]]. Choosing a different connection with non-zero [[torsion tensor|torsion]] leads to a modified theory known as [[Einstein\u2013Cartan theory]]</ref>\n\n===Einstein's equations===\n{{Main|Einstein field equations|Mathematics of general relativity}}\n\nHaving formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains. In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass. In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the [[energy\u2013momentum tensor]], which includes both [[energy density|energy]] and momentum [[density|densities]] as well as [[stress (physics)|stress]]: [[pressure]] and shear.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|p=16}}, {{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.2}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=sec. 2.8}}</ref> Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime. Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the [[field equation]] for gravity relates this tensor and the [[Ricci curvature|Ricci tensor]], which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely. In special relativity, [[conservation of energy]]\u2013momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy\u2013momentum tensor is [[divergence]]-free. This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-[[manifold]] counterparts, [[covariant derivative]]s studied in differential geometry. With this additional condition\u2014the covariant divergence of the energy\u2013momentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero\u2014 the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Einstein's field equations'''\n|equation=<math>G_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu} - {\\textstyle 1 \\over 2}R\\,g_{\\mu\\nu} = {8 \\pi G \\over c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = #50C878\n|background colour = #ECFCF4}}\n\nOn the left-hand side is the [[Einstein tensor]], a specific divergence-free combination of the Ricci tensor <math>R_{\\mu\\nu}</math> and the metric.

All tensors are written in [[abstract index notation]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=19\u201322}}; for similar derivations, see sections 1 and 2 of ch. 7 in {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972}}. The Einstein tensor is the only divergence-free tensor that is a function of the metric coefficients, their first and second derivatives at most, and allows the spacetime of special relativity as a solution in the absence of sources of gravity, cf. {{Harvnb|Lovelock|1972}}. The tensors on both side are of second rank, that is, they can each be thought of as 4\u00d74 matrices, each of which contains ten independent terms; hence, the above represents ten coupled equations. The fact that, as a consequence of geometric relations known as [[Bianchi identities]], the Einstein tensor satisfies a further four identities reduces these to six independent equations, e.g. {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 8.3}}</ref> Matching the theory's prediction to observational results for [[planet]]ary [[orbit]]s or, equivalently, assuring that the weak-gravity, low-speed limit is Newtonian mechanics, the proportionality constant can be fixed as <math>\\kappa = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4}</math>, where <math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]] and <math>c</math> the speed of light in vacuum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.4}}</ref> When there is no matter present, so that the energy\u2013momentum tensor vanishes, the results are the vacuum Einstein equations,\n\n:<math>R_{\\mu\\nu}=0.\\,</math>\n\nIn general relativity, the [[world line]] of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational force is a particular type of geodesic in curved spacetime.

Greek indices may take the values: 0, 1, 2, 3 and the [[summation convention]] is used for repeated indices <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>. The quantity on the left-hand-side of this equation is the acceleration of a particle, and so this equation is analogous to [[Newton's laws of motion]] which likewise provide formulae for the acceleration of a particle. This equation of motion employs the [[Einstein notation]], meaning that repeated indices are summed (i.e. from zero to three). The Christoffel symbols are functions of the four space-time coordinates, and so are independent of the velocity or acceleration or other characteristics of a [[test particle]] whose motion is described by the geodesic equation.\n\n===Alternatives to general relativity===\n{{Main|Alternatives to general relativity}}\nThere are [[alternatives to general relativity]] built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations.

At its core are [[Einstein's equations]], which describe the relation between the geometry of a four-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] representing spacetime, and the [[Stress\u2013energy tensor|energy\u2013momentum]] contained in that spacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=ch. 4}},\n{{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=ch. 7}} or, in fact, any other textbook on general relativity</ref> Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as [[free-fall]], orbital motion, and [[spacecraft]] [[Trajectory|trajectories]]), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow.<ref>At least approximately, cf. {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}</ref> The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy\u2013momentum of matter.

Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy\u2013momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.<ref>Introductory chapters of {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}</ref>\n\nEinstein's equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and, as such, difficult to solve exactly.<ref>A review showing Einstein's equation in the broader context of other PDEs with physical significance is {{Harvnb|Geroch|1996}}</ref> Nevertheless, a number of [[exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] are known, although only a few have direct physical applications.<ref>For background information and a list of solutions, cf. {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}; a more recent review can be found in {{Harvnb|MacCallum|2006}}</ref> The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the [[Schwarzschild solution]], the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution and the [[Kerr metric]], each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3,5,6}}</ref> and the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker]] and [[de Sitter universe]]s, each describing an expanding cosmos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=ch. 4, sec. 3.3}}</ref> Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the [[G\u00f6del metric|G\u00f6del universe]] (which opens up the intriguing possibility of [[time travel]] in curved spacetimes), the [[Taub-NUT solution]] (a model universe that is [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], but [[anisotropic]]), and [[anti-de Sitter space]] (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the [[Maldacena conjecture]]).<ref>Brief descriptions of these and further interesting solutions can be found in {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=ch. 5}}</ref>\n\nGiven the difficulty of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by [[numerical integration]] on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions.

The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light.

No influence from an event ''A'' can reach any other location ''X'' before light sent out at ''A'' to ''X''. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines ([[Geodesic (general relativity)|null geodesics]]) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using [[Penrose diagram|Penrose\u2013Carter diagrams]] in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk (\"[[Compactification (mathematics)|compactified]]\") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard [[spacetime diagram]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frauendiener|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.1}}, {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 6.8, 6.9}}</ref>\n\nAware of the importance of causal structure, [[Roger Penrose]] and others developed what is known as [[global geometry]]. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the [[Raychaudhuri equation]], and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of [[energy conditions]]) are used to derive general results.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 9.2\u20139.4}} and {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=ch. 6}}</ref>\n\n===Horizons===\n{{Main|Horizon (general relativity)|No hair theorem|Black hole mechanics}}\nUsing global geometry, some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called [[event horizon|horizons]], which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the [[hoop conjecture]], the relevant length scale is the [[Schwarzschild radius]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Thorne|1972}}; for more recent numerical studies, see {{Harvnb|Berger|2002|loc=sec. 2.1}}</ref>), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's ''horizon'', is not a physical barrier.<ref>{{Harvnb|Israel|1987}}. A more exact mathematical description distinguishes several kinds of horizon, notably event horizons and [[apparent horizon]]s cf. {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|pp=312\u2013320}} or {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 12.2}}; there are also more intuitive definitions for isolated systems that do not require knowledge of spacetime properties at infinity, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Krishnan|2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|left|The ergosphere of a rotating black hole, which plays a key role when it comes to extracting energy from such a black hole]]\nEarly studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein's equations, notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution (used to describe a [[Static spacetime|static]] black hole) and the axisymmetric [[Kerr solution]] (used to describe a rotating, [[Stationary spacetime|stationary]] black hole, and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere). Using global geometry, later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes. With time they become rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying: electric charge, mass-energy, [[linear momentum]], [[angular momentum]], and location at a specified time. This is stated by the [[no hair theorem|black hole uniqueness theorem]]: \"black holes have no hair\", that is, no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans. Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole, the object that results (having emitted gravitational waves) is very simple.<ref>For first steps, cf. {{Harvnb|Israel|1971}}; see {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 9.3}} or {{Harvnb|Heusler|1996|loc=ch. 9 and 10}} for a derivation, and {{Harvnb|Heusler|1998}} as well as {{Harvnb|Beig|Chru\u015bciel|2006}} as overviews of more recent results</ref>\n\nEven more remarkably, there is a general set of laws known as [[black hole mechanics]], which is analogous to the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the [[entropy]] of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the [[Penrose process]]).<ref>The laws of black hole mechanics were first described in {{Harvnb|Bardeen|Carter|Hawking|1973}}; a more pedagogical presentation can be found in {{Harvnb|Carter|1979}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 2}}. A thorough, book-length introduction including an introduction to the necessary mathematics {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}. For the Penrose process, see {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}</ref> There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1973}}, {{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1974}}</ref> This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease\u2014as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit [[thermal radiation]]. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in [[Planck's law]]. This radiation is known as [[Hawking radiation]] (cf. the [[General relativity#Quantum field theory in curved spacetime|quantum theory section]], below).<ref>The fact that black holes radiate, quantum mechanically, was first derived in {{Harvnb|Hawking|1975}}; a more thorough derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Wald|1975}}. A review is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 3}}</ref>\n\nThere are other types of horizons. In an expanding universe, an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed (\"[[particle horizon]]\"), and some regions of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon).<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=sec. 4.4.4, 4.4.5}}</ref> Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer ([[Rindler space]]), there will be horizons associated with a semi-classical radiation known as [[Unruh effect|Unruh radiation]].<ref>Horizons: cf. {{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 12.4}}. Unruh effect: {{Harvnb|Unruh|1976}}, cf. {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 3}}</ref>\n\n===Singularities===\n{{Main|Spacetime singularity}}\nAnother general feature of general relativity is the appearance of spacetime boundaries known as singularities. Spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and lightlike geodesics\u2014all possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel. But some solutions of Einstein's equations have \"ragged edges\"\u2014regions known as [[spacetime singularity|spacetime singularities]], where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end, and geometry becomes ill-defined. In the more interesting cases, these are \"curvature singularities\", where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature, such as the [[Ricci scalar]], take on infinite values.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 8.1}}, {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 9.1}}</ref> Well-known examples of spacetimes with future singularities\u2014where worldlines end\u2014are the Schwarzschild solution, which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole,<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 2}}; a more extensive treatment of this solution can be found in {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3}}</ref> or the Kerr solution with its ring-shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 4}}; for a more extensive treatment, cf. {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 6}}</ref> The Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin, namely Big Bang singularities, and some have future singularities ([[Big Crunch]]) as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellis|Van Elst|1999}}; a closer look at the singularity itself is taken in {{Harvnb|B\u00f6rner|1993|loc=sec. 1.2}}</ref>\n\nGiven that these examples are all highly symmetric\u2014and thus simplified\u2014it is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization.<ref>Here one should remind to the well-known fact that the important  \"quasi-optical\" singularities of the so-called [[eikonal approximation]]s of many wave-equations, namely the \"[[caustic (mathematics)|caustics]]\", are resolved into finite peaks beyond that approximation.</ref> The famous [[singularity theorems]], proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage<ref>Namely when there are [[trapped null surface]]s, cf. {{Harvnb|Penrose|1965}}</ref> and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|1966}}</ref> However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the [[BKL singularity|BKL conjecture]]).<ref>The conjecture was made in {{Harvnb|Belinskii|Khalatnikov|Lifschitz|1971}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Berger|2002}}. An accessible exposition is given by {{Harvnb|Garfinkle|2007}}</ref> The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.<ref>The restriction to future singularities naturally excludes initial singularities such as the big bang singularity, which in principle be visible to observers at later cosmic time. The cosmic censorship conjecture was first presented in {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}; a textbook-level account is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=302\u2013305}}. For numerical results, see the review {{Harvnb|Berger|2002|loc=sec. 2.1}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution equations===\n{{Main|Initial value formulation (general relativity)}}\n\nEach solution of Einstein's equation encompasses the whole history of a universe&nbsp;\u2014 it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the [[time evolution]] of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a [[coordinate condition]], which is analogous to [[gauge fixing]] in other field theories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 7.1}}</ref>\n\nTo understand Einstein's equations as partial differential equations, it is helpful to formulate them in a way that describes the evolution of the universe over time. This is done in \"3+1\" formulations, where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension. The best-known example is the [[ADM formalism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a721.4\u2013\u00a721.7}}</ref> These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved: solutions always [[existence theorem|exist]], and are uniquely defined, once suitable initial conditions have been specified.<ref>{{Harvnb|Four\u00e8s-Bruhat|1952}} and {{Harvnb|Bruhat|1962}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=ch. 10}}; an online review can be found in {{Harvnb|Reula|1998}}</ref> Such formulations of Einstein's field equations are the basis of numerical relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gourgoulhon|2007}}; for a review of the basics of numerical relativity, including the problems arising from the peculiarities of Einstein's equations, see {{Harvnb|Lehner|2001}}</ref>\n\n===Global and quasi-local quantities===\n{{Main|Mass in general relativity}}\nThe notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field\u2014like any physical field\u2014must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a720.4}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, there are possibilities to define a system's total mass, either using a hypothetical \"infinitely distant observer\" ([[ADM mass]])<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}</ref> or suitable symmetries ([[Komar mass]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Komar|1959}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}; although defined in a totally different way, it can be shown to be equivalent to the ADM mass for stationary spacetimes, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Magnon-Ashtekar|1979}}</ref> If one excludes from the system's total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves, the result is the [[Mass in general relativity#ADM and Bondi masses in asymptotically flat space-times|Bondi mass]] at null infinity.<ref>For a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}</ref> Just as in [[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical physics]], it can be shown that these masses are positive.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|p=295 and refs therein}}; this is important for questions of stability\u2014if there were [[negative mass]] states, then flat, empty Minkowski space, which has mass zero, could evolve into these states</ref> Corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 5}}</ref> There have also been a number of attempts to define ''quasi-local'' quantities, such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system.

General [[theory of relativity|relativity]] generalizes [[special relativity]] and refines [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[time in physics|time]], or [[spacetime]]. In particular, the ''{{vanchor|[[curvature]] of spacetime|Spacetime curvature|curvature of spacetime}}'' is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s.\n\nSome predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of [[classical physics]], especially concerning the passage of time, the [[geometry]] of space, the motion of bodies in [[free fall]], and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational lens]]ing, the [[gravitational redshift]] of light, and the [[Shapiro delay|gravitational time delay]]. The predictions of general relativity in relation to classical physics have been [[tests of general relativity|confirmed]] in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity is [[Alternatives to general relativity|not the only relativistic theory of gravity]], it is the [[Occam's razor|simplest theory]] that is consistent with [[experimental data]]. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how ''general relativity'' can be reconciled with the laws of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of [[quantum gravity]].\n\nEinstein's theory has important [[astrophysical]] implications. For example, it implies the existence of black holes\u2014regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape\u2014as an end-state for [[massive star]]s. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes. For example, [[microquasar]]s and [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] result from the presence of [[stellar black hole]]s and [[supermassive black hole]]s, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of [[gravitational wave]]s, which have since been [[List of gravitational wave observations|observed directly]] by the physics collaboration [[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory|LIGO]]. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of a consistently [[Metric expansion of space|expanding universe]].\n\n<!-- Before any further attempt of deleting the following claim, please, note its sources in the History-section, and the conclusive consensus on the TP. -->\nWidely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary beauty, general relativity has often been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of general relativity|Classical theories of gravitation}}\n\nSoon after publishing the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate [[gravity]] into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple [[thought experiment]] involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the [[Prussian Academy of Science]] in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations.<ref>O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.

But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist [[Karl Schwarzschild]] found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the [[Schwarzschild metric]]. This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to [[electrical charge|electrically charged]] objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], now associated with [[charged black hole|electrically charged black holes]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916a}}, {{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916b}} and {{Harvnb|Reissner|1916}} (later complemented in {{Harvnb|Nordstr\u00f6m|1918}})</ref> In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the [[universe]] as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations\u2014the [[cosmological constant]]\u2014to match that observational presumption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Einstein|1917}}, cf. {{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 15e}}</ref> By 1929, however, the work of [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]] in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre]] used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the [[Big Bang]] models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state.<ref>Hubble's original article is {{Harvnb|Hubble|1929}}; an accessible overview is given in {{Harvnb|Singh|2004|loc=ch. 2\u20134}}</ref> Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.<ref>As reported in {{Harvnb|Gamow|1970}}. Einstein's condemnation would prove to be premature, cf. the section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]], below</ref>\n\nDuring that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to [[Newtonian gravity]], being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous perihelion advance]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] without any arbitrary parameters (\"[[wikt:fudge factor|fudge factors]]\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|pp=253\u2013254}}</ref> Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by [[Arthur Eddington|Eddington]] confirmed general relativity's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Kennefick|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Kennefick|2007}}</ref> making Einstein instantly famous.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 16}}</ref> Yet the theory entered the mainstream of [[theoretical physics]] and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now known as the [[History of general relativity#More about GR history|golden age of general relativity]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The future of theoretical physics and cosmology: celebrating Stephen Hawking's 60th birthday |first1=Kip |last1=Thorne |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-82081-3 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC|ref=harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC&pg=PA74 Extract of page 74]</ref> Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify [[quasar]]s as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Israel|1987|loc=ch. 7.8\u20137.10}}, {{Harvnb|Thorne|1994|loc=ch. 3\u20139}}</ref> Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power,<ref>Sections [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|Orbital effects and the relativity of direction]], [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]] and [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|Light deflection and gravitational time delay]], and references therein</ref> and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.<ref>Section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]] and references therein; the historical development is in {{Harvnb|Overbye|1999}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, general relativity has acquired a reputation as a theory of extraordinary beauty.<ref name=\":0\">{{Harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1975|loc=p. 228}} \"...the ''general theory of relativity''...was established by Einstein, and represents probably the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.\"</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=p. 3}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rovelli|2015|loc=pp. 1\u20136}} \"General relativity is not just an extraordinarily beautiful physical theory providing the best description of the gravitational interaction we have so far.

It juxtaposes fundamental concepts (space and time ''versus'' matter and motion) which had previously been considered as entirely independent. Chandrasekhar also noted that Einstein's only guides in his search for an exact theory were the principle of equivalence and his sense that a proper description of gravity should be geometrical at its basis, so that there was an \"element of revelation\" in the manner in which Einstein arrived at his theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1984|loc=p. 6}}</ref> Other elements of beauty associated with the general theory of relativity are its simplicity, symmetry, the manner in which it incorporates invariance and unification, and its perfect logical consistency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Engler|2002}}</ref>\n\n==From classical mechanics to general relativity==\nGeneral relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.<ref>The following exposition re-traces that of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1}}</ref>\n\n===Geometry of Newtonian gravity<!--'Einstein's elevator experiment' redirects here-->===\n[[File:Elevator gravity.svg|thumb|According to general relativity, objects in a gravitational field behave similarly to objects within an accelerating enclosure. For example, an observer will see a ball fall the same way in a rocket (left) as it does on Earth (right), provided that the acceleration of the rocket is equal to 9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth).]]\nAt the base of [[classical mechanics]] is the notion that a [[physical body|body]]'s motion can be described as a combination of free (or [[inertia]]l) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second [[Newton's laws of motion|law of motion]], which states that the net [[force]] acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) [[mass]] multiplied by its [[acceleration]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnold|1989|loc=ch. 1}}</ref> The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard [[frame of reference|reference frames]] of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are [[geodesic]]s, straight [[world lines]] in curved spacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=5f}}</ref>\n\nConversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[friction]]), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time [[coordinate]]. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]] and its successors (see [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak [[equivalence principle]], or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a [[test body]] in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=sec. 2.4}}, {{Harvnb|Will|2006|loc=sec. 2}}</ref> A simplified version of this is embodied in '''Einstein's elevator experiment'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}</ref>\n\nGiven the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time\u2014in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] which depends on the [[gradient]] of the [[gravitational potential]]. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]]. However, space''time'' as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not [[integrable systems|integrable]]. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting [[Newton\u2013Cartan theory]] is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors#Informal usage|covariant]] concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.2}}, {{Harvnb|Havas|1964}}, {{Harvnb|K\u00fcnzle|1972}}. The simple thought experiment in question was first described in {{Harvnb|Heckmann|Sch\u00fccking|1959}}</ref> In this geometric description, [[tidal effect]]s\u2014the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall\u2014are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=10f}}</ref>\n\n===Relativistic generalization===\n[[File:Light cone.svg|thumb|left|upright|[[Light cone]]]]\nAs intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a [[limiting case (philosophy of science)|limiting case]] of (special) relativistic mechanics.<ref>Good introductions are, in order of increasing presupposed knowledge of mathematics, {{Harvnb|Giulini|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005}}, and {{Harvnb|Rindler|1991}}; for accounts of precision experiments, cf. part IV of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|L\u00e4mmerzahl|2006}}</ref> In the language of [[symmetry]]: where gravity can be neglected, physics is [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] as in special relativity rather than [[Galilean invariance|Galilei invariant]] as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the [[speed of light]], and with high-energy phenomena.<ref>An in-depth comparison between the two symmetry groups can be found in {{Harvnb|Giulini|2006}}</ref>\n\nWith Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play. They are defined by the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each [[event (relativity)|event]] {{math|A}}, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by {{math|A}} via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event {{math|B}} in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event {{math|C}} in the image). These sets are observer-independent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|1991|loc=sec. 22}}, {{Harvnb|Synge|1972|loc=ch. 1 and 2}}</ref> In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space\u2013time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a [[conformal structure]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 2.3}}</ref> or conformal geometry.\n\nSpecial relativity is defined in the absence of gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global [[inertial frame]]s. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight [[time-like]] lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}}, {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 5.1}}</ref>\n\nA priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold\u2014that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|below]]). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=17ff}}; a derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005|loc=ch. 12}}. For the experimental evidence, cf. the section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]], below</ref> The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the [[Equivalence Principle#The Einstein equivalence principle|Einstein equivalence principle]], a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 1.13}}; for an elementary account, see {{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}; there are, however, some differences between the modern version and Einstein's original concept used in the historical derivation of general relativity, cf. {{Harvnb|Norton|1985}}</ref>\n\nThe same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field\u2014[[proper time]], to give the technical term\u2014does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the [[Minkowski metric]]. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] that defines the geometry\u2014in particular, how lengths and angles are measured\u2014is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or [[pseudo-Riemannian]] metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the [[Levi-Civita connection]], and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable [[Local reference frame|locally inertial coordinates]], the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}} for the experimental evidence, see once more section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]]. Choosing a different connection with non-zero [[torsion tensor|torsion]] leads to a modified theory known as [[Einstein\u2013Cartan theory]]</ref>\n\n===Einstein's equations===\n{{Main|Einstein field equations|Mathematics of general relativity}}\n\nHaving formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains. In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass. In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the [[energy\u2013momentum tensor]], which includes both [[energy density|energy]] and momentum [[density|densities]] as well as [[stress (physics)|stress]]: [[pressure]] and shear.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|p=16}}, {{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.2}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=sec. 2.8}}</ref> Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime. Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the [[field equation]] for gravity relates this tensor and the [[Ricci curvature|Ricci tensor]], which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely. In special relativity, [[conservation of energy]]\u2013momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy\u2013momentum tensor is [[divergence]]-free. This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-[[manifold]] counterparts, [[covariant derivative]]s studied in differential geometry. With this additional condition\u2014the covariant divergence of the energy\u2013momentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero\u2014 the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Einstein's field equations'''\n|equation=<math>G_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu} - {\\textstyle 1 \\over 2}R\\,g_{\\mu\\nu} = {8 \\pi G \\over c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = #50C878\n|background colour = #ECFCF4}}\n\nOn the left-hand side is the [[Einstein tensor]], a specific divergence-free combination of the Ricci tensor <math>R_{\\mu\\nu}</math> and the metric.

The Ricci tensor itself is related to the more general [[Riemann curvature tensor]] as\n\n:<math>R_{\\mu\\nu}={R^\\alpha}_{\\mu\\alpha\\nu}.\\,</math>\n\nOn the right-hand side, ''<math>T_{\\mu\\nu}</math>'' is the energy\u2013momentum tensor. All tensors are written in [[abstract index notation]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=19\u201322}}; for similar derivations, see sections 1 and 2 of ch. 7 in {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972}}. The Einstein tensor is the only divergence-free tensor that is a function of the metric coefficients, their first and second derivatives at most, and allows the spacetime of special relativity as a solution in the absence of sources of gravity, cf. {{Harvnb|Lovelock|1972}}. The tensors on both side are of second rank, that is, they can each be thought of as 4\u00d74 matrices, each of which contains ten independent terms; hence, the above represents ten coupled equations. The fact that, as a consequence of geometric relations known as [[Bianchi identities]], the Einstein tensor satisfies a further four identities reduces these to six independent equations, e.g. {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 8.3}}</ref> Matching the theory's prediction to observational results for [[planet]]ary [[orbit]]s or, equivalently, assuring that the weak-gravity, low-speed limit is Newtonian mechanics, the proportionality constant can be fixed as <math>\\kappa = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4}</math>, where <math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]] and <math>c</math> the speed of light in vacuum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.4}}</ref> When there is no matter present, so that the energy\u2013momentum tensor vanishes, the results are the vacuum Einstein equations,\n\n:<math>R_{\\mu\\nu}=0.\\,</math>\n\nIn general relativity, the [[world line]] of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational force is a particular type of geodesic in curved spacetime. In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.\n\nThe [[Geodesics in general relativity|'''geodesic equation''']] is:\n:<math> {d^2 x^\\mu \\over ds^2}+\\Gamma^\\mu {}_{\\alpha \\beta}{d x^\\alpha \\over ds}{d x^\\beta \\over ds}=0,</math>\nwhere <math>s</math> is a scalar parameter of motion (e.g. the [[proper time]]), and <math> \\Gamma^\\mu {}_{\\alpha \\beta}</math> are [[Christoffel symbols]] (sometimes called the [[affine connection]] coefficients or [[Levi-Civita connection]] coefficients) which is symmetric in the two lower indices. Greek indices may take the values: 0, 1, 2, 3 and the [[summation convention]] is used for repeated indices <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>. The quantity on the left-hand-side of this equation is the acceleration of a particle, and so this equation is analogous to [[Newton's laws of motion]] which likewise provide formulae for the acceleration of a particle. This equation of motion employs the [[Einstein notation]], meaning that repeated indices are summed (i.e. from zero to three). The Christoffel symbols are functions of the four space-time coordinates, and so are independent of the velocity or acceleration or other characteristics of a [[test particle]] whose motion is described by the geodesic equation.\n\n===Alternatives to general relativity===\n{{Main|Alternatives to general relativity}}\nThere are [[alternatives to general relativity]] built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations. Examples are [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]], [[Brans\u2013Dicke theory]], [[teleparallelism]], [[f(R) gravity|''f''(''R'') gravity]] and [[Einstein\u2013Cartan theory]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brans|Dicke|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=sec. 3 in ch. 7}}, {{Harvnb|Goenner|2004|loc=sec. 7.2}}, and {{Harvnb|Trautman|2006}}, respectively</ref>\n\n==Definition and basic applications==\n{{See also|Mathematics of general relativity|Physical theories modified by general relativity}}\n\nThe derivation outlined in the previous section contains all the information needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of crucial importance in physics, namely how the theory can be used for model-building.\n\n===Definition and basic properties===\nGeneral relativity is a [[metric (general relativity)|metric]] theory of gravitation. At its core are [[Einstein's equations]], which describe the relation between the geometry of a four-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] representing spacetime, and the [[Stress\u2013energy tensor|energy\u2013momentum]] contained in that spacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=ch. 4}},\n{{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=ch. 7}} or, in fact, any other textbook on general relativity</ref> Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as [[free-fall]], orbital motion, and [[spacecraft]] [[Trajectory|trajectories]]), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow.<ref>At least approximately, cf. {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}</ref> The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy\u2013momentum of matter.

Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy\u2013momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.<ref>Introductory chapters of {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}</ref>\n\nEinstein's equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and, as such, difficult to solve exactly.<ref>A review showing Einstein's equation in the broader context of other PDEs with physical significance is {{Harvnb|Geroch|1996}}</ref> Nevertheless, a number of [[exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] are known, although only a few have direct physical applications.<ref>For background information and a list of solutions, cf. {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}; a more recent review can be found in {{Harvnb|MacCallum|2006}}</ref> The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the [[Schwarzschild solution]], the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution and the [[Kerr metric]], each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3,5,6}}</ref> and the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker]] and [[de Sitter universe]]s, each describing an expanding cosmos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=ch. 4, sec. 3.3}}</ref> Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the [[G\u00f6del metric|G\u00f6del universe]] (which opens up the intriguing possibility of [[time travel]] in curved spacetimes), the [[Taub-NUT solution]] (a model universe that is [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], but [[anisotropic]]), and [[anti-de Sitter space]] (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the [[Maldacena conjecture]]).<ref>Brief descriptions of these and further interesting solutions can be found in {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=ch. 5}}</ref>\n\nGiven the difficulty of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by [[numerical integration]] on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions. In the field of [[numerical relativity]], powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lehner|2002}}</ref> In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as [[naked singularity|naked singularities]].

The solutions require extreme physical conditions unlikely ever to occur in practice, and it remains an open question whether further laws of physics will eliminate them completely. Since then, other\u2014similarly impractical\u2014GR solutions containing CTCs have been found, such as the [[Tipler cylinder]] and [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]].\n\n==Advanced concepts==\n\n===Causal structure and global geometry===\n{{Main|Causal structure}}\n[[File:Penrose.svg|thumb|Penrose\u2013Carter diagram of an infinite [[Minkowski space|Minkowski universe]]]]\nIn general relativity, no material body can catch up with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event ''A'' can reach any other location ''X'' before light sent out at ''A'' to ''X''. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines ([[Geodesic (general relativity)|null geodesics]]) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using [[Penrose diagram|Penrose\u2013Carter diagrams]] in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk (\"[[Compactification (mathematics)|compactified]]\") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard [[spacetime diagram]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frauendiener|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.1}}, {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 6.8, 6.9}}</ref>\n\nAware of the importance of causal structure, [[Roger Penrose]] and others developed what is known as [[global geometry]]. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the [[Raychaudhuri equation]], and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of [[energy conditions]]) are used to derive general results.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 9.2\u20139.4}} and {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=ch. 6}}</ref>\n\n===Horizons===\n{{Main|Horizon (general relativity)|No hair theorem|Black hole mechanics}}\nUsing global geometry, some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called [[event horizon|horizons]], which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the [[hoop conjecture]], the relevant length scale is the [[Schwarzschild radius]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Thorne|1972}}; for more recent numerical studies, see {{Harvnb|Berger|2002|loc=sec. 2.1}}</ref>), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's ''horizon'', is not a physical barrier.<ref>{{Harvnb|Israel|1987}}. A more exact mathematical description distinguishes several kinds of horizon, notably event horizons and [[apparent horizon]]s cf. {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|pp=312\u2013320}} or {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 12.2}}; there are also more intuitive definitions for isolated systems that do not require knowledge of spacetime properties at infinity, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Krishnan|2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|left|The ergosphere of a rotating black hole, which plays a key role when it comes to extracting energy from such a black hole]]\nEarly studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein's equations, notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution (used to describe a [[Static spacetime|static]] black hole) and the axisymmetric [[Kerr solution]] (used to describe a rotating, [[Stationary spacetime|stationary]] black hole, and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere). Using global geometry, later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes. With time they become rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying: electric charge, mass-energy, [[linear momentum]], [[angular momentum]], and location at a specified time. This is stated by the [[no hair theorem|black hole uniqueness theorem]]: \"black holes have no hair\", that is, no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans. Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole, the object that results (having emitted gravitational waves) is very simple.<ref>For first steps, cf. {{Harvnb|Israel|1971}}; see {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 9.3}} or {{Harvnb|Heusler|1996|loc=ch. 9 and 10}} for a derivation, and {{Harvnb|Heusler|1998}} as well as {{Harvnb|Beig|Chru\u015bciel|2006}} as overviews of more recent results</ref>\n\nEven more remarkably, there is a general set of laws known as [[black hole mechanics]], which is analogous to the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the [[entropy]] of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the [[Penrose process]]).<ref>The laws of black hole mechanics were first described in {{Harvnb|Bardeen|Carter|Hawking|1973}}; a more pedagogical presentation can be found in {{Harvnb|Carter|1979}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 2}}. A thorough, book-length introduction including an introduction to the necessary mathematics {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}. For the Penrose process, see {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}</ref> There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1973}}, {{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1974}}</ref> This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease\u2014as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit [[thermal radiation]]. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in [[Planck's law]]. This radiation is known as [[Hawking radiation]] (cf. the [[General relativity#Quantum field theory in curved spacetime|quantum theory section]], below).<ref>The fact that black holes radiate, quantum mechanically, was first derived in {{Harvnb|Hawking|1975}}; a more thorough derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Wald|1975}}. A review is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 3}}</ref>\n\nThere are other types of horizons. In an expanding universe, an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed (\"[[particle horizon]]\"), and some regions of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon).<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=sec. 4.4.4, 4.4.5}}</ref> Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer ([[Rindler space]]), there will be horizons associated with a semi-classical radiation known as [[Unruh effect|Unruh radiation]].<ref>Horizons: cf. {{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 12.4}}. Unruh effect: {{Harvnb|Unruh|1976}}, cf. {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 3}}</ref>\n\n===Singularities===\n{{Main|Spacetime singularity}}\nAnother general feature of general relativity is the appearance of spacetime boundaries known as singularities. Spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and lightlike geodesics\u2014all possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel. But some solutions of Einstein's equations have \"ragged edges\"\u2014regions known as [[spacetime singularity|spacetime singularities]], where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end, and geometry becomes ill-defined. In the more interesting cases, these are \"curvature singularities\", where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature, such as the [[Ricci scalar]], take on infinite values.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 8.1}}, {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 9.1}}</ref> Well-known examples of spacetimes with future singularities\u2014where worldlines end\u2014are the Schwarzschild solution, which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole,<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 2}}; a more extensive treatment of this solution can be found in {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3}}</ref> or the Kerr solution with its ring-shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 4}}; for a more extensive treatment, cf. {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 6}}</ref> The Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin, namely Big Bang singularities, and some have future singularities ([[Big Crunch]]) as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellis|Van Elst|1999}}; a closer look at the singularity itself is taken in {{Harvnb|B\u00f6rner|1993|loc=sec. 1.2}}</ref>\n\nGiven that these examples are all highly symmetric\u2014and thus simplified\u2014it is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization.<ref>Here one should remind to the well-known fact that the important  \"quasi-optical\" singularities of the so-called [[eikonal approximation]]s of many wave-equations, namely the \"[[caustic (mathematics)|caustics]]\", are resolved into finite peaks beyond that approximation.</ref> The famous [[singularity theorems]], proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage<ref>Namely when there are [[trapped null surface]]s, cf. {{Harvnb|Penrose|1965}}</ref> and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|1966}}</ref> However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the [[BKL singularity|BKL conjecture]]).<ref>The conjecture was made in {{Harvnb|Belinskii|Khalatnikov|Lifschitz|1971}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Berger|2002}}. An accessible exposition is given by {{Harvnb|Garfinkle|2007}}</ref> The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.<ref>The restriction to future singularities naturally excludes initial singularities such as the big bang singularity, which in principle be visible to observers at later cosmic time. The cosmic censorship conjecture was first presented in {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}; a textbook-level account is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=302\u2013305}}. For numerical results, see the review {{Harvnb|Berger|2002|loc=sec. 2.1}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution equations===\n{{Main|Initial value formulation (general relativity)}}\n\nEach solution of Einstein's equation encompasses the whole history of a universe&nbsp;\u2014 it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the [[time evolution]] of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a [[coordinate condition]], which is analogous to [[gauge fixing]] in other field theories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 7.1}}</ref>\n\nTo understand Einstein's equations as partial differential equations, it is helpful to formulate them in a way that describes the evolution of the universe over time. This is done in \"3+1\" formulations, where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension. The best-known example is the [[ADM formalism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a721.4\u2013\u00a721.7}}</ref> These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved: solutions always [[existence theorem|exist]], and are uniquely defined, once suitable initial conditions have been specified.<ref>{{Harvnb|Four\u00e8s-Bruhat|1952}} and {{Harvnb|Bruhat|1962}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=ch. 10}}; an online review can be found in {{Harvnb|Reula|1998}}</ref> Such formulations of Einstein's field equations are the basis of numerical relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gourgoulhon|2007}}; for a review of the basics of numerical relativity, including the problems arising from the peculiarities of Einstein's equations, see {{Harvnb|Lehner|2001}}</ref>\n\n===Global and quasi-local quantities===\n{{Main|Mass in general relativity}}\nThe notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field\u2014like any physical field\u2014must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a720.4}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, there are possibilities to define a system's total mass, either using a hypothetical \"infinitely distant observer\" ([[ADM mass]])<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}</ref> or suitable symmetries ([[Komar mass]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Komar|1959}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}; although defined in a totally different way, it can be shown to be equivalent to the ADM mass for stationary spacetimes, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Magnon-Ashtekar|1979}}</ref> If one excludes from the system's total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves, the result is the [[Mass in general relativity#ADM and Bondi masses in asymptotically flat space-times|Bondi mass]] at null infinity.<ref>For a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}</ref> Just as in [[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical physics]], it can be shown that these masses are positive.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|p=295 and refs therein}}; this is important for questions of stability\u2014if there were [[negative mass]] states, then flat, empty Minkowski space, which has mass zero, could evolve into these states</ref> Corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 5}}</ref> There have also been a number of attempts to define ''quasi-local'' quantities, such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system.

It also aims to strengthen patient-care services and residential facilities for faculty members and staff.\n\nOfficials said the estimated cost of executing the master plan is around \u20b910,345 crore, including \u20b91,000 crore for hiring manpower .\n\nThe project will be completed in two phases; while Phase 1 will be completed in 46 months, the second phase will be finalized in 70 months.\n\nAs per the plan, a convention centre, a guesthouse with 40 rooms, a hostel with more than 4,500 rooms and 500 residential units with allied car parking will be set up.\n\nAs There is no scope of further expansion with the limited availability of land, residential facilities stretching from Trauma Centre campus, West Campus (Ansari Nagar) to East Campus (Ansari Nagar) and Ayurvigyan Nagar Campus will be relocated. This will free up space in the main campus and allow to expand vertically.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/govt-in-principle-approves-master-plan-to-convert-aiims-into-world-class-medical-university-119022801286_1.html|title=Govt 'in principle' approves Master Plan to convert AIIMS into world class medical university|last=ANI|date=2019-02-28|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nWith senior faculty members raising issues of shortage of labs and operation theaters in the institute, the administration hopes the upcoming project will look into that concern.

MBBS is the basic medical course at bachelor's degree level. This is followed by master's degree level specialisation in general surgery, general internal medicine, pediatrics and other fields. Superspecialties are those healthcare fields whose practitioners need specialised certification after completing their postgraduation, examples being cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, rheumatology, neurology, and pediatric neurology. There are at least 45 superspecialties at AIIMS (New Delhi) at higher master's degree level. AIIMS also offers M.Sc. and PhD level research courses.\n\nThere are about forty-two specialty post-graduate courses conducted at AIIMS (New Delhi). The entry is through a nationwide competitive examination, AIIMS PG, held every six months.<ref name=\"dunia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.careerconvey.com/exam/aiims|title=All India Institute Of Medical Sciences - AIIMS-EXAM|website=Careerconvey|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> Each year nearly 50 thousand medical graduates and 25 thousand dental graduates across the country compete for the limited number of positions, approximately <1% of the candidates are admitted through the process.\n\nInstitute has a separate Examination-Section of its own, dedicated for all national level entrance exams, university's internal professional exams and departmental exams.

And that was something really crucial for the main objectives for which AIIMS (New Delhi) was established, which are cutting edge research, medical innovations and to demonstrate high standards of medical education to all medical colleges and allied institutions in India.\n\n===Residential facilities===\nAIIMS is a residential university where the faculty members, staff, and students live on either the main campus or one of the several extension campuses.

MBBS is the basic medical course at bachelor's degree level. This is followed by master's degree level specialisation in general surgery, general internal medicine, pediatrics and other fields. Superspecialties are those healthcare fields whose practitioners need specialised certification after completing their postgraduation, examples being cardiothoracic and vascular surgery, rheumatology, neurology, and pediatric neurology. There are at least 45 superspecialties at AIIMS (New Delhi) at higher master's degree level. AIIMS also offers M.Sc. and PhD level research courses.\n\nThere are about forty-two specialty post-graduate courses conducted at AIIMS (New Delhi). The entry is through a nationwide competitive examination, AIIMS PG, held every six months.<ref name=\"dunia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.careerconvey.com/exam/aiims|title=All India Institute Of Medical Sciences - AIIMS-EXAM|website=Careerconvey|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> Each year nearly 50 thousand medical graduates and 25 thousand dental graduates across the country compete for the limited number of positions, approximately <1% of the candidates are admitted through the process.\n\nInstitute has a separate Examination-Section of its own, dedicated for all national level entrance exams, university's internal professional exams and departmental exams.
