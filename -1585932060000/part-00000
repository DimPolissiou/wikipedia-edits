Its population of 3,678,301 (2015) makes it one of the most populated provinces in the country. Originally agricultural and now a booming bedroom community for ultracongested Metro Manila, its location just north of Taal volcano poses significant risks of ashfall, and debris flows through it into [[Manila Bay]].\n\nThe ''de facto'' capital of the province is [[Trece Martires]], although [[Imus]] is the official (''de jure'') capital.\n\nFor over 300 years, the province played an important role in both the country's colonial past and eventual fight for independence, earning it the title \"Historical Capital of the Philippines\". It became the cradle of the [[Philippine Revolution]], which led to the renouncement of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial control]], finally culminating in the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] on June{{nbsp}}12, 1898 in [[Kawit, Cavite]].

The land was formerly known as \"Tangway\". Archeological evidence in coastal areas show prehistorical settlements. According to local folklore, the earliest settlers of Cavite came from [[Sulu]] or [[Borneo]]. The territory of what is Cavite used to be under the jurisdiction of the Indianized Empire of [[Majapahit]] which was superseded by the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] which had waged a successful war for independence, thereafter, invaded by the [[Sultanate of Brunei]] which established a vassal-state, the [[Rajahnate of Maynila]].\n\n===Spanish colonial period===\nThe Spanish colonizers who arrived in the late 16th century saw the unusual tongue of land jutting out on [[Manila Bay]] and saw its deep waters as the main staging ground where they could launch their bulky galleons. It would later become the most important port linking the colony to the outside world through the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] trade. In 1571, Spanish colonizers established the port and City of Cavite and fortified the settlement as a first line of defense for the city of [[Manila]]. [[Galleon]]s were built and fitted at the port and many Chinese merchants settled in the communities of Bacoor and Kawit, opposite the Spanish city to trade silks, porcelain and other oriental goods.<ref name=Fish>{{Cite book |last=Fish |first=Shirley |title=The Manila-Acapulco Galleons: The Treasure Ships of the Pacific |publisher=AuthorHouse |year=2011 |isbn=9781456775421 |page=65,69,128\u2013132,274}}</ref>\n\n\"A defensive curtained wall was constructed the length of Cavite's western side,\" beginning from the entrance, \"La Estanzuela\", and continuing to the end of the peninsula, \"Punta de Rivera\", with the eastern shore unprotected by a wall.

Docks were in place to construct galleons and galleys, but without a dry dock, ships were repaired by [[careening]] along the beach.<ref name=Fish/>\n\n'''Fort San Felipe''', La Fuerza de San Felipe, was built between 1609 and 1616.

Three infantry companies, 180 men each, plus 220 [[Pampangan]] infantry, garrisoned the fort.<ref name=Fish/>{{rp|142\u2013143}}\n\nThe galleons ''Espiritu Santo'' and ''San Miguel'', plus six galleys were constructed between 1606 and 1616.

As with many other provinces organized during the Spanish colonial era, Cavite City, the name of the capital, was applied to the whole province, Cavite. The province covered all the present territory except for the town of [[Maragondon]], which used to belong to the [[Corregimiento]] of [[Mariveles, Bataan|Mariveles]].

The [[religious order]]s began acquiring these lands, with some donated, enlarging vast [[hacienda]]s (estates) in Cavite during the 18th and 19th century, enriching themselves. These haciendas became the source of bitter conflicts between the friar orders and Filipino farmers and pushed a number of Cavite\u00f1os to live as outlaws. This opposition to the friar orders was an important factor that drove many Cavite residents to support reform, and later, independence.<ref name=bh/>\n\nIn 1872, Filipinos launched their revolt against Spain. Three Filipino priests\u2014[[Gomburza|Jose Burgos, Mariano Gomez and Jacinto Zamora]]\u2014were implicated in the [[1872 Cavite mutiny|Cavite mutiny]] when 200 Filipinos staged a rebellion within Spanish garrisons.

Eventually, the Japanese discovered his guerrilla connection and raided his house in the attempt to capture him, but he escaped along with Col.

Hildebrand and the valliant Cavite\u00f1o guerrilleros of the Fil-American Cavite Guerilla Forces, which liberated the province of Cavite from the Japanese occupiers, and protected at all costs the National Highway 17 from [[Tagaytay]] to [[Las Pinas]] that serve as the vital supply route of the 11th Airborne Division, paving the way towards the road to the bitter but victorious [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]].\n\n=== Postwar growth ===\nThe economic growth of the country began to creep its way to the province following the end of the Second World War and the restoration of independence. Given its distance from Manila, the province soon began to feel a transformation into an economic provider of food and industrial goods not just for Metro Manila but for the whole of the country. In 1954, Trece Martires City was created out as a planned capital city from portions of Tanza, Indang, Naic and General Trias. Despite the transfer of capital status to Imus City in 1979, it retains many offices of the provincial government, acting thus as the de facto capital of the province. Also, Tagaytay's high location and cool temperatures would enable it to become a secondary summer capital and a vacation spot especially during the Christmas season, given its distance to the Manila area.\n\nPlan CALABARZON of 1972, in the midst of martial law and the communist and anti-government aggression that occurred in the rural areas and the western highlands, set the roadmap for the arrival of industrial estates to the province, beginning an era of economic progress. Carmona was the first town to have industrial estates, through the rising number of residents from the capital region enabled the creation of a new town, [[General Mariano Alvarez]], in 1981, from parts of the town's north and west. In addition, Bacoor, given its distance from Metro Manila, saw the building of the first residential villages to accommodate the rising number of workers in the capital in the same period, and today, this city, alongside other towns and cities in the province's north and central parts, have more residential subdivisions and townships, as well as a number of shopping malls and other private business establishments.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ph map cavite.png|thumb|left|Detailed topographic map of Cavite]]\nCavite is surrounded by [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] province to the east, [[Metro Manila]] to the northeast, and [[Batangas]] province to the south.

Cavite occupies a land area of {{convert|1427.06|km2}}, which is approximately 8.72 percent of Calabarzon's total land area, 2.74 percent of the regional area and 0.48 per cent of the total land area of the Philippines. The municipalities of [[Maragondon]] and [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]] have the biggest land areas, comprising {{convert|165.49|km2}} and {{convert|156.41|km2}} respectively, while the municipality of [[Noveleta]] has the smallest land area as indicated by {{convert|5.41|km2}} or 0.38 percent of the provincial total and area.<ref name=PNR/>\n\n===Topography and slope===\n[[File:Cavite Relief Map.png|thumb|left|Topographic map of Cavite on 1 arc second/30-meter resolution]]\nSituated at the entrance of Manila Bay, Cavite is characterized by rolling hinterlands punctuated by hills; shoreline fronting Manila Bay at sea level; and rugged portion at the boundary with Batangas where the Dos Picos mountains are located. The province has two mountain ranges.\n\nCavite is divided into four physiographical areas, namely: the lowest lowland area, lowland area, the central hilly area and the upland mountainous area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wvphilippineshea.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/cavite-pdrrm-plan.pdf|title=Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan 2011-2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Humanitarian and Emergency Affairs|publisher=|access-date=September 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\n* The '''lowest lowland area''' is the coastal plain in particular. These areas have extremely low ground level of {{convert|0|to|2|m}} elevation compared to the high tide level of about {{convert|0.8|m|sp=us}} from the [[mean sea level]] (msl). These are the cities of [[Cavite City|Cavite]], [[Bacoor]] and the municipalities of [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]], [[Noveleta]], [[Rosario, Cavite|Rosario]], northern part of [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]] and eastern part of [[Ternate]].\n* The '''lowland area''' consists of the coastal and alluvial plains. These areas have flat ground slope of less than 0.5% and low ground elevation of {{convert|2|to|30|m}}. The alluvial plain can be found in the city of [[Imus]] and southern part of [[General Trias, Cavite|General Trias]]. Into these municipalities forms the transition area between the coastal plain and the central hilly area.

It forms the rolling [[tuffaceous]] plateau. This topography includes steep hills, ridges and elevated inland valley. The plateau is characterized with ground elevation ranging from {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} to nearly {{convert|400|m|sp=us}}. Its ground slope ranges from 0.5 to 2%.

Forest lands are being maintained as they play a great role for the ecological balance of the province aside from the fact that they are home to numerous flora and fauna that needs to be protected and preserved. Correspondingly, the alienable and disposable lands are the built-up areas as well as production areas. These lands are intended for urban, economic and demographic developments.\n\n====Forest lands====\nCavite province lies in the western monsoon forest zone. This location is very beneficial for the formation of [[tropical rainforest]]s, which are characteristically made through natural vegetation. In 2007, the existing forest area within the province totaled only to {{convert|8625|ha}}. These forest areas were categorized as Protected Landscape under the National Integrated Protected Area System (NIPAS) and the rest, unclassified forest (Non-NIPAS). A total of {{convert|4000|ha}} are located within the [[Mounts Palay-Palay\u2013Mataas-na-Gulod Protected Landscape]], a [[protected area]] in Ternate and Maragondon created by Proclamation Number 1594 on October 26, 1976. The park lies at the border of Cavite and Batangas and encompasses three peaks, Palay-Palay, [[Mount Pico De Loro|Pico de Loro]] and [[Mount Marami|Mataas na Gulod]]. The five (5) unclassified forests are found along [[Tagaytay Ridge]], [[Maragondon]], Magallanes, [[Ternate]] and [[Alfonso]].  The other mountain peaks in the province are Mt. Buntis, Mt. Nagpatong, Mt. Hulog and Mt. Gonzales (Mt. Sungay).\n\nCavite's forest provides an abundance of different forest products. [[Bamboo]], a member of the grass family, is one of the most available forest products found in the municipalities of [[Ternate]], [[Magallanes, Cavite|Magallanes]], [[Maragondon]] and General Aguinaldo throughout the year.\n\n====Alienable and disposable lands====\nThese lands are being used in various ways, either for agriculture, residences, open areas, etc.  Based on the Cavite Provincial Physical Framework Plan 2005\u20132010, Cavite's alienable and disposable lands are further classified into production lands and built-up areas. Production lands in Cavite are intended for agriculture, fishery and mining. On the other hand, built-up areas are mainly for residential areas, commercial, industrial and tourism areas.\n\n====Production land-use====\nMajority of production land-use is for [[agriculture]]. Considering that 50.33% of the total provincial land area is engaged into agriculture, it can be generalized that in spite of rapid urbanization in the province, Cavite remains to have an agricultural economy that makes food security attainable. Some of the major crops being produced in the province are [[rice]], [[Maize|corn]], [[coffee]], [[coconuts]], [[cut flowers]] and [[vegetables]].\n\nIncluded in the agricultural land use are livestock farms that range from [[piggery]], [[poultry]], [[goat]] and [[cattle]] farms. The climatic suitability of Cavite makes the province ideal for integrated farming, having crops and livestock raising in one farm.\n\n[[Fishery]] is also another major component of the agricultural sector. Having rich marine resources and long coastlines, the province is home to numerous fishery activities providing livelihood to many Cavite\u00f1os. In some lowland and even upland areas, fishery, in the form of [[fish pond]]s are also producing a large amount of fish products. Some areas in Cavite are also engaged in fish processing and production of fish products like [[fish sauce]].\n\n[[Mining]] is the third component of production land-use in the province. As of 2009, there are 15 mining and quarrying areas operating in Cavite. Extraction includes filling materials, gravel, and sand.\n\n====Built-up areas====\nThe built-up areas are mainly composed of residential and industrial sites. This also includes commercial and business areas where commerce is transpiring. According to the 2007 Census of Population and Housing by the Philippine Statistics Authority, there are 611,450 occupied housing units in Cavite.\n\nMoreover, according to the Housing and Land-Use Regulatory Board, there are around 1,224 housing subdivisions with issued license to sell in the province until 2009 which occupies an area of 9,471 hectares.\n\nMeanwhile, the industrial sector also develops rapidly in the province. For 2009, operational industrial estates cover around {{convert|2,939|ha}}. Tourism establishments are also considered built-up areas such as golf courses, leisure farms, resorts and the likes.<ref name=\"PNR\"/>\n\n===Water resources===\nThe hydrological network of the province is composed of seven major rivers and its tributaries. These river systems generally flows from the highlands of Tagaytay and Maragondon to Manila Bay. Numerous springs, waterfalls and rivers found in the upland areas of the province, have been developed for tourism.  In the lowland areas, hundreds of [[artesian well]]s and deep wells provide water supply for both residential and irrigation purposes.\n\nCavite shoreline stretches about {{convert|123|km}}. The communities located along the coast are Cavite City, Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon, and Ternate. The richness of Cavite's coastal resources is a major producer of [[oyster]]s and [[mussel]]s. The fishing industry also produces [[shrimp]] and ''bangus'' ([[milkfish]]). The western coastline are lined with of pale gray sand beaches popular with tourists.  Thus, fishery and tourism contributes to the economic activity of the province.<ref>[http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/General%20Information.pdf \"General Information\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131200214/http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/General%20Information.pdf |date=January 31, 2012 }}.

Classification of soil types in a specific area is a very important consideration in identifying its most fitted land-use. This way, utmost productivity can be achieved.\n\nThe lowland area of Cavite is generally composed of Guadalupe clay and clay loam. It is characterized as coarse and granular when dry but sticky and plastic when wet. Its substratum is solid volcanic tuff. These types of soils are suited to lowland rice and corn while those in the upland are suited for orchard and pasture. Guadalupe clay adobes are abundant in the southern part of [[Bacoor]] and [[Imus]] bordering [[Dasmari\u00f1as]]. The soil is hard and compact and difficult to cultivate that makes it generally unsuitable for diverse cropping. It is very sticky when wet and granular when dry. Forage grass is advised for this type of soil. Hydrosol and Obando sand are found along Bacoor Bay. The shoreline of [[Rosario, Cavite|Rosario]], [[Tanza]], [[Naic]] and [[Ternate]] are lined with Guadalupe sand.\n\nThe central area principally consists of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture. This is recommended for diversified farming such as the cultivation of upland rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees. The steep phase should be forested or planted to rootcrops. The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceaous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown in this type of soil. Guingua fine sandy loam is found along the lower part of Malabon and Alang-ilang River at Noveleta.\n\nThe type of soils that dominate the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with mountain soil undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and easy to work on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Santa Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.<ref name=PNR/>\n\n===Mineral resources and reserves===\n\nThe greater parts of Cavite are composed of volcanic materials, tuff, cinders, basalt, breccias, agglomerate and interbeddings of shales, and sandstones. The dormant and active volcanoes (Taal) are within these volcanic areas and have been the sources of volcanic materials which form the Tagaytay Cuesta. The drainage systems are deeply entrenched in the tuffs, eroding thin interbedded sandstones and conglomerate rocks which are the sources of little reserves of sand and gravel in the larger stream. Adobe stone quarries also flourish in the tuff areas.\n\nCavite coastal areas have marl and conglomerate sedimentary rocks and some igneous rocks which are prominent in the high, mountainous regions of western part of the province. Black sands are found in [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]] while [[Noveleta]] has its own salt products. [[Magallanes, Cavite|Magallanes]] has gravel deposits while reserves of sand and gravel materials are found in [[Alfonso]], [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]], [[Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo]], [[Naic]], [[Ternate]], [[Maragondon]] and [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]].<ref name=PNR/>\n\n{{clear right}}\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nCavite comprises 16 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]] and 7 [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]]:\n[[File:Ph fil cavite.png|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Political divisions}}]]\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

The tremendous increase can be observed in the year 1990 when industrialization was introduced in the province. Investors established their businesses in different industrial estates that magnetized people to migrate to Cavite due to job opportunities the province offers. Another factor attributed to the increase of population is the mushrooming of housing subdivisions. Since Cavite is proximate to [[Metro Manila]], people working in the metropolitan area choose to live in the province together with their families. Natural increase also contributes to the increase in population.

The Adventist Church has its own mission in the province, the Cavite Satellite Field Office<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clc.adventist.ph/directory/cavite-satellite-field-office/ |title=Cavite Satellite Field Office {{!}} Seventh-Day Adventists |website=clc.adventist.ph |access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref> divided administratively in 21 districts which also serves as the 10th Area of its mother organisation, Central Luzon Conference.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clc.adventist.ph/ |title=Central Luzon {{!}} Seventh-Day Adventists |website=clc.adventist.ph |access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref> \n\nWith influx of migrants from Mindanao other non-Christian faiths particularly [[Islam]]\nhas also become evident in some areas of the province.  [[Dambana|Anitism]], [[Animism]], and [[Atheism]] are also practiced in the province.\n\n===Languages===\nThe main languages spoken are [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Chavacano language|Chavacano]] and [[Philippine English|English]]. Due to the province bordering south of [[Metro Manila]], a large number of people from farther provinces migrated to Cavite, resulting in minor but significant usages of [[Bicolano language|Bicolano]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Waray language|Waray]] languages.\n\n====Chavacano in Cavite====\n[[Chavacano]] or Chabacano is a [[Spanish-based creole language]] and known in linguistics as Philippine Creole Spanish. Chabacano is originally spoken by majority of the Cavite\u00f1os that lived in Cavite City and Ternate after the arrival of the Spaniards three centuries ago. The various dialects of [[Chabacano]] were formed out of necessity like all languages, though scholars and laypersons disagree about exactly when and where it all began. The various language groups working at the Cavite naval base needed a way to communicate with each other, and to the soldiers who were barking the orders in less-than-genteel Spanish. It was from this situation that Cavite Chabacano began as a simplified form of Spanish \u2013 a [[pidgin language]] that later developed into a mixed, or [[creole language]]. The fact that the first Chabacanos learned their Spanish from the coarse language of soldiers is probably why they were called Chabacanos in the first place.\n\nHowever, some historians disagree with parts of this story and say that Chabacano did not emerge until almost a century later when Catholic Malays settled in Cavite after the Spaniards had abandoned the Spice Islands to the Dutch in 1662. These Malays, known as the Mardicas (likely from the Malay word ''merdeka'' meaning \"free\" or \"independent\"), settled in Ternate, the town named after their original homeland. They joined with many other language groups to defend Manila from yet another Chinese warlord, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong).<ref>Morrow, Paul (November 1, 2007). [http://www.pilipino-express.com/history-a-culture/in-other-words/69-chabacano.html \"Chabacano\"]. Pilipino Express. Retrieved on 2013-06-25.</ref>\n\nNow used almost exclusively in Cavite City and coastal Ternate, Chabacano enjoyed its widest diffusion and greatest splendor in Spanish and American period of Filipino history, when newspapers and literary outputs flourished. Cavite Chabacano was spoken with relative ease because it was essentially a simplification of Castillan morphology patterned after the Tagalog syntax. Gradually and naturally, it acquired the sounds present in the Spanish phonological system. After World War II, creole Spanish speakers within the capital of the archipelago vanished. Around 30,000 Cavite\u00f1os still speak Chabacano, mostly elderly speakers. The language is today taught in elementary schools in both Cavite City and Ternate as part of the K-12 national curiculum from the first to 3rd grades, building up a new generation of speakers and writers within the province.\n\n==Culture==\nAside from the celebrations of town fiestas, the province of Cavite celebrates festivals as forms of thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest. Some of these festivals are also observed in honor of the historical legacies passed from one generation to another generation. In fact, the province fetes the renowned Kalayaan Festival which is given a great social importance in commemoration of the heroism of its people. The annual ''Fiesta de la Reina del Provincia de Cavite'' is a grandiose fiesta celebration in honor of the patroness of the province, the ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga]]''. The image is enshrined at San Roque Church in [[Cavite City]]. Her feastday is celebrated every 2nd and 3rd Sunday of November.\n\nTraditions and fiesta celebrations include ''Mardicas'', a war dance held in Ternate town. ''Karakol'' street dancing with a fluvial procession is usually held in coastal towns. There is also a pre-colonial ritual called the ''Sanghiyang'' as a form of thanksgiving and to heal the sick.{{where|date=June 2013}} Another cultural tradition is the ''Live via Crucis or Kalbaryo ni Hesus'' held during [[Holy Week]].  The ''Maytinis'' or word prayer that is annually held in Kawit every December 24 before the beginning of the midnight Mass.\n\n===Festivals===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size:90%;background-color:#FDFDFD;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Event\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;background-color:#FDFDFD;\" | Fiesta de la Reina de Caracol\n| [[Rosario, Cavite|Rosario]]\n| Held every 3rd weekend of May and 1st weekend of October.

Emilio Aguinaldo.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe province is predominantly an agriculture province. The province's economy is largely dependent to agriculture. Despite urbanization and industrialization, still, a significant number of inhabitants are engaged into agribusinesses. The data gathered from Office of the Provincial Agriculturist shows that though the province lies in the industrial belt, the agricultural land is about 49.38 percent or {{convert|70,466.53|ha}} of the total land area of the Province. This is {{convert|1,176.5|ha}} bigger than that of the declared agricultural lands in 2008 (69,290.03 hectares).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe municipality of Maragondon has the biggest area intended for agriculture, accounts for 14.57% of the total provincial agricultural lands while Cavite City has no longer available land for agriculture related activities and industries. If based on total agricultural lands, we may say that the major players in agriculture in the province are Maragondon, Silang, Indang, Naic and Alfonso. Of the eight districts in the province, the top three with the widest agricultural area are District VII comprising 43,587.01 hectares or 61.85 percent of the total agricultural areas with 27,115 farmers followed by District VI with 17.40 percent or {{convert|12,257.71|ha}} having 8,701 farmers and District V comprising {{convert|10,248.55|ha}} with 10,295 farmers. The municipality of Silang has the most number of farmers. The municipality of Maragondon only ranks 3rd in terms of number of farmers. This can be attributed to highly mechanized operation and vast plantation of rice. The same is true with General Trias and Naic, known as the rice producing municipalities in Cavite. The number of farmers increased by 6.5% that corresponds to around 3,097 farmers. The increase in the number of farmers was due to worldwide recession which led to work displacement of some inhabitants. Silang is dominated by pineapple and coffee plantations as well as with cutflower production.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/Economic%20Sector-Agriculture.pdf \"Agriculture\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415093954/http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/Economic%20Sector-Agriculture.pdf |date=April 15, 2012 }}.

The 11.7-km route of the light railway system that will start from [[Baclaran]] to Niog was planned to carry a capacity of 40,000 passengers per direction per hour. The extension will have 48 air-conditioned coaches, 12-four car trains, 8 passenger stations and a satellite depot in Cavite. The groundbreaking of LRT Line 1 South Extension Project was held on Thursday, May 4, 2017. The actual construction officially started on Tuesday, May 7, 2019 because the [[Right-of-way]] is \"free and clear\" from obstructions. Once its completed, Cavite will be served by the [[LRT-1]] (via [[Niog station]]). The whole extension line from Baclaran to Niog, Bacoor, Cavite will be finished by 2022. This is the second project outside Metro Manila after the planned [[MRT-7]] that starts from North Avenue, [[Quezon City]] and it will end in [[San Jose Del Monte]], [[Bulacan]]. The said project will serve approximately 1.9 million commuters based in Pasay, Paranaque, Las Pi\u00f1as and Bacoor.\n\n====LRT Line 6 Project====\nThe proposed [[Manila LRT Line 6|LRT Line 6]] project would further extend the LRT system by another 19 kilometers all the way to Dasmari\u00f1as from the proposed end in [[Niog station|Niog]] in Bacoor, Cavite.\n\nThe mass transit system would pass along the Aguinaldo Highway and would have stations in Niog, [[Tirona station|Tirona]] station, [[Imus station|Imus]] station, [[Daang Hari station|Daang Hari]] station, [[Salitran station|Salitran]] station, [[Congressional Avenue station|Congressional Avenue]] station, and [[Governor's Drive station|Governor's Drive]] station. The project will improve passenger mobility and reduce the volume of vehicular traffic in the Cavite area by providing a higher capacity mass transit system. It also aims to spur economic development along the extension corridor.\n\n===Ferry services===\nThere is one ferry service: [[Metrostar Ferry]], from [[Cavite City]] to [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay]].\n\n==Government==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Governor===\n* [[Juanito Victor Remulla]] ([[Nacionalista Party|NP]]/[[Partido Magdalo]])\n\n===Vice Governor===\n* [[Jolo Revilla|Ramon M.

Situated {{convert|21|km|sp=us}} southwest of [[Metro Manila]], it is one of the most industrialized and fastest-growing provinces in the Philippines. Its population of 3,678,301 (2015) makes it one of the most populated provinces in the country. Originally agricultural and now a booming bedroom community for ultracongested Metro Manila, its location just north of Taal volcano poses significant risks of ashfall, and debris flows through it into [[Manila Bay]].\n\nThe ''de facto'' capital of the province is [[Trece Martires]], although [[Imus]] is the official (''de jure'') capital.\n\nFor over 300 years, the province played an important role in both the country's colonial past and eventual fight for independence, earning it the title \"Historical Capital of the Philippines\". It became the cradle of the [[Philippine Revolution]], which led to the renouncement of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial control]], finally culminating in the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] on June{{nbsp}}12, 1898 in [[Kawit, Cavite]]. The old provincial capital, [[Cavite City]] also hosted docks for the [[Manila galleon]], becoming an essential part of commerce between [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Cavite\" comes from the Hispanicized form of ''kawit'' or it may be a corruption of ''kalawit'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] words for \"hook\", in reference to the [[Cavite Peninsula|small hook-shaped peninsula]] jutting out to [[Manila Bay]].<ref name=\"cav\">[http://cavite.gov.ph/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=94&Itemid=90 Official Website of the Provincial Government of Cavite - Cavite City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301233846/http://cavite.gov.ph/main/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=94&Itemid=90 |date=2009-03-01}}</ref> The name originally applied to the peninsula, ''Cavite La Punta'' (now [[Cavite City]]) and the adjacent lowland coastal area of ''Cavite Viejo'' (now [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]]).\n\nAnother theory proposes that the name is a Hispanicized form of ''kabit'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"joined\", \"connected\", or \"attached\", referring to the peninsula's topographical relation to the mainland.<ref name=\"cav\" /> [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]], in his 1821 memoir, stated that the \"natives\" called it '''Caveit''' due to the \"crooked point of land extending into the sea\".<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Edmund |title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/59/ |publisher=Harper & Brothers |location=New York |year=1837 |page=59}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Hispanic period===\nThe present Cavite City was once a mooring place for [[Chinese junk]]s trading that came to trade with the settlements around Manila Bay. The land was formerly known as \"Tangway\". Archeological evidence in coastal areas show prehistorical settlements. According to local folklore, the earliest settlers of Cavite came from [[Sulu]] or [[Borneo]]. The territory of what is Cavite used to be under the jurisdiction of the Indianized Empire of [[Majapahit]] which was superseded by the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] which had waged a successful war for independence, thereafter, invaded by the [[Sultanate of Brunei]] which established a vassal-state, the [[Rajahnate of Maynila]].\n\n===Spanish colonial period===\nThe Spanish colonizers who arrived in the late 16th century saw the unusual tongue of land jutting out on [[Manila Bay]] and saw its deep waters as the main staging ground where they could launch their bulky galleons. It would later become the most important port linking the colony to the outside world through the [[Manila-Acapulco Galleon]] trade. In 1571, Spanish colonizers established the port and City of Cavite and fortified the settlement as a first line of defense for the city of [[Manila]]. [[Galleon]]s were built and fitted at the port and many Chinese merchants settled in the communities of Bacoor and Kawit, opposite the Spanish city to trade silks, porcelain and other oriental goods.<ref name=Fish>{{Cite book |last=Fish |first=Shirley |title=The Manila-Acapulco Galleons: The Treasure Ships of the Pacific |publisher=AuthorHouse |year=2011 |isbn=9781456775421 |page=65,69,128\u2013132,274}}</ref>\n\n\"A defensive curtained wall was constructed the length of Cavite's western side,\" beginning from the entrance, \"La Estanzuela\", and continuing to the end of the peninsula, \"Punta de Rivera\", with the eastern shore unprotected by a wall.  Cavite contained government offices, churches, mission buildings, Spanish homes, Fort San Felipe and the Rivera de Cavite shipyard.  Docks were in place to construct galleons and galleys, but without a dry dock, ships were repaired by [[careening]] along the beach.<ref name=Fish/>\n\n'''Fort San Felipe''', La Fuerza de San Felipe, was built between 1609 and 1616.  This quadrilateral structure of [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtained walls]], with bastions at the corners, contained 20 cannons facing the seashore.  Three infantry companies, 180 men each, plus 220 [[Pampangan]] infantry, garrisoned the fort.<ref name=Fish/>{{rp|142\u2013143}}\n\nThe galleons ''Espiritu Santo'' and ''San Miguel'', plus six galleys were constructed between 1606 and 1616.

As with many other provinces organized during the Spanish colonial era, Cavite City, the name of the capital, was applied to the whole province, Cavite. The province covered all the present territory except for the town of [[Maragondon]], which used to belong to the [[Corregimiento]] of [[Mariveles, Bataan|Mariveles]]. Maragondon was ceded to Cavite in 1754 when [[Bataan]] province was created from [[Pampanga]] province.<ref>(2001).

The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] made a surprise attack on the city in 1647, pounding the port incessantly, but were repulsed. In 1672, the British occupied the port during their [[British occupation of Manila|two-year control]] in the Philippines.<ref name=bh/>\n\nIn the 17th century, ''encomiendas'' (Spanish Royal [[land grant]]s) were given in Cavite and Maragondon to Spanish [[conquistador]]es and their families.  The [[religious order]]s began acquiring these lands, with some donated, enlarging vast [[hacienda]]s (estates) in Cavite during the 18th and 19th century, enriching themselves. These haciendas became the source of bitter conflicts between the friar orders and Filipino farmers and pushed a number of Cavite\u00f1os to live as outlaws. This opposition to the friar orders was an important factor that drove many Cavite residents to support reform, and later, independence.<ref name=bh/>\n\nIn 1872, Filipinos launched their revolt against Spain. Three Filipino priests\u2014[[Gomburza|Jose Burgos, Mariano Gomez and Jacinto Zamora]]\u2014were implicated in the [[1872 Cavite mutiny|Cavite mutiny]] when 200 Filipinos staged a rebellion within Spanish garrisons. On August 28, 1896, when the [[Philippine Revolution|revolution]] against Spain broke out, Cavite became a bloody theater of war. Led by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], Cavite\u00f1os made lightning raids on Spanish headquarters, and soon liberated the entire province through the [[Battle of Alapan]]. Aguinaldo commanded the Revolution to its successful end \u2013 the proclamation of the [[First Republic of the Philippines]] on June 12, 1898 in Kawit.\n[[File:CaviteCannonPlacard-WinnetkaPark.jpg|thumb|A marker affixed to the Cavite cannon in Winnetka, IL that reads ''\"This gun was mounted on the defences of Cavite arsenal which was surrendered to Commodore George Dewey\"'']]\nDuring the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], American forces attacked the Spanish squadron in Cavite.

Mariano N. Castaneda, a future governor of the province, returned to Cavite and secretly organized the resistance movement in the province.\n\nThe Japanese Authorities pressured him to accept the position as Provincial Governor of Cavite, he refused many times over until his excuses did not work, much against his will he was forced to accept the position by the Japanese, and by thinking that it would be beneficial to further organize the resistance movement as Governor by day and a guerilla by night. Eventually, the Japanese discovered his guerrilla connection and raided his house in the attempt to capture him, but he escaped along with Col. Javalera by swimming the Imus river up to Salinas, [[Bacoor]] and finally joined his comrades in the field in Neneng, in the then town of [[Dasmarinas]].\n\nAt this time due to his organizational skills the Fil American Cavite Guerilla Forces (FACGF) raised a regiment in each of the administrative units and also created attached special battalions consist of 14,371 Enlisted Men and 1,245 officers 3 special battalions, 1 medical battalion, 1 signal company, 1 hospital unit, Division GHQ and Staff which later on grew into a formidable force to take on the omnipresent rule of the Japanese in the province. At its peak the force contained 14 infantry regiments:\n\n*1st Infantry Regiment, Imus (Col. Lorenzo Saulog)\n*2nd Infantry Regiment, Bacoor (Col. Francisco Guererro)\n*3rd Infantry Regiment, Silang (Col. Dominador Kiamson) \n*4th Infantry Regiment, Dasmarinas (Col.

Hildebrand and the valliant Cavite\u00f1o guerrilleros of the Fil-American Cavite Guerilla Forces, which liberated the province of Cavite from the Japanese occupiers, and protected at all costs the National Highway 17 from [[Tagaytay]] to [[Las Pinas]] that serve as the vital supply route of the 11th Airborne Division, paving the way towards the road to the bitter but victorious [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]].\n\n=== Postwar growth ===\nThe economic growth of the country began to creep its way to the province following the end of the Second World War and the restoration of independence. Given its distance from Manila, the province soon began to feel a transformation into an economic provider of food and industrial goods not just for Metro Manila but for the whole of the country. In 1954, Trece Martires City was created out as a planned capital city from portions of Tanza, Indang, Naic and General Trias. Despite the transfer of capital status to Imus City in 1979, it retains many offices of the provincial government, acting thus as the de facto capital of the province. Also, Tagaytay's high location and cool temperatures would enable it to become a secondary summer capital and a vacation spot especially during the Christmas season, given its distance to the Manila area.\n\nPlan CALABARZON of 1972, in the midst of martial law and the communist and anti-government aggression that occurred in the rural areas and the western highlands, set the roadmap for the arrival of industrial estates to the province, beginning an era of economic progress. Carmona was the first town to have industrial estates, through the rising number of residents from the capital region enabled the creation of a new town, [[General Mariano Alvarez]], in 1981, from parts of the town's north and west. In addition, Bacoor, given its distance from Metro Manila, saw the building of the first residential villages to accommodate the rising number of workers in the capital in the same period, and today, this city, alongside other towns and cities in the province's north and central parts, have more residential subdivisions and townships, as well as a number of shopping malls and other private business establishments.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ph map cavite.png|thumb|left|Detailed topographic map of Cavite]]\nCavite is surrounded by [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] province to the east, [[Metro Manila]] to the northeast, and [[Batangas]] province to the south.

Forest lands are being maintained as they play a great role for the ecological balance of the province aside from the fact that they are home to numerous flora and fauna that needs to be protected and preserved. Correspondingly, the alienable and disposable lands are the built-up areas as well as production areas. These lands are intended for urban, economic and demographic developments.\n\n====Forest lands====\nCavite province lies in the western monsoon forest zone. This location is very beneficial for the formation of [[tropical rainforest]]s, which are characteristically made through natural vegetation. In 2007, the existing forest area within the province totaled only to {{convert|8625|ha}}. These forest areas were categorized as Protected Landscape under the National Integrated Protected Area System (NIPAS) and the rest, unclassified forest (Non-NIPAS). A total of {{convert|4000|ha}} are located within the [[Mounts Palay-Palay\u2013Mataas-na-Gulod Protected Landscape]], a [[protected area]] in Ternate and Maragondon created by Proclamation Number 1594 on October 26, 1976. The park lies at the border of Cavite and Batangas and encompasses three peaks, Palay-Palay, [[Mount Pico De Loro|Pico de Loro]] and [[Mount Marami|Mataas na Gulod]]. The five (5) unclassified forests are found along [[Tagaytay Ridge]], [[Maragondon]], Magallanes, [[Ternate]] and [[Alfonso]].  The other mountain peaks in the province are Mt. Buntis, Mt. Nagpatong, Mt. Hulog and Mt. Gonzales (Mt. Sungay).\n\nCavite's forest provides an abundance of different forest products. [[Bamboo]], a member of the grass family, is one of the most available forest products found in the municipalities of [[Ternate]], [[Magallanes, Cavite|Magallanes]], [[Maragondon]] and General Aguinaldo throughout the year.\n\n====Alienable and disposable lands====\nThese lands are being used in various ways, either for agriculture, residences, open areas, etc.  Based on the Cavite Provincial Physical Framework Plan 2005\u20132010, Cavite's alienable and disposable lands are further classified into production lands and built-up areas. Production lands in Cavite are intended for agriculture, fishery and mining. On the other hand, built-up areas are mainly for residential areas, commercial, industrial and tourism areas.\n\n====Production land-use====\nMajority of production land-use is for [[agriculture]]. Considering that 50.33% of the total provincial land area is engaged into agriculture, it can be generalized that in spite of rapid urbanization in the province, Cavite remains to have an agricultural economy that makes food security attainable. Some of the major crops being produced in the province are [[rice]], [[Maize|corn]], [[coffee]], [[coconuts]], [[cut flowers]] and [[vegetables]].\n\nIncluded in the agricultural land use are livestock farms that range from [[piggery]], [[poultry]], [[goat]] and [[cattle]] farms. The climatic suitability of Cavite makes the province ideal for integrated farming, having crops and livestock raising in one farm.\n\n[[Fishery]] is also another major component of the agricultural sector. Having rich marine resources and long coastlines, the province is home to numerous fishery activities providing livelihood to many Cavite\u00f1os. In some lowland and even upland areas, fishery, in the form of [[fish pond]]s are also producing a large amount of fish products. Some areas in Cavite are also engaged in fish processing and production of fish products like [[fish sauce]].\n\n[[Mining]] is the third component of production land-use in the province. As of 2009, there are 15 mining and quarrying areas operating in Cavite. Extraction includes filling materials, gravel, and sand.\n\n====Built-up areas====\nThe built-up areas are mainly composed of residential and industrial sites. This also includes commercial and business areas where commerce is transpiring. According to the 2007 Census of Population and Housing by the Philippine Statistics Authority, there are 611,450 occupied housing units in Cavite.\n\nMoreover, according to the Housing and Land-Use Regulatory Board, there are around 1,224 housing subdivisions with issued license to sell in the province until 2009 which occupies an area of 9,471 hectares.\n\nMeanwhile, the industrial sector also develops rapidly in the province. For 2009, operational industrial estates cover around {{convert|2,939|ha}}. Tourism establishments are also considered built-up areas such as golf courses, leisure farms, resorts and the likes.<ref name=\"PNR\"/>\n\n===Water resources===\nThe hydrological network of the province is composed of seven major rivers and its tributaries. These river systems generally flows from the highlands of Tagaytay and Maragondon to Manila Bay. Numerous springs, waterfalls and rivers found in the upland areas of the province, have been developed for tourism.  In the lowland areas, hundreds of [[artesian well]]s and deep wells provide water supply for both residential and irrigation purposes.\n\nCavite shoreline stretches about {{convert|123|km}}. The communities located along the coast are Cavite City, Bacoor, Kawit, Noveleta, Rosario, Tanza, Naic, Maragondon, and Ternate. The richness of Cavite's coastal resources is a major producer of [[oyster]]s and [[mussel]]s. The fishing industry also produces [[shrimp]] and ''bangus'' ([[milkfish]]). The western coastline are lined with of pale gray sand beaches popular with tourists.  Thus, fishery and tourism contributes to the economic activity of the province.<ref>[http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/General%20Information.pdf \"General Information\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131200214/http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/General%20Information.pdf |date=2012-01-31 }}.

Classification of soil types in a specific area is a very important consideration in identifying its most fitted land-use. This way, utmost productivity can be achieved.\n\nThe lowland area of Cavite is generally composed of Guadalupe clay and clay loam. It is characterized as coarse and granular when dry but sticky and plastic when wet. Its substratum is solid volcanic tuff. These types of soils are suited to lowland rice and corn while those in the upland are suited for orchard and pasture. Guadalupe clay adobes are abundant in the southern part of [[Bacoor]] and [[Imus]] bordering [[Dasmari\u00f1as]]. The soil is hard and compact and difficult to cultivate that makes it generally unsuitable for diverse cropping. It is very sticky when wet and granular when dry. Forage grass is advised for this type of soil. Hydrosol and Obando sand are found along Bacoor Bay. The shoreline of [[Rosario, Cavite|Rosario]], [[Tanza]], [[Naic]] and [[Ternate]] are lined with Guadalupe sand.\n\nThe central area principally consists of Magallanes loam with streaks of Magallanes clay loam of sandy texture. This is recommended for diversified farming such as the cultivation of upland rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, coconut, coffee, mangoes and other fruit trees. The steep phase should be forested or planted to rootcrops. The eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceaous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted to rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown in this type of soil. Guingua fine sandy loam is found along the lower part of Malabon and Alang-ilang River at Noveleta.\n\nThe type of soils that dominate the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with mountain soil undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and easy to work on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Santa Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.<ref name=PNR/>\n\n===Mineral resources and reserves===\n\nThe greater parts of Cavite are composed of volcanic materials, tuff, cinders, basalt, breccias, agglomerate and interbeddings of shales, and sandstones. The dormant and active volcanoes (Taal) are within these volcanic areas and have been the sources of volcanic materials which form the Tagaytay Cuesta. The drainage systems are deeply entrenched in the tuffs, eroding thin interbedded sandstones and conglomerate rocks which are the sources of little reserves of sand and gravel in the larger stream. Adobe stone quarries also flourish in the tuff areas.\n\nCavite coastal areas have marl and conglomerate sedimentary rocks and some igneous rocks which are prominent in the high, mountainous regions of western part of the province. Black sands are found in [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]] while [[Noveleta]] has its own salt products. [[Magallanes, Cavite|Magallanes]] has gravel deposits while reserves of sand and gravel materials are found in [[Alfonso]], [[Carmona, Cavite|Carmona]], [[Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo]], [[Naic]], [[Ternate]], [[Maragondon]] and [[Silang, Cavite|Silang]].<ref name=PNR/>\n\n{{clear right}}\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nCavite comprises 16 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]] and 7 [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]]:\n[[File:Ph fil cavite.png|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Political divisions}}]]\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

The tremendous increase can be observed in the year 1990 when industrialization was introduced in the province. Investors established their businesses in different industrial estates that magnetized people to migrate to Cavite due to job opportunities the province offers. Another factor attributed to the increase of population is the mushrooming of housing subdivisions. Since Cavite is proximate to [[Metro Manila]], people working in the metropolitan area choose to live in the province together with their families. Natural increase also contributes to the increase in population.

Emilio Aguinaldo]] has registered the smallest population with 22,220 people.\n\nCavite is classified as predominantly urban having 90.69 percent of the population concentrated in the urban areas, while 9.21 percent of the population reside in the rural areas.\n\n===Religion===\nIn line with national statistics, Christianity is the predominant faith in the province, composed of Catholics, Protestants, and other Independent Christian groups. The majority (70%) of the population are [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]].\n\nAdherents of the [[Philippine Independent Church]], also known as the Aglipayan Church, account for (20%) of the total Cavite population. Aglipayan communities are particularly found in the towns where historically the [[Philippine Revolution]] and anti-clericalist sentiments which resulted from it took full swing.\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] presence in Cavite province was a part of the [[Philippine Orthodox Church]] here in the Philippines under the jurisdiction of the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]] and its own Orthodox Diocese province in Southeast Asia the [[Diocese of the Philippines and Vietnam]], account of (3%) of total of the Cavite's population. Many Orthodox community lives throughout the province especially in the city of [[Tagaytay]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philippine-mission.org/2019/08/hierarchal-liturgy-at-tagaytay/|title=Hierarchal Liturgy at Tagaytay|last=Father|first=Silouan|date=August 10, 2019|website=Philippine Mission of the Russian Orthodox Church|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://orthochristian.com/119595.html|title=RUSSIAN CHURCH ESTABLISHES FOUR DIOCESES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA|date=2019-02-27|access-date=|website=Orthodox Christianity|first=}}</ref>\n\nThe strong presence of other Christian denominations and sects such as the mainline [[Protestant]] Evangelical Churches, Christian Fellowships and other Christian sects is also evident throughout the province.

[[Dambana|Anitism]], [[Animism]], and [[Atheism]] are also practiced in the province.\n\n===Languages===\nThe main languages spoken are [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Chavacano language|Chavacano]] and [[Philippine English|English]]. Due to the province bordering south of [[Metro Manila]], a large number of people from farther provinces migrated to Cavite, resulting in minor but significant usages of [[Bicolano language|Bicolano]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Waray language|Waray]] languages.\n\n====Chavacano in Cavite====\n[[Chavacano]] or Chabacano is a [[Spanish-based creole language]] and known in linguistics as Philippine Creole Spanish. Chabacano is originally spoken by majority of the Cavite\u00f1os that lived in Cavite City and Ternate after the arrival of the Spaniards three centuries ago. The various dialects of [[Chabacano]] were formed out of necessity like all languages, though scholars and laypersons disagree about exactly when and where it all began. The various language groups working at the Cavite naval base needed a way to communicate with each other, and to the soldiers who were barking the orders in less-than-genteel Spanish. It was from this situation that Cavite Chabacano began as a simplified form of Spanish \u2013 a [[pidgin language]] that later developed into a mixed, or [[creole language]]. The fact that the first Chabacanos learned their Spanish from the coarse language of soldiers is probably why they were called Chabacanos in the first place.\n\nHowever, some historians disagree with parts of this story and say that Chabacano did not emerge until almost a century later when Catholic Malays settled in Cavite after the Spaniards had abandoned the Spice Islands to the Dutch in 1662. These Malays, known as the Mardicas (likely from the Malay word ''merdeka'' meaning \"free\" or \"independent\"), settled in Ternate, the town named after their original homeland. They joined with many other language groups to defend Manila from yet another Chinese warlord, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong).<ref>Morrow, Paul (2007-11-01). [http://www.pilipino-express.com/history-a-culture/in-other-words/69-chabacano.html \"Chabacano\"]. Pilipino Express. Retrieved on 2013-06-25.</ref>\n\nNow used almost exclusively in Cavite City and coastal Ternate, Chabacano enjoyed its widest diffusion and greatest splendor in Spanish and American period of Filipino history, when newspapers and literary outputs flourished. Cavite Chabacano was spoken with relative ease because it was essentially a simplification of Castillan morphology patterned after the Tagalog syntax. Gradually and naturally, it acquired the sounds present in the Spanish phonological system. After World War II, creole Spanish speakers within the capital of the archipelago vanished. Around 30,000 Cavite\u00f1os still speak Chabacano, mostly elderly speakers. The language is today taught in elementary schools in both Cavite City and Ternate as part of the K-12 national curiculum from the first to 3rd grades, building up a new generation of speakers and writers within the province.\n\n==Culture==\nAside from the celebrations of town fiestas, the province of Cavite celebrates festivals as forms of thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest. Some of these festivals are also observed in honor of the historical legacies passed from one generation to another generation. In fact, the province fetes the renowned Kalayaan Festival which is given a great social importance in commemoration of the heroism of its people. The annual ''Fiesta de la Reina del Provincia de Cavite'' is a grandiose fiesta celebration in honor of the patroness of the province, the ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga]]''. The image is enshrined at San Roque Church in [[Cavite City]]. Her feastday is celebrated every 2nd and 3rd Sunday of November.\n\nTraditions and fiesta celebrations include ''Mardicas'', a war dance held in Ternate town. ''Karakol'' street dancing with a fluvial procession is usually held in coastal towns. There is also a pre-colonial ritual called the ''Sanghiyang'' as a form of thanksgiving and to heal the sick.{{where|date=June 2013}} Another cultural tradition is the ''Live via Crucis or Kalbaryo ni Hesus'' held during [[Holy Week]].  The ''Maytinis'' or word prayer that is annually held in Kawit every December 24 before the beginning of the midnight Mass.\n\n===Festivals===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size:90%;background-color:#FDFDFD;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Event\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;background-color:#FDFDFD;\" | Fiesta de la Reina de Caracol\n| [[Rosario, Cavite|Rosario]]\n| Held every 3rd weekend of May and 1st weekend of October.

Emilio Aguinaldo.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe province is predominantly an agriculture province. The province's economy is largely dependent to agriculture. Despite urbanization and industrialization, still, a significant number of inhabitants are engaged into agribusinesses. The data gathered from Office of the Provincial Agriculturist shows that though the province lies in the industrial belt, the agricultural land is about 49.38 percent or {{convert|70,466.53|ha}} of the total land area of the Province. This is {{convert|1,176.5|ha}} bigger than that of the declared agricultural lands in 2008 (69,290.03 hectares).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe municipality of Maragondon has the biggest area intended for agriculture, accounts for 14.57% of the total provincial agricultural lands while Cavite City has no longer available land for agriculture related activities and industries. If based on total agricultural lands, we may say that the major players in agriculture in the province are Maragondon, Silang, Indang, Naic and Alfonso. Of the eight districts in the province, the top three with the widest agricultural area are District VII comprising 43,587.01 hectares or 61.85 percent of the total agricultural areas with 27,115 farmers followed by District VI with 17.40 percent or {{convert|12,257.71|ha}} having 8,701 farmers and District V comprising {{convert|10,248.55|ha}} with 10,295 farmers. The municipality of Silang has the most number of farmers. The municipality of Maragondon only ranks 3rd in terms of number of farmers. This can be attributed to highly mechanized operation and vast plantation of rice. The same is true with General Trias and Naic, known as the rice producing municipalities in Cavite. The number of farmers increased by 6.5% that corresponds to around 3,097 farmers. The increase in the number of farmers was due to worldwide recession which led to work displacement of some inhabitants. Silang is dominated by pineapple and coffee plantations as well as with cutflower production.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/Economic%20Sector-Agriculture.pdf \"Agriculture\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415093954/http://www.cavite.gov.ph/Socio-Economic_Profile/2009/Economic%20Sector-Agriculture.pdf |date=2012-04-15 }}.

The famous line of General Douglas McArthur said is associated with Corregidor: \"[[I shall return#World War II|I shall return!]]\"\n\nThere are first class hotels, inns and lodging houses to accommodate both foreign and local tourists. Conference facilities can be found in several convention centers, hotels and resorts in the province. Restaurants and specialty dining places offer mushroom dishes, native delicacies and exotic cuisines. Seafoods, fruits, coffee, organic vegetables, tinapa, handicrafts, ornamental plants also abound in the province.\n\n[[File:Mt. Pico De Loro Monolith.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|The popular hiking destination at Cavite; [[Mount Pico De Loro]] and its monolith}}]]\n\nMountain climbing is also one of the outdoor activities in Cavite. This includes [[Mount Pico De Loro]] which is within the towns of [[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]] and [[Maragondon, Cavite|Maragondon]] (and some parts of it are already part of [[Batangas]]), which is a part of the Palay-Palay and Mataas na Gulod protected landscape. Mt. Pico De Loro is the highest part of Cavite at 664 meters above sea level and is noted for its 360 degree view at its summit and a cliff known as Parrot's Beak or Monolith that mountaineers would also like to climb.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maragondon.cavite.gov.ph/index.php/tourism/naturetrip/27-nature-trip |title=Mt.

There are also tour packages being arranged with the [[Department of Tourism (Philippines)|Department of Tourism]]. Centuries old traditions and the very rich culture of Cavite have been the source of great pride to Cavite\u00f1os.\n\n==Transportation==\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Cavite, particularly the Cavite Peninsula in the north, was a stop for ships from [[South America]] before [[free trade]] opened up.<ref name=Roberts1/>\n\n===Roads===\nCavite's total road network comprises roughly {{convert|1973|km|sp=us}}. Of these, the {{convert|407.7|km|adj=on}} national roads are mostly paved with concrete or asphalt and are relatively in good condition with some portions in need of rehabilitation. Provincial roads stretches to an approximate total length of {{convert|335.1|km|sp=us}}. Most of these roads are concrete, some are paved with asphalt and the rest remain gravel roads. Majority of the municipal/city roads are paved with concrete, while barangay roads consist of 46.7% concrete and asphalt roads and 53.3% earth and gravel roads.\n\nThere are three main highways traversing the province: [[Aguinaldo Highway]] runs in a general north-south direction which includes the [[Tagaytay\u2013Nasugbu Highway]] segment in the south; the [[Governor's Drive]] runs in a general east-west direction; the [[Antero Soriano Highway]] runs within the coastal towns on the northwest. The existing road length computed in terms of road density with respect to population at the standard of {{convert|2.4|km|sp=us}} per 1,000 population has a deficit of {{convert|3,532.71|km|sp=us}}.\n\nIn 2011, the Cavite Expressway ([[Manila\u2013Cavite Expressway|CAVITEx]]) was opened, which lessened the heavy volume of vehicles on Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor. This project decreased the [[traffic congestion]] in Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor, so travel time from Imus to Baclaran/Pasay is lessened to only one hour.\n\nIn 2013, the Kaybiang Tunnel, the country's longest underground highway tunnel at {{convert|300|m|sp=us}} was opened along the [[Ternate\u2013Nasugbu Road]] piercing through Mt. Pico De Loro's north ridge, and shortens the travel time from Manila to the western coves of Cavite and [[Nasugbu, Batangas|Nasugbu]], Batangas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/182813/the-nearness-of-pico-de-loro |title=The nearness of Pico de Loro |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nLast July 24, 2015, the [[Muntinlupa\u2013Cavite Expressway]] (MCX), a {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} long access-controlled toll expressway linking the southern province of Cavite to Muntinlupa in the Philippines, was opened to the public. The road is expected to reduce travel time by an average of 45 minutes from Daang Hari to Alabang Interchange as well as decongest traffic in Cavite, Las Pi\u00f1as and Muntinlupa.\n\nCurrently, Cavite province is served by three [[Department of Public Works and Highways (Philippines)|DPWH]] offices: Cavite 1st, Cavite 2nd and Cavite Sub District Engineering Offices.\n\n===Proposed/ongoing transportation projects===\n\n====Sangley International Airport====\n[[The Department of Transportation]] had \u201cno objection\" to an offer building a P508-billion airport complex on reclaimed land in Sangley Point. The upcoming international airport was pursued as a joint venture between investors,  including Chinese enterprises, and the Cavite LGU.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://business.inquirer.net/272540/new-tack-for-sangley-airport-project|title=New tack for Sangley airport project|publisher=Inquirer Business|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Cavite\u2013Laguna and Cavite\u2013Tagaytay\u2013Batangas Expressways====\nThe [[Cavite\u2013Laguna Expressway]] (CALAEx) is an under-construction expressway that will cross the provinces of Cavite and [[Laguna (Province)|Laguna]] in the [[Philippines]]. The construction of the four-lane {{convert|47|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} long expressway will connect [[CAVITEx]] in [[Kawit, Cavite]] to [[SLEx]] \u2013 Interchange. When constructed, it is expected to ease the traffic in the Cavite\u2013Laguna region, particularly in [[Aguinaldo Highway]], [[Santa Rosa\u2013Tagaytay Road]] and [[Governor's Drive]].\n\n[[Cavite\u2013Tagaytay\u2013Batangas Expressway]] is also a proposed expressway connects with CALAEx from [[Silang, Cavite]] to [[Nasugbu, Batangas]]. CTBEx is a future alternative route for tourists going to [[Tagaytay]] and [[Nasugbu]].\n\n====LRT Line 1 South Extension Project====\nThe [[Manila LRT Line 1|LRT Line 1]] South Extension Project or '''Cavite Extension Project''', through southern Metro Manila to the Province of Cavite has been identified as an integral link of the Rail Transit Network by Metro Manila Urban Transportation Integration Study (MMUTIS). It is one of the priority projects of the [[Department of Transportation and Communications]] (DOTC) and [[Light Rail Transit Authority|LRTA]]. It is also a flagship project of the Office of the President.\n\nThe project aims to expand the existing LRT Line 1 service southward to the cities of [[Para\u00f1aque]], [[Las Pi\u00f1as]] and the city of [[Bacoor]] in the Cavite Province. The 11.7-km route of the light railway system that will start from [[Baclaran]] to Niog was planned to carry a capacity of 40,000 passengers per direction per hour. The extension will have 48 air-conditioned coaches, 12-four car trains, 8 passenger stations and a satellite depot in Cavite. The groundbreaking of LRT Line 1 South Extension Project was held on Thursday, May 4, 2017. The actual construction officially started on Tuesday, May 7, 2019 because the [[Right-of-way]] is \"free and clear\" from obstructions. Once its completed, Cavite will be served by the [[LRT-1]] (via [[Niog station]]). The whole extension line from Baclaran to Niog, Bacoor, Cavite will be finished by 2022. This is the second project outside Metro Manila after the planned [[MRT-7]] that starts from North Avenue, [[Quezon City]] and it will end in [[San Jose Del Monte]], [[Bulacan]]. The said project will serve approximately 1.9 million commuters based in Pasay, Paranaque, Las Pi\u00f1as and Bacoor.\n\n====LRT Line 6 Project====\nThe proposed [[Manila LRT Line 6|LRT Line 6]] project would further extend the LRT system by another 19 kilometers all the way to Dasmari\u00f1as from the proposed end in [[Niog station|Niog]] in Bacoor, Cavite.\n\nThe mass transit system would pass along the Aguinaldo Highway and would have stations in Niog, [[Tirona station|Tirona]] station, [[Imus station|Imus]] station, [[Daang Hari station|Daang Hari]] station, [[Salitran station|Salitran]] station, [[Congressional Avenue station|Congressional Avenue]] station, and [[Governor's Drive station|Governor's Drive]] station. The project will improve passenger mobility and reduce the volume of vehicular traffic in the Cavite area by providing a higher capacity mass transit system. It also aims to spur economic development along the extension corridor.\n\n===Ferry services===\nThere is one ferry service: [[Metrostar Ferry]], from [[Cavite City]] to [[SM Mall of Asia]] in [[Pasay]].\n\n==Government==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Governor===\n* [[Juanito Victor Remulla]] ([[Nacionalista Party|NP]]/[[Partido Magdalo]])\n\n===Vice Governor===\n* [[Jolo Revilla|Ramon M.

The Lazic War lasted for twenty years, from 541 to 562, with varying success and ended in a victory for the Persians, who obtained an annual tribute in exchange for ending the war. The Lazic War is narrated in detail in the works of [[Procopius of Caesarea]] and [[Agathias]].\n\n==Lazica==\nLazica, situated on the eastern shore of the [[Black Sea]], and controlling important mountain passes across the [[Caucasus]] and to the [[Caspian Sea]], had a key strategic importance for both empires. For Byzantines, it was a barrier against a Persian advance through [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Iberia]] to the coasts of the Black Sea. Persians on the other side hoped to gain access to the sea, and control a territory from which Iberia, which was by now under their firm domination, could be threatened.<ref>{{harvnb|Salia|1980|p=113}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nThe Persian [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] recognized Lazica (Egrisi) as part of the Roman/Byzantine sphere of influence by the \"[[Eternal Peace (532)|Eternal Peace]]\" Treaty of 532. By that time, in order to foster their influence over the local monarchy, the Byzantines had insisted on the conversion of the King, [[Tzath I of Lazica|Tzath I]]: he received both baptism and royal attributes in [[Constantinople]], from Emperor [[Justin I]] ([[Justinian I|Justinian's]] predecessor), in 522/3.<ref>{{harvnb|Salia|1980|p=114}}</ref> Byzantine garrisons were stationed in Lazica and in neighboring [[Abkhazia|Abasgia]], mostly in the coastal cities of [[Poti]], [[Sukhum|Sebastopolis]] and [[Pitsunda|Pityus]]. The kingdom's capital, [[Archaeopolis]], was fortified, as well as the southern access to the kingdom on the coastal road at [[Petra, Lazica|Petra]] (present-day [[Tsikhisdziri]], north of [[Batumi]]). In 536, however, the Byzantine presence turned into a full protectorate, as the king lost many powers to the new ''[[magister militum]] per Armeniam''  [[John Tzibus]]. When Tzibus curtailed the freedom of trade of Lazic tradesmen to advance Byzantine interests, the popular dissatisfaction led to a full-scale uprising in 541, and the weakened king, [[Gubazes II of Lazica|Gubazes II]], secretly sought Persian assistance against the Byzantines.\n\n== War ==\n[[File:Nokalakevi (Photo A.

Gubazes II requested aid from Emperor [[Justinian I]] and brought [[Alans]] and [[Sabir people|Sabirs]] to an alliance. Justinian sent 7,000 Roman and 1,000 [[Tzani]] (relatives of the [[Laz people|Lazs]]) auxiliaries under [[Dagisthaeus]] to assist Gubazes, and [[Siege of Petra (549)|besieged]] the Petra fortress, but faced a tough resistance from its heavilly outnumbered garrison. Persian reinforcements under [[Mihr-Mihroe]] defeated a small Byzantine force guarding the mountain passes and then relieved the besieged Petra. Mihr-Mihroe garrisoned 3,000 men in the fortress and marched to [[Armenia]] leaving 5,000 soldiers to plunder Lazica. This force was destroyed by Dagisthaeus at the [[Rioni river|Phasis river]] in 549. The next Persian offensive also proved to be unsuccessful with the commander Chorianes killed in a decisive battle at the river Hippis (now the [[Tskhenistskali]]). The new Byzantine commander Bessas quelled a pro-Persian revolt of the [[Abasgians|Abasgi]] tribe, took and dismantled the fort of Petra after a [[Siege of Petra (550\u2013551)|lengthy siege]], and defeated Mihr-Mihroe at [[Archaeopolis]] in 551. However, the latter managed to capture [[Kutaisi|Cotais]] and the Uthimereos fortress blocking the important roads to the highland regions of [[Lechkhumi|Scymnia]] and [[Svaneti|Souania]]. In the summer of 555, he won an impressive victory at [[Battle of Telephis\u2013Ollaria|Telephis]] and forced the Byzantine-Lazic forces to retreat to Nesos. [[Nachoragan]] replaced Mihr-Mihroe as the latter died of illness shortly after.\n\nKing Gubazes quarreled with Byzantine commanders [[Bessas (general)|Bessas]], [[Martin (general under Justinian I)|Martin]], and Rusticus, complaining to emperor Justinian. Bessas was recalled, but Rusticus and his brother John eventually murdered Gubazes. The Byzantines launched a full-scale assault at [[Siege of Onoguris|Onoguris]], which was repulsed by Nachoragan and resulted in the subsequent destruction of the main Byzantine base at [[Archaeopolis]], which Mihr-Mihroe had twice tried and failed to take. These defeats and the murder of the Lazic king caused a bitter feud between the Lazic and Byzantine generals. The [[Laz people|Lazi]] people got the Emperor to nominate [[Tzath II of Lazica|Tzathes]], the younger brother of Gubazes, as their new king, and Senator Athanasius investigated the assassination. Rusticus and John were arrested, tried, and executed. In 556, the allies retook Archaeopolis and routed Nachoragan in his abortive [[Siege of Phasis|attack on Phasis]]. In the autumn and winter of the same year, the Byzantines suppressed a rebellion staged by the [[mountain tribe]] of the [[Misimians]], and finally expelled the Persians from the country.\n\n== Outcome ==\n{{See also|Fifty-Year Peace Treaty}}\nThen, in 557, a truce ended the hostilities between the Byzantines and Persians, and by the [[Treaty of Dara|\"Fifty Years Peace\" of Dara]] of 562, [[Khosrow I]] recognized Lazica as a Byzantine vassal state for an annual payment of gold.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iberian War]]\n*[[Siege of Edessa (544)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Alemany|first=Agust\u00ed|title=Sixth Century Alania: Between Byzantium, Sasanian Iran and the Turkic World|journal=Transoxiana: Journal Libre de Estudios Orientales (Transoxiana Webfestschrift Series)|year=2003|pages=1\u20138|url=http://www.transoxiana.org/Eran/Articles/alemany.pdf|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|first=Kalistrat|last=Salia|title=Histoire de la nation g\u00e9orgienne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=decTAQAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Nino Salia|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bury|first=John Bagnell|authorlink=J.

The Lazic War lasted for twenty years, from 541 to 562, with varying success and ended in a victory for the Persians, who obtained an annual tribute in exchange for ending the war. The Lazic War is narrated in detail in the works of [[Procopius of Caesarea]] and [[Agathias]].\n\n==Lazica==\nLazica, situated on the eastern shore of the [[Black Sea]], and controlling important mountain passes across the [[Caucasus]] and to the [[Caspian Sea]], had a key strategic importance for both empires. For Byzantines, it was a barrier against a Persian advance through [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Iberia]] to the coasts of the Black Sea. Persians on the other side hoped to gain access to the sea, and control a territory from which Iberia, which was by now under their firm domination, could be threatened.<ref>{{harvnb|Salia|1980|p=113}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nThe Persian [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] recognized Lazica (Egrisi) as part of the Roman/Byzantine sphere of influence by the \"[[Eternal Peace (532)|Eternal Peace]]\" Treaty of 532. By that time, in order to foster their influence over the local monarchy, the Byzantines had insisted on the conversion of the King, [[Tzath I of Lazica|Tzath I]]: he received both baptism and royal attributes in [[Constantinople]], from Emperor [[Justin I]] ([[Justinian I|Justinian's]] predecessor), in 522/3.<ref>{{harvnb|Salia|1980|p=114}}</ref> Byzantine garrisons were stationed in Lazica and in neighboring [[Abkhazia|Abasgia]], mostly in the coastal cities of [[Poti]], [[Sukhum|Sebastopolis]] and [[Pitsunda|Pityus]]. The kingdom's capital, [[Archaeopolis]], was fortified, as well as the southern access to the kingdom on the coastal road at [[Petra, Lazica|Petra]] (present-day [[Tsikhisdziri]], north of [[Batumi]]). In 536, however, the Byzantine presence turned into a full protectorate, as the king lost many powers to the new ''[[magister militum]] per Armeniam''  [[John Tzibus]]. When Tzibus curtailed the freedom of trade of Lazic tradesmen to advance Byzantine interests, the popular dissatisfaction led to a full-scale uprising in 541, and the weakened king, [[Gubazes II of Lazica|Gubazes II]], secretly sought Persian assistance against the Byzantines.\n\n== War ==\n[[File:Nokalakevi (Photo A.

Gubazes II requested aid from Emperor [[Justinian I]] and brought [[Alans]] and [[Sabir people|Sabirs]] to an alliance. Justinian sent 7,000 Roman and 1,000 [[Tzani]] (relatives of the [[Laz people|Lazs]]) auxiliaries under [[Dagisthaeus]] to assist Gubazes, and [[Siege of Petra (549)|besieged]] the Petra fortress, but faced a tough resistance from its heavilly outnumbered garrison. Persian reinforcements under [[Mihr-Mihroe]] defeated a small Byzantine force guarding the mountain passes and then relieved the besieged Petra. Mihr-Mihroe garrisoned 3,000 men in the fortress and marched to [[Armenia]] leaving 5,000 soldiers to plunder Lazica. This force was destroyed by Dagisthaeus at the [[Rioni river|Phasis river]] in 549.
