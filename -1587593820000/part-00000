Andrea Gilbert currently serves as the President of Bryn Mawr Hospital.\n\nIn 2016, Main Line Health broke ground on a $200 million expansion of Bryn Mawr Hospital, which included adding over 200,000 square feet of space including 12 new operating rooms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mainlinemedianews.com/mainlinetimes/news/main-line-health-breaks-ground-for-200-million-expansion-project-at-bryn-mawr-hospital/article_4ab3b0fd-122b-5354-9571-d4f8a4043c07.html|title=Main Line Health breaks ground for $200 million expansion project at Bryn Mawr Hospital|last=Twitter|first=Richard Ilgenfritzrilgenfritz@21st-centurymedia com@rpilgenfritz on|website=Main Line Media News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>\n\nBryn Mawr Hospital is not to be confused with Brynn Marr Hospital, a 100-bed psychiatric hospital in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina]].\n\n==Hospital rating data==\nThe [[HealthGrades]] website contains the latest quality data for Bryn Mawr Hospital, as of 2015.

That same year, a [[cigarette]] tax earmarked for mental-health treatment was cut. One hundred Bryce employees were laid off, including twenty professional staff. Members of the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Alabama]] attempted to file suit on behalf of the laid-off workers, but Federal Judge [[Frank Minis Johnson|Frank M.

He left open, however, the possibility of a suit filed on behalf of patients, whose quality of care was affected.\n\n==''Wyatt v.

In 1971 the plaintiff class was expanded to include patients at Alabama's two other inpatient mental health facilities, [[Searcy Hospital]] ([[Mount Vernon, Alabama|Mt. Vernon]]) and Camp Partlow ([[Coker, Alabama|Coker]]). The resulting court-ordered agreements formed the basis for federal minimum standards for the care of people with mental illness or mental retardations who reside in institutional settings. In 1999 a new [[settlement agreement]] was made, recognizing a great deal of progress. The case was finally dismissed on December 5, 2003, with the finding by Judge [[Myron Thompson]] that Alabama was in compliance with the agreement.\n\nThe standards elaborated in that agreement have served as a model nationwide.  Known as the \"Wyatt Standards,\" they are founded on four criteria for evaluation of care:\n* Humane psychological and physical environment\n* Qualified and sufficient staff for administration of treatment\n* Individualized treatment plans\n* Minimum restriction of patient freedom.\n\nThe case of ''Wyatt v. Stickney'' came to a conclusion after 33 years, through the tenure of nine Alabama governors and fourteen state mental health commissioners, the longest mental health case in national history. The State of Alabama estimates its litigation expenses at over $15 million.<ref name=\"Wyatt\"/>\n\n==Future of Bryce Hospital==\n\nGov. [[Bob Riley]] announced on December 30, 2009 that Bryce Hospital was to relocate into a newly constructed facility across McFarland Boulevard in Tuscaloosa, and the [[University of Alabama]] would take over the current Bryce campus.

The deal, approved by Gov. Bob Riley and the [[Alabama Department of Mental Health]] on December 30, 2009 was worth $72 million in cash for Mental Health to build a replacement hospital. The university will pay $50 million in cash and Mental Health will get another $22 million in state bond money. The university pledged another $10 million to clean up environmental problems on the Bryce grounds and restore the main hospital building, construction of which started in 1853.<ref name=\"tuscnews1\"/>\n\nThe sale of Bryce Hospital and Harper Center to UA was finalized on May 27, 2010 at a price of $87.75 million. $77 million would go to installments plus the aforementioned $10 million for ground improvements.<ref>http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/05/88_million_sale_of_bryce_hospi.html November 5, 2017</ref> \nIn 2014, the remaining patients were moved to a new facility and UA began a restoration project estimated at $40 million.

[[Bob Riley]] announced on December 30, 2009 that Bryce Hospital was to relocate into a newly constructed facility across McFarland Boulevard in Tuscaloosa, and the [[University of Alabama]] would take over the current Bryce campus.  For several years the university had sought the {{convert|180|acre|adj=on}} parcel of land, which is adjacent to its landlocked campus.<ref name=\"tuscnews1\">Bryce Hospital to remain in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20091230/NEWS/912309997/1007?p=1&tc=pg]</ref>\n\nRiley said that a hospital for about 268 patients had been envisioned but the final size was yet to be determined. The deal, approved by Gov. Bob Riley and the [[Alabama Department of Mental Health]] on December 30, 2009 was worth $72 million in cash for Mental Health to build a replacement hospital. The university will pay $50 million in cash and Mental Health will get another $22 million in state bond money. The university pledged another $10 million to clean up environmental problems on the Bryce grounds and restore the main hospital building, construction of which started in 1853.<ref name=\"tuscnews1\"/>\n\nThe sale of Bryce Hospital and Harper Center to UA was finalized on May 27, 2010 at a price of $87.75 million. $77 million would go to installments plus the aforementioned $10 million for ground improvements.<ref>http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/05/88_million_sale_of_bryce_hospi.html November 5, 2017</ref> \nIn 2014, the remaining patients were moved to a new facility and UA began a restoration project estimated at $40 million. Dan Wolfe, University of Alabama planner, revealed the two buildings will house a welcome center, \ntwo museums focusing on mental health and the history of the university, event space and classrooms for performing arts students. The project is expected to be complete by 2020.<ref>http://www.al.com/living/index.ssf/2016/06/inside_the_spooky_skeleton_of.html November 5, 2017</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Bryce Hospital by Highsmith 06.jpg|Entrance gate to the campus\nFile:Bryce State Hospital Tuscaloosa Alabama USA.jpg|Detail of front portico on the Administration Building\nImage:Brycehospital.jpg|A postcard depicting Bryce Hospital around the turn of the 20th  century\nImage:Bryceh1.jpg|Abandoned building on the campus\nImage:Bryceh4.jpg|Admission building, where most patients are located\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*{{Commons category-inline|Bryce State Mental Hospital}}\n* [[Alabama Department of Mental Health]]\n* [[Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law]]\n* ''[[The Meteor]]'', an internal paper published by the residents of Bryce Hospital between 1872 and 1881.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Robert O.
