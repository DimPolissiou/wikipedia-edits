At the Marschallin's suggestion, Octavian acts as Ochs' ''Rosenkavalier'' by presenting a ceremonial silver rose to Sophie.

The curtain rises to show them lounging in bed together just before daybreak (\"Wie du warst! Wie du bist\"). Loud voices are soon heard outside, and the Marschallin has Octavian hide, believing that her husband has returned early from a hunting trip. Octavian emerges in a skirt and bonnet (\"Befehl'n f\u00fcrstli' Gnad'n, i bin halt noch nit recht...\") and tries to sneak away, but the Marschallin's country cousin, Baron Ochs auf Lerchenau, bursts in through the same door.\n\nThe Baron is newly engaged to Sophie Faninal (\"Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich empf\u00e4ngt mich Ihro Gnaden\"), the daughter of a wealthy merchant, though this does not keep him from making lewd comments at the disguised Octavian. Ochs has come to ask two favors: he wants to borrow his cousin's [[Civil law notary#Germany|notary]] to write the marriage contract, and he wants her recommendation of a young nobleman to serve as his Rosenkavalier (\"Knight of the Rose\"), who will deliver the traditional silver engagement rose to Sophie. The Marschallin instructs \"Mariandel\" to fetch Octavian's miniature portrait and present it to the Baron. Ochs easily accepts Octavian as his Rosenkavalier, deciding that the \"maid\" must be that young count's \"bastard sister\", then insists that the Marschallin allow \"Mariandel\" to come and work for his new bride. She refuses as politely as possible and finally dismisses the \"maid\".\n\nA busy reception scene ensues as the room fills with vendors and supplicants to the Marschallin (\"Drei arme adelige Waisen\"), who ignores the former and aids the latter. A tenor sent by the Portuguese [[ambassador]] serenades her (\"Di rigori armato\") while Ochs sits down with the notary. Two Italian intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, present scandal sheets for sale, which the Marschallin coldly declines. Ochs tries to stipulate a gift from Sophie's family consisting of all their properties, free from mortgages, and quickly loses patience with the notary's attempts to explain that this is illegal. Amidst all the activity, the Marschallin remarks to her hairdresser: \"My dear Hippolyte, today you have made me look like an old woman.\" (\"Mein lieber Hippolyte\"). This so disturbs her that she orders the room to be emptied. As the people file out, Valzacchi and Annina offer Baron Ochs their spying services. He asks whether they know anything about \"Mariandel\"; they promptly lie and claim to know all about her.\n\nThe Marschallin, now alone, ponders her waning youth and the unhappiness of her forced marriage, perceiving the same in store for Sophie Faninal (\"Da geht er hin...\"). Octavian returns, dressed again in men's clothes (\"Ach, du bist wieder da\"). When he sees that the Marschallin is out of sorts, he assumes it is from her earlier fear that he might have been discovered. But she is still thinking of the passage of time (a clock is heard chiming thirteen times) and tells him that, very soon, he will leave her for someone younger and prettier. Octavian reacts with frustration, and the Marschallin turns him away. Too late, she realizes that she has neglected to kiss him goodbye. With nothing else to be done, she summons her young page, Mohammed, to take the silver rose to Octavian, then stares pensively into her hand mirror (or similar) as the curtain falls.\n\n[[File:Faistauer Richard Mayr als Ochs.jpg|thumb|upright|1927 portrait of [[Richard Mayr]] as Ochs by [[Anton Faistauer]]. Mayr sang this role 149 times in Vienna, Salzburg and London.]]\n\n===Act 2===\n''The von Faninals' palace''\n\nThe next day, Herr von Faninal exultantly and Sophie nervously await the arrival of the Rosenkavalier (\"Ein ernster Tag, ein grosser Tag!\"). Following tradition, Faninal departs before the Knight appears, saying that he will return with the bridegroom. Sophie prays to keep her sense of humility through all the rapid changes happening in her life, but she is repeatedly interrupted by her [[Chaperone (social)|duenna]], Marianne, who reports from the window on the Rosenkavalier's elaborate entourage (\"In dieser feierlichen Stunde der Pr\u00fcfung\"). Octavian arrives with great pomp, dressed all in silver, and presents the silver rose to Sophie (\"Mir ist die Ehre widerfahren...\"). She smells it, saying it is as sweet as a greeting from Heaven itself. Octavian, instantly smitten, joins her avowal that they will remember this moment until death.\n\nThey settle into a chaperoned conversation. Sophie reveals that she already knows Octavian's full name \u2013 Octavian Maria Ehrenreich Bonaventura Fernand Hyacinth Rofrano \u2013 from studying the catalogue of Austrian nobility to prepare for her marriage. She even knows his nickname: Quinquin, which only intimate friends (including the Marschallin) call him. She adds that she likes him very much. Ochs then enters with Faninal (\"Jetzt aber kommt mein Herr Zuk\u00fcnftiger\") and wastes no time revealing his character to the bride, loudly examining Sophie's body and comparing her to \"an unbroken filly\" when she protests. Once he leaves the room with Faninal to finalize the marriage contract, Sophie and Octavian quickly agree that she will not marry the Baron under any circumstances.\n\nThe young lovers' rapturous duet (\"Mit Ihren Augen voll Tr\u00e4nen\") is soon interrupted by Valzacchi and Annina, who surprise them and call for Ochs. Octavian challenges the Baron to a duel. Ochs runs forward, scratches his arm on the point of Octavian's drawn sword, and screams so that Faninal and the rest of the household come rushing in. Sophie begs her father to call off the wedding, to no avail: Octavian is asked to leave, and Sophie is sent to her room. Ochs is left on the divan, his arm in a sling, nursing a bottle of [[Port wine|port]] and fantasies of revenge against Octavian. But Annina brings him something that raises his spirits much more quickly: a letter signed by \"Mariandel,\" the \"chambermaid\" from Act 1, asking for a tryst. At this, Ochs forgets his sling and waltzes across the stage, ignoring Annina's hints for a tip \u2013 and missing her quiet promise to get even (\"Da lieg' ich!\").\n\n===Act 3===\n''A private room in a shabby inn''\n\nValzacchi and Annina, fed up with the Baron, help Octavian prepare a trap the following evening. Elaborate preparations are seen in [[pantomime]] before Ochs arrives with \"Mariandel,\" ready for a cozy dinner at a table set for two.\n\nIn spite of himself, Ochs is disturbed by \"Mariandel's\" uncanny resemblance to his nemesis Octavian, and he keeps catching glimpses of strange apparitions in the room. A disguised Annina bursts in, calling Ochs her husband and the father of her (numerous) children, who crowd around him crying \"Papa! Papa!\" The Baron calls for the police; to his unpleasant surprise, the vice squad treats ''him'' with suspicion, and Valzacchi is suddenly claiming not to know him. The police inspector asks about the \"woman\" accompanying him, and Ochs lies that \"she\" is his fianc\u00e9e, Sophie Faninal \u2013 just in time for Herr von Faninal to arrive, demanding to know why Ochs' messenger (presumably Valzacchi) has summoned him to this disreputable place. When asked if \"Mariandel\" is his daughter, Faninal retorts in a rage that his daughter is outside. The real Sophie enters and announces once and for all that she does not consider Baron Ochs her bridegroom. Her apoplectic father staggers out, leaning on her shoulder.\n\n\"Mariandel\" now offers to make a statement in private, and retires behind a screen with the Police Inspector. Soon Ochs sees articles of women's clothing coming into view. He rages against the vice squad, but is interrupted by the arrival of the Marschallin. The Police Inspector greets her before clearing the room, and she explains to the Baron that he has been had. Sophie returns, and Octavian emerges, to confirm that they set up a \"masquerade\" together to break his engagement. Ochs, glancing back and forth between Octavian and the Marschallin, now grasps the nature of their relationship and asks for hush money. But he is cowed by the Marschallin's force of will (if not the sight of Octavian's sword) and ingloriously departs, pursued by children and bill collectors.\n\n[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2014 \u2013 Der Rosenkavalier Foto 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Farewell of Marschallin in act 3, with [[Mojca Erdmann]], [[Sophie Koch]] and [[Krassimira Stoyanova]] (from left to right), [[Salzburg Festival]] 2014]]\nThe Marschallin, Sophie, and Octavian are left alone, and Octavian does not know what to do. The Marschallin introduces herself to Sophie, recognizing that the day she feared has come (Trio: \"Marie Theres'!\" / \"Hab' mir's gelobt\"), and releases Octavian to be with the woman he truly loves. She then withdraws, with a promise to Sophie that she will offer Faninal a face-saving ride home in her carriage. As soon as she is gone, Sophie and Octavian run to each other's arms. Faninal and the Marschallin return to find them locked in an embrace. With a last, bittersweet look toward her lost lover, the Marschallin heads for the carriage with Faninal. Sophie and Octavian follow after another brief but ecstatic love duet (\"Ist ein Traum\" / \"Sp\u00fcr' nur dich\"). The opera ends with little Mohammed trotting in to retrieve Sophie's dropped handkerchief, then racing out again after the others.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nStrauss's score is [[Instrumentation (music)|written for]] the following:<ref>[http://www.boosey.com/shop/work-info/Strauss-Rosenkavalier-Suite-op-59/6042 Work details] at [[Boosey & Hawkes]]; [https://en.schott-music.com/shop/der-rosenkavalier-no230.html work details] at [[Schott Music]]</ref>\n* [[Woodwind]]: 3 [[western concert flute|flute]]s (III doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]] (also doubling on 3rd oboe), 3 [[clarinet]]s (III also clarinet in D & E flat), [[basset horn]] (doubles [[bass clarinet]] in B flat and A), 3 [[bassoon]]s (III also [[contrabassoon]])\n* [[Brass instrument|Brass]]: 4 [[French horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[bass tuba]]\n* [[Percussion]]: [[timpani]], [[bass drum]] and [[cymbal]]s, [[triangle]], [[tambourine]], [[glockenspiel]], [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], [[tenor drum]], [[snare drum]], [[jingle bell]]s, [[castanets]]\n* [[Celesta]], 2 [[harp]]s\n* [[string section|Strings]]: 16 [[violin]]s I, 16 violins II, 12 [[viola]]s, 10 [[cello]]s, 8 [[double bass]]es\n* Off-stage: 2 flutes, oboe, 3 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 [[French horn]]s, [[trumpet]], [[drum]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[piano]], [[string orchestra|strings]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Der Rosenkavalier Study Guide|author=Michael Kennedy|authorlink=Michael Kennedy (music critic)|page=28, note 9|chapter=Comedy for Music \u2013 Act Three|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oRjDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA28|year=2011|orig-year=1980|publisher=Overture|location=London|isbn=9780714544953}}</ref>\n\n==''Rosenkavalier'' Suite==\nIn 1945 Strauss allowed an orchestral ''Rosenkavalier'' Suite to be published, but he was apparently not involved in creating it.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SseCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT446 Del Mar 1992], p. 19 on books.google.com</ref> It is likely that conductor [[Artur Rodzi\u0144ski]] arranged it, as he had conducted the Suite's first performance, which was in October 1944 by the [[New York Philharmonic]].<ref>[http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/rosenkavalier-suite-richard-strauss \"About the Piece: ''Rosenkavalier Suite''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714130645/http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/rosenkavalier-suite-richard-strauss |date=2014-07-14 }}, programme note on laphil.com</ref><ref>Don Anderson, [http://www.tso.ca/en-ca/Plan-Your-Experience/Programme-Notes/Suite-from-Der-Rosenkavalier.aspx?ID=4807&pID=4438 Programme Notes: \"R.

Next comes the appearance of Octavian as the \"Rosenkavalier\", which is depicted in tender music; the sight of him looking so young makes the Marschallin realise that he will soon leave her for a younger woman. There follows the duet between Octavian and Sophie (oboe and [[French horn|horn]]) \u2013 in which their love for each other becomes ever more obvious, but this is abruptly interrupted by the discordant music associated with the clumsy arrival of Ochs. Next the violins tentatively introduce the first waltz, which is followed by another given out by the solo violin, before the whole orchestra settles into waltz mode. A general pause and a violin solo leads into the nostalgic music where the Marschallin sadly realises she has lost Octavian. Then comes its ecstatic climax. The work closes with a singularly robust waltz, depicting Ochs at his most pompous, and a boisterous coda newly composed for the suite.\n\n==Language==\n[[Hugo von Hofmannsthal|Hofmannsthal]]'s libretto is a combination of different forms of the German language. Members of the nobility speak in very refined language, often archaic (set to the time of the opera) and very courteous. In more intimate circles they use a more familiar style of speech ({{Lang|de|[[T\u2013V distinction#German|du]]}}). For instance, the conversations between Octavian and the Marschallin in the first act use the familiar \"you\" but switch back and forth between more formal speech (''[[wikt:Sie|Sie]]'') and the familiar ''[[Du (personal pronoun)#German|du]]'',<ref name=\"Jefferson\" /> as well as the intermediate (and now obsolete) ''[[wikt:Er#Pronoun|Er]]''.<ref>For example, \"Beklagt Er sich \u00fcber das, Qinquin?\" in \"Wie Du warst!\" on [http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/bhq8846/large/sco10010.gif page 10] of the piano-vocal score referred to below.</ref>\n\nSome productions of the opera include a glossary in the programme to help clarify the contextual meaning of the language used, which is mostly lost in translation. Baron Ochs makes clumsy, mannered attempts at using refined or flamboyant language, making use of non-German words and phrases such as {{Lang|it|corpo di Bacco!}} (meaning \"by Bacchus' body!\" in Italian), some of which he mispronounces. The language used by Octavian when impersonating Mariandel, and by other non-noble characters, is an Austrian dialect, whose connotations are difficult for non-native speakers to grasp. The German used by the Italians, Valzacchi and Annina, is also very broken and marked by Italian accentuations.<ref name=\"Jefferson\" />\n\nIn English translations of the opera, these dialects have been accounted for with varying degrees of rigor; the Chandos Highlights version, for example, uses only standard British English.<ref name=\"Jefferson\" />\n\n==Grainger's ''Ramble''==\n[[Percy Grainger]] wrote an elaborate and complex piano transcription of a theme from this opera. The ''Ramble on the Last Love Duet in Der Rosenkavalier'' is one of Grainger's more complex piano transcriptions, with many sumptuous ornamentations and harmonic twists and turns.\n\n==Recordings==\n{{Main|Der Rosenkavalier discography}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n* Jefferson, Alan (1985).

The curtain rises to show them lounging in bed together just before daybreak (\"Wie du warst! Wie du bist\"). Loud voices are soon heard outside, and the Marschallin has Octavian hide, believing that her husband has returned early from a hunting trip. Octavian emerges in a skirt and bonnet (\"Befehl'n f\u00fcrstli' Gnad'n, i bin halt noch nit recht...\") and tries to sneak away, but the Marschallin's country cousin, Baron Ochs auf Lerchenau, bursts in through the same door.\n\nThe Baron is newly engaged to Sophie Faninal (\"Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich empf\u00e4ngt mich Ihro Gnaden\"), the daughter of a wealthy merchant, though this does not keep him from making lewd comments at the disguised Octavian. Ochs has come to ask two favors: he wants to borrow his cousin's [[Civil law notary#Germany|notary]] to write the marriage contract, and he wants her recommendation of a young nobleman to serve as his Rosenkavalier (\"Knight of the Rose\"), who will deliver the traditional silver engagement rose to Sophie. The Marschallin instructs \"Mariandel\" to fetch Octavian's miniature portrait and present it to the Baron. Ochs easily accepts Octavian as his Rosenkavalier, deciding that the \"maid\" must be that young count's \"bastard sister\", then insists that the Marschallin allow \"Mariandel\" to come and work for his new bride. She refuses as politely as possible and finally dismisses the \"maid\".\n\nA busy reception scene ensues as the room fills with vendors and supplicants to the Marschallin (\"Drei arme adelige Waisen\"), who ignores the former and aids the latter. A tenor sent by the Portuguese [[ambassador]] serenades her (\"Di rigori armato\") while Ochs sits down with the notary. Two Italian intriguers, Valzacchi and Annina, present scandal sheets for sale, which the Marschallin coldly declines. Ochs tries to stipulate a gift from Sophie's family consisting of all their properties, free from mortgages, and quickly loses patience with the notary's attempts to explain that this is illegal. Amidst all the activity, the Marschallin remarks to her hairdresser: \"My dear Hippolyte, today you have made me look like an old woman.\" (\"Mein lieber Hippolyte\"). This so disturbs her that she orders the room to be emptied. As the people file out, Valzacchi and Annina offer Baron Ochs their spying services. He asks whether they know anything about \"Mariandel\"; they promptly lie and claim to know all about her.\n\nThe Marschallin, now alone, ponders her waning youth and the unhappiness of her forced marriage, perceiving the same in store for Sophie Faninal (\"Da geht er hin...\"). Octavian returns, dressed again in men's clothes (\"Ach, du bist wieder da\"). When he sees that the Marschallin is out of sorts, he assumes it is from her earlier fear that he might have been discovered. But she is still thinking of the passage of time (a clock is heard chiming thirteen times) and tells him that, very soon, he will leave her for someone younger and prettier. Octavian reacts with frustration, and the Marschallin turns him away. Too late, she realizes that she has neglected to kiss him goodbye. With nothing else to be done, she summons her young page, Mohammed, to take the silver rose to Octavian, then stares pensively into her hand mirror (or similar) as the curtain falls.\n\n[[File:Faistauer Richard Mayr als Ochs.jpg|thumb|upright|1927 portrait of [[Richard Mayr]] as Ochs by [[Anton Faistauer]]. Mayr sang this role 149 times in Vienna, Salzburg and London.]]\n\n===Act 2===\n''The von Faninals' palace''\n\nThe next day, Herr von Faninal exultantly and Sophie nervously await the arrival of the Rosenkavalier (\"Ein ernster Tag, ein grosser Tag!\"). Following tradition, Faninal departs before the Knight appears, saying that he will return with the bridegroom. Sophie prays to keep her sense of humility through all the rapid changes happening in her life, but she is repeatedly interrupted by her [[Chaperone (social)|duenna]], Marianne, who reports from the window on the Rosenkavalier's elaborate entourage (\"In dieser feierlichen Stunde der Pr\u00fcfung\"). Octavian arrives with great pomp, dressed all in silver, and presents the silver rose to Sophie (\"Mir ist die Ehre widerfahren...\"). She smells it, saying it is as sweet as a greeting from Heaven itself. Octavian, instantly smitten, joins her avowal that they will remember this moment until death.\n\nThey settle into a chaperoned conversation. Sophie reveals that she already knows Octavian's full name \u2013 Octavian Maria Ehrenreich Bonaventura Fernand Hyacinth Rofrano \u2013 from studying the catalogue of Austrian nobility to prepare for her marriage. She even knows his nickname: Quinquin, which only intimate friends (including the Marschallin) call him. She adds that she likes him very much. Ochs then enters with Faninal (\"Jetzt aber kommt mein Herr Zuk\u00fcnftiger\") and wastes no time revealing his character to the bride, loudly examining Sophie's body and comparing her to \"an unbroken filly\" when she protests. Once he leaves the room with Faninal to finalize the marriage contract, Sophie and Octavian quickly agree that she will not marry the Baron under any circumstances.\n\nThe young lovers' rapturous duet (\"Mit Ihren Augen voll Tr\u00e4nen\") is soon interrupted by Valzacchi and Annina, who surprise them and call for Ochs. Octavian challenges the Baron to a duel. Ochs runs forward, scratches his arm on the point of Octavian's drawn sword, and screams so that Faninal and the rest of the household come rushing in. Sophie begs her father to call off the wedding, to no avail: Octavian is asked to leave, and Sophie is sent to her room. Ochs is left on the divan, his arm in a sling, nursing a bottle of [[Port wine|port]] and fantasies of revenge against Octavian. But Annina brings him something that raises his spirits much more quickly: a letter signed by \"Mariandel,\" the \"chambermaid\" from Act 1, asking for a tryst. At this, Ochs forgets his sling and waltzes across the stage, ignoring Annina's hints for a tip \u2013 and missing her quiet promise to get even (\"Da lieg' ich!\").\n\n===Act 3===\n''A private room in a shabby inn''\n\nValzacchi and Annina, fed up with the Baron, help Octavian prepare a trap the following evening. Elaborate preparations are seen in [[pantomime]] before Ochs arrives with \"Mariandel,\" ready for a cozy dinner at a table set for two.\n\nIn spite of himself, Ochs is disturbed by \"Mariandel's\" uncanny resemblance to his nemesis Octavian, and he keeps catching glimpses of strange apparitions in the room. A disguised Annina bursts in, calling Ochs her husband and the father of her (numerous) children, who crowd around him crying \"Papa! Papa!\" The Baron calls for the police; to his unpleasant surprise, the vice squad treats ''him'' with suspicion, and Valzacchi is suddenly claiming not to know him. The police inspector asks about the \"woman\" accompanying him, and Ochs lies that \"she\" is his fianc\u00e9e, Sophie Faninal \u2013 just in time for Herr von Faninal to arrive, demanding to know why Ochs' messenger (presumably Valzacchi) has summoned him to this disreputable place. When asked if \"Mariandel\" is his daughter, Faninal retorts in a rage that his daughter is outside. The real Sophie enters and announces once and for all that she does not consider Baron Ochs her bridegroom. Her apoplectic father staggers out, leaning on her shoulder.\n\n\"Mariandel\" now offers to make a statement in private, and retires behind a screen with the Police Inspector. Soon Ochs sees articles of women's clothing coming into view. He rages against the vice squad, but is interrupted by the arrival of the Marschallin. The Police Inspector greets her before clearing the room, and she explains to the Baron that he has been had. Sophie returns, and Octavian emerges, to confirm that they set up a \"masquerade\" together to break his engagement. Ochs, glancing back and forth between Octavian and the Marschallin, now grasps the nature of their relationship and asks for hush money. But he is cowed by the Marschallin's force of will (if not the sight of Octavian's sword) and ingloriously departs, pursued by children and bill collectors.\n\n[[File:Salzburger Festspiele 2014 \u2013 Der Rosenkavalier Foto 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Farewell of Marschallin in act 3, with [[Mojca Erdmann]], [[Sophie Koch]] and [[Krassimira Stoyanova]] (from left to right), [[Salzburg Festival]] 2014]]\nThe Marschallin, Sophie, and Octavian are left alone, and Octavian does not know what to do. The Marschallin introduces herself to Sophie, recognizing that the day she feared has come (Trio: \"Marie Theres'!\" / \"Hab' mir's gelobt\"), and releases Octavian to be with the woman he truly loves. She then withdraws, with a promise to Sophie that she will offer Faninal a face-saving ride home in her carriage. As soon as she is gone, Sophie and Octavian run to each other's arms. Faninal and the Marschallin return to find them locked in an embrace. With a last, bittersweet look toward her lost lover, the Marschallin heads for the carriage with Faninal. Sophie and Octavian follow after another brief but ecstatic love duet (\"Ist ein Traum\" / \"Sp\u00fcr' nur dich\").

Next comes the appearance of Octavian as the \"Rosenkavalier\", which is depicted in tender music; the sight of him looking so young makes the Marschallin realise that he will soon leave her for a younger woman. There follows the duet between Octavian and Sophie (oboe and [[French horn|horn]]) \u2013 in which their love for each other becomes ever more obvious, but this is abruptly interrupted by the discordant music associated with the clumsy arrival of Ochs. Next the violins tentatively introduce the first waltz, which is followed by another given out by the solo violin, before the whole orchestra settles into waltz mode. A general pause and a violin solo leads into the nostalgic music where the Marschallin sadly realises she has lost Octavian. Then comes its ecstatic climax. The work closes with a singularly robust waltz, depicting Ochs at his most pompous, and a boisterous coda newly composed for the suite.\n\n==Language==\n[[Hugo von Hofmannsthal|Hofmannsthal]]'s libretto is a combination of different forms of the German language. Members of the nobility speak in very refined language, often archaic (set to the time of the opera) and very courteous. In more intimate circles they use a more familiar style of speech ({{Lang|de|[[T\u2013V distinction#German|du]]}}). For instance, the conversations between Octavian and the Marschallin in the first act use the familiar \"you\" but switch back and forth between more formal speech (''[[wikt:Sie|Sie]]'') and the familiar ''[[Du (personal pronoun)#German|du]]'',<ref name=\"Jefferson\" /> as well as the intermediate (and now obsolete) ''[[wikt:Er#Pronoun|Er]]''.<ref>For example, \"Beklagt Er sich \u00fcber das, Qinquin?\" in \"Wie Du warst!\" on [http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/variations/scores/bhq8846/large/sco10010.gif page 10] of the piano-vocal score referred to below.</ref>\n\nSome productions of the opera include a glossary in the programme to help clarify the contextual meaning of the language used, which is mostly lost in translation. Baron Ochs makes clumsy, mannered attempts at using refined or flamboyant language, making use of non-German words and phrases such as {{Lang|it|corpo di Bacco!}} (meaning \"by Bacchus' body!\" in Italian), some of which he mispronounces. The language used by Octavian when impersonating Mariandel, and by other non-noble characters, is an Austrian dialect, whose connotations are difficult for non-native speakers to grasp. The German used by the Italians, Valzacchi and Annina, is also very broken and marked by Italian accentuations.<ref name=\"Jefferson\" />\n\nIn English translations of the opera, these dialects have been accounted for with varying degrees of rigor; the Chandos Highlights version, for example, uses only standard British English.<ref name=\"Jefferson\" />\n\n==Grainger's ''Ramble''==\n[[Percy Grainger]] wrote an elaborate and complex piano transcription of a theme from this opera. The ''Ramble on the Last Love Duet in Der Rosenkavalier'' is one of Grainger's more complex piano transcriptions, with many sumptuous ornamentations and harmonic twists and turns.\n\n==Recordings==\n{{Main|Der Rosenkavalier discography}}\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n* Jefferson, Alan (1985).

{"title_page": "Option ROM", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}\nAn '''Option ROM''' is a piece of [[firmware]] that resides in  BIOS or on an expansion card, which gets shadowed into memory and executed to initialise the device and register it with the BIOS. It is essentially a driver that interfaces between BIOS services and hardware.\n\n== BIOS Boot Specification ==\nThe BIOS Boot Specification (BBS) was developed by a consortium comprising [[Compaq]], [[Intel]] and [[Phoenix Technologies]] to standardise the initialisation sequence of PnP BIOS option ROMs and legacy option ROMs not conforming to the PnP BIOS standard and the order in which they hook interrupts. The standard presents the notion of a BCV table and BCV priority. The core principles of the standard make behaviour more defined and debuggable and gives BIOS manufacturers room to further dynamise boot device selection for the user on top of suggestions of the standard.\n\nA common option ROM is the [[video BIOS]] which gets loaded very early on in the boot process and hooks [[INT 10H|INT 10h]] so that output from the [[power-on self-test]] (POST) can be displayed. The video BIOS is almost always located in the <code>C000</code> memory segment, the start of the memory area reserved for option ROMs; this is because when the motherboard has a built in VGA controller, the option ROM will reside in the BIOS \u2013 the BIOS knows where it is and shadows it into memory at a fixed time. Other ROMs can be located from segments <code>C800</code> all the way up to <code>F400</code> in early PCs.<ref name=\"IBM PC XT Technical Reference\">[http://www.reenigne.org/crtc/PC-XT.pdf IBM PC XT Technical Reference], pg. 2-10</ref> The final search address was eventually limited to <code>E000</code><ref name=\"Personal System/2 and Personal Computer BIOS Interface Technical Reference\">[http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ibm/pc/ps2/PS2_and_PC_BIOS_Interface_Technical_Reference_Apr87.pdf Personal System/2 and Personal Computer BIOS Interface Technical Reference], pg. 4-12</ref> in later products. The BIOS Boot Specification requires that option ROMs be aligned to 2kB boundaries (e.g. segments <code>C800, C880, C900, C980</code>, etc.). The first two bytes of the ROM must be <code>55 AA</code>.<ref name=\"The execution environment of Etherboot\">[http://etherboot.sourceforge.net/doc/html/devman/extension.html The execution environment of Etherboot]</ref>\n\nAfter the basic POST checks are complete, the BBS specifies that the BIOS will detect and shadow all option ROMs that reside in the BIOS into the aforementioned region and it will traverse the PCI configuration space, filling in XROMBARs and copying the expansion card option ROMs from MMIO space to the region. The BIOS then scans the region, and if the option ROM has a PnP Expansion header, it does a far call to offset +03h in the option ROM header to initialise it. It then rescans the region after all the PnP option ROMs have been initialised (because, as appendix E states, the option ROM initialisation routine may have chained more PnP expansion headers for individual disks the device owns). It adds the BCV pointer (if present) in the PnP Expansion headers it finds the BCV Table or the BEV pointer (if present) to the IPL priority table. The BCV entries in the BCV table are then called according to priority togglable in [[Nonvolatile BIOS memory|NVRAM]]. The BCV table is full of BCV function pointers but has a fixed entry representing legacy option ROMs which is a pointer to a BIOS routine which calls +03h in all the remaining option ROMs that don't have a PnP Expansion header. The BCV function initialises the INT 13h and INT 19h hooks, which the BBS stipulates must not be done in the initialisation routine at +03h. If a device has no PnP Expansion header, it may perform any hook in the routine at +03h, as it is a legacy card.\n\nIn the initial initialisation routine, as the Option ROM points to a PCI data structure (not the same as the configuration space), the option ROM code knows the device and vendor ID is at a fixed offset from [[Program counter|RIP]]. This allows it to scan the PCI configuration space to find the correct device and BARs it needs to use. To prevent this scan, and in case of two identical cards in the system, the BIOS passes the PFA (bus/device/function) to the initialisation routine in AX, and the card select number (CSN) for ISA option ROMs is passed in BX. It can then interact with the device using [[PMIO]] / [[MMIO]] to see how many disks it has and which ones are bootable by reading the [[Master boot record|MBR]]. The BIOS will have already combed the configuration space, allocated the BARs and filled in the ACPI table prior to the initialisation routine call, so the option ROM would use the addresses allocated to its BARs. The BCV, however, hooks interrupt routines which interact with the device which are adjusted based on a base MMIO address location, disk information ascertained in the option ROM initialisation routine and the current disk number in the BDA.\n\nThe BIOS INT 19h procedure then uses the IPL table priority in NVRAM to decide whether to call an entry containing a boot handler which will read the MBR of 00h (floppy disk BAID; the first device in the BCV table to register disk 00h), an entry containing a boot handler which will read the MBR of 80h (the hard drive BAID; the first device in the BCV Table to register disk 80h) or one of the BEV entries in the table. A device only has a BEV or a BCV if it is a bootable device.\n\n=== SCSI ===\nAn ISA [[SCSI]] controller card may hook [[INT 13]] which is responsible for providing disk services. It will do so in its BCV if it is a PnP ISA card. Once it has done this, any subsequent calls to INT 13h will be \"caught\" by the SCSI option ROM (or \"SCSI BIOS\"), allowing it to respond for disks that may exist on the SCSI bus. Before it had hooked the interrupt there may have been no disks on the system, but by intercepting the interrupt and altering the values returned, the SCSI BIOS can make all the disks on the SCSI bus visible to the system.\n\nIn this particular case, the BIOS itself may call INT 13h to provide a list of possible boot devices to the user, and because the SCSI BIOS has hooked the interrupt the user will be able to choose not only which standard system devices to boot from, but also which SCSI disks as well. This is because, as suggested in Appendix D of the Boot BIOS Specification, the BIOS could populate the IPL table with device and vendor information from INT 13h calls to the different disks, paired with the Hard Disk Number (80h, 81h ...), to allow any Hard Disk Device to be booted from, rather than just the first disk of the first controller to hook INT 13h be bootable (the highest priority item in the BCV table), referred to as a BIOS Aware IPL Device (BAID) in the specification.\n\nMultiple controllers can hook INT 13h at once. For instance, after the SCSI controller, an AHCI controller can also hook INT 13h by putting a call to the previous handler, which was stored in the IDT at entry 13h by the SCSI controller, at the end of its own handler, which it then puts in the IDT at entry 13h. If INT 13h is called with DL = 83h, then the controller that assigned a disk range containing 83h will respond, otherwise it will skip and call the previous handler. The first controller to hook INT 13h will see that 0 disks have been installed by checking the byte at <code>0040:0075</code>, which resides in the BIOS Data Area (BDA), and if it has 4 disks to enumerate, it will assign the range 80h\u201383h and store '4' in the BDA.\n\n=== Network boot ROM ===\nAnother common option ROM is a [[Network booting|network boot]] ROM. The option ROM contains the program required to download the boot code. The original [[IBM Personal Computer]] ROMs hooked INT 18H (originally to invoke [[Cassette BASIC]]) and INT 19H, as these two interrupts were designated when the boot process is about to begin. INT 19H is called to initiate the boot process, while INT 18H is called when the system tries to boot from all possible devices and none were bootable. Originally, by hooking INT 18H, the system would invoke [[Cassette BASIC]] (if present) or try to boot from the network when all other boot devices (floppy drives, hard drives, etc.) had failed. By hooking INT 19H, the system would attempt to boot from the network before any other devices. The BBS specifies that the NIC option ROM does not hook 19h, instead the BIOS 19h handler should call the BEV, which will then download the boot code.\n\n== UEFI Option ROMs ==\n{{expand section|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe PCI spec allows multiple option ROM images on the same device. These option ROMs could be Legacy x86 & UEFI. If the Option ROM format is set to UEFI Compatible in the UEFI BIOS, the DXE stage will load the newer EFI ROM if one is present (which is written in EFI byte code) and the legacy ROM if one is not. UEFI BIOS can use legacy option ROMs when a [[Compatibility support module|Compatibility Support Module]] (CSM) is enabled. Note that when Secure Boot is enabled, execution of the Compatibility Support Module and legacy ROMs is prohibited because legacy firmware drivers do not support authentication, which is a security threat.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/uefi-validation-option-rom-validation-guidance|title=Microsoft docs|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[BIOS]]\n* [[Booting]]\n* [[Bootstrapping]]\n* [[Firmware]]\n* [[Legacy Plug and Play]]\n* [[PCI configuration space]]\n* [[Read-only memory|ROM]]\n* PXE [[Preboot eXecution Environment]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:BIOS]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}\nAn '''Option ROM''' is a piece of [[firmware]] that resides in  BIOS or on an expansion card, which gets shadowed into memory and executed to initialise the device and register it with the BIOS.
