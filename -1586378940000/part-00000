An economics [[lecturer]] and wartime [[civil servant]], he was elected to Parliament in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] and held office in [[Clement Attlee]]'s governments, notably as [[Minister of Fuel and Power]] after the [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom|bitter winter of 1946\u201347]], and eventually joining the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. Facing the need to increase military spending in 1951, he imposed [[National Health Service]] charges on dentures and spectacles, prompting the leading [[left-wing politics|left-winger]] [[Aneurin Bevan]] to resign from the Cabinet.\n\nThe perceived similarity in his outlook to that of his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] counterpart [[Rab Butler]] was dubbed \"[[Butskellism]]\", initially a satirical term, after an elision of their names, and was one aspect of the [[post-war consensus]] through which the major parties largely agreed on the main points of domestic and foreign policy until the 1970s.<ref name=\"Richard Heffernan 2000 p 301\">Brian Brivati and Richard Heffernan, eds. ''The Labour Party: a centenary history'' (Macmillan, 2000) p 301.</ref><ref>Neil Rollings, \"\u2018Poor Mr Butskell: A Short Life, Wrecked by Schizophrenia\u2019?.\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' 5#2 (1994): 183-205.</ref> With Labour in opposition from [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]], Gaitskell won bitter leadership battles with Bevan and his supporters to become the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] in 1955. In 1956 he opposed the Eden government's use of military force at [[Suez Crisis|Suez]]. Against a backdrop of a booming economy he led Labour to its third successive defeat at the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]].\n\nIn the late 1950s, in the teeth of opposition from the major [[trade unions]], he attempted in vain to remove [[Clause IV]] of the [[Labour Party Constitution]], which committed Labour to [[nationalisation]] of all the means of production. He did not reject public ownership altogether, but also emphasised the ethical goals of liberty, social welfare and above all equality, and argued that they could be achieved by fiscal and social policies within a [[mixed economy]]. His revisionist views, on the [[right-wing politics|right wing]] of the Labour Party, were sometimes called [[Gaitskellism]].\n\nDespite this setback, Gaitskell reversed an attempt to adopt [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]] as Labour Party policy, and opposed [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]]'s attempt to lead the UK into the [[European Union|European Common Market]]. He was loved and hated for his confrontational leadership and brutal frankness. He died suddenly in 1963, when he appeared to be on the verge of leading Labour back into power and becoming the next Prime Minister.\n\n== Early life ==\nHugh Gaitskell was born in [[Kensington]], [[London]], the third and youngest child of Arthur Gaitskell (1869\u20131915), of the [[Indian Civil Service]], and Adelaide Mary, ''n\u00e9e'' Jamieson (died 1956), whose father, George Jamieson, was [[consul-general]] in [[Shanghai]] and prior to that had been Judge of the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\">Matthew 2004, p.287</ref> He was known as \"Sam\" as a child.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> The Gaitskells had a long family connection with the Indian Army, and he spent his childhood in [[Burma]]. After his father's death, his mother soon remarried and returned to Burma, leaving him at [[boarding school]].<ref>Campbell 2010, p197</ref>\n\nGaitskell was educated at the [[Dragon School]] from 1912\u20131919, where he was a friend of the future poet [[John Betjeman]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\">Matthew 2004, p.290</ref> He then attended [[Winchester College]] from 1919 to 1924.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" />\n\nHe attended [[New College, Oxford]], from 1924\u20131927. Studying under [[G. D. H. Cole]], Gaitskell became a [[socialist]] and wrote a long essay on [[Chartism]], arguing that the [[working class]] needed [[middle class]] leadership. Gaitskell's first political involvement came about as a result of the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike of 1926]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Most students supported the government and many volunteered for civil defence duties, or helped to run essential services. Gaitskell, unusually, supported the strikers and acted as a driver for people like his Oxford contemporary [[Evan Durbin]] and Cole's wife [[Margaret Cole|Margaret]], who made speeches and delivered the trade union newspaper ''[[British Worker]]''. After the collapse of the General Strike, Gaitskell spent another six months raising funds for the miners, whose dispute (technically a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] rather than a strike) did not end until November.<ref>Williams 1985, p18-19</ref> He graduated with a [[first-class degree]] in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] in 1927.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" />\n\n== Academic and early political career ==\nIn 1927\u201328 Gaitskell lectured in economics for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] to miners in [[Nottinghamshire]]. His essay on Chartism was published as a WEA booklet in 1928.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> This was his first experience of interaction with the working class.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p198\">Campbell 2010, p198</ref> Gaitskell eventually came to oppose both Cole's [[Guild Socialism]] and [[Syndicalism]] and to feel that the General Strike had been the last failed spasm of a strategy - attempting to seize power through direct trade union action - which had already been tried in the abortive [[Black Friday (1921)|Triple Alliance Strike of 1921]]. It is unclear whether Gaitskell was ever sympathetic to [[Oswald Mosley]], then seen as a future leader of the Labour Party. Gaitskell's wife later insisted that he never had been, but Margaret Cole, Evan Durbin's wife and [[Noel Frederick Hall|Noel Hall]] believed that he was, although as an opponent of factional splits he was not tempted to join Mosley's [[New Party (UK)|New Party]] in 1931.<ref>Williams 1985, p43</ref>\n\nGaitskell helped to run the New [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] Research Bureau, set up by G. D. H. Cole in March 1931.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> He was selected as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate for [[Chatham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chatham]] in autumn 1932.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Gaitskell moved to [[University College London]] in the early 1930s at the invitation of Noel Hall.<ref name=\"Saville_1980\">{{cite journal | author = [[John Saville]] | publisher = [[Socialist Register]] | work = The Socialist Register 1980 | title = Hugh Gaitskell (1906\u20131963): An assessment | date = 18 March 1980 | volume = 17 | issue = 17 | pages = 155\u2013158 | url = http://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5450/2349 | accessdate = 8 October 2010}}</ref> In 1934 he joined the XYZ Club, a club for Labour financial experts (e.g. [[Hugh Dalton]], of whom he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Douglas Jay]] and [[Evan Durbin]]) and City people such as the economist Nicholas Davenport.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Dalton and Gaitskell were often referred to as \"Big Hugh and Little Hugh\" over the next fifteen years.<ref>Williams 1985, p70</ref>\n\nIn 1934 Gaitskell was in [[Vienna]] on a Rockefeller scholarship.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> He was attached to the [[University of Vienna]] for the 1933\u201334 academic year and witnessed first-hand the political suppression of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democratic]] workers movement by the [[Fatherland's Front|conservative]] [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]'s government in February 1934.<ref name=\"Saville_1980\" /> This event made a lasting impression, making him profoundly hostile to conservatism but also making him reject as futile the Marxian outlook of many European social democrats. This placed him in the socialist [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]] camp.\n\nAt the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], he stood unsuccessfully as the Labour Party candidate for [[Chatham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chatham]]. Gaitskell helped to draft \"Labour\u2019s Immediate Programme\" in 1937. This had a strong emphasis on planning, although not as much as his mentor Dalton would have liked, with no plans for the nationalisation of banks or the steel industry. He also drafted documents which would have been used in the election due in 1939\u201340.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Dalton helped him to be selected as candidate for South Leeds in 1937, and had it not been for the war, he would very likely have become an MP by 1940.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p198\" />\n\nGaitskell became head of the Department of Political Economy at UCL when Hall was appointed Director of the [[National Institute of Economic and Social Research]] in 1938,<ref>Brian  Brivati, \"Gaitskell, Hugh Todd Naylor (1906\u20131963)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> jointly with [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]].<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.567\">Dell 1997, p.567</ref> He also became a University Reader.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> He opposed the [[appeasement]] of [[Nazi Germany]]<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> and supported rearmament.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p198\" />\n\n== Marriage and personal life ==\nWhilst a WEA lecturer in the late 1920s Gaitskell lived for a time with a local woman in Nottinghamshire. This is thought to have been his first adult relationship.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Until the early 1930s he rejected marriage as a \"bourgeois convention\".<ref>Williams 1985, p24</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1930s Gaitskell had formed a close relationship with a married woman, [[Anna Dora Gaitskell|Mrs. Dora Frost]] (n\u00e9e Creditor), who came out to join him in Vienna for the latter part of his stay there. Adultery still carried such stigma that she thought it best not to help him during his Parliamentary campaign in Chatham in 1935. After her divorce, hard to obtain prior to the passage of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]], they were eventually married on 9 April 1937, Gaitskell's thirty-first birthday, with Evan Durbin as best man.<ref>Williams 1985, p79</ref> Dora had a son, Raymond Frost (b 1925), from her first marriage.<ref>Williams 1985, p37</ref> The Gaitskells had two daughters: Julia, born in 1939 and Cressida, born in 1942. Dora Gaitskell became a Labour [[life peer]] one year after his death, and died in 1989.<ref name=\"ODNB\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39851 William Rodgers: ''Gaitskell, (Anna) Dora, Baroness Gaitskell (1901\u20131989)'' rev.

Observers watched Gaitskell blossom and enjoy exercising power. Dalton liked to shout at his subordinates; Gaitskell sometimes shouted back.<ref>Williams 1985, pp98-9</ref> Along with Dalton Gaitskell was moved to the [[Board of Trade]] in February 1942, where for the first time he came into contact with the leaders of the miners\u2019 unions, who were later to support him in his struggles against [[Aneurin Bevan]] in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\">Matthew 2004, p.288</ref> For his service, he was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1945.\n\nIn March 1945 Gaitskell suffered a [[coronary thrombosis]] brought on by overwork. Advised to rest, he considered withdrawing from his parliamentary candidacy in [[Leeds]], but he was popular with his constituency workers and they offered to campaign for him even if he was unable to do so.<ref>Williams 1985, p124-5</ref> He was also approached to return to UCL as a Professor after the war, but he disliked the constant state of flux of academic economics and the increasing emphasis on mathematics, a subject of which he had little knowledge. By now he found himself more drawn to public life.<ref>Williams 1985, p81</ref>\n\nGaitskell was elected Labour [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Leeds South (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds South]] in the Labour landslide victory of [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> Despite his illness, as a protege of Dalton he was seriously considered for immediate appointment as a junior minister, Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the [[Board of Trade]] (under [[Stafford Cripps]]).<ref>Williams 1985, p130</ref> This would have been a rare honour as 263 of the 393 Labour MPs in 1945 were newly elected, but did not take place.<ref>Dell 1997, p.15 Harold Wilson, another newly-elected economics don and wartime civil servant, was appointed a junior minister immediately</ref>\n\nAs a backbencher, he spoke in debates in support of Dalton's [[Bank of England Act 1946|nationalisation]] of the [[Bank of England]], which eventually received Royal Assent on 14 February 1946. Dalton was trying to score party points by claiming that he was reasserting political control over the [[City of London]], a far-fetched claim as the Bank was already under political control. Although some Conservative MPs spoke against the measure it was not opposed by Churchill, then Leader of the Opposition, who had had an ambivalent view of the Bank since his own time as chancellor in the 1920s.<ref>Dell 1997, p.77</ref>\n\n== Ministry of Fuel and Power ==\nGaitskell was given his first ministerial appointment in May 1946 as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Fuel and Power, serving under [[Manny Shinwell|Emmanuel \"Manny\" Shinwell]]. The job had initially been earmarked for [[Harold Wilson]], with Gaitskell pencilled in to succeed Wilson as Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. Gaitskell believed that Shinwell, who was suspicious of middle class intellectual socialists, may have picked him in preference to Wilson because the latter was already an expert on the mining industry.<ref>Williams 1985, p132</ref>\n\nGaitskell played an important role steering the [[Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946|Coal Nationalisation Bill]] through the House of Commons, bearing the brunt of the committee stage and winding up the final debate. In the [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom|fuel crisis of February 1947]] Shinwell, who had ignored Gaitskell's warnings, had to ask the Cabinet for permission to shut down power stations; Gaitskell was put on and ran the key committee which decided where coal should be sent. In 1947 he once again played an important role steering [[Electricity Act 1947|electricity nationalisation]] through the House of Commons, winding up the debate on the [[second reading]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" />\n\nOn 7 October 1947 Gaitskell was promoted to [[Ministry of Fuel and Power|Minister of Fuel and Power]] in Shinwell's place. He was not made a member of the Cabinet,<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> although he often attended Cabinet meetings when his input was required.<ref>Dell 1997, p.135</ref> He had committed a gaffe during the municipal election campaign in Hastings earlier that year, when he recommended that people save fuel by taking fewer baths, adding that he had never taken all that many himself; in the House of Commons in late October Churchill joked that it was no wonder that the Government were \"in bad odour\" and asked the Speaker if he might be permitted to describe Labour ministers as \"lousey\", normally an unparliamentary expression, as it would be a simple statement of fact.<ref>Williams 1985, p151</ref> Gaitskell made himself very unpopular by abolishing the basic petrol ration for private motorists, but encouraged the building of oil refineries, a move little-noticed at the time which would have important repercussions for the future.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" />\n\n== Treasury matters ==\n\n=== Devaluation ===\nIn early July 1949 Gaitskell shared [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Stafford Cripps]]' worries that Treasury officials were too \"liberal\" and too reluctant to implement socialist measures.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p. 119-21\">Dell 1997, p. 119-21</ref> Like Cripps and Dalton, Gaitskell was a devotee of cheap money. Not only were higher interest rates seen as associated with the [[Gold standard]] and the deflationary policies of the 1920s, but the policy preference in the 1940s was for quantitative controls (e.g. [[exchange controls]] in finance, or rationing of physical goods) rather than the price mechanism. Interest rates, which had been cut to low levels in the 1930s, did not begin to be used as an instrument of policy again until after the Conservatives returned to power in 1952.<ref>Dell 1997, p. 111</ref>\n\nCripps was seriously unwell and had to go to [[Switzerland]] to convalesce on 18 July; Attlee announced that he was taking over Cripps\u2019 responsibilities with three young, financially able, ministers to advise him.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p. 119-21\" /> Gaitskell soon emerged as the leader of the group, the others being [[Harold Wilson]], [[President of the Board of Trade]], and Douglas Jay, [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]]. All three had been wartime civil servants.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" />\n\nThe young ministers were now in favour of devaluation of the [[Pound Sterling]], currently at $4.03. Jay lunched with Gaitskell on 20 July 1949, and they agreed that this would help to reverse the drain of capital out of the UK, that the USA was unlikely to help with further [[Anglo-American loan|loans]] or [[Marshall Plan|gifts]] of dollars, that Commonwealth countries needed to be encouraged to buy British goods rather than goods priced in dollars, that there was potential to increase exports to dollar areas, and that if nothing was done there was a risk of reserves running low and a collapse in sterling putting the UK at the mercy of the USA. On 21 July Gaitskell, Jay and Wilson met the Prime Minister to tell him that devaluation was inevitable as reserves were still dropping. On 29 July, the Cabinet agreed in principle to devalue, having also been given the same advice in another memo from senior civil servants, [[Edward Bridges, 1st Baron Bridges|Sir Edward Bridges]] ([[Permanent Secretary to the Treasury]]) and the two Treasury Second Secretaries ([[Robert Hall, Baron Roberthall|Robert Hall]] and [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Sir Edwin Plowden]]).<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p. 119-21\" />\n\nCripps returned to London on 18 August to be greeted by two memoranda from Gaitskell. One was a short paper advising a general election that autumn after devaluation. Cripps did indeed make that recommendation to Attlee, but it was rejected. The second paper was ten pages on devaluation, which in [[Edmund Dell]]\u2019s view it is unlikely he actually read. Gaitskell argued that with employment high, the balance of payments in decent shape and inflation a containable problem, the ''only'' problem was shortage of dollars, with US opinion very reluctant to help the UK any more. He recommended spending cuts to keep inflation under control \u2013 but did not say how much. He also recommended that sterling initially float within a band of $2.80-$2.60, a proposal discussed with Hall and Plowden. He recommended devaluation by 4 September, but rejected the idea that currencies become fully convertible \u2013 in the way that [[John Maynard Keynes]] had advocated at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] \u2013 as this might prevent governments protecting full employment. Dell argues that Gaitskell\u2019s memo was full of the impatience of a young man at his elders clinging to office, but that on the other hand he himself had been slow to recognise the need for devaluation.<ref>Dell 1997, p. 122-4</ref> Gaitskell and Wilson met with Attlee, [[Ernest Bevin]] and Cripps at [[Chequers]] on 19 August, and Bevin and Cripps agreed with some reluctance to devaluation. The decision was finally confirmed by the Cabinet on 9 August, although Cripps rejected Gaitskell\u2019s plan for a floating band.<ref>Dell 1997, p. 124-5</ref> Devaluation (from $4.03 to $2.80) was announced on Sunday 18 September after a secret Cabinet meeting the day before. Many other countries followed suit, so it was mainly UK trade with dollar-using countries which was affected.<ref>Dell 1997, p.126</ref>\n\nGaitskell had initially been suspicious of devaluation because it was a price mechanism, but earned the admiration of Robert Hall over this crisis.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.138\">Dell 1997, p.138</ref> He accepted the need for spending cuts to help make devaluation work and keep to keep the Americans happy, and thought former chancellor Dalton \"rather dishonest\" for arguing at the Economic Policy Committee that cuts were not necessary. Cripps, who had implied in his devaluation broadcast that devaluation was an ''alternative'' to cuts, threatened to resign unless cuts of \u00a3300m were agreed; [[Aneurin Bevan]] (Minister of Health) in turn threatened to resign as did [[A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough|A.V. Alexander]] ([[Secretary of State for Defence|Minister of Defence]]). In the event most of the cuts were to future spending plans except for Bevan's housing budget.<ref>Dell 1997, p. 127-8</ref>\n\n=== Minister for Economic Affairs ===\nIn January 1950 Gaitskell submitted a paper called \"Control and Liberalisation\" to the Economic Policy Committee, which he was sometimes invited to attend. He wrote that \"On 'liberalisation' we have gone about far enough. But we have done it for political reasons \u2013 US and Europe\". He was opposed to the convertibility of currencies and non-discrimination between trading partners, both policies which the USA favoured. Britain still preferred to encourage trade in pounds sterling within the Commonwealth, and Gaitskell wanted to preserve Britain's ability to avoid downturns like the US downturn of 1948\u20139, which Britain had largely escaped because of devaluation.<ref>Dell 1997, p.140</ref>\n\nIn the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|February 1950 General Election]] the Government were re-elected with a tiny majority. In the ensuing reshuffle Gaitskell was appointed [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs|Minister for Economic Affairs]], effectively Deputy Chancellor but still outside the Cabinet.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> He was made a full member of the Economic Policy Committee.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.136\">Dell 1997, p.136</ref> Soon after his promotion he recorded that he often had to stiffen up Cripps, who was not as tough as his public image would suggest, to make sure he did not make too many concessions in negotiations with colleagues.<ref>Dell 1997, p.101</ref>\n\nThe level of spending on the new [[National Health Service|NHS]] was already running far in excess of predictions.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.143\">Dell 1997, p.143</ref> In November 1949, with the high level of public spending already a problem and under pressure from Cripps, Bevan had pushed an act through Parliament granting the government the power to impose prescription charges, although they were not brought in just yet (Cripps had wanted 1 shilling per prescription, but Bevan had not agreed to this). In the 1949\u201350 financial year Cripps had allowed \u00a390m of extra health service spending (\"supplementaries\"). Early in 1950 Cripps backed off from a plan to introduce further charges, this time on false teeth and spectacles, after Bevan threatened to resign, but Gaitskell was put on a committee to monitor Bevan's agreement to a ceiling on NHS spending. The Treasury wanted health spending capped at \u00a3350m per annum, although it was willing to accept \u00a3392m for 1950\u20131.<ref>Dell 1997, p.133, 147</ref>\n\nThere was already friction between Gaitskell and Bevan. At one meeting, probably 28 June 1950, Bevan had been about to walk out of the room until Attlee called him back. Bevan stopped attending Cripps\u2019 Thursday night dinners for economics ministers.<ref>Dell 1997, p.137</ref> After one of those dinners Bevan's old ally [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]], now Minister of Food, rebuked him for attacking Gaitskell, whom he thought \"one of the really considerable men of the Government\", a suggestion to which Bevan responded with derision, calling him \"nothing, nothing, nothing\".<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p204\">Campbell 2010, p204</ref>\n\n=== Rearmament and European Payments Union ===\nBy the second half of 1950 the western powers were caught up in a major rearmament drive. The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 at first threatened US loss of South Korea (which was seen as vital for the defence of Japan), and by the autumn threatened to escalate into a general war between the US and Communist China. There were also very real worries that the Soviets might invade western Europe (which was unarmed, with strong communist influence in many countries) and that the USA would not help Britain if she did not help herself. The crushing of democracy in Czechoslovakia had been as recent as 1948. In August 1950 the British defence budget was hiked from \u00a32.3bn to \u00a33.6bn (a total over a three-year period); at this stage it had appeared that the USA would be willing to help foot the bill.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.143-4\">Dell 1997, p.143-4</ref>\n\nIn September 1950 inflationary pressure was worsened when the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] voted to end the existing two-year wage freeze, although there was no wage explosion just yet. It was difficult for the Treasury to take tough measures given the government's small majority and the likelihood of another election soon.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.143\" />\n\nGaitskell thought balance of payments problems should be solved not by realignments of currencies but by asking surplus countries like the US and [[Belgium]] to inflate their economies (so they would import more). He was attacked for this by the US Treasury Secretary and [[Camille Gutt]] (former Belgian finance minister and now Managing Director of the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]). Dell argues that Gaitskell did not realise that other countries had their own domestic problems.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.141\">Dell 1997, p.141</ref> In September 1950, with Britain's balance of payments now in surplus, Gaitskell negotiated British membership of the [[European Payments Union]], meaning that instead of bilateral clearing, European currencies were to be convertible against one another even if not against the US dollar. Previously dollars had been needed for trade within Europe. Until then Gaitskell had shared concerns that some countries might stay in permanent deficit and thus effectively use their neighbours for free borrowing, or conversely that Belgium's surplus would enable her to suck gold and dollars from Britain. The EPU lasted until sterling was made convertible in 1958.<ref>Dell 1997, p.132, p.142</ref><ref>The USA had been pushing for such a measure as a precursor to European federalism. Cripps thought it would be a threat to the [[sterling area]] and claimed in February 1950 that it would prevent Britain from preserving full employment by restricting imports (the latter charge might have been true of a customs union but was untrue of a payments union). Cobbold (Governor of the Bank of England) was suspicious of EPU, and saw it as a return to the Gold Standard of the 1920s or of the pre-1914 era.[Dell 1997, p.132, 142]</ref>\n\nAlthough Gaitskell had until recently thought Bevan an inevitable future leader for the Labour Party, by the 1950 Party Conference (2 October) the ''\"[[Daily Telegraph]]\"'' political correspondent guessed correctly that he and Gaitskell were already fighting a proxy battle for the future leadership.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p204\" />\n\n=== Promotion to the Chancellorship ===\nCripps, whose health was still failing, had notified Attlee of his intention to resign as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 26 April 1950. He attempted to resign in the summer but was dissuaded by Gaitskell and Plowden because of the outbreak of the Korean War. He instead went on a long holiday, leaving Gaitskell in charge.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.133\">Dell 1997, p.133</ref>\n\nIt was now becoming clear that the US Congress was reluctant to help Britain meet the cost of rearmament. Gaitskell visited Washington in October 1950, his first visit there, just before becoming Chancellor. He warned that the [[terms of trade]] were shifting against Britain, and of the costs of rearmament.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.144\">Dell 1997, p.144</ref>\n\nIn October 1950 Cripps finally resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Dalton proposed Gaitskell for the vacancy. Sir Edward Bridges wanted [[Herbert Morrison]], a political heavyweight; Morrison had been an early advocate of devaluation but did not regard himself as qualified.<ref>Dell 1997, p.135-7</ref> Gaitskell was appointed at the young age of 44, especially unusual as most of Attlee's Cabinet were in their sixties or older. He became the Chancellor with the shortest Parliamentary apprenticeship since [[Pitt the Younger]] in 1782.<ref>Campbell 2010, p199</ref> As Chancellor of the Exchequer he retained the same control over economic planning which Cripps had had. Both Cripps and Gaitskell insisted that Gaitskell be listed after Attlee, Bevin and Morrison in the official Cabinet pecking order.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.136\" />\n\nBevan was furious at Gaitskell being promoted over him, even though, as Gaitskell correctly guessed in his diary, he probably did not want the job himself.<ref>Campbell 2010, pp.204-5</ref> Gaitskell recorded that Bevan often asserted that Cripps had promised him the Exchequer.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.567\" />\n\nThe US Chiefs of Staff wanted an even greater increase in the British armaments budget to \u00a36bn over three years, a plan backed by the British Chiefs of Staff and urged on Prime Minister Attlee on his visit to the US in Dec 1950. On his return from Washington Attlee told the House of Commons on 29 January 1951 that the defence budget was to be hiked to \u00a34.7bn over the next three-year period, including a fourfold increase in munitions production. The defence budget was to increase from 8% to 14% of GNP, a proportion exceeded only by the USA amongst NATO members. At the peak 2.5m people, 11% of the workforce, would be engaged in defence work.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.143-4\" />\n\n== Chancellor of the Exchequer, 1950\u201351 ==\n\n=== Economic philosophy ===\nOn his appointment Gaitskell told [[William Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Sanderstead|William Armstrong]], his Principal Private Secretary, that the main job over next few years would be the redistribution of wealth.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.147\">Dell 1997, p.147</ref>\n\nRab Butler and [[Samuel Brittan]], both writing in the early 1970s, commented that Gaitskell was the most technically-qualified chancellor of the 20th century up until that date.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.138\" /> However, Dell comments that he often went into excessive detail, including personally overseeing economic forecasts, and held excessively long meetings. This may have been from a love of micro-management or because, as an advocate of controls and planning, he was suspicious of treasury officials, whom he thought excessively inclined to free market mechanisms.<ref>Dell 1997, p.139</ref>\n\nIn Dec 1950 Gaitskell rejected the advice of [[Cameron Cobbold, 1st Baron Cobbold|Kim Cobbold]] ([[Governor of the Bank of England]]) and Hall that interest rates be raised, calling such a policy \"completely antiquated\".<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.141\" />\n\n=== Cost of rearmament ===\n[[Marshall Aid]], which had totalled $3.1bn over previous three years, ended officially on 1 January 1951, although in practice it ended six weeks earlier. It was held that the balance of payments was now strong enough for it no longer to be necessary.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.144\" /> Harold Wilson ([[President of the Board of Trade]]) and [[George Strauss]] ([[Minister of Supply]]) warned Gaitskell that the burden of rearmament was too much for the shortage of raw materials and manufacturing capacity, but Gaitskell ignored them as they were friends of Bevan. On 27 January 1951 Bevan was reshuffled to the Ministry of Labour with Health, now under [[Hilary Marquand]], downgraded to a non-Cabinet appointment.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.146\">Dell 1997, p.146</ref> Gaitskell welcomed the changes as reducing an obstacle to economies in health spending.<ref>Campbell 2010, p205</ref>\n\nGaitskell still favoured discrimination in favour of sterling trade and was opposed to sterling convertibility, but was now a lot more pro-American since his October 1950 visit to Washington. By February 1951 he was strongly critical of anti-Americanism in cabinet.<ref>Dell 1997, p.145</ref>\n\nBevan's Commons speech on 15 February 1951 defended the extra \u00a34.7bn on armaments, although most of his speech was a warning not to rearm too fast and that communism would be defeated through democratic socialism not through arms. Gaitskell the following day recorded his regret that for all Bevan's brilliance in oratory he should be \"a difficult team worker, and some would say even worse \u2013 a thoroughly unreliable and disloyal colleague.\"<ref>Campbell 2010, p206</ref>\n\n=== Budget ===\nGaitskell made the controversial decision to introduce charges for prescription glasses and dentures on the [[National Health Service]] in his spring 1951 budget.<ref name=\"Howse\">{{cite news|title=Anniversaries of 2013|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9770133/Anniversaries-of-2013.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=28 December 2012|location=London|first=Christopher|last=Howse}}</ref> The Cabinet had agreed in principle in February 1951 to charges on teeth and spectacles.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> For 1951-2 Bevan was demanding \u00a3422m of health spending, whereas Gaitskell was willing to allow \u00a3400m.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.147\" /> Gaitskell wanted to pass on half the cost of false teeth and spectacles, to bring in \u00a313m in 1951-2 and \u00a323m in a full year. Children, the poor and the sick were to be exempt.<ref>Dell 1997, p.148</ref> On 9 March [[Ernest Bevin]] was moved from the Foreign Office, dying a month later. Bevan, who had hoped to succeed him, was passed over for promotion to a major job for the second time in six months. By this point other ministers felt that Bevan was looking for an issue on which to resign, and that it was pointless making too many concessions as he needed to be made to appear to be in the wrong.<ref>Dell 1997, p.146, 148</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[purchase tax]] was increased from 33% to 66% on certain luxury items such as cars, television sets and domestic appliances, while entertainment tax was increased on cinema tickets.<ref name=\"Hugh Gaitskell by Brian Brivati\">Hugh Gaitskell by Brian Brivati</ref> At the same time, however, taxation on profits was raised and pensions increased to compensate retirees for a rise in the cost of living,<ref>Henry Pelling, ''The Labour Governments, 1945\u201351'' (1984).</ref> while the allowances for dependent children payable to widows, the unemployed and the sick, together with marriage and child allowances, were also increased.<ref>Post-Victorian Britain 1902\u20131951 by Lewis Charles Bernard Seaman</ref> In addition, a number of small items were removed from purchase tax,<ref name=\"Hugh Gaitskell by Brian Brivati\" /> while the amount of earnings allowed without affecting the pension was increased from 20 shillings (\u00a31) to 40 shillings (\u00a32) a week.<ref>Denis Nowell Pritt, ''The Labour Government 1945\u201351'' (1963)</ref> Besides taxing the better off and protecting pensions, Gaitskell actually increased NHS spending.<ref>Campbell 2010, p209-10</ref> The budget increased defence spending by \u00a3500m to \u00a31.5bn for 1951\u20132, helped by a surplus inherited from Cripps and optimistic growth forecasts. Plans to introduce capital gains tax were postponed until 1952.<ref>Dell 1997, p.147, 150</ref>\n\nPrime Minister Attlee's initial reaction to the draft budget was that there were not likely to be many votes in it \u2013 Gaitskell replied that he could not expect votes in a rearmament year.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> Ernest Bevin did not like the idea of health charges and tried in vain to negotiate a compromise. [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Minister]] [[George Tomlinson]] suggested a repetition of the previous year's formula, a spending ceiling of \u00a3400m. Gaitskell was prepared to offer a delay in the introduction of charges but rejected the Tomlinson formula, despite Attlee's urgings, as the ceiling could not be achieved without charges. Attlee went into hospital to be treated for a duodenal ulcer on 21 March. From his sickbed he wrote what [[Kenneth O. Morgan|Kenneth O.Morgan]] calls a \"remarkably vacuous letter\" which \"dealt with none of the substantive points at issue\".<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.148-9\">Dell 1997, p.148-9</ref> At a Cabinet meeting on 22 March Gaitskell was dissuaded from his original intention to insist on prescription charges, as these might fall heavily on the genuinely sick.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p207-8\">Campbell 2010, p207-8</ref>\n\n=== Bevan's resignation ===\nGaitskell and Attlee warned of risks that the rearmament programme might not be fully implemented. Gaitskell warned the Economic Policy Committee (3 April 1951) of the shortage of machine tools, and stated that some could be imported from the USA but that this would weaken the balance of payments.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.151\">Dell 1997, p.151</ref>\n\nA very angry Bevan saw the charges as a blow to the principle of a free health service, telling a heckler whilst he was making a speech in [[Bermondsey]] (3 April 1951) that he would resign rather than accept health charges. Gaitskell, besides the obvious need for a new Chancellor to assert his authority, saw this as a deliberate attempt to publicly bounce the Cabinet, telling Dalton that Bevan's \"influence was very much exaggerated\" and that he might split the Labour Party as [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] had the Liberals.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p207-8\" />\n\nIn two long Cabinet meetings on 9 April Bevan found himself supported only by Harold Wilson.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p208-9\">Campbell 2010, p208-9</ref> [[Herbert Morrison]], who was chairing the Cabinet whilst Attlee was being treated in hospital, again proposed a compromise that there be an agreed ceiling on public spending but no NHS charges.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\">Matthew 2004, p.289</ref> Gaitskell was determined that there would not be an open-ended commitment to welfare spending at the expense of economic investment or rearmament, and rejected Morrison's proposal.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> At the second meeting, Gaitskell threatened to resign, but quietly and without a public fuss, if he did not have the backing of the Cabinet; the resignation of the Chancellor on the eve of the budget would have caused a political crisis. Douglas Jay and others attempted in vain to persuade Gaitskell to compromise, but he refused, arguing that two members of the Cabinet should not be allowed to dictate to eighteen, although he agreed not to specify just yet the date at which the charges would come into effect.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p208-9\" /> A final attempt by Attlee to negotiate a compromise from his sickbed (10 April) came to nothing.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.148-9\" /> The affair brought Gaitskell close to physical and emotional collapse.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nGaitskell won the admiration of Treasury officials for his stance: on the morning of the budget Sir Edward Bridges came to tell him of the respect he had earned in the department and that it was \"the best day we have had in the Treasury for ten years\". Gaitskell recorded that Bridges, Plowden, Leslie (Head of Information) and Armstrong were all urging him to stand firm and that he was \"overcome with emotion\" at Armstrong's words.<ref>Dell 1997, p.149</ref>\n\nGaitskell's budget was praised at the time. His predecessor Stafford Cripps wrote to him praising him for not giving in to \"political expediency\", whilst he was supported in public by two younger MPs later to be staunch allies, [[Roy Jenkins]] and [[Anthony Crosland]].<ref>Dell 1997, p.150</ref> After the budget [[Tony Benn]], who was on the right of the Labour Party at that time, recorded the atmosphere at the party meeting (i.e. a meeting of Labour MPs) on 11 April as \"sheer relief\" that it had not been worse; the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) strongly supported the budget. However, Bevan soon rejected Gaitskell's proposed compromise that it be announced that the health charges were not be permanent as \"a bromide\". Bevan's ally [[Michael Foot]] wrote an editorial in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' comparing Gaitskell to [[Philip Snowden]] (the Chancellor whose cuts in 1931 had brought down the [[Second MacDonald ministry|Second Labour Government]], after which he and other leading members of the Cabinet entered into the Tory-dominated [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]]). Bevan resigned on 21 April, as did Harold Wilson and [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]].<ref>Campbell 2010, p210</ref>\n\nGaitskell defended his budget at the party meeting on 24 April. He said it was still too early to tell if the rearmament programme was actually achievable.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.151\" /> Benn commented after the meeting on how Gaitskell's greatness arose from his combination of \"intellectual ability and political forcefulness\". Bevan then made an angry speech which did not impress many of the PLP.<ref>Campbell 2010, p212-3</ref>\n\n=== Analysis ===\nEdmund Dell argues that neither Bevan nor Gaitskell emerge with much credit from the affair. \"Gaitskell was obsessed by Bevan and by the need to establish his authority over him\". Charges on false teeth and spectacles were \"insignificant\" in the context of the greater budget and \"financially were neither here nor there\" ... but Bevan was \"impatient and arrogant and noisy and apparently intent on exhausting the tolerance of his cabinet colleagues\". Gaitskell agreed to limit health charges to three years (subject to Parliament voting to extend them), made concessions on pensions to the Trade Union Group of MPs, and a diary entry suggests he was not happy about dividend constraints \u2013 yet he was not prepared to make significant concessions to Bevan. However, Dell argues that all chancellors have to make sticking points or they would have to give in to everybody. Gaitskell saw himself as defending the country and wanted to prove Labour a \"responsible party of government\", but the public were not yet aware of the looming inflation problem. Gaitskell told [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] in 1960: \"It was a battle between us for power \u2013 he knew it and so did I\".<ref>Dell 1997, p.148, 155-7</ref>\n\nJohn Campbell agrees that Bevan may have been partly right that Gaitskell, abetted by Morrison, was deliberately trying to drive him out of the Cabinet. Gaitskell believed that Labour had to be seen to govern with fiscal responsibility, telling Dalton on 4 May 1951 that he and Bevan were engaged in a battle for the soul of the Labour Party, and that if Bevan won Labour would be out for many years (although, ironically, Gaitskell won but they were out of power for many years anyway). Had Attlee not been sick, he might have been able to patch up a compromise.<ref>Campbell 2010, p213-5</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Brian Brivati]] believes that the importance of the charges was \"irrelevant\" to the huge cost of rearmament, which damaged Britain's recovery in the years which followed by absorbing earnings from exports.<ref>Matthew 2004, p.288-9</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nA \u00a3300m surplus in the British balance of payments in 1950 turned into a \u00a3400m deficit in 1951, the most sudden reversal on record up until that time. This was caused partly by businesses switching to rearmament rather than generating exports. The other reason was a deterioration in the [[terms of trade]]: higher oil prices after the [[Abadan Crisis|Iranian oil crisis]] caused an outflow of dollars, whilst prices of wool, tin and rubber fell so the rest of the sterling area was not earning so many dollars from exports. By the second half of 1951 the overseas sterling area was importing from North America at double the 1950 rate. By 1951 inflation was beginning to increase, the government budget surplus had disappeared, and in another sign of an overheating economy unemployment was down to 1945 levels. By the second half of 1951 Gaitskell was worried about the political effect of the higher cost of living, but the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]'' accused him of using higher prices to choke off consumption and free up resources for rearmament instead of consumer goods production.<ref>Dell 1997, p.152, 154</ref>\n\nGaitskell again rejected Treasury advice to raise interest rates to cool the economy in June, July and August 1951. He argued that higher interest rates would be perceived as generating profits for the banks, which would not sit well with trade unions, and he was only prepared to consider demanding that the banks restrict credit.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.141\" /> Gaitskell (diary 10 August 1951) stated that he and Morrison thought that Attlee had been too weak in dealing with Bevan.<ref>Campbell 2010, p216</ref> By August\u2013September 1951 the Treasury were taken by surprise by a full-on sterling crisis, which they passed on to the incoming Conservative Government. Sterling was trading unofficially at $2.40, below the official rate of $2.80.<ref>Dell 1997, p.158</ref>\n\nGaitskell visited Washington in the autumn of 1951, where he thought [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|US Treasury Secretary]] [[John Wesley Snyder (US Cabinet Secretary)|John W. Snyder]] \"a pretty small-minded, small town, semi-isolationist\". A committee was formed, containing Plowden and [[Averell Harriman]], to investigate the way in which US rearmament was absorbing and pushing up the prices of world raw materials.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.151\" /> Gaitskell was horrified by Attlee's calling an election (19 September 1951) when he and Morrison were in North America. If Attlee had held on for another six or nine months Labour might have won.<ref>Dell 1997, p.157</ref> Labour lost the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|October 1951 General Election]] despite getting more votes than the Conservatives. Whilst the Bevanites blamed defeat on Morrison's policy of \"consolidation\", the right blamed Bevan for causing a split. Nobody imagined Labour would be out of power for more than a few years, and Attlee expected to be Prime Minister again by 1953.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /><ref>Campbell 2010, p217</ref>\n\nWhen the Conservatives returned to power, the new chancellor [[Rab Butler]] would get the balance of payments back into surplus in 1952 by cutting overseas spending, a measure which Dell suggests Gaitskell had not wanted to irritate the Americans by taking. In his memoirs (''Art of the Possible'', p.&nbsp;163) Butler later called him \"a political mouse who, confronted with a gigantic deterioration in the balance of payments, responded by cutting a sliver off the cheese ration\".<ref>Dell 1997, p.154</ref> After the Conservatives cut the armament plans in 1952 Crosland told people that Gaitskell had made him look like \"a complete idiot\" for supporting the budget in public. However, even by the end of 1951 there was less likelihood of the Korean War turning into a general war (the front line had stabilised, with the US administration being clear that they did not wish to escalate hostilities against China), so any government might have pared back defence spending in 1952.<ref>Dell 1997, p.150, 152-3</ref>\n\n== Opposition: the Bevanite split 1951\u201355 ==\n\n=== 1951\u201352 ===\nIn opposition, Gaitskell's house at [[Frognal]] Gardens, [[Hampstead]], became a centre for political intrigue. At first Herbert Morrison still seemed likely to succeed Attlee as leader. This period was characterised by factional infighting between the '[[Bevanism|Bevanite]]' left of the Labour party led by [[Aneurin Bevan]], whose strength lay mainly in the constituency Labour Parties (\"CLP\"s) and the '[[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellite]]' right who had the upper hand in the Parliamentary Party (Labour MPs \u2013 known collectively as the \"PLP\").<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nIn February 1952 Bevan led a rebellion of 56 other Labour MPs to vote against the Conservatives\u2019 defence spending plans (the official Labour position was to abstain). Dalton recorded (11 March) that Gaitskell was, behind the scenes, keen for a showdown with Bevan. At the party meeting Bevan refused to agree to toe the party line, but the issue was defused by a conciliatory motion by the centrist \"Keep Calm\" group, passed against the wishes of the platform.<ref>Campbell 2010, p218-9</ref> Bevan at this time thought that Gaitskell should be reduced to \"a junior clerk\" in the next Labour Government. On 1 August 1952, when Gaitskell had succeeded in putting Churchill (Prime Minister at the time) on the ropes in a House of Commons debate, Bevan intervened to attack Gaitskell, an event greeted with Tory relief and according to [[Richard Crossman|Crossman]] \"icy silence\" on the Labour benches.<ref>Campbell 2010, p219</ref>\n\nDalton (30 September 1952) thought the [[Morecambe]] Party Conference \"the worst \u2026 for bad temper and general hatred, since 1926\" whilst Michael Foot thought it \"rowdy, convulsive, vulgar, splenetic\". A series of left-wing motions were passed. Bevanites took over the constituency section of Labour's National Executive Committee (the \"NEC\"): Bevan, [[Barbara Castle]], [[Tom Driberg]], [[Ian Mikardo]] and Harold Wilson took the top five places with Crossman seventh. Veteran right-wingers such as Herbert Morrison and Hugh Dalton were voted off, with [[Jim Griffiths]] in sixth place the only member of the Old Guard to survive; Shinwell, who as Minister of Defence was seen as responsible for the rearmament programme, had been voted off the previous year.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p219-21\">Campbell 2010, p219-21</ref>\n\nIn a speech at [[Stalybridge]] (5 October 1952) Gaitskell alleged that \"about one-sixth\" of the constituency delegates \"appeared to be Communist or Communist-inspired\" and attacked \"the stream of grossly misleading propaganda with poisonous innuendos and malicious attacks on Attlee, Morrison and the rest of us\" published in ''Tribune''. He claimed that Labour was threatened by \"mob rule\" got up by \"frustrated journalists\" (a number of Bevanites, including [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tom Driberg]], were journalists).<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /><ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p219-21\" /> He received strong backing from the [[Transport and General Workers' Union|TGWU]] whose block vote was of immense importance at the Labour Conference and which was able to exert pressure on its sponsored MPs to toe the party line.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nAttlee then gave a speech at the newly-built [[Royal Festival Hall]] demanding an end to groups within the party. After the PLP voted 188\u201351 to ban such groups Bevan insisted, over the wishes of Foot and Crossman, that the Bevanite group be disbanded. The Shadow Cabinet elections (elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) were topped by Jim Griffiths and [[Chuter Ede]]. Gaitskell was in third place with 179 votes. Bevan, who had just challenged Morrison unsuccessfully for the Deputy Leadership, scraped on in twelfth and last place with 108 votes.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p219-21\" />\n\n=== 1953\u201354 ===\nTony Benn wrote of Gaitskell (24 September 1953) \"he is intellectually arrogant, obstinate and patronising. I respect \u2013 but cannot quite admire \u2013 him\".<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p222\">Campbell 2010, p222</ref>\n\nRelations between Bevan and Gaitskell continued to be acrimonious. On one occasion in 1953, when Gaitskell called for unity at a Shadow Cabinet meeting, Bevan was observed to give him \"a glare of concentrated hatred\" and declared: \"You\u2019re too young in the movement to know what you\u2019re talking about\".<ref>Campbell 2010, p221</ref> Bevan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet in April 1954 over Labour's support for the setting-up of [[SEATO]].<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p222\" />\n\nBevan stood against Gaitskell for [[Treasurer of the Labour Party|Party Treasurer]], knowing he would likely lose but hoping to discredit union bosses [[Arthur Deakin]] and [[Tom Williamson, Baron Williamson|Tom Williamson]] in the eyes of rank-and-file trade union members. In the event even [[Sam Watson (trade unionist)|Sam Watson]], leader of Bevan's own miners' union, supported Gaitskell. Gaitskell won by 4.3 million votes to 2 million. Bevan gave a speech to the ''Tribune'' party at the conference, declaring that the Labour Leader needed to be a \"desiccated calculating machine\". He was widely and probably wrongly thought to be referring to Gaitskell, to whom the label stuck. In fact it may well have been aimed at Attlee who had the previous day warned against \"emotionalism\" whilst privately Bevan thought that Gaitskell was highly emotional and, as he had shown in 1951, \"couldn\u2019t count\".<ref>Campbell 2010, p222-3</ref>\n\n=== 1955 ===\nIn March 1955 Bevan, who had given no hint of disagreement with party policy at the party meeting a few days earlier, now challenged Attlee in a House of Commons debate to demand terms for use of the new [[Thermonuclear weapon|H-Bomb]] in return for Labour's support for the weapon. He and 62 other abstained in the vote, leading to demands from loyalists that the party whip be withdrawn from him as a preliminary to him being formally expelled from the Labour Party by the NEC.<ref>Campbell 2010, p223-4</ref>\n\nWriting a few days later, Gaitskell claimed to have felt that \"sooner or later [Bevan] would have to go, but I was not sure whether this was the right moment\" (19 March). However, Gaitskell told an audience at [[Doncaster]] that Bevan had made \"a direct challenge to the elected Leader of our Party\" and accused him of not being a team player. At a party meeting a few days later (16 March) Bevan accused Gaitskell of having told a direct lie against him and declared that it was \"those hatchet-faced men sitting on the platform\" who were undermining the leadership. After a lukewarm summing up by Attlee the PLP voted by 114\u2013112 to withdraw the whip from Bevan.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p224-5\">Campbell 2010, p224-5</ref>\n\nGaitskell felt he had to follow the lead of the unions and pushed for Bevan's expulsion, telling Crossman (24 March) that Ian Mikardo was running a Bevanite organisation in the constituency parties to make Bevan leader. When Crossman interjected that Bevan \"was only half wanting\" to be leader, had not made any conspiracy against Attlee and was mainly concerned at voicing protests against Morrison and Gaitskell, the latter replied that \"there are extraordinary parallels between Nye and Adolf Hitler. They are demagogues of exactly the same sort \u2026 There are minor differences but what is striking is the resemblance\". Summoned to appear before an NEC sub-committee, Bevan refused to be \"cornered by Gaitskell\". In the event Gaitskell intervened only once at the meeting, asking Bevan to give a pledge that he would not attack the leader \u2013 Bevan refused as it was \"a trap\". Bevan's apology for his rebellion over the H-Bomb was accepted. Gaitskell described the result (2 April) as \"a stalemate \u2026 my own position is no doubt weaker\".<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p224-5\" /> Gaitskell thought the need to move against Bevan \"dirty work\" (April 1955).<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nThe [[1955 United Kingdom general election|May 1955 General Election]] was the first since 1931 in which Labour's vote had not increased. In ''Tribune'' on 21 June 1955 Gaitskell poured scorn on the idea that more left-wing policies (or, as he put it, policies more similar to those of the Communist Party) would have won Labour more votes. Campbell argues that \"history overwhelmingly supports\" Gaitskell's argument that elections are won by appealing to the centre ground rather than to a party's core base, tempting as the latter strategy often is to parties in opposition.<ref>Campbell 2010, p226</ref>\n\nAt the [[Margate]] conference that autumn Gaitskell gave a stirring and well-received speech including an apparently unscripted passage stressing his own socialist credentials and arguing that nationalisation was still a \"vital means\" to achieving that end. Bevan was observed to be watching the speech \"red-faced and furious\" and complaining of Gaitskell's \"sheer demagogy\".<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p226-7\">Campbell 2010, p226-7</ref> In October 1955 Gaitskell was re-elected Party Treasurer by a wider margin over Bevan than the previous year.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nThe apparent congruence between Gaitskell's economic policies and those of his Conservative successor as chancellor [[Rab Butler]], who had retained and extended NHS charges, was sometimes labelled \"Butskellism\" by the press. This view was not shared by Gaitskell himself, and after Butler's emergency \"Pots and Pans\" budget in October 1955, in which he reversed tax cuts made prior to the Conservatives' re-election at the General Election earlier that year, he attacked him strongly for allegedly having misled the electorate.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> Gaitskell won further praise for his attacks on Butler.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p226-7\" />\n\n==Party leader==\nAfter the retirement of Attlee as leader in December 1955, Gaitskell stood for party leader against Bevan and the ageing Herbert Morrison. At that time (and until 1981) the Labour Party leader was elected solely by MPs. In a final effort to stave off an inevitable Gaitskell victory, Bevan proposed that he and Gaitskell both withdraw in Morrison's favour, but Gaitskell rejected the offer.<ref>Campbell 2010, p227</ref> Gaitskell comfortably defeated Bevan (Morrison came a poor third) in the [[1955 Labour Party leadership election|party leadership contest]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> [[Chuter Ede]] described the leadership election as \"the political funeral of two of the greatest publicity mongers I\u2019ve ever known,\" adding that Gaitskell had never actively sought publicity.<ref>Williams 1985, p367</ref>\n\nGaitskell told a friend that \"The leadership came to me so early because Bevan threw it at me by his behaviour\", a view shared by Attlee and Harold Wilson. Gaitskell was very inexperienced for a party leader by the standards of the time. He offered Bevan a public olive branch at the party meeting after the result, promising that he would \"not be outdone in generosity\" if Bevan accepted the vote. Bevan agreed to do so, wishing Gaitskell \"higher office\".<ref>Campbell 2010, p228</ref>\n\nBrivati writes that Gaitskell's 1951\u201355 \"political performance \u2026 has not received the credit it deserves, for energy, for strategy and for sheer nerve\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\n== Leader of the Opposition, 1955\u20131963 ==\n=== Suez ===\nIn 1956 the [[Egypt]]ian ruler Colonel [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalised the [[Suez Canal Company]], beginning the [[Suez Crisis]]. Gaitskell initially told the Prime Minister, Sir [[Anthony Eden]], and the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Harold Macmillan]] at a dinner with King [[Faisal II]] of [[Iraq]] on 26 July 1956, that they would have the support of public opinion for the use of military action against Nasser, but warned Eden that he must act quickly and would have to keep the Americans closely informed.<ref name=\"Barry Turner 2006 pp 231-232\">Barry Turner, ''Suez 1956'' (2006) pp 231-232.</ref><ref>Williams 1985, p419</ref> Gaitskell denounced Nasser's action at 11am on 27 July in the House of Commons debate.<ref>Thorpe 1989, p217-8</ref>\n\nGaitskell's position became more cautious during the summer, and he suggested the dispute with Egypt should be referred to the [[United Nations]]. His first speech on Suez (2 August 1956) attacked Nasser and was welcomed by many Conservatives, and implied that he would support the use of force, but in Brivati's view did not give enough emphasis to his stipulation that it be done through the United Nations.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> He had believed Eden's assurances that he had no intention of using force.<ref>Campbell 2010, p231</ref> In two letters to Eden sent on 3 and 10 August Gaitskell condemned Nasser, but warned that he would not support any action that violated the United Nations charter.<ref name=\"Barry Turner 2006 pp 231-232\" /> In his letter of 10 August, Gaitskell wrote: \"Lest there should be any doubt in your mind about my personal attitude, let me say that I could not regard an armed attack on Egypt by ourselves and the French as justified by anything which Nasser has done so far or as consistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Nor, in my opinion, would such an attack be justified in order to impose a system of international control over the canal \u2013 desirable though this is. If, of course, the whole matter were to be taken to the United Nations and if Egypt were to be condemned by them as aggressors, then, of course, the position would be different. And if further action which amounted to obvious aggression by Egypt were taken by Nasser, then again it would be different. So far what Nasser has done amounts to a threat, a grave threat to us and to others, which certainly cannot be ignored; but it is only a threat, not in my opinion justifying retaliation by war.\"<ref name=\"Barry Turner 2006 pp 231-232\" />\n\nGaitskell passionately condemned the eventual Anglo-French military intervention to secure the Suez Canal, supposedly launched to enforce international law and to separate the Egyptian and [[Israel]]i combatants; the Israeli attack had in fact been launched in collusion with the British and French to supply a pretext for the invasion.<ref name=\"Barry Turner 2006 pp 231-232\" /> On 31 October he publicly called the invasion \"an act of disastrous folly\" which threatened the Atlantic Alliance, the United Nations and Commonwealth solidarity.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> On 4 November 1956 Gaitskell gave a powerful broadcast, attacking the Prime Minister now it was clear Eden had been lying to him in private. Gaitskell was accused by the Conservatives of trying to appeal to the Labour Left, and of betrayal.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /><ref>Turner, ''Suez 1956'', p 232.</ref>\n\nGaitskell's stance on Suez attracted some Liberal support. The pollster Mark Abrams convinced him of the need to broaden Labour's appeal by picking up anti-colonialist votes, but this would be a development of longer-term importance to the Labour Party. At the time Gaitskell was much-criticised in the press, especially for his ill-judged and unsuccessful plea for Tory dissidents to remove Eden from power.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\" /> The Conservatives not only attacked Gaitskell as unpatriotic for failing to support British troops in action, but also tried to exploit perceived differences between Gaitskell and Bevan, who had rejoined the Shadow Cabinet earlier in the year and who had now been promoted to Shadow Foreign Secretary. Crossman noted that this forced Bevan to be loyal to Gaitskell (15 December 1956), making the two men allies of a kind.<ref>Campbell 2010, p231-2</ref>\n\n=== Nationalisation and political philosophy ===\nGaitskell was a consensual leader in 1955\u201359, in contrast to his earlier and later image. Labour was widely expected to win the next General Election and in Campbell's view he arguably did not give a clear enough lead or attack the Conservatives aggressively enough.<ref>Campbell 2010, p228-9</ref>\n\nGaitskell had initially believed nationalisation to be both morally right and economically efficient, and hoped in vain that manager-worker relations would be transformed.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> But in 1956 he published a Fabian pamphlet ''\"Socialism and Nationalisation\"'' (actually written three years earlier), arguing that there was no need for greater public ownership, and that his goals were full employment, industrial democracy and a greater spread of economic power. Gaitskell still supported physical controls and his views were a little to the left of those expressed by [[Anthony Crosland]] in ''\"The Future of Socialism\"'' (1956).<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\">Matthew 2004, p.291</ref>\n\nGaitskell's political philosophy became known as [[Gaitskellism]], and from the late 1950s brought him into increasing conflict with the trade unions over nationalisation.<ref name=quizlet>{{cite web|url=https://quizlet.com/82580255/bevanism-vs-gaitskellites-labour-party-divisions-flash-cards |title='Bevanism' vs 'Gaitskellites' Labour Party Divisions flashcards |publisher=Quizlet |date=1956-07-26 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}</ref> Besides repudiating the unquestioned commitment to public ownership of the means of production, now seen as merely one of numerous useful devices, he emphasised the goals of personal liberty, social welfare and above all social equality. Gaitskellism tended to downplay loyalty to the Labour movement as a central ethical goal, and argued that the new goals could be achieved if the government used appropriate fiscal and social policy measures within the context of a market-oriented mixed economy.<ref name=\"Richard Heffernan 2000 p 301\" /> Gaitskell's cadre of supporters included [[Anthony Crosland]], [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Douglas Jay]], [[Patrick Gordon Walker]] and [[James Callaghan]].<ref>Brian Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951\u20131970'' (2011) ch 8.</ref>\n\n[[Frank Cousins]] became General Secretary of the TGWU in 1956, beginning the process whereby the unions began to shift left. The 1957 Conference endorsed the document ''\"Industry and Society\"'', which called for more flexibility, including state purchase of shares in small private firms. This was loudly condemned by Bevan's wife [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]] and by [[Michael Foot]], editor of ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' but out of Parliament at the time.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\" />\n\n=== 1959 General Election ===\nIn the summer of 1959 Bevan supported Gaitskell on the NEC against Frank Cousins over unilateralism, which Bevan had opposed at the 1957 Conference, and nuclear tests (24 June 1959). Crossman believed Bevan could have overthrown Gaitskell (17 July 1959) and that both Bevan and Gaitskell thought Wilson an unprincipled careerist (13 August 1959).<ref>Campbell 2010, p236</ref> In the summer of 1959 Hugh and Dora Gaitskell, accompanied by Bevan, went to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to copy Macmillan's recent successful trip.<ref>Campbell 2010, p236-7</ref>\n\nAt [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], with a General Election clearly imminent, Gaitskell pledged that Labour's spending plans would not require him to raise income tax, for which he was attacked by the Tories for supposed irresponsibility.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\" />\n\nDuring the 1959 election campaign Crossman thought Gaitskell had become \"a television star\" with Bevan \"a rather faded elder statesman behind him\" (22 September 1959).<ref>Campbell 2010, p237</ref> The Labour Party had been widely expected to win the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]], but did not.<ref>David E. Butler and Richard Rose, ''The British General Election of 1959'' (1960)</ref> The Conservatives increased their majority, a fact partly attributable to the post-war prosperity that Britain was now experiencing.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\" /> Gaitskell was undermined by public doubts about the credibility of proposals to raise pensions and by a highly effective Conservative campaign run by [[Harold Macmillan]] under the slogan \"Life is better with the Conservatives, don't let Labour ruin it.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1959_over.stm | work=BBC News | title=Election Battles 1945\u20131997}}</ref> This election defeat led to questions being asked as to whether Labour could ever win a general election again, but Gaitskell remained as leader.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n=== Clause IV ===\nFollowing the election defeat, bitter internecine disputes resumed. Gaitskell blamed the Left for the defeat and attempted unsuccessfully to amend Labour's [[Clause IV]]\u2014which its adherents believed committed the party to further [[nationalisation]] of industry, while Gaitskell and his followers believed it had become either superfluous or a political liability.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" />\n\nOn the Tuesday after the election Gaitskell lunched \"bibulously\" with Bevan at [[Asheridge]] in the [[Chiltern Hills|Chilterns]] to discuss his plans for party reform. At this time he had no plans to revise Clause IV. He told Crossman (19 October) that Bevan simply wanted to succeed Jim Griffiths as deputy leader and had shown no inclination to resist moderate policies. After initially expressing surprise, Gaitskell accepted Crossman's advice that Bevan be allowed a veto over any change to nationalisation policy.<ref>Campbell 2010, p238</ref>\n\nThe November 1959 Conference, postponed because of the election, was already divided by rumours that Gaitskell was planning action over Clause IV. Ignoring advice from his allies, and partly motivated by detailed polling by Mark Abrams which showed that younger voters regarded Labour as old-fashioned, Gaitskell pushed for reform. Brivati writes that Clause IV was irrelevant in practice but Gaitskell had made \"a frontal assault on \u2026 a Labour equivalent of the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]]\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" />\n\nBevan saw Gaitskell's speech in advance and made no objection to it at the time. Gaitskell did not rule out further nationalisation, but saw it as a means to an end, pouring scorn on the idea that Labour should be committed to nationalising \"the whole of light industry, the whole of agriculture, all the shops, every little pub and garage\". Bevan now claimed he had \"misunderstood or misheard\" what Gaitskell planned and was reported to be \"absolutely livid\" and \"wondering whether to blow the whole thing wide open\". In the end he made a conciliatory speech, mentioning that Barbara Castle (who had attacked Gaitskell's proposal) and Gaitskell had both quoted his own dictum that Socialism was about controlling the \"commanding heights\" of the economy. He argued that according to the principles of [[Euclid]] if two things are equal to a third thing they must both be equal to one another, and so there could not be any real difference between Castle and Gaitskell.<ref>Campbell 2010, p238-9</ref>\n\nBenn wrote (28 November 1959): \"Nye\u2019s speech this afternoon was witty, scintillating, positive, conciliatory \u2013 the model of what a Leader should do. He didn\u2019t knock Hugh out but he gently elbowed him aside\". The cartoonist \"[[Victor Weisz|Vicky]]\" showed Gaitskell pedalling to [[Blackpool]] on a [[Tandem bicycle|tandem]] with Bevan behind him \u2013 then pedalling back again but this time with Bevan in the front saddle (30 November 1959).<ref>Campbell 2010, p239</ref>\n\nThere was much talk that Bevan might now seize the party leadership, but it seems unlikely that he had the stomach for this anymore, not least as he had never wanted to be leader solely for its own sake. Gaitskell could no longer afford to quarrel with his deputy, and he enjoyed a position of great influence as keeper of the party's conscience, similar to, but much more powerful than, the position of [[John Prescott]] relative to [[Tony Blair]] forty years later. Moreover, by the end of 1959 Bevan was seriously unwell; he withdrew from the public eye and died in July 1960.<ref>Campbell 2010, p239-40</ref>\n\nIn March 1960 the NEC agreed a new statement of Labour's aims as an addition to Clause IV rather than a replacement. Throughout the summer of 1960 union conferences, many of whose rule books had their own equivalent to Clause IV, were hostile to the new proposal, and in the end four of the six largest unions opposed Gaitskell's plans. The new proposal was demoted to a \"valuable expression\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" />\n\n=== Unilateral disarmament ===\n[[Unilateral disarmament|Unilateral nuclear disarmament]] was increasingly popular amongst union activists and was also debated in several union conferences in the spring and summer of 1960. The great majority of the PLP supported [[NATO]] and multilateral disarmament.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" />\n\nGaitskell took on Frank Cousins and wanted to show that Labour were a party of government, not just of opposition. At the October 1960 [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] Conference two resolutions in favour of unilateral disarmament \u2013 proposed by the TGWU and the Engineers\u2019 Union \u2013 were carried, whilst the official policy document on defence was rejected. Gaitskell roused his supporters by promising to \"Fight and Fight and Fight Again\" to reverse the decision. Labour doctrine was that the Parliamentary Party had discretion over the timing of implementation of conference policy. In practice, in the 1940s and '50s, the unions, whose block votes dominated conference, had been broadly supportive of the PLP, but this was now beginning to change.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\">Matthew 2004, p.292</ref> Gaitskell was challenged unsuccessfully for the leadership by Harold Wilson [[1960 Labour Party leadership election|in November 1960]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/harold-wilson-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011161640/http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/harold-wilson-2/ |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Blackpool]] Conference of October 1961 saw a narrow conference vote in favour of ''multi''lateral disarmament.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\" /> Winning the unilateralism vote in 1961 restored Gaitskell's authority in the party and his reputation in the country.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p241\">Campbell 2010, p241</ref> Unilateral nuclear disarmament remained a divisive issue, and many on the Left continued to call for a change of leadership.

Although not entirely opposed in principle to British entry, he believed that the EEC was resistant to reform and that membership would hurt Britain's relations with the Commonwealth.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\" /><ref>Williams 1985, pp.702-749</ref><ref>Roy Jenkins, ''A Life at the Center '' (1991) pp 136 \u2013 45.</ref>\n\nIn a speech to the party conference in October 1962, Gaitskell claimed that Britain's participation in a [[Federal Europe]] would mean \"the end of Britain as an independent European state, the end of a thousand years of history!\" He added: \"You may say, all right! Let it end! But, my goodness, it's a decision that needs a little care and thought.\"<ref name=\"Charlton\" />\n\nIn the speech Gaitskell summoned up the memory of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] and [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], where [[Canadian Corps|Canadian]] and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC]] troops had fought alongside British, mixing his defence of national identity with the tradition of the Commonwealth. The speech dismayed many of Gaitskell's natural supporters but was applauded by many on the Left, causing his wife Dora to observe \"all the wrong people are cheering\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\" />\n\n== Death ==\nIn mid-December 1962, Gaitskell fell ill with [[flu]], but he was declared well enough by his doctor to travel to the [[Soviet Union]], where he met the Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] for talks. Upon his return to Britain his condition deteriorated after he contracted another virus. On 4 January he was admitted to [[Middlesex Hospital]] in [[Marylebone]], where, despite enormous efforts by doctors to save his life, he died on 18 January, with his wife at his bedside. He had died from complications following a sudden flare-up of [[systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], an [[autoimmune disease]] which had affected his heart and kidneys. He was 56.<ref>{{cite news|title=1963: Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell dies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/18/newsid_3376000/3376971.stm|website=bbc.co.uk|date=18 January 1963|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Howse\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Hugh Gaitskell|url=http://www.lupus.org.uk/news-events/celebrity/315-hugh-gaitskell|publisher=St. Thomas' Lupus Trust|accessdate=4 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915143607/http://www.lupus.org.uk/news-events/celebrity/315-hugh-gaitskell|archive-date=15 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The shock of his death was comparable to that of the sudden death of the later Labour Party leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], in May 1994, when he too seemed to be on the threshold of [[10 Downing Street]].<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p241\" />\n\nGaitskell's death left an opening for [[Harold Wilson]] in the party leadership; Wilson narrowly won the next [[1964 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for Labour 21 months later. The abrupt and unexpected nature of his death led to some speculation that [[crime|foul play]] might have been involved. The most [[Harold Wilson conspiracy theories|popular conspiracy theory]] involved a supposed Soviet [[KGB]] plot to ensure that Wilson (alleged by the supporters of these theories to be a KGB agent himself) became Prime Minister. This claim was given new life by [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]]'s controversial 1987 book ''[[Spycatcher]]'', but the only evidence that ever came to light was the testimony of a Soviet [[defector]], [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], whose claims about Wilson were repeatedly investigated and never substantiated.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 30 greatest conspiracy theories - part 2, 16 to 30|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3483652/The-30-greatest-conspiracy-theories-part-2.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nGaitskell had inherited \u00a314,000 (around \u00a3800,000 at 2015 prices) from an aunt in April 1938, which was invested for him and multiplied several times (at a time of relatively high inflation) by a friend in the City.

The diary is an important primary source for the politics of the era.<ref>Campbell 2010, p.235</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Gaitskellites and after ===\nGaitskell was adored by followers like [[Roy Jenkins]], who thought him a beacon of hope, decency and integrity, especially as Wilson's government came more and more to seem one of shabby compromises. Left-wingers like [[Barbara Castle]] loathed him for his intransigence. Many, including [[Tony Benn]] \u2013 a Labour centrist at the time \u2013 simply thought him a divisive figure and initially welcomed Wilson as a fresh start who could unite the party. In the event Wilson's closest allies as Prime Minister \u2013 Crossman and Castle \u2013 were former Bevanites.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p241-2\">Campbell 2010, p241-2</ref>\n\nHowever, many of the Gaitskellites held leading positions in Harold Wilson's Cabinet of 1964\u201370. Many of them \u2013 e.g. [[Roy Jenkins]] and [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]] but not Anthony Crosland or [[Douglas Jay]] \u2013 became supporters of British membership of the EEC, an issue on which Labour was split in the 1970s and which helped to precipitate the SDP split of 1981.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.293\" />\n\nJohn Campbell writes that \"the echoes of the Gaitskell-Bevan rivalry continued to divide the party right up to the 1980s\".<ref>Campbell 2010, p196</ref> [[Neil Kinnock]] (Labour Leader 1983\u201392) grew up in [[South Wales]] and was brought up as an admirer of Bevan, but although he disliked the comparison his battle with the hard-left [[Militant Tendency]] in the mid-1980s had echoes of Gaitskellism; John Smith (Labour Leader 1992-4) had been a Gaitskellite as a young man in the early 1960s; Tony Blair's first act as leader in 1994 was finally to abolish Clause IV \u2013 for this and other acts he was supported by the elderly Roy Jenkins, who had become a Liberal Democrat by then. Like Gaitskell before him, Blair was often seen by many of his enemies in the Labour Party as a public-school educated, middle-class interloper.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p241-2\" />\n\n[[Tony Benn]] contrasted Gaitskell's stand on the [[Suez Crisis]] to that of the former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] on [[Iraq War|the war in Iraq]]. [[Margaret Thatcher]] compared Blair with Gaitskell in a different manner, warning her party when Blair came to power that he was the most formidable Labour leader since Hugh Gaitskell.\n\n=== Assessments ===\nGaitskell's socialism was, in Campbell's view, that of a public servant wanting to see the world more rationally governed.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p198\" /> Gaitskell very likely might have become Prime Minister had he lived; however, he left no lasting monument other than \"the fading memory of promise unfulfilled\". Gaitskell, although no Marxist, was a sincere socialist but nonetheless was in some respects the first \"moderniser\" who saw how Labour would have to adapt to survive.<ref>Campbell 2010, p242-3</ref>\n\nHis longtime close friend [[Roy Jenkins]] concluded a decade afterwards, in an article which he later quoted in his memoirs:\n:All his struggles illustrated some blemishes as well as exceptional strength. He would not have been a perfect Prime Minister. He was stubborn, rash, and could in a paradoxical way become too emotionally committed to an over-rational position which, once he had thought it rigorously through, he believed must be the final answer. He was only a moderately good judge of people. But when these faults are put in the scales and weighed against his qualities they shrivel away. He had purpose and direction, courage and humanity. He was a man for raising the sights of politics. He clashed on great issues. He avoided the petty bitterness of personal jealousy. You could raise a banner which men were proud to follow, but he never perverted his leadership ability; it was infused by sense and humour, and by a desire to change the world, not for his own satisfaction, but so that people might more enjoy living in it.... He was that very rare phenomenon, a great politician was also an unusually agreeable man.<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''A Life at the Center '' (1991) pp 141-42</ref>\n\nBecause he never became Prime Minister, and because of the great capacity many considered that he had for the post, Hugh Gaitskell is remembered largely with respect from people both within and outside of the Labour Party. Gaitskell is regarded by some as \"the best Prime Minister we never had\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/public-affairs/press-releases/index.phtml?menu=pressreleasesarchive&code=CAB-175/04&create_date=06-dec-2004|title=Press releases|work=nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrivati acknowledged that he had \"an almost reckless honesty and courage\"<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.293\" /> which could turn into stubbornness.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> \"His leadership was a heroic failure\" and \"The defining moment of the post-war history of the Labour Party\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.293\" /> Although by 1963 Gaitskell appeared to be on the verge of leading Labour back into power, it still took what Brivati describes as \"the greatest performance by a leader of the opposition [last] century\" for Harold Wilson to lead Labour back by a narrow majority.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\" />\n\nBrivati writes that for Gaitskell \"socialism was not an end state \u2026 but the reform of institutions and practices for the more effective realisation of preferred values\". Evan Durbin's ''Politics of Democratic Socialism'' (1940) was a seminal text.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" /> Gaitskell was not, in Brivati's view, a \"progressive\" in any modern sense. He favoured equality and thought the free market wasteful. He wanted to incorporate Liberal opinion within the Labour vote. However, the modernising leaders of subsequent generations, [[Neil Kinnock]] and [[Tony Blair]], were to a certain extent continuing Gaitskell's tradition.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.293\" />\n\n=== Memorials ===\nHis name appears in popular culture from time to time. For example, 'Hugh Gaitskell House' is the building [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]]'s character Garry Sparrow is looking for in ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'' when he first stumbles into [[Second World War]] London. A tower block of that name can be found opposite [[Stoke Newington railway station]] in North London.\n\nHugh Gaitskell Primary School is situated in [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]], part of his former Leeds South constituency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hughgaitskell.leeds.sch.uk|title=Hugh Gaitskell Primary School|work=hughgaitskell.leeds.sch.uk|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=428500&Y=430500&width=700&height=400&gride=428671&gridn=430688&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=LS118AB&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=10000&out.x=3&out.y=11|title=Maps|publisher=}}</ref> The area is now in the Leeds Central constituency, represented by [[Hilary Benn]].\n\nIn 1978, some 15 years after his death, a new housing development by [[Sandwell]] council in the [[Tividale]] area of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] was named Gaitskell Terrace.\n\nGaitskell was buried in Hampstead, and a memorial plaque to his name is prominently placed in the cloisters of [[New College, Oxford]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23470 |title = Hugh Todd Naylor Gaitskell (1906-1963) - Find a}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!--See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Brivati, Brian. \"Gaitskell, Hugh Todd Naylor (1906\u20131963)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33309, accessed 26 June 2016] doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/33309 (print edition listed under \"Matthew\" below)\n* Brivati, Brian.

Facing the need to increase military spending in 1951, he imposed [[National Health Service]] charges on dentures and spectacles, prompting the leading [[left-wing politics|left-winger]] [[Aneurin Bevan]] to resign from the Cabinet.\n\nThe perceived similarity in his outlook to that of his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] counterpart [[Rab Butler]] was dubbed \"[[Butskellism]]\", initially a satirical term, after an elision of their names, and was one aspect of the [[post-war consensus]] through which the major parties largely agreed on the main points of domestic and foreign policy until the 1970s.<ref name=\"Richard Heffernan 2000 p 301\">Brian Brivati and Richard Heffernan, eds. ''The Labour Party: a centenary history'' (Macmillan, 2000) p 301.</ref><ref>Neil Rollings, \"\u2018Poor Mr Butskell: A Short Life, Wrecked by Schizophrenia\u2019?.\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' 5#2 (1994): 183-205.</ref> With Labour in opposition from [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]], Gaitskell won bitter leadership battles with Bevan and his supporters to become the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] in 1955. In 1956 he opposed the Eden government's use of military force at [[Suez Crisis|Suez]]. Against a backdrop of a booming economy he led Labour to its third successive defeat at the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]].\n\nIn the late 1950s, in the teeth of opposition from the major [[trade unions]], he attempted in vain to remove [[Clause IV]] of the [[Labour Party Constitution]], which committed Labour to [[nationalisation]] of all the means of production. He did not reject public ownership altogether, but also emphasised the ethical goals of liberty, social welfare and above all equality, and argued that they could be achieved by fiscal and social policies within a [[mixed economy]]. His revisionist views, on the [[right-wing politics|right wing]] of the Labour Party, were sometimes called [[Gaitskellism]].\n\nDespite this setback, Gaitskell reversed an attempt to adopt [[unilateral nuclear disarmament]] as Labour Party policy, and opposed [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Harold Macmillan]]'s attempt to lead the UK into the [[European Union|European Common Market]]. He was loved and hated for his confrontational leadership and brutal frankness. He died suddenly in 1963, when he appeared to be on the verge of leading Labour back into power and becoming the next Prime Minister.\n\n== Early life ==\nHugh Gaitskell was born in [[Kensington]], [[London]], the third and youngest child of Arthur Gaitskell (1869\u20131915), of the [[Indian Civil Service]], and Adelaide Mary, ''n\u00e9e'' Jamieson (died 1956), whose father, George Jamieson, was [[consul-general]] in [[Shanghai]] and prior to that had been Judge of the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\">Matthew 2004, p.287</ref> He was known as \"Sam\" as a child.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> The Gaitskells had a long family connection with the Indian Army, and he spent his childhood in [[Burma]]. After his father's death, his mother soon remarried and returned to Burma, leaving him at [[boarding school]].<ref>Campbell 2010, p197</ref>\n\nGaitskell was educated at the [[Dragon School]] from 1912-1919, where he was a friend of the future poet [[John Betjeman]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\">Matthew 2004, p.290</ref> He then attended [[Winchester College]] from 1919 to 1924.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" />\n\nHe attended [[New College, Oxford]], from 1924-1927. Studying under [[G. D. H. Cole]], Gaitskell became a [[socialist]] and wrote a long essay on [[Chartism]], arguing that the [[working class]] needed [[middle class]] leadership. Gaitskell's first political involvement came about as a result of the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike of 1926]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Most students supported the government and many volunteered for civil defence duties, or helped to run essential services. Gaitskell, unusually, supported the strikers and acted as a driver for people like his Oxford contemporary [[Evan Durbin]] and Cole's wife [[Margaret Cole|Margaret]], who made speeches and delivered the trade union newspaper ''[[British Worker]]''. After the collapse of the General Strike, Gaitskell spent another six months raising funds for the miners, whose dispute (technically a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]] rather than a strike) did not end until November.<ref>Williams 1985, p18-19</ref> He graduated with a [[first-class degree]] in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] in 1927.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" />\n\n== Academic and early political career ==\nIn 1927\u201328 Gaitskell lectured in economics for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] to miners in [[Nottinghamshire]]. His essay on Chartism was published as a WEA booklet in 1928.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> This was his first experience of interaction with the working class.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p198\">Campbell 2010, p198</ref> Gaitskell eventually came to oppose both Cole's [[Guild Socialism]] and [[Syndicalism]] and to feel that the General Strike had been the last failed spasm of a strategy - attempting to seize power through direct trade union action - which had already been tried in the abortive [[Black Friday (1921)|Triple Alliance Strike of 1921]]. It is unclear whether Gaitskell was ever sympathetic to [[Oswald Mosley]], then seen as a future leader of the Labour Party. Gaitskell's wife later insisted that he never had been, but Margaret Cole, Evan Durbin's wife and [[Noel Frederick Hall|Noel Hall]] believed that he was, although as an opponent of factional splits he was not tempted to join Mosley's [[New Party (UK)|New Party]] in 1931.<ref>Williams 1985, p43</ref>\n\nGaitskell helped to run the New [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] Research Bureau, set up by G. D. H. Cole in March 1931.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> He was selected as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate for [[Chatham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chatham]] in autumn 1932.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Gaitskell moved to [[University College London]] in the early 1930s at the invitation of Noel Hall.<ref name=\"Saville_1980\">{{cite journal | author = [[John Saville]] | publisher = [[Socialist Register]] | work = The Socialist Register 1980 | title = Hugh Gaitskell (1906\u20131963): An assessment | date = 18 March 1980 | volume = 17 | issue = 17 | pages = 155\u2013158 | url = http://socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5450/2349 | accessdate = 8 October 2010}}</ref> In 1934 he joined the XYZ Club, a club for Labour financial experts (e.g. [[Hugh Dalton]], of whom he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Douglas Jay]] and [[Evan Durbin]]) and City people such as the economist Nicholas Davenport.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Dalton and Gaitskell were often referred to as \"Big Hugh and Little Hugh\" over the next fifteen years.<ref>Williams 1985, p70</ref>\n\nIn 1934 Gaitskell was in [[Vienna]] on a Rockefeller scholarship.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> He was attached to the [[University of Vienna]] for the 1933\u201334 academic year and witnessed first-hand the political suppression of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|social democratic]] workers movement by the [[Fatherland's Front|conservative]] [[Engelbert Dollfuss]]'s government in February 1934.<ref name=\"Saville_1980\" /> This event made a lasting impression, making him profoundly hostile to conservatism but also making him reject as futile the Marxian outlook of many European social democrats. This placed him in the socialist [[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]] camp.\n\nAt the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], he stood unsuccessfully as the Labour Party candidate for [[Chatham (UK Parliament constituency)|Chatham]]. Gaitskell helped to draft \"Labour\u2019s Immediate Programme\" in 1937. This had a strong emphasis on planning, although not as much as his mentor Dalton would have liked, with no plans for the nationalisation of banks or the steel industry. He also drafted documents which would have been used in the election due in 1939\u201340.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Dalton helped him to be selected as candidate for South Leeds in 1937, and had it not been for the war, he would very likely have become an MP by 1940.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p198\" />\n\nGaitskell became head of the Department of Political Economy at UCL when Hall was appointed Director of the [[National Institute of Economic and Social Research]] in 1938,<ref>Brian  Brivati, \"Gaitskell, Hugh Todd Naylor (1906\u20131963)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> jointly with [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]].<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.567\">Dell 1997, p.567</ref> He also became a University Reader.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> He opposed the [[appeasement]] of [[Nazi Germany]]<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> and supported rearmament.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p198\" />\n\n== Marriage and personal life ==\nWhilst a WEA lecturer in the late 1920s Gaitskell lived for a time with a local woman in Nottinghamshire. This is thought to have been his first adult relationship.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.287\" /> Until the early 1930s he rejected marriage as a \"bourgeois convention\".<ref>Williams 1985, p24</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1930s Gaitskell had formed a close relationship with a married woman, [[Anna Dora Gaitskell|Mrs. Dora Frost]] (n\u00e9e Creditor), who came out to join him in Vienna for the latter part of his stay there. Adultery still carried such stigma that she thought it best not to help him during his Parliamentary campaign in Chatham in 1935. After her divorce, hard to obtain prior to the passage of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]], they were eventually married on 9 April 1937, Gaitskell's thirty-first birthday, with Evan Durbin as best man.<ref>Williams 1985, p79</ref> Dora had a son, Raymond Frost (b 1925), from her first marriage.<ref>Williams 1985, p37</ref> The Gaitskells had two daughters: Julia, born in 1939 and Cressida, born in 1942. Dora Gaitskell became a Labour [[life peer]] one year after his death, and died in 1989.<ref name=\"ODNB\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39851 William Rodgers: ''Gaitskell, (Anna) Dora, Baroness Gaitskell (1901\u20131989)'' rev.

This contrasted with his stern public image. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the [[Bilderberg Group]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html |title=Former Steering Committee Members |work=bilderbergmeetings.org |publisher=[[Bilderberg Group]] |accessdate=8 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095633/http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/former-steering-committee-members.html |archivedate=2 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Wartime civil servant and election to Parliament ==\nDuring the [[Second World War]], from the formation of Churchill's coalition government in May 1940 Gaitskell worked with Noel Hall and [[Hugh Dalton]] as a senior civil servant for the [[Minister of Economic Warfare|Ministry of Economic Warfare]], giving him experience of government.<ref name=\"Saville_1980\" /> As Dalton's Private Secretary Gaitskell was more of a ''[[Chef de Cabinet]]'' and trusted adviser. Observers watched Gaitskell blossom and enjoy exercising power. Dalton liked to shout at his subordinates; Gaitskell sometimes shouted back.<ref>Williams 1985, pp98-9</ref> Along with Dalton Gaitskell was moved to the [[Board of Trade]] in February 1942, where for the first time he came into contact with the leaders of the miners\u2019 unions, who were later to support him in his struggles against [[Aneurin Bevan]] in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\">Matthew 2004, p.288</ref> For his service, he was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1945.\n\nIn March 1945 Gaitskell suffered a [[coronary thrombosis]] brought on by overwork. Advised to rest, he considered withdrawing from his parliamentary candidacy in [[Leeds]], but he was popular with his constituency workers and they offered to campaign for him even if he was unable to do so.<ref>Williams 1985, p124-5</ref> He was also approached to return to UCL as a Professor after the war, but he disliked the constant state of flux of academic economics and the increasing emphasis on mathematics, a subject of which he had little knowledge. By now he found himself more drawn to public life.<ref>Williams 1985, p81</ref>\n\nGaitskell was elected Labour [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Leeds South (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds South]] in the Labour landslide victory of [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> Despite his illness, as a protege of Dalton he was seriously considered for immediate appointment as a junior minister, Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the [[Board of Trade]] (under [[Stafford Cripps]]).<ref>Williams 1985, p130</ref> This would have been a rare honour as 263 of the 393 Labour MPs in 1945 were newly elected, but did not take place.<ref>Dell 1997, p.15 Harold Wilson, another newly-elected economics don and wartime civil servant, was appointed a junior minister immediately</ref>\n\nAs a backbencher, he spoke in debates in support of Dalton's [[Bank of England Act 1946|nationalisation]] of the [[Bank of England]], which eventually received Royal Assent on 14 February 1946. Dalton was trying to score party points by claiming that he was reasserting political control over the [[City of London]], a far-fetched claim as the Bank was already under political control. Although some Conservative MPs spoke against the measure it was not opposed by Churchill, then Leader of the Opposition, who had had an ambivalent view of the Bank since his own time as chancellor in the 1920s.<ref>Dell 1997, p.77</ref>\n\n== Ministry of Fuel and Power ==\nGaitskell was given his first ministerial appointment in May 1946 as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Fuel and Power, serving under [[Manny Shinwell|Emmanuel \"Manny\" Shinwell]]. The job had initially been earmarked for [[Harold Wilson]], with Gaitskell pencilled in to succeed Wilson as Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. Gaitskell believed that Shinwell, who was suspicious of middle class intellectual socialists, may have picked him in preference to Wilson because the latter was already an expert on the mining industry.<ref>Williams 1985, p132</ref>\n\nGaitskell played an important role steering the [[Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946|Coal Nationalisation Bill]] through the House of Commons, bearing the brunt of the committee stage and winding up the final debate. In the [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom|fuel crisis of February 1947]] Shinwell, who had ignored Gaitskell's warnings, had to ask the Cabinet for permission to shut down power stations; Gaitskell was put on and ran the key committee which decided where coal should be sent. In 1947 he once again played an important role steering [[Electricity Act 1947|electricity nationalisation]] through the House of Commons, winding up the debate on the [[second reading]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" />\n\nOn 7 October 1947 Gaitskell was promoted to [[Ministry of Fuel and Power|Minister of Fuel and Power]] in Shinwell's place. He was not made a member of the Cabinet,<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> although he often attended Cabinet meetings when his input was required.<ref>Dell 1997, p.135</ref> He had committed a gaffe during the municipal election campaign in Hastings earlier that year, when he recommended that people save fuel by taking fewer baths, adding that he had never taken all that many himself; in the House of Commons in late October Churchill joked that it was no wonder that the Government were \"in bad odour\" and asked the Speaker if he might be permitted to describe Labour ministers as \"lousey\", normally an unparliamentary expression, as it would be a simple statement of fact.<ref>Williams 1985, p151</ref> Gaitskell made himself very unpopular by abolishing the basic petrol ration for private motorists, but encouraged the building of oil refineries, a move little-noticed at the time which would have important repercussions for the future.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" />\n\n== Treasury matters ==\n\n=== Devaluation ===\nIn early July 1949 Gaitskell shared [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Stafford Cripps]]' worries that Treasury officials were too \"liberal\" and too reluctant to implement socialist measures.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p. 119-21\">Dell 1997, p. 119-21</ref> Like Cripps and Dalton, Gaitskell was a devotee of cheap money. Not only were higher interest rates seen as associated with the [[Gold standard]] and the deflationary policies of the 1920s, but the policy preference in the 1940s was for quantitative controls (e.g. [[exchange controls]] in finance, or rationing of physical goods) rather than the price mechanism. Interest rates, which had been cut to low levels in the 1930s, did not begin to be used as an instrument of policy again until after the Conservatives returned to power in 1952.<ref>Dell 1997, p. 111</ref>\n\nCripps was seriously unwell and had to go to [[Switzerland]] to convalesce on 18 July; Attlee announced that he was taking over Cripps\u2019 responsibilities with three young, financially able, ministers to advise him.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p. 119-21\" /> Gaitskell soon emerged as the leader of the group, the others being [[Harold Wilson]], [[President of the Board of Trade]], and Douglas Jay, [[Economic Secretary to the Treasury]]. All three had been wartime civil servants.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" />\n\nThe young ministers were now in favour of devaluation of the [[Pound Sterling]], currently at $4.03. Jay lunched with Gaitskell on 20 July 1949, and they agreed that this would help to reverse the drain of capital out of the UK, that the USA was unlikely to help with further [[Anglo-American loan|loans]] or [[Marshall Plan|gifts]] of dollars, that Commonwealth countries needed to be encouraged to buy British goods rather than goods priced in dollars, that there was potential to increase exports to dollar areas, and that if nothing was done there was a risk of reserves running low and a collapse in sterling putting the UK at the mercy of the USA. On 21 July Gaitskell, Jay and Wilson met the Prime Minister to tell him that devaluation was inevitable as reserves were still dropping. On 29 July, the Cabinet agreed in principle to devalue, having also been given the same advice in another memo from senior civil servants, [[Edward Bridges, 1st Baron Bridges|Sir Edward Bridges]] ([[Permanent Secretary to the Treasury]]) and the two Treasury Second Secretaries ([[Robert Hall, Baron Roberthall|Robert Hall]] and [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Sir Edwin Plowden]]).<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p. 119-21\" />\n\nCripps returned to London on 18 August to be greeted by two memoranda from Gaitskell. One was a short paper advising a general election that autumn after devaluation. Cripps did indeed make that recommendation to Attlee, but it was rejected. The second paper was ten pages on devaluation, which in [[Edmund Dell]]\u2019s view it is unlikely he actually read. Gaitskell argued that with employment high, the balance of payments in decent shape and inflation a containable problem, the ''only'' problem was shortage of dollars, with US opinion very reluctant to help the UK any more. He recommended spending cuts to keep inflation under control \u2013 but did not say how much. He also recommended that sterling initially float within a band of $2.80-$2.60, a proposal discussed with Hall and Plowden. He recommended devaluation by 4 September, but rejected the idea that currencies become fully convertible \u2013 in the way that [[John Maynard Keynes]] had advocated at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] \u2013 as this might prevent governments protecting full employment. Dell argues that Gaitskell\u2019s memo was full of the impatience of a young man at his elders clinging to office, but that on the other hand he himself had been slow to recognise the need for devaluation.<ref>Dell 1997, p. 122-4</ref> Gaitskell and Wilson met with Attlee, [[Ernest Bevin]] and Cripps at [[Chequers]] on 19 August, and Bevin and Cripps agreed with some reluctance to devaluation. The decision was finally confirmed by the Cabinet on 9 August, although Cripps rejected Gaitskell\u2019s plan for a floating band.<ref>Dell 1997, p. 124-5</ref> Devaluation (from $4.03 to $2.80) was announced on Sunday 18 September after a secret Cabinet meeting the day before. Many other countries followed suit, so it was mainly UK trade with dollar-using countries which was affected.<ref>Dell 1997, p.126</ref>\n\nGaitskell had initially been suspicious of devaluation because it was a price mechanism, but earned the admiration of Robert Hall over this crisis.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.138\">Dell 1997, p.138</ref> He accepted the need for spending cuts to help make devaluation work and keep to keep the Americans happy, and thought former chancellor Dalton \"rather dishonest\" for arguing at the Economic Policy Committee that cuts were not necessary. Cripps, who had implied in his devaluation broadcast that devaluation was an ''alternative'' to cuts, threatened to resign unless cuts of \u00a3300m were agreed; [[Aneurin Bevan]] (Minister of Health) in turn threatened to resign as did [[A. V. Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Hillsborough|A.V. Alexander]] ([[Secretary of State for Defence|Minister of Defence]]). In the event most of the cuts were to future spending plans except for Bevan's housing budget.<ref>Dell 1997, p. 127-8</ref>\n\n=== Minister for Economic Affairs ===\nIn January 1950 Gaitskell submitted a paper called \"Control and Liberalisation\" to the Economic Policy Committee, which he was sometimes invited to attend. He wrote that \"On 'liberalisation' we have gone about far enough. But we have done it for political reasons \u2013 US and Europe\". He was opposed to the convertibility of currencies and non-discrimination between trading partners, both policies which the USA favoured. Britain still preferred to encourage trade in pounds sterling within the Commonwealth, and Gaitskell wanted to preserve Britain's ability to avoid downturns like the US downturn of 1948-9, which Britain had largely escaped because of devaluation.<ref>Dell 1997, p.140</ref>\n\nIn the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|February 1950 General Election]] the Government were re-elected with a tiny majority. In the ensuing reshuffle Gaitskell was appointed [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs|Minister for Economic Affairs]], effectively Deputy Chancellor but still outside the Cabinet.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> He was made a full member of the Economic Policy Committee.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.136\">Dell 1997, p.136</ref> Soon after his promotion he recorded that he often had to stiffen up Cripps, who was not as tough as his public image would suggest, to make sure he did not make too many concessions in negotiations with colleagues.<ref>Dell 1997, p.101</ref>\n\nThe level of spending on the new [[National Health Service|NHS]] was already running far in excess of predictions.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.143\">Dell 1997, p.143</ref> In November 1949, with the high level of public spending already a problem and under pressure from Cripps, Bevan had pushed an act through Parliament granting the government the power to impose prescription charges, although they were not brought in just yet (Cripps had wanted 1 shilling per prescription, but Bevan had not agreed to this). In the 1949\u201350 financial year Cripps had allowed \u00a390m of extra health service spending (\"supplementaries\"). Early in 1950 Cripps backed off from a plan to introduce further charges, this time on false teeth and spectacles, after Bevan threatened to resign, but Gaitskell was put on a committee to monitor Bevan's agreement to a ceiling on NHS spending. The Treasury wanted health spending capped at \u00a3350m per annum, although it was willing to accept \u00a3392m for 1950-1.<ref>Dell 1997, p.133, 147</ref>\n\nThere was already friction between Gaitskell and Bevan. At one meeting, probably 28 June 1950, Bevan had been about to walk out of the room until Attlee called him back. Bevan stopped attending Cripps\u2019 Thursday night dinners for economics ministers.<ref>Dell 1997, p.137</ref> After one of those dinners Bevan's old ally [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]], now Minister of Food, rebuked him for attacking Gaitskell, whom he thought \"one of the really considerable men of the Government\", a suggestion to which Bevan responded with derision, calling him \"nothing, nothing, nothing\".<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p204\">Campbell 2010, p204</ref>\n\n=== Rearmament and European Payments Union ===\nBy the second half of 1950 the western powers were caught up in a major rearmament drive. The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 at first threatened US loss of South Korea (which was seen as vital for the defence of Japan), and by the autumn threatened to escalate into a general war between the US and Communist China. There were also very real worries that the Soviets might invade western Europe (which was unarmed, with strong communist influence in many countries) and that the USA would not help Britain if she did not help herself. The crushing of democracy in Czechoslovakia had been as recent as 1948. In August 1950 the British defence budget was hiked from \u00a32.3bn to \u00a33.6bn (a total over a three-year period); at this stage it had appeared that the USA would be willing to help foot the bill.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.143-4\">Dell 1997, p.143-4</ref>\n\nIn September 1950 inflationary pressure was worsened when the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] voted to end the existing two-year wage freeze, although there was no wage explosion just yet. It was difficult for the Treasury to take tough measures given the government's small majority and the likelihood of another election soon.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.143\" />\n\nGaitskell thought balance of payments problems should be solved not by realignments of currencies but by asking surplus countries like the US and [[Belgium]] to inflate their economies (so they would import more). He was attacked for this by the US Treasury Secretary and [[Camille Gutt]] (former Belgian finance minister and now Managing Director of the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]). Dell argues that Gaitskell did not realise that other countries had their own domestic problems.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.141\">Dell 1997, p.141</ref> In September 1950, with Britain's balance of payments now in surplus, Gaitskell negotiated British membership of the [[European Payments Union]], meaning that instead of bilateral clearing, European currencies were to be convertible against one another even if not against the US dollar. Previously dollars had been needed for trade within Europe. Until then Gaitskell had shared concerns that some countries might stay in permanent deficit and thus effectively use their neighbours for free borrowing, or conversely that Belgium's surplus would enable her to suck gold and dollars from Britain. The EPU lasted until sterling was made convertible in 1958.<ref>Dell 1997, p.132, p.142</ref><ref>The USA had been pushing for such a measure as a precursor to European federalism. Cripps thought it would be a threat to the [[sterling area]] and claimed in February 1950 that it would prevent Britain from preserving full employment by restricting imports (the latter charge might have been true of a customs union but was untrue of a payments union). Cobbold (Governor of the Bank of England) was suspicious of EPU, and saw it as a return to the Gold Standard of the 1920s or of the pre-1914 era.[Dell 1997, p.132, 142]</ref>\n\nAlthough Gaitskell had until recently thought Bevan an inevitable future leader for the Labour Party, by the 1950 Party Conference (2 October) the ''\"[[Daily Telegraph]]\"'' political correspondent guessed correctly that he and Gaitskell were already fighting a proxy battle for the future leadership.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p204\" />\n\n=== Promotion to the Chancellorship ===\nCripps, whose health was still failing, had notified Attlee of his intention to resign as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 26 April 1950. He attempted to resign in the summer but was dissuaded by Gaitskell and Plowden because of the outbreak of the Korean War. He instead went on a long holiday, leaving Gaitskell in charge.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.133\">Dell 1997, p.133</ref>\n\nIt was now becoming clear that the US Congress was reluctant to help Britain meet the cost of rearmament. Gaitskell visited Washington in October 1950, his first visit there, just before becoming Chancellor. He warned that the [[terms of trade]] were shifting against Britain, and of the costs of rearmament.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.144\">Dell 1997, p.144</ref>\n\nIn October 1950 Cripps finally resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Dalton proposed Gaitskell for the vacancy. Sir Edward Bridges wanted [[Herbert Morrison]], a political heavyweight; Morrison had been an early advocate of devaluation but did not regard himself as qualified.<ref>Dell 1997, p.135-7</ref> Gaitskell was appointed at the young age of 44, especially unusual as most of Attlee's Cabinet were in their sixties or older. He became the Chancellor with the shortest Parliamentary apprenticeship since [[Pitt the Younger]] in 1782.<ref>Campbell 2010, p199</ref> As Chancellor of the Exchequer he retained the same control over economic planning which Cripps had had. Both Cripps and Gaitskell insisted that Gaitskell be listed after Attlee, Bevin and Morrison in the official Cabinet pecking order.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.136\" />\n\nBevan was furious at Gaitskell being promoted over him, even though, as Gaitskell correctly guessed in his diary, he probably did not want the job himself.<ref>Campbell 2010, pp.204-5</ref> Gaitskell recorded that Bevan often asserted that Cripps had promised him the Exchequer.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.567\" />\n\nThe US Chiefs of Staff wanted an even greater increase in the British armaments budget to \u00a36bn over three years, a plan backed by the British Chiefs of Staff and urged on Prime Minister Attlee on his visit to the US in Dec 1950. On his return from Washington Attlee told the House of Commons on 29 January 1951 that the defence budget was to be hiked to \u00a34.7bn over the next three-year period, including a fourfold increase in munitions production. The defence budget was to increase from 8% to 14% of GNP, a proportion exceeded only by the USA amongst NATO members. At the peak 2.5m people, 11% of the workforce, would be engaged in defence work.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.143-4\" />\n\n== Chancellor of the Exchequer, 1950\u201351 ==\n\n=== Economic philosophy ===\nOn his appointment Gaitskell told [[William Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Sanderstead|William Armstrong]], his Principal Private Secretary, that the main job over next few years would be the redistribution of wealth.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.147\">Dell 1997, p.147</ref>\n\nRab Butler and [[Samuel Brittan]], both writing in the early 1970s, commented that Gaitskell was the most technically-qualified chancellor of the 20th century up until that date.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.138\" /> However, Dell comments that he often went into excessive detail, including personally overseeing economic forecasts, and held excessively long meetings. This may have been from a love of micro-management or because, as an advocate of controls and planning, he was suspicious of treasury officials, whom he thought excessively inclined to free market mechanisms.<ref>Dell 1997, p.139</ref>\n\nIn Dec 1950 Gaitskell rejected the advice of [[Cameron Cobbold, 1st Baron Cobbold|Kim Cobbold]] ([[Governor of the Bank of England]]) and Hall that interest rates be raised, calling such a policy \"completely antiquated\".<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.141\" />\n\n=== Cost of rearmament ===\n[[Marshall Aid]], which had totalled $3.1bn over previous three years, ended officially on 1 January 1951, although in practice it ended six weeks earlier. It was held that the balance of payments was now strong enough for it no longer to be necessary.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.144\" /> Harold Wilson ([[President of the Board of Trade]]) and [[George Strauss]] ([[Minister of Supply]]) warned Gaitskell that the burden of rearmament was too much for the shortage of raw materials and manufacturing capacity, but Gaitskell ignored them as they were friends of Bevan. On 27 January 1951 Bevan was reshuffled to the Ministry of Labour with Health, now under [[Hilary Marquand]], downgraded to a non-Cabinet appointment.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.146\">Dell 1997, p.146</ref> Gaitskell welcomed the changes as reducing an obstacle to economies in health spending.<ref>Campbell 2010, p205</ref>\n\nGaitskell still favoured discrimination in favour of sterling trade and was opposed to sterling convertibility, but was now a lot more pro-American since his October 1950 visit to Washington. By February 1951 he was strongly critical of anti-Americanism in cabinet.<ref>Dell 1997, p.145</ref>\n\nBevan's Commons speech on 15 February 1951 defended the extra \u00a34.7bn on armaments, although most of his speech was a warning not to rearm too fast and that communism would be defeated through democratic socialism not through arms. Gaitskell the following day recorded his regret that for all Bevan's brilliance in oratory he should be \"a difficult team worker, and some would say even worse \u2013 a thoroughly unreliable and disloyal colleague.\"<ref>Campbell 2010, p206</ref>\n\n=== Budget ===\nGaitskell made the controversial decision to introduce charges for prescription glasses and dentures on the [[National Health Service]] in his spring 1951 budget.<ref name=\"Howse\">{{cite news|title=Anniversaries of 2013|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/9770133/Anniversaries-of-2013.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=28 December 2012|location=London|first=Christopher|last=Howse}}</ref> The Cabinet had agreed in principle in February 1951 to charges on teeth and spectacles.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> For 1951-2 Bevan was demanding \u00a3422m of health spending, whereas Gaitskell was willing to allow \u00a3400m.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.147\" /> Gaitskell wanted to pass on half the cost of false teeth and spectacles, to bring in \u00a313m in 1951-2 and \u00a323m in a full year. Children, the poor and the sick were to be exempt.<ref>Dell 1997, p.148</ref> On 9 March [[Ernest Bevin]] was moved from the Foreign Office, dying a month later. Bevan, who had hoped to succeed him, was passed over for promotion to a major job for the second time in six months. By this point other ministers felt that Bevan was looking for an issue on which to resign, and that it was pointless making too many concessions as he needed to be made to appear to be in the wrong.<ref>Dell 1997, p.146, 148</ref>\n\nIn addition, [[purchase tax]] was increased from 33% to 66% on certain luxury items such as cars, television sets and domestic appliances, while entertainment tax was increased on cinema tickets.<ref name=\"Hugh Gaitskell by Brian Brivati\">Hugh Gaitskell by Brian Brivati</ref> At the same time, however, taxation on profits was raised and pensions increased to compensate retirees for a rise in the cost of living,<ref>Henry Pelling, ''The Labour Governments, 1945\u201351'' (1984).</ref> while the allowances for dependent children payable to widows, the unemployed and the sick, together with marriage and child allowances, were also increased.<ref>Post-Victorian Britain 1902\u20131951 by Lewis Charles Bernard Seaman</ref> In addition, a number of small items were removed from purchase tax,<ref name=\"Hugh Gaitskell by Brian Brivati\" /> while the amount of earnings allowed without affecting the pension was increased from 20 shillings (\u00a31) to 40 shillings (\u00a32) a week.<ref>Denis Nowell Pritt, ''The Labour Government 1945\u201351'' (1963)</ref> Besides taxing the better off and protecting pensions, Gaitskell actually increased NHS spending.<ref>Campbell 2010, p209-10</ref> The budget increased defence spending by \u00a3500m to \u00a31.5bn for 1951-2, helped by a surplus inherited from Cripps and optimistic growth forecasts. Plans to introduce capital gains tax were postponed until 1952.<ref>Dell 1997, p.147, 150</ref>\n\nPrime Minister Attlee's initial reaction to the draft budget was that there were not likely to be many votes in it \u2013 Gaitskell replied that he could not expect votes in a rearmament year.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> Ernest Bevin did not like the idea of health charges and tried in vain to negotiate a compromise. [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Minister]] [[George Tomlinson]] suggested a repetition of the previous year's formula, a spending ceiling of \u00a3400m. Gaitskell was prepared to offer a delay in the introduction of charges but rejected the Tomlinson formula, despite Attlee's urgings, as the ceiling could not be achieved without charges. Attlee went into hospital to be treated for a duodenal ulcer on 21 March. From his sickbed he wrote what [[Kenneth O. Morgan|Kenneth O.Morgan]] calls a \"remarkably vacuous letter\" which \"dealt with none of the substantive points at issue\".<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.148-9\">Dell 1997, p.148-9</ref> At a Cabinet meeting on 22 March Gaitskell was dissuaded from his original intention to insist on prescription charges, as these might fall heavily on the genuinely sick.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p207-8\">Campbell 2010, p207-8</ref>\n\n=== Bevan's resignation ===\nGaitskell and Attlee warned of risks that the rearmament programme might not be fully implemented. Gaitskell warned the Economic Policy Committee (3 April 1951) of the shortage of machine tools, and stated that some could be imported from the USA but that this would weaken the balance of payments.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.151\">Dell 1997, p.151</ref>\n\nA very angry Bevan saw the charges as a blow to the principle of a free health service, telling a heckler whilst he was making a speech in [[Bermondsey]] (3 April 1951) that he would resign rather than accept health charges. Gaitskell, besides the obvious need for a new Chancellor to assert his authority, saw this as a deliberate attempt to publicly bounce the Cabinet, telling Dalton that Bevan's \"influence was very much exaggerated\" and that he might split the Labour Party as [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] had the Liberals.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p207-8\" />\n\nIn two long Cabinet meetings on 9 April Bevan found himself supported only by Harold Wilson.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p208-9\">Campbell 2010, p208-9</ref> [[Herbert Morrison]], who was chairing the Cabinet whilst Attlee was being treated in hospital, again proposed a compromise that there be an agreed ceiling on public spending but no NHS charges.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\">Matthew 2004, p.289</ref> Gaitskell was determined that there would not be an open-ended commitment to welfare spending at the expense of economic investment or rearmament, and rejected Morrison's proposal.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> At the second meeting, Gaitskell threatened to resign, but quietly and without a public fuss, if he did not have the backing of the Cabinet; the resignation of the Chancellor on the eve of the budget would have caused a political crisis. Douglas Jay and others attempted in vain to persuade Gaitskell to compromise, but he refused, arguing that two members of the Cabinet should not be allowed to dictate to eighteen, although he agreed not to specify just yet the date at which the charges would come into effect.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p208-9\" /> A final attempt by Attlee to negotiate a compromise from his sickbed (10 April) came to nothing.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.148-9\" /> The affair brought Gaitskell close to physical and emotional collapse.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nGaitskell won the admiration of Treasury officials for his stance: on the morning of the budget Sir Edward Bridges came to tell him of the respect he had earned in the department and that it was \"the best day we have had in the Treasury for ten years\". Gaitskell recorded that Bridges, Plowden, Leslie (Head of Information) and Armstrong were all urging him to stand firm and that he was \"overcome with emotion\" at Armstrong's words.<ref>Dell 1997, p.149</ref>\n\nGaitskell's budget was praised at the time. His predecessor Stafford Cripps wrote to him praising him for not giving in to \"political expediency\", whilst he was supported in public by two younger MPs later to be staunch allies, [[Roy Jenkins]] and [[Anthony Crosland]].<ref>Dell 1997, p.150</ref> After the budget [[Tony Benn]], who was on the right of the Labour Party at that time, recorded the atmosphere at the party meeting (i.e. a meeting of Labour MPs) on 11 April as \"sheer relief\" that it had not been worse; the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) strongly supported the budget. However, Bevan soon rejected Gaitskell's proposed compromise that it be announced that the health charges were not be permanent as \"a bromide\". Bevan's ally [[Michael Foot]] wrote an editorial in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' comparing Gaitskell to [[Philip Snowden]] (the Chancellor whose cuts in 1931 had brought down the [[Second MacDonald ministry|Second Labour Government]], after which he and other leading members of the Cabinet entered into the Tory-dominated [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]]). Bevan resigned on 21 April, as did Harold Wilson and [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]].<ref>Campbell 2010, p210</ref>\n\nGaitskell defended his budget at the party meeting on 24 April. He said it was still too early to tell if the rearmament programme was actually achievable.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.151\" /> Benn commented after the meeting on how Gaitskell's greatness arose from his combination of \"intellectual ability and political forcefulness\". Bevan then made an angry speech which did not impress many of the PLP.<ref>Campbell 2010, p212-3</ref>\n\n=== Analysis ===\nEdmund Dell argues that neither Bevan nor Gaitskell emerge with much credit from the affair. \"Gaitskell was obsessed by Bevan and by the need to establish his authority over him\". Charges on false teeth and spectacles were \"insignificant\" in the context of the greater budget and \"financially were neither here nor there\" ... but Bevan was \"impatient and arrogant and noisy and apparently intent on exhausting the tolerance of his cabinet colleagues\". Gaitskell agreed to limit health charges to three years (subject to Parliament voting to extend them), made concessions on pensions to the Trade Union Group of MPs, and a diary entry suggests he was not happy about dividend constraints \u2013 yet he was not prepared to make significant concessions to Bevan. However, Dell argues that all chancellors have to make sticking points or they would have to give in to everybody. Gaitskell saw himself as defending the country and wanted to prove Labour a \"responsible party of government\", but the public were not yet aware of the looming inflation problem. Gaitskell told [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] in 1960: \"It was a battle between us for power \u2013 he knew it and so did I\".<ref>Dell 1997, p.148, 155-7</ref>\n\nJohn Campbell agrees that Bevan may have been partly right that Gaitskell, abetted by Morrison, was deliberately trying to drive him out of the Cabinet. Gaitskell believed that Labour had to be seen to govern with fiscal responsibility, telling Dalton on 4 May 1951 that he and Bevan were engaged in a battle for the soul of the Labour Party, and that if Bevan won Labour would be out for many years (although, ironically, Gaitskell won but they were out of power for many years anyway). Had Attlee not been sick, he might have been able to patch up a compromise.<ref>Campbell 2010, p213-5</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Brian Brivati]] believes that the importance of the charges was \"irrelevant\" to the huge cost of rearmament, which damaged Britain's recovery in the years which followed by absorbing earnings from exports.<ref>Matthew 2004, p.288-9</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nA \u00a3300m surplus in the British balance of payments in 1950 turned into a \u00a3400m deficit in 1951, the most sudden reversal on record up until that time. This was caused partly by businesses switching to rearmament rather than generating exports. The other reason was a deterioration in the [[terms of trade]]: higher oil prices after the [[Abadan Crisis|Iranian oil crisis]] caused an outflow of dollars, whilst prices of wool, tin and rubber fell so the rest of the sterling area was not earning so many dollars from exports. By the second half of 1951 the overseas sterling area was importing from North America at double the 1950 rate. By 1951 inflation was beginning to increase, the government budget surplus had disappeared, and in another sign of an overheating economy unemployment was down to 1945 levels. By the second half of 1951 Gaitskell was worried about the political effect of the higher cost of living, but the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]'' accused him of using higher prices to choke off consumption and free up resources for rearmament instead of consumer goods production.<ref>Dell 1997, p.152, 154</ref>\n\nGaitskell again rejected Treasury advice to raise interest rates to cool the economy in June, July and August 1951. He argued that higher interest rates would be perceived as generating profits for the banks, which would not sit well with trade unions, and he was only prepared to consider demanding that the banks restrict credit.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.141\" /> Gaitskell (diary 10 August 1951) stated that he and Morrison thought that Attlee had been too weak in dealing with Bevan.<ref>Campbell 2010, p216</ref> By August\u2013September 1951 the Treasury were taken by surprise by a full-on sterling crisis, which they passed on to the incoming Conservative Government. Sterling was trading unofficially at $2.40, below the official rate of $2.80.<ref>Dell 1997, p.158</ref>\n\nGaitskell visited Washington in the autumn of 1951, where he thought [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|US Treasury Secretary]] [[John Wesley Snyder (US Cabinet Secretary)|John W. Snyder]] \"a pretty small-minded, small town, semi-isolationist\". A committee was formed, containing Plowden and [[Averell Harriman]], to investigate the way in which US rearmament was absorbing and pushing up the prices of world raw materials.<ref name=\"Dell 1997, p.151\" /> Gaitskell was horrified by Attlee's calling an election (19 September 1951) when he and Morrison were in North America. If Attlee had held on for another six or nine months Labour might have won.<ref>Dell 1997, p.157</ref> Labour lost the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|October 1951 General Election]] despite getting more votes than the Conservatives. Whilst the Bevanites blamed defeat on Morrison's policy of \"consolidation\", the right blamed Bevan for causing a split. Nobody imagined Labour would be out of power for more than a few years, and Attlee expected to be Prime Minister again by 1953.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /><ref>Campbell 2010, p217</ref>\n\nWhen the Conservatives returned to power, the new chancellor [[Rab Butler]] would get the balance of payments back into surplus in 1952 by cutting overseas spending, a measure which Dell suggests Gaitskell had not wanted to irritate the Americans by taking. In his memoirs (''Art of the Possible'', p.&nbsp;163) Butler later called him \"a political mouse who, confronted with a gigantic deterioration in the balance of payments, responded by cutting a sliver off the cheese ration\".<ref>Dell 1997, p.154</ref> After the Conservatives cut the armament plans in 1952 Crosland told people that Gaitskell had made him look like \"a complete idiot\" for supporting the budget in public. However, even by the end of 1951 there was less likelihood of the Korean War turning into a general war (the front line had stabilised, with the US administration being clear that they did not wish to escalate hostilities against China), so any government might have pared back defence spending in 1952.<ref>Dell 1997, p.150, 152-3</ref>\n\n== Opposition: the Bevanite split 1951\u201355 ==\n\n=== 1951\u201352 ===\nIn opposition, Gaitskell's house at [[Frognal]] Gardens, [[Hampstead]], became a centre for political intrigue. At first Herbert Morrison still seemed likely to succeed Attlee as leader. This period was characterised by factional infighting between the '[[Bevanism|Bevanite]]' left of the Labour party led by [[Aneurin Bevan]], whose strength lay mainly in the constituency Labour Parties (\"CLP\"s) and the '[[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellite]]' right who had the upper hand in the Parliamentary Party (Labour MPs \u2013 known collectively as the \"PLP\").<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nIn February 1952 Bevan led a rebellion of 56 other Labour MPs to vote against the Conservatives\u2019 defence spending plans (the official Labour position was to abstain). Dalton recorded (11 March) that Gaitskell was, behind the scenes, keen for a showdown with Bevan. At the party meeting Bevan refused to agree to toe the party line, but the issue was defused by a conciliatory motion by the centrist \"Keep Calm\" group, passed against the wishes of the platform.<ref>Campbell 2010, p218-9</ref> Bevan at this time thought that Gaitskell should be reduced to \"a junior clerk\" in the next Labour Government. On 1 August 1952, when Gaitskell had succeeded in putting Churchill (Prime Minister at the time) on the ropes in a House of Commons debate, Bevan intervened to attack Gaitskell, an event greeted with Tory relief and according to [[Richard Crossman|Crossman]] \"icy silence\" on the Labour benches.<ref>Campbell 2010, p219</ref>\n\nDalton (30 September 1952) thought the [[Morecambe]] Party Conference \"the worst \u2026 for bad temper and general hatred, since 1926\" whilst Michael Foot thought it \"rowdy, convulsive, vulgar, splenetic\". A series of left-wing motions were passed. Bevanites took over the constituency section of Labour's National Executive Committee (the \"NEC\"): Bevan, [[Barbara Castle]], [[Tom Driberg]], [[Ian Mikardo]] and Harold Wilson took the top five places with Crossman seventh. Veteran right-wingers such as Herbert Morrison and Hugh Dalton were voted off, with [[Jim Griffiths]] in sixth place the only member of the Old Guard to survive; Shinwell, who as Minister of Defence was seen as responsible for the rearmament programme, had been voted off the previous year.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p219-21\">Campbell 2010, p219-21</ref>\n\nIn a speech at [[Stalybridge]] (5 October 1952) Gaitskell alleged that \"about one-sixth\" of the constituency delegates \"appeared to be Communist or Communist-inspired\" and attacked \"the stream of grossly misleading propaganda with poisonous innuendos and malicious attacks on Attlee, Morrison and the rest of us\" published in ''Tribune''. He claimed that Labour was threatened by \"mob rule\" got up by \"frustrated journalists\" (a number of Bevanites, including [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tom Driberg]], were journalists).<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /><ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p219-21\" /> He received strong backing from the [[Transport and General Workers' Union|TGWU]] whose block vote was of immense importance at the Labour Conference and which was able to exert pressure on its sponsored MPs to toe the party line.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nAttlee then gave a speech at the newly-built [[Royal Festival Hall]] demanding an end to groups within the party. After the PLP voted 188-51 to ban such groups Bevan insisted, over the wishes of Foot and Crossman, that the Bevanite group be disbanded. The Shadow Cabinet elections (elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) were topped by Jim Griffiths and [[Chuter Ede]]. Gaitskell was in third place with 179 votes. Bevan, who had just challenged Morrison unsuccessfully for the Deputy Leadership, scraped on in twelfth and last place with 108 votes.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p219-21\" />\n\n=== 1953\u201354 ===\nTony Benn wrote of Gaitskell (24 September 1953) \"he is intellectually arrogant, obstinate and patronising. I respect \u2013 but cannot quite admire \u2013 him\".<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p222\">Campbell 2010, p222</ref>\n\nRelations between Bevan and Gaitskell continued to be acrimonious. On one occasion in 1953, when Gaitskell called for unity at a Shadow Cabinet meeting, Bevan was observed to give him \"a glare of concentrated hatred\" and declared: \"You\u2019re too young in the movement to know what you\u2019re talking about\".<ref>Campbell 2010, p221</ref> Bevan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet in April 1954 over Labour's support for the setting-up of [[SEATO]].<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p222\" />\n\nBevan stood against Gaitskell for [[Treasurer of the Labour Party|Party Treasurer]], knowing he would likely lose but hoping to discredit union bosses [[Arthur Deakin]] and [[Tom Williamson, Baron Williamson|Tom Williamson]] in the eyes of rank-and-file trade union members. In the event even [[Sam Watson (trade unionist)|Sam Watson]], leader of Bevan's own miners' union, supported Gaitskell. Gaitskell won by 4.3 million votes to 2 million. Bevan gave a speech to the ''Tribune'' party at the conference, declaring that the Labour Leader needed to be a \"desiccated calculating machine\". He was widely and probably wrongly thought to be referring to Gaitskell, to whom the label stuck. In fact it may well have been aimed at Attlee who had the previous day warned against \"emotionalism\" whilst privately Bevan thought that Gaitskell was highly emotional and, as he had shown in 1951, \"couldn\u2019t count\".<ref>Campbell 2010, p222-3</ref>\n\n=== 1955 ===\nIn March 1955 Bevan, who had given no hint of disagreement with party policy at the party meeting a few days earlier, now challenged Attlee in a House of Commons debate to demand terms for use of the new [[Thermonuclear weapon|H-Bomb]] in return for Labour's support for the weapon. He and 62 other abstained in the vote, leading to demands from loyalists that the party whip be withdrawn from him as a preliminary to him being formally expelled from the Labour Party by the NEC.<ref>Campbell 2010, p223-4</ref>\n\nWriting a few days later, Gaitskell claimed to have felt that \"sooner or later [Bevan] would have to go, but I was not sure whether this was the right moment\" (19 March). However, Gaitskell told an audience at [[Doncaster]] that Bevan had made \"a direct challenge to the elected Leader of our Party\" and accused him of not being a team player. At a party meeting a few days later (16 March) Bevan accused Gaitskell of having told a direct lie against him and declared that it was \"those hatchet-faced men sitting on the platform\" who were undermining the leadership. After a lukewarm summing up by Attlee the PLP voted by 114-112 to withdraw the whip from Bevan.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p224-5\">Campbell 2010, p224-5</ref>\n\nGaitskell felt he had to follow the lead of the unions and pushed for Bevan's expulsion, telling Crossman (24 March) that Ian Mikardo was running a Bevanite organisation in the constituency parties to make Bevan leader. When Crossman interjected that Bevan \"was only half wanting\" to be leader, had not made any conspiracy against Attlee and was mainly concerned at voicing protests against Morrison and Gaitskell, the latter replied that \"there are extraordinary parallels between Nye and Adolf Hitler. They are demagogues of exactly the same sort \u2026 There are minor differences but what is striking is the resemblance\". Summoned to appear before an NEC sub-committee, Bevan refused to be \"cornered by Gaitskell\". In the event Gaitskell intervened only once at the meeting, asking Bevan to give a pledge that he would not attack the leader \u2013 Bevan refused as it was \"a trap\". Bevan's apology for his rebellion over the H-Bomb was accepted. Gaitskell described the result (2 April) as \"a stalemate \u2026 my own position is no doubt weaker\".<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p224-5\" /> Gaitskell thought the need to move against Bevan \"dirty work\" (April 1955).<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nThe [[1955 United Kingdom general election|May 1955 General Election]] was the first since 1931 in which Labour's vote had not increased. In ''Tribune'' on 21 June 1955 Gaitskell poured scorn on the idea that more left-wing policies (or, as he put it, policies more similar to those of the Communist Party) would have won Labour more votes. Campbell argues that \"history overwhelmingly supports\" Gaitskell's argument that elections are won by appealing to the centre ground rather than to a party's core base, tempting as the latter strategy often is to parties in opposition.<ref>Campbell 2010, p226</ref>\n\nAt the [[Margate]] conference that autumn Gaitskell gave a stirring and well-received speech including an apparently unscripted passage stressing his own socialist credentials and arguing that nationalisation was still a \"vital means\" to achieving that end. Bevan was observed to be watching the speech \"red-faced and furious\" and complaining of Gaitskell's \"sheer demagogy\".<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p226-7\">Campbell 2010, p226-7</ref> In October 1955 Gaitskell was re-elected Party Treasurer by a wider margin over Bevan than the previous year.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\nThe apparent congruence between Gaitskell's economic policies and those of his Conservative successor as chancellor [[Rab Butler]], who had retained and extended NHS charges, was sometimes labelled \"Butskellism\" by the press. This view was not shared by Gaitskell himself, and after Butler's emergency \"Pots and Pans\" budget in October 1955, in which he reversed tax cuts made prior to the Conservatives' re-election at the General Election earlier that year, he attacked him strongly for allegedly having misled the electorate.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> Gaitskell won further praise for his attacks on Butler.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p226-7\" />\n\n==Party leader==\nAfter the retirement of Attlee as leader in December 1955, Gaitskell stood for party leader against Bevan and the ageing Herbert Morrison. At that time (and until 1981) the Labour Party leader was elected solely by MPs. In a final effort to stave off an inevitable Gaitskell victory, Bevan proposed that he and Gaitskell both withdraw in Morrison's favour, but Gaitskell rejected the offer.<ref>Campbell 2010, p227</ref> Gaitskell comfortably defeated Bevan (Morrison came a poor third) in the [[1955 Labour Party leadership election|party leadership contest]].<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> [[Chuter Ede]] described the leadership election as \"the political funeral of two of the greatest publicity mongers I\u2019ve ever known,\" adding that Gaitskell had never actively sought publicity.<ref>Williams 1985, p367</ref>\n\nGaitskell told a friend that \"The leadership came to me so early because Bevan threw it at me by his behaviour\", a view shared by Attlee and Harold Wilson. Gaitskell was very inexperienced for a party leader by the standards of the time. He offered Bevan a public olive branch at the party meeting after the result, promising that he would \"not be outdone in generosity\" if Bevan accepted the vote. Bevan agreed to do so, wishing Gaitskell \"higher office\".<ref>Campbell 2010, p228</ref>\n\nBrivati writes that Gaitskell's 1951\u201355 \"political performance \u2026 has not received the credit it deserves, for energy, for strategy and for sheer nerve\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" />\n\n== Leader of the Opposition, 1955\u20131963 ==\n=== Suez ===\nIn 1956 the [[Egypt]]ian ruler Colonel [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalised the [[Suez Canal Company]], beginning the [[Suez Crisis]]. Gaitskell initially told the Prime Minister, Sir [[Anthony Eden]], and the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Harold Macmillan]] at a dinner with King [[Faisal II]] of [[Iraq]] on 26 July 1956, that they would have the support of public opinion for the use of military action against Nasser, but warned Eden that he must act quickly and would have to keep the Americans closely informed.<ref name=\"Barry Turner 2006 pp 231-232\">Barry Turner, ''Suez 1956'' (2006) pp 231-232.</ref><ref>Williams 1985, p419</ref> Gaitskell denounced Nasser's action at 11am on 27 July in the House of Commons debate.<ref>Thorpe 1989, p217-8</ref>\n\nGaitskell's position became more cautious during the summer, and he suggested the dispute with Egypt should be referred to the [[United Nations]]. His first speech on Suez (2 August 1956) attacked Nasser and was welcomed by many Conservatives, and implied that he would support the use of force, but in Brivati's view did not give enough emphasis to his stipulation that it be done through the United Nations.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> He had believed Eden's assurances that he had no intention of using force.<ref>Campbell 2010, p231</ref> In two letters to Eden sent on 3 and 10 August Gaitskell condemned Nasser, but warned that he would not support any action that violated the United Nations charter.<ref name=\"Barry Turner 2006 pp 231-232\" /> In his letter of 10 August, Gaitskell wrote: \"Lest there should be any doubt in your mind about my personal attitude, let me say that I could not regard an armed attack on Egypt by ourselves and the French as justified by anything which Nasser has done so far or as consistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Nor, in my opinion, would such an attack be justified in order to impose a system of international control over the canal \u2013 desirable though this is. If, of course, the whole matter were to be taken to the United Nations and if Egypt were to be condemned by them as aggressors, then, of course, the position would be different. And if further action which amounted to obvious aggression by Egypt were taken by Nasser, then again it would be different. So far what Nasser has done amounts to a threat, a grave threat to us and to others, which certainly cannot be ignored; but it is only a threat, not in my opinion justifying retaliation by war.\"<ref name=\"Barry Turner 2006 pp 231-232\" />\n\nGaitskell passionately condemned the eventual Anglo-French military intervention to secure the Suez Canal, supposedly launched to enforce international law and to separate the Egyptian and [[Israel]]i combatants; the Israeli attack had in fact been launched in collusion with the British and French to supply a pretext for the invasion.<ref name=\"Barry Turner 2006 pp 231-232\" /> On 31 October he publicly called the invasion \"an act of disastrous folly\" which threatened the Atlantic Alliance, the United Nations and Commonwealth solidarity.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /> On 4 November 1956 Gaitskell gave a powerful broadcast, attacking the Prime Minister now it was clear Eden had been lying to him in private. Gaitskell was accused by the Conservatives of trying to appeal to the Labour Left, and of betrayal.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.289\" /><ref>Turner, ''Suez 1956'', p 232.</ref>\n\nGaitskell's stance on Suez attracted some Liberal support. The pollster Mark Abrams convinced him of the need to broaden Labour's appeal by picking up anti-colonialist votes, but this would be a development of longer-term importance to the Labour Party. At the time Gaitskell was much-criticised in the press, especially for his ill-judged and unsuccessful plea for Tory dissidents to remove Eden from power.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\" /> The Conservatives not only attacked Gaitskell as unpatriotic for failing to support British troops in action, but also tried to exploit perceived differences between Gaitskell and Bevan, who had rejoined the Shadow Cabinet earlier in the year and who had now been promoted to Shadow Foreign Secretary. Crossman noted that this forced Bevan to be loyal to Gaitskell (15 December 1956), making the two men allies of a kind.<ref>Campbell 2010, p231-2</ref>\n\n=== Nationalisation and political philosophy ===\nGaitskell was a consensual leader in 1955\u201359, in contrast to his earlier and later image. Labour was widely expected to win the next General Election and in Campbell's view he arguably did not give a clear enough lead or attack the Conservatives aggressively enough.<ref>Campbell 2010, p228-9</ref>\n\nGaitskell had initially believed nationalisation to be both morally right and economically efficient, and hoped in vain that manager-worker relations would be transformed.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> But in 1956 he published a Fabian pamphlet ''\"Socialism and Nationalisation\"'' (actually written three years earlier), arguing that there was no need for greater public ownership, and that his goals were full employment, industrial democracy and a greater spread of economic power. Gaitskell still supported physical controls and his views were a little to the left of those expressed by [[Anthony Crosland]] in ''\"The Future of Socialism\"'' (1956).<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\">Matthew 2004, p.291</ref>\n\nGaitskell's political philosophy became known as [[Gaitskellism]], and from the late 1950s brought him into increasing conflict with the trade unions over nationalisation.<ref name=quizlet>{{cite web|url=https://quizlet.com/82580255/bevanism-vs-gaitskellites-labour-party-divisions-flash-cards |title='Bevanism' vs 'Gaitskellites' Labour Party Divisions flashcards |publisher=Quizlet |date=1956-07-26 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}</ref> Besides repudiating the unquestioned commitment to public ownership of the means of production, now seen as merely one of numerous useful devices, he emphasised the goals of personal liberty, social welfare and above all social equality. Gaitskellism tended to downplay loyalty to the Labour movement as a central ethical goal, and argued that the new goals could be achieved if the government used appropriate fiscal and social policy measures within the context of a market-oriented mixed economy.<ref name=\"Richard Heffernan 2000 p 301\" /> Gaitskell's cadre of supporters included [[Anthony Crosland]], [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Douglas Jay]], [[Patrick Gordon Walker]] and [[James Callaghan]].<ref>Brian Harrison, ''Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951\u20131970'' (2011) ch 8.</ref>\n\n[[Frank Cousins]] became General Secretary of the TGWU in 1956, beginning the process whereby the unions began to shift left. The 1957 Conference endorsed the document ''\"Industry and Society\"'', which called for more flexibility, including state purchase of shares in small private firms. This was loudly condemned by Bevan's wife [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Jennie Lee]] and by [[Michael Foot]], editor of ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' but out of Parliament at the time.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\" />\n\n=== 1959 General Election ===\nIn the summer of 1959 Bevan supported Gaitskell on the NEC against Frank Cousins over unilateralism, which Bevan had opposed at the 1957 Conference, and nuclear tests (24 June 1959). Crossman believed Bevan could have overthrown Gaitskell (17 July 1959) and that both Bevan and Gaitskell thought Wilson an unprincipled careerist (13 August 1959).<ref>Campbell 2010, p236</ref> In the summer of 1959 Hugh and Dora Gaitskell, accompanied by Bevan, went to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] to copy Macmillan's recent successful trip.<ref>Campbell 2010, p236-7</ref>\n\nAt [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], with a General Election clearly imminent, Gaitskell pledged that Labour's spending plans would not require him to raise income tax, for which he was attacked by the Tories for supposed irresponsibility.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\" />\n\nDuring the 1959 election campaign Crossman thought Gaitskell had become \"a television star\" with Bevan \"a rather faded elder statesman behind him\" (22 September 1959).<ref>Campbell 2010, p237</ref> The Labour Party had been widely expected to win the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]], but did not.<ref>David E. Butler and Richard Rose, ''The British General Election of 1959'' (1960)</ref> The Conservatives increased their majority, a fact partly attributable to the post-war prosperity that Britain was now experiencing.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.290\" /> Gaitskell was undermined by public doubts about the credibility of proposals to raise pensions and by a highly effective Conservative campaign run by [[Harold Macmillan]] under the slogan \"Life is better with the Conservatives, don't let Labour ruin it.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1959_over.stm | work=BBC News | title=Election Battles 1945\u20131997}}</ref> This election defeat led to questions being asked as to whether Labour could ever win a general election again, but Gaitskell remained as leader.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n=== Clause IV ===\nFollowing the election defeat, bitter internecine disputes resumed. Gaitskell blamed the Left for the defeat and attempted unsuccessfully to amend Labour's [[Clause IV]]\u2014which its adherents believed committed the party to further [[nationalisation]] of industry, while Gaitskell and his followers believed it had become either superfluous or a political liability.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" />\n\nOn the Tuesday after the election Gaitskell lunched \"bibulously\" with Bevan at [[Asheridge]] in the [[Chiltern Hills|Chilterns]] to discuss his plans for party reform. At this time he had no plans to revise Clause IV. He told Crossman (19 October) that Bevan simply wanted to succeed Jim Griffiths as deputy leader and had shown no inclination to resist moderate policies. After initially expressing surprise, Gaitskell accepted Crossman's advice that Bevan be allowed a veto over any change to nationalisation policy.<ref>Campbell 2010, p238</ref>\n\nThe November 1959 Conference, postponed because of the election, was already divided by rumours that Gaitskell was planning action over Clause IV. Ignoring advice from his allies, and partly motivated by detailed polling by Mark Abrams which showed that younger voters regarded Labour as old-fashioned, Gaitskell pushed for reform. Brivati writes that Clause IV was irrelevant in practice but Gaitskell had made \"a frontal assault on \u2026 a Labour equivalent of the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]]\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" />\n\nBevan saw Gaitskell's speech in advance and made no objection to it at the time. Gaitskell did not rule out further nationalisation, but saw it as a means to an end, pouring scorn on the idea that Labour should be committed to nationalising \"the whole of light industry, the whole of agriculture, all the shops, every little pub and garage\". Bevan now claimed he had \"misunderstood or misheard\" what Gaitskell planned and was reported to be \"absolutely livid\" and \"wondering whether to blow the whole thing wide open\". In the end he made a conciliatory speech, mentioning that Barbara Castle (who had attacked Gaitskell's proposal) and Gaitskell had both quoted his own dictum that Socialism was about controlling the \"commanding heights\" of the economy. He argued that according to the principles of [[Euclid]] if two things are equal to a third thing they must both be equal to one another, and so there could not be any real difference between Castle and Gaitskell.<ref>Campbell 2010, p238-9</ref>\n\nBenn wrote (28 November 1959): \"Nye\u2019s speech this afternoon was witty, scintillating, positive, conciliatory \u2013 the model of what a Leader should do. He didn\u2019t knock Hugh out but he gently elbowed him aside\". The cartoonist \"[[Victor Weisz|Vicky]]\" showed Gaitskell pedalling to [[Blackpool]] on a [[Tandem bicycle|tandem]] with Bevan behind him \u2013 then pedalling back again but this time with Bevan in the front saddle (30 November 1959).<ref>Campbell 2010, p239</ref>\n\nThere was much talk that Bevan might now seize the party leadership, but it seems unlikely that he had the stomach for this anymore, not least as he had never wanted to be leader solely for its own sake. Gaitskell could no longer afford to quarrel with his deputy, and he enjoyed a position of great influence as keeper of the party's conscience, similar to, but much more powerful than, the position of [[John Prescott]] relative to [[Tony Blair]] forty years later. Moreover, by the end of 1959 Bevan was seriously unwell; he withdrew from the public eye and died in July 1960.<ref>Campbell 2010, p239-40</ref>\n\nIn March 1960 the NEC agreed a new statement of Labour's aims as an addition to Clause IV rather than a replacement. Throughout the summer of 1960 union conferences, many of whose rule books had their own equivalent to Clause IV, were hostile to the new proposal, and in the end four of the six largest unions opposed Gaitskell's plans. The new proposal was demoted to a \"valuable expression\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" />\n\n=== Unilateral disarmament ===\n[[Unilateral disarmament|Unilateral nuclear disarmament]] was increasingly popular amongst union activists and was also debated in several union conferences in the spring and summer of 1960. The great majority of the PLP supported [[NATO]] and multilateral disarmament.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" />\n\nGaitskell took on Frank Cousins and wanted to show that Labour were a party of government, not just of opposition. At the October 1960 [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] Conference two resolutions in favour of unilateral disarmament \u2013 proposed by the TGWU and the Engineers\u2019 Union \u2013 were carried, whilst the official policy document on defence was rejected. Gaitskell roused his supporters by promising to \"Fight and Fight and Fight Again\" to reverse the decision. Labour doctrine was that the Parliamentary Party had discretion over the timing of implementation of conference policy. In practice, in the 1940s and '50s, the unions, whose block votes dominated conference, had been broadly supportive of the PLP, but this was now beginning to change.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\">Matthew 2004, p.292</ref> Gaitskell was challenged unsuccessfully for the leadership by Harold Wilson [[1960 Labour Party leadership election|in November 1960]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/harold-wilson-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011161640/http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/harold-wilson-2/ |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Blackpool]] Conference of October 1961 saw a narrow conference vote in favour of ''multi''lateral disarmament.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\" /> Winning the unilateralism vote in 1961 restored Gaitskell's authority in the party and his reputation in the country.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p241\">Campbell 2010, p241</ref> Unilateral nuclear disarmament remained a divisive issue, and many on the Left continued to call for a change of leadership.

Although not entirely opposed in principle to British entry, he believed that the EEC was resistant to reform and that membership would hurt Britain's relations with the Commonwealth.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\" /><ref>Williams 1985, pp.702-749</ref><ref>Roy Jenkins, ''A Life at the Center '' (1991) pp 136 \u2013 45.</ref>\n\nIn a speech to the party conference in October 1962, Gaitskell claimed that Britain's participation in a [[Federal Europe]] would mean \"the end of Britain as an independent European state, the end of a thousand years of history!\" He added: \"You may say, all right! Let it end! But, my goodness, it's a decision that needs a little care and thought.\"<ref name=\"Charlton\" />\n\nIn the speech Gaitskell summoned up the memory of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] and [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], where [[Canadian Corps|Canadian]] and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC]] troops had fought alongside British, mixing his defence of national identity with the tradition of the Commonwealth. The speech dismayed many of Gaitskell's natural supporters but was applauded by many on the Left, causing his wife Dora to observe \"all the wrong people are cheering\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\" />\n\n== Death ==\nIn mid-December 1962, Gaitskell fell ill with [[flu]], but he was declared well enough by his doctor to travel to the [[Soviet Union]], where he met the Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] for talks. Upon his return to Britain his condition deteriorated after he contracted another virus. On 4 January he was admitted to [[Middlesex Hospital]] in [[Marylebone]], where, despite enormous efforts by doctors to save his life, he died on 18 January, with his wife at his bedside. He had died from complications following a sudden flare-up of [[systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], an [[autoimmune disease]] which had affected his heart and kidneys. He was 56.<ref>{{cite news|title=1963: Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell dies|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/18/newsid_3376000/3376971.stm|website=bbc.co.uk|date=18 January 1963|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Howse\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Hugh Gaitskell|url=http://www.lupus.org.uk/news-events/celebrity/315-hugh-gaitskell|publisher=St. Thomas' Lupus Trust|accessdate=4 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915143607/http://www.lupus.org.uk/news-events/celebrity/315-hugh-gaitskell|archive-date=15 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The shock of his death was comparable to that of the sudden death of the later Labour Party leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]], in May 1994, when he too seemed to be on the threshold of [[10 Downing Street]].<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p241\" />\n\nGaitskell's death left an opening for [[Harold Wilson]] in the party leadership; Wilson narrowly won the next [[1964 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for Labour 21 months later. The abrupt and unexpected nature of his death led to some speculation that [[crime|foul play]] might have been involved. The most [[Harold Wilson conspiracy theories|popular conspiracy theory]] involved a supposed Soviet [[KGB]] plot to ensure that Wilson (alleged by the supporters of these theories to be a KGB agent himself) became Prime Minister. This claim was given new life by [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]]'s controversial 1987 book ''[[Spycatcher]]'', but the only evidence that ever came to light was the testimony of a Soviet [[defector]], [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]], whose claims about Wilson were repeatedly investigated and never substantiated.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 30 greatest conspiracy theories - part 2, 16 to 30|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3483652/The-30-greatest-conspiracy-theories-part-2.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nGaitskell had inherited \u00a314,000 (around \u00a3800,000 at 2015 prices) from an aunt in April 1938, which was invested for him and multiplied several times (at a time of relatively high inflation) by a friend in the City.

The diary is an important primary source for the politics of the era.<ref>Campbell 2010, p.235</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Gaitskellites and after ===\nGaitskell was adored by followers like [[Roy Jenkins]], who thought him a beacon of hope, decency and integrity, especially as Wilson's government came more and more to seem one of shabby compromises. Left-wingers like [[Barbara Castle]] loathed him for his intransigence. Many, including [[Tony Benn]] \u2013 a Labour centrist at the time \u2013 simply thought him a divisive figure and initially welcomed Wilson as a fresh start who could unite the party. In the event Wilson's closest allies as Prime Minister \u2013 Crossman and Castle \u2013 were former Bevanites.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p241-2\">Campbell 2010, p241-2</ref>\n\nHowever, many of the Gaitskellites held leading positions in Harold Wilson's Cabinet of 1964\u201370. Many of them \u2013 e.g. [[Roy Jenkins]] and [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]] but not Anthony Crosland or [[Douglas Jay]] \u2013 became supporters of British membership of the EEC, an issue on which Labour was split in the 1970s and which helped to precipitate the SDP split of 1981.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.293\" />\n\nJohn Campbell writes that \"the echoes of the Gaitskell-Bevan rivalry continued to divide the party right up to the 1980s\".<ref>Campbell 2010, p196</ref> [[Neil Kinnock]] (Labour Leader 1983\u201392) grew up in [[South Wales]] and was brought up as an admirer of Bevan, but although he disliked the comparison his battle with the hard-left [[Militant Tendency]] in the mid-1980s had echoes of Gaitskellism; John Smith (Labour Leader 1992-4) had been a Gaitskellite as a young man in the early 1960s; Tony Blair's first act as leader in 1994 was finally to abolish Clause IV \u2013 for this and other acts he was supported by the elderly Roy Jenkins, who had become a Liberal Democrat by then. Like Gaitskell before him, Blair was often seen by many of his enemies in the Labour Party as a public-school educated, middle-class interloper.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p241-2\" />\n\n[[Tony Benn]] contrasted Gaitskell's stand on the [[Suez Crisis]] to that of the former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] on [[Iraq War|the war in Iraq]]. [[Margaret Thatcher]] compared Blair with Gaitskell in a different manner, warning her party when Blair came to power that he was the most formidable Labour leader since Hugh Gaitskell.\n\n=== Assessments ===\nGaitskell's socialism was, in Campbell's view, that of a public servant wanting to see the world more rationally governed.<ref name=\"Campbell 2010, p198\" /> Gaitskell very likely might have become Prime Minister had he lived; however, he left no lasting monument other than \"the fading memory of promise unfulfilled\". Gaitskell, although no Marxist, was a sincere socialist but nonetheless was in some respects the first \"moderniser\" who saw how Labour would have to adapt to survive.<ref>Campbell 2010, p242-3</ref>\n\nHis longtime close friend [[Roy Jenkins]] concluded a decade afterwards, in an article which he later quoted in his memoirs:\n:All his struggles illustrated some blemishes as well as exceptional strength. He would not have been a perfect Prime Minister. He was stubborn, rash, and could in a paradoxical way become too emotionally committed to an over-rational position which, once he had thought it rigorously through, he believed must be the final answer. He was only a moderately good judge of people. But when these faults are put in the scales and weighed against his qualities they shrivel away. He had purpose and direction, courage and humanity. He was a man for raising the sights of politics. He clashed on great issues. He avoided the petty bitterness of personal jealousy. You could raise a banner which men were proud to follow, but he never perverted his leadership ability; it was infused by sense and humour, and by a desire to change the world, not for his own satisfaction, but so that people might more enjoy living in it.... He was that very rare phenomenon, a great politician was also an unusually agreeable man.<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''A Life at the Center '' (1991) pp 141-42</ref>\n\nBecause he never became Prime Minister, and because of the great capacity many considered that he had for the post, Hugh Gaitskell is remembered largely with respect from people both within and outside of the Labour Party. Gaitskell is regarded by some as \"the best Prime Minister we never had\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/public-affairs/press-releases/index.phtml?menu=pressreleasesarchive&code=CAB-175/04&create_date=06-dec-2004|title=Press releases|work=nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrivati acknowledged that he had \"an almost reckless honesty and courage\"<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.293\" /> which could turn into stubbornness.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.288\" /> \"His leadership was a heroic failure\" and \"The defining moment of the post-war history of the Labour Party\".<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.293\" /> Although by 1963 Gaitskell appeared to be on the verge of leading Labour back into power, it still took what Brivati describes as \"the greatest performance by a leader of the opposition [last] century\" for Harold Wilson to lead Labour back by a narrow majority.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.292\" />\n\nBrivati writes that for Gaitskell \"socialism was not an end state \u2026 but the reform of institutions and practices for the more effective realisation of preferred values\". Evan Durbin's ''Politics of Democratic Socialism'' (1940) was a seminal text.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.291\" /> Gaitskell was not, in Brivati's view, a \"progressive\" in any modern sense. He favoured equality and thought the free market wasteful. He wanted to incorporate Liberal opinion within the Labour vote. However, the modernising leaders of subsequent generations, [[Neil Kinnock]] and [[Tony Blair]], were to a certain extent continuing Gaitskell's tradition.<ref name=\"Matthew 2004, p.293\" />\n\n=== Memorials ===\nHis name appears in popular culture from time to time. For example, 'Hugh Gaitskell House' is the building [[Nicholas Lyndhurst]]'s character Garry Sparrow is looking for in ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'' when he first stumbles into [[Second World War]] London. A tower block of that name can be found opposite [[Stoke Newington railway station]] in North London.\n\nHugh Gaitskell Primary School is situated in [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]], part of his former Leeds South constituency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hughgaitskell.leeds.sch.uk|title=Hugh Gaitskell Primary School|work=hughgaitskell.leeds.sch.uk|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?client=public&X=428500&Y=430500&width=700&height=400&gride=428671&gridn=430688&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&addr1=&addr2=&addr3=&pc=LS118AB&advanced=&local=&localinfosel=&kw=&inmap=&table=&ovtype=&keepicon=true&zm=0&scale=10000&out.x=3&out.y=11|title=Maps|publisher=}}</ref> The area is now in the Leeds Central constituency, represented by [[Hilary Benn]].\n\nIn 1978, some 15 years after his death, a new housing development by [[Sandwell]] council in the [[Tividale]] area of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] was named Gaitskell Terrace.\n\nGaitskell was buried in Hampstead, and a memorial plaque to his name is prominently placed in the cloisters of [[New College, Oxford]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23470 |title = Hugh Todd Naylor Gaitskell (1906-1963) - Find a}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!--See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Brivati, Brian. \"Gaitskell, Hugh Todd Naylor (1906\u20131963)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33309, accessed 26 June 2016] doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/33309 (print edition listed under \"Matthew\" below)\n* Brivati, Brian.

The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games, particularly ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other ideologies and personality traits of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. It features a distinctive [[watercolor]] art style, and music by the group [[British Sea Power]]. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with its narrative and conversation systems receiving the most praise. It was named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications, and won numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html |title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective |publisher=Techspot |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424 |title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy |website=GameCrate |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/ |title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet.  Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet |title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind or body, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented persona. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ |title=Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing |first=David |last=O'Keefe |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=7 April 2020 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Disco Elysium'' is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability, and traversing the Pale is considered highly dangerous.<ref name=gamerant>{{cite web |date=24 January 2020 |first=Philip |last=Trahan |url=https://gamerant.com/disco-elysium-world-explained/ |title=The World of Disco Elysium Explained |website=GameRant |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Nations and people within ''Disco Elysium'' follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], [[fascism]], moralism (the setting's stand-in for [[centrism]]) and ultraliberalism (the setting's stand-in for [[right-libertarianism]]).\n\nThe setting's political and cultural history is also markedly different. The philosophy of communism was founded by an economist and a historical materialist named Kras Mazov, and rather than being associated with the color red and symbols like [[hammer and sickle]], the ideology is instead represented by the color white and symbolised by deer antlers surrounding a pentagram. Moralism, meanwhile, despite being a centrist ideology, also has religious overtones and connotations, since it is associated with the setting's largest religion, the Moralist International, the dominant feature of which are the so-called \"Innocences\", [[saint]]-like figures, who also wielded great religious and political power while they were alive, akin to the position of pope. The greatest and most influential amongst the historical Innocences is Dolores Dei, a woman of mysterious origins, who allegedly had glowing lungs and founded many of the world's modern institutions. Due to Dolores Dei's influence, the symbol of love in ''Disco Elysium''{{'s}} world is a set of lungs, rather than a heart.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fictional city of Revachol on the isola of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /><ref name=gamerant/> Five decades before the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city. A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise.

Kurvitz fell into a period of depression and alcoholism for about three years following the book's failing.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nKurvitz eventually pulled himself out of his alcoholism, and helped Kender to also surpass his personal period of alcoholism. As a sign of gratitude, Kender suggested to Kurvitz that instead of pursuing a novel that he try capturing his world as a video game instead as to draw a larger interest. Kurvitz had no experience in video games before, but once he had seen artwork of the game's setting of Revachol as easily fitting into an [[isometric RPG|isometric format]], as well as Rostov's agreement that they might as well continue taking the risk of failing on a video game together, Kurvitz proceeded with the idea.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kurvitz wrote a concise description of what the game would be: \"AD&D meets '70s cop-show, in an original 'fantastic realist' setting, with swords, guns and motor-cars. Realised as an isometric CRPG \u2013 a modern advancement on the legendary Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate. Massive, reactive story. Exploring a vast, poverty-stricken ghetto. Deep, strategic combat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kender was impressed on the strong statement that he invested into the game's development, with additional investment coming from friends and family.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> The game was announced as ''No Truce With the Furies'' with a planned 2017 release date.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nWork on the game started around 2016, with the local team working out of a [[Squatting|squat]] in a former gallery in Tallinn. They were able to secure venture capital into the game during that first year which allowed Kurvitz to seek out the band [[British Sea Power]] for their music for the game's soundtrack. While in [[Birmingham]] to speak to the band, Kurvitz realised the city was a better location for the main development team as there were more local resources for both development and for voice-overs.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London and [[Brighton]], with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Overall, by the time of the game's release, ZA/UM had about 20 outside consultants and 35 in-house developers,<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> with a team of eight writers assisting Kurvitz in the game's dialog.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war |title=Making games under threat of nuclear war |website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/ |title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha |first=Deisi |last=Helem\u00e4e |publisher=Geenius.ee |date=5 September 2018 |lang=Estonian |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nAs originally planned, the game was to focus on action in a single city location to make the 2017 release.

The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games, particularly ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other ideologies and personality traits of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. It features a distinctive [[watercolor]] art style, and music by the group [[British Sea Power]]. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with its narrative and conversation systems receiving the most praise. It was named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications, and won numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html |title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective |publisher=Techspot |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424 |title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy |website=GameCrate |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/ |title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet.  Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet |title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind or body, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented persona. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ |title=Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing |first=David |last=O'Keefe |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=7 April 2020 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Disco Elysium'' is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability, and traversing the Pale is considered highly dangerous.<ref name=gamerant>{{cite web |date=24 January 2020 |first=Philip |last=Trahan |url=https://gamerant.com/disco-elysium-world-explained/ |title=The World of Disco Elysium Explained |website=GameRant |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Nations and people within ''Disco Elysium'' follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], [[fascism]], moralism (the setting's stand-in for [[centrism]]) and ultraliberalism (the setting's stand-in for [[right-libertarianism]]).\n\nThe setting's political and cultural history is also markedly different. The philosophy of communism was founded by an economist and a historical materialist named Kras Mazov, and rather than being associated with the color red and symbols like [[hammer and sickle]], the ideology is instead represented by the color white and symbolised by deer antlers surrounding a pentagram. Moralism, meanwhile, despite being a centrist ideology, also has religious overtones and connotations, since it is associated with the setting's largest religion, the Moralist International, the dominant feature of which are the so-called \"Innocences\", [[saint]]-like figures, who also wielded great religious and political power while they were alive, akin to the position of pope. The greatest and most influential amongst the historical Innocences is Dolores Dei, a woman of mysterious origins, who allegedly had glowing lungs and founded many of the world's modern institutions. Due to Dolores Dei's influence, the symbol of love in ''Disco Elysium''{{'s}} world is a set of lungs, rather than a heart.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fictional city of Revachol on the isola of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /><ref name=gamerant/> Five decades before the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city. A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise. They reflect on Harry's actions during the game, whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium |title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction |website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz since 2001 had been part of a band called Ultramelanhool, and in 2005, while in [[Tallinn]], Estonia, with the group struggling for finances, conceived of a fictional world during a drunken evening while listening to [[Ti\u00ebsto]]'s \"[[Adagio for Strings (Ti\u00ebsto song)|Adagio for Strings]]\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-disco-elysium-how-zaum-created-one-of-the-most-original-rpgs-of-the-decade/ |title=The making of Disco Elysium: How ZA/UM created one of the most original RPGs of the decade |first=Alex |last=Alex |last=Wiltshire |date=9 January 2020 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> Feeling this had a solid idea, the group created a collective of artists and musicians, which included Aleksander Rostov, to expand upon the work of that night and developing a [[tabletop RPG]] based on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' on this [[steampunk]]-like concept.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During this period, Kurvitz met Estonian author [[Kaur Kender]], who helped him to write a novel set in this world, ''Sacred and Terrible Air'',<ref name= Kurvitz/>  which was published in 2013 but only sold about one thousand copies. Kurvitz feel into a period of depression and alcoholism for about three years following the book's failing.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nKurvitz eventually pulled himself out of his alcoholism, and helped Kender to also surpass his personal period of alcoholism. As a sign of gratitude, Kender suggested to Kurvitz that instead of pursuing a novel that he try capturing his world as a video game instead as to draw a larger interest. Kurvitz had no experience in video games before, but once he had seen artwork of the game's setting of Revachol as easily fitting into an [[isometric RPG|isometric format]], as well as Rostov's agreement that they might as well continue taking the risk of failing on a video game together, Kurvitz proceeded with the idea.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kurvitz wrote a concise description of what the game would be: \"AD&D meets '70s cop-show, in an original 'fantastic realist' setting, with swords, guns and motor-cars. Realised as an isometric CRPG \u2013 a modern advancement on the legendary Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate. Massive, reactive story. Exploring a vast, poverty-stricken ghetto. Deep, strategic combat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kender was impressed on the strong statement that he invested into the game's development, with additional investment coming from friends and family.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> The game was announced as ''No Truce With the Furies'' with a planned 2017 release date.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nWork on the game started around 2016, with the local team working out of a [[Squatting|squat]] in a former gallery in Tallinn. They were able to secure venture capital into the game during that first year which allowed Kurvitz to seek out the band [[British Sea Power]] for their music for the game's soundtrack. While in [[Birmingham]] to speak to the band, Kurvitz realised the city was a better location for the main development team as there were more local resources for both development and for voice-overs.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London and [[Brighton]], with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Overall, by the time of the game's release, ZA/UM had about 20 outside consultants and 35 in-house developers,<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> with a team of eight writers assisting Kurvitz in the game's dialog.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war |title=Making games under threat of nuclear war |website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/ |title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha |first=Deisi |last=Helem\u00e4e |publisher=Geenius.ee |date=5 September 2018 |lang=Estonian |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nAs originally planned, the game was to focus on action in a single city location to make the 2017 release.

{"title_page": "Stanley Evans", "text_new": "{{for|the Canadian writer|Stanley Evans (author)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2016}}\n'''Stanley Norman Evans''' (1 February 1898 \u2013 25 June 1970) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] industrialist and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician. He served very briefly as an Agriculture Minister in the post-war [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]] government but was forced to resign when he claimed that farmers were being \"[[wikt:featherbed|featherbedded]]\". During the [[Suez Crisis]], Evans broke from the party line and supported the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's policy, which led his local association successfully to press him to resign from Parliament.\n\n==Wartime service==\nEvans was a native of [[Birmingham]] where he went to Harborne Elementary School.<ref name=\"Obituary\">\"Mr Stanley Evans\" (Obituary), ''The Times'', 26 June 1970, p. 10.</ref> His first job after leaving school was in a [[Accountancy|chartered accountants]] firm,<ref name=\"Times Guide 1950\">\"The Times House of Commons 1950\", p. 155.</ref> but in 1915 he left to enlist in the [[Northumberland Hussars]]. He served in [[France]] and [[Belgium]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], and was discharged in 1919.<ref name=\"Stenton and Lees\">M. Stenton and S. Lees, \"Who's Who of British MPs\" vol. IV (Harvester Press, 1981), p. 112.</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nReturning to the West Midlands, Evans established Stanley N. Evans (Birmingham) Ltd, who supplied [[sand]] for [[Molding (process)|mould]]s used in the many [[Casting|cast metal]] [[foundry|foundries]] in the [[Black Country]].<ref name=\"Obituary\" /> Evans was also involved in the publishing industry, being Chairman of Town Crier Publishing Society Ltd.<ref name=\"Stenton and Lees\" /> During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Evans was a road transport organiser employed by the Ministry of War Transport.<ref name=\"Times Guide 1945\">\"The Times House of Commons 1945\", p. 69.</ref>\n\n==Election to Parliament==\nEvans was chosen as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Wednesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Wednesbury]] to follow [[John Banfield]], who died at the end of May 1945 while still in post. At the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] he had no difficulty in being elected, winning a majority of 15,935.<ref name=\"Times Guide 1945\" />\n\nIn his [[maiden speech]] on 22 August 1945, Evans spoke in a debate on the ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]]. He concentrated on the post-war reconstruction and opposed attempts to indict 70,000,000 Germans for the misdeeds of a few.<ref name=\"Maiden speech\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 23 August 1945, p. 8.</ref> In October he criticised the restrictive practices of trade associations in several fields of industry, and urged an investigation into their activities.<ref name=\"Trade associations\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 26 October 1945, p. 8.</ref> His speech drew a protest from [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] Ltd, whom he had singled out.<ref name=\"ICI letter\">\"Combine Prices\", ''The Times'', 1 November 1945, p. 5.</ref> Evans opposed the [[Anglo-American loan]] and the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] agreement.<ref name=\"Dissension\">[[Philip Norton, Baron Norton of Louth|Philip Norton]], \"Dissension in the House of Commons 1945-74\" (Macmillan, 1975), pp. 3, 5.</ref>\n\n==Steel nationalisation==\nEvans was a supporter of economic planning who was very conscious of his origins in the industrial midlands of England; in a debate in February 1946 he declared to laughter and cheers that \"the [[elbow grease]] would be forthcoming from those who had always saved Britain \u2013 the common people, the best bred [[wikt:mongrel|mongrels]] in the world\".<ref name=\"Elbow grease\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 1 March 1946, p. 8.</ref> He distrusted the [[Soviet Union]] for its \"constant stream of vilification, invective and abuse\" directed at the British people,<ref name=\"Soviet abuse\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 24 October 1946, p. 8.</ref> and in June 1947 made an outspoken attack on Soviet domination of Europe led by the \"hermits of the [[Kremlin]]\".<ref name=\"Hermits\">\"'A Great Opportunity For Europe'\", ''The Times'', 20 June 1947, p. 8.</ref>\n\nIn a free vote on [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|abolition of the death penalty]], Evans spoke loudly in support of retaining capital punishment on the grounds that public opinion was not supportive, and reported that the people to whom he spoke were concerned that too many condemned prisoners were being reprieved.<ref name=\"Capital punishment\">\"Suspension Of Death Penalty\", ''The Times'', 15 April 1948, p. 4.</ref> He was also a supporter of the Government's plan to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] the steel industry, which was the most controversial of all its nationalisation proposals.<ref name=\"Steel nationalisation\">\"Aims Of Iron And Steel Bill\", ''The Times'', 16 November 1948, p. 4.</ref> Because of his experience in the industry, Evans was placed on the Standing Committee examining the Bill.\n\n==Ministry of Food==\nEvans was re-elected for Wednesbury at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], his majority almost unchanged on that of 1945 despite a three-way fight. In the government reshuffle that followed, he was appointed [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food]]. At his first press conference on 17 March, a fortnight into his job, Evans warned that Britain \"must be careful not to cosset any section of the population at the expense of the community as a whole\". He said the Ministry should consider themselves the representatives of housewives; later Evans had to stress that these were his personal views.<ref name=\"Press conference\">\"Food Supplies Easier\", ''The Times'', 18 March 1950, p. 6.</ref>\n\nHe had a tough debut on the front bench of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 3 April 1950 when he made a statement about [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[sugar]] negotiations. Many Members of Parliament thought that the West Indies had been treated discourteously and the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] [[Herbert Morrison]] had to come to the aid of the junior Food Minister.<ref name=\"Sugar negotiations\">\"Agreements On Empire Sugar\", ''The Times'', 4 April 1950, p. 4.</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nThe controversy caused by his initial press conference had continued. The [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|National Farmers Union]] had protested and the Minister ([[Maurice Webb (politician)|Maurice Webb]]) had to give an assurance to them that the Ministry would fail if it did not assist food producers. However, Evans was to cause further problems at a press conference in [[Manchester]] on 14 April. He asserted that farmers were provided with guaranteed prices and assured markets at taxpayers' expense, and asked how long it could continue. Evans then went on to claim that subsidies concealed inefficiency and inertia, and commented that \"no other nation feather-beds its agriculture like Britain\".<ref name=\"Featherbedding\">\"Junior Minister Dropped\", ''The Times'', 17 April 1950, p. 4.</ref>\n\n===Dismissal===\nThe National Farmers Unions of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland immediately responded in a joint statement expressing their amazement and giving detailed figures to refute his argument. At this [[Clement Attlee]] asked for Evans' resignation, dismissing him from office after only six weeks. Evans stuck by his opinions even though \"the National Farmers' Unions have my scalp under their belt\".<ref name=\"Featherbedding\" /> He later denied as \"fantastic\" rumours that he intended to resign his Parliamentary seat.<ref name=\"Resignation\">\"Mr. Evans and his Resignation\", ''The Times'', 18 April 1950, p. 4.</ref> On 16 May Evans used a debate on the [[Finance Act|Finance Bill]] to set out a full defence of his charges against agriculture.<ref name=\"Finance Bill debate\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 17 May 1950, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Parliamentary activity==\nEvans opposed the opening of [[Battersea Park]] funfair on Sundays, saying it would cause dismay to millions of people.<ref name=\"Sunday opening\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 29 November 1950, p. 7.</ref> Despite his sacking he paid tribute to Attlee for his statesmanlike diplomacy with the [[United States]] over the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Korea\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 15 December 1950, p. 8.</ref> He was a frequent member of Parliamentary delegations to other countries, including that to [[Hungary]] in 1946. In 1951 he led a delegation to [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Nyasaland]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Malta]]. He was also a member of a delegation to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1954.<ref name=\"Stenton and Lees\" />\n\nIn 1953 Evans annoyed his own side by speaking against a Labour amendment on the issue of the [[Central African Federation]]. He agreed with the Conservative government that federation would lead to economic development and would make Central Africa the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr Valley]] of Africa.<ref name=\"Central Africa\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 25 March 1953, p. 3.</ref> He was a cautious supporter of German rearmament, because it would assist in the defence against Soviet expansionism.<ref name=\"German rearmament\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 25 February 1954, p. 3.</ref>\n\n==Attitude toward America==\nThe summer of 1956 saw Evans involved in two controversies, first over the sale of the Trinidad Oil Company to the [[Texaco|Texas Oil Company]],<ref name=\"Trinidad Oil\">\"Changing Views On Oil Deal\", ''The Times'', 14 June 1956, p. 7.</ref> and second over his allegation that the United States was discriminating against British shipping.<ref name=\"Flag discrimination\">\"Discrimination At Sea\" (letter), ''The Times'', 10 July 1956, p. 11.</ref> When speaking at the outbreak of the [[Suez Crisis]], Evans was critical of the lack of American support for what he described as the British crusade against totalitarianism.<ref name=\"Suez opening\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 3 August 1956, p. 6.</ref>\n\n==Suez==\nAs the situation became more grave, Evans pressed Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] to withhold military action until Parliament had debated it.<ref name=\"Eden question\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 31 October 1956, p. 4.</ref> When Eden called a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] on 1 November 1956, Evans abstained from voting rather than vote with his party against the Government; he was the only Labour Member of Parliament to break the [[Whip (politics)|whip]] but was not disciplined for his failure to vote.<ref name=\"Abstain\">\"Prime Minister To Broadcast\", ''The Times'', 3 November 1956, p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Constituency discontent===\nHowever, Evans' tacit support for the invasion of Suez caused unrest in his constituency. After several local organisations sent in resolutions strongly condemning his action, the Wednesbury divisional Labour Party called a meeting to discuss his future on 17 November. Evans spoke in defence of his position, but the meeting unanimously passed a resolution calling on Evans to resign his seat. A few days later, Evans complied, also resigning from membership of the Labour Party. He declared that when military action had begun, it was \"against the best interests of the British people to divide the House of Commons while fighting was still in progress\".<ref name=\"Suez resignation\">\"Mr. S. Evans, M.P., Resigns\", ''The Times'', 21 November 1956, p. 6.</ref>\n\nAlthough supporters of Evans raised a petition asking him to stand for re-election as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] candidate,<ref name=\"Independent candidate\">\"Mr. Evans urged to stand again\", ''The Times'', 23 November 1956, p. 6.</ref> Evans rejected the idea of standing again under any banner.

During the [[Suez Crisis]], Evans broke from the party line and supported the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's policy, which led his local association successfully to press him to resign from Parliament.\n\n==Wartime service==\nEvans was a native of [[Birmingham]] where he went to Harborne Elementary School.<ref name=\"Obituary\">\"Mr Stanley Evans\" (Obituary), ''The Times'', 26 June 1970, p. 10.</ref> His first job after leaving school was in a [[Accountancy|chartered accountants]] firm,<ref name=\"Times Guide 1950\">\"The Times House of Commons 1950\", p. 155.</ref> but in 1915 he left to enlist in the [[Northumberland Hussars]].

IV (Harvester Press, 1981), p. 112.</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nReturning to the West Midlands, Evans established Stanley N. Evans (Birmingham) Ltd, who supplied [[sand]] for [[Molding (process)|mould]]s used in the many [[Casting|cast metal]] [[foundry|foundries]] in the [[Black Country]].<ref name=\"Obituary\" /> Evans was also involved in the publishing industry, being Chairman of Town Crier Publishing Society Ltd.<ref name=\"Stenton and Lees\" /> During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Evans was a road transport organiser employed by the Ministry of War Transport.<ref name=\"Times Guide 1945\">\"The Times House of Commons 1945\", p. 69.</ref>\n\n==Election to Parliament==\nEvans was chosen as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Wednesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Wednesbury]] to follow [[John Banfield]], who died at the end of May 1945 while still in post. At the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] he had no difficulty in being elected, winning a majority of 15,935.<ref name=\"Times Guide 1945\" />\n\nIn his [[maiden speech]] on 22 August 1945, Evans spoke in a debate on the ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]]. He concentrated on the post-war reconstruction and opposed attempts to indict 70,000,000 Germans for the misdeeds of a few.<ref name=\"Maiden speech\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 23 August 1945, p. 8.</ref> In October he criticised the restrictive practices of trade associations in several fields of industry, and urged an investigation into their activities.<ref name=\"Trade associations\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 26 October 1945, p. 8.</ref> His speech drew a protest from [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] Ltd, whom he had singled out.<ref name=\"ICI letter\">\"Combine Prices\", ''The Times'', 1 November 1945, p. 5.</ref> Evans opposed the [[Anglo-American loan]] and the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|Bretton Woods]] agreement.<ref name=\"Dissension\">[[Philip Norton, Baron Norton of Louth|Philip Norton]], \"Dissension in the House of Commons 1945-74\" (Macmillan, 1975), pp. 3, 5.</ref>\n\n==Steel nationalisation==\nEvans was a supporter of economic planning who was very conscious of his origins in the industrial midlands of England; in a debate in February 1946 he declared to laughter and cheers that \"the [[elbow grease]] would be forthcoming from those who had always saved Britain \u2013 the common people, the best bred [[wikt:mongrel|mongrels]] in the world\".<ref name=\"Elbow grease\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 1 March 1946, p. 8.</ref> He distrusted the [[Soviet Union]] for its \"constant stream of vilification, invective and abuse\" directed at the British people,<ref name=\"Soviet abuse\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 24 October 1946, p. 8.</ref> and in June 1947 made an outspoken attack on Soviet domination of Europe led by the \"hermits of the [[Kremlin]]\".<ref name=\"Hermits\">\"'A Great Opportunity For Europe'\", ''The Times'', 20 June 1947, p. 8.</ref>\n\nIn a free vote on [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|abolition of the death penalty]], Evans spoke loudly in support of retaining capital punishment on the grounds that public opinion was not supportive, and reported that the people to whom he spoke were concerned that too many condemned prisoners were being reprieved.<ref name=\"Capital punishment\">\"Suspension Of Death Penalty\", ''The Times'', 15 April 1948, p. 4.</ref> He was also a supporter of the Government's plan to [[nationalisation|nationalise]] the steel industry, which was the most controversial of all its nationalisation proposals.<ref name=\"Steel nationalisation\">\"Aims Of Iron And Steel Bill\", ''The Times'', 16 November 1948, p. 4.</ref> Because of his experience in the industry, Evans was placed on the Standing Committee examining the Bill.\n\n==Ministry of Food==\nEvans was re-elected for Wednesbury at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], his majority almost unchanged on that of 1945 despite a three way fight. In the government reshuffle that followed, he was appointed [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food]]. At his first press conference on 17 March, a fortnight into his job, Evans warned that Britain \"must be careful not to cosset any section of the population at the expense of the community as a whole\". He said the Ministry should consider themselves the representatives of housewives; later Evans had to stress that these were his personal views.<ref name=\"Press conference\">\"Food Supplies Easier\", ''The Times'', 18 March 1950, p. 6.</ref>\n\nHe had a tough debut on the front bench of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 3 April 1950 when he made a statement about [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[sugar]] negotiations. Many Members of Parliament thought that the West Indies had been treated discourteously and the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] [[Herbert Morrison]] had to come to the aid of the junior Food Minister.<ref name=\"Sugar negotiations\">\"Agreements On Empire Sugar\", ''The Times'', 4 April 1950, p. 4.</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\nThe controversy caused by his initial press conference had continued. The [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|National Farmers Union]] had protested and the Minister ([[Maurice Webb (politician)|Maurice Webb]]) had to give an assurance to them that the Ministry would fail if it did not assist food producers. However, Evans was to cause further problems at a press conference in [[Manchester]] on 14 April. He asserted that farmers were provided with guaranteed prices and assured markets at taxpayers' expense, and asked how long it could continue. Evans then went on to claim that subsidies concealed inefficiency and inertia, and commented that \"no other nation feather-beds its agriculture like Britain\".<ref name=\"Featherbedding\">\"Junior Minister Dropped\", ''The Times'', 17 April 1950, p. 4.</ref>\n\n===Dismissal===\nThe National Farmers Unions of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland immediately responded in a joint statement expressing their amazement and giving detailed figures to refute his argument. At this [[Clement Attlee]] asked for Evans' resignation, dismissing him from office after only six weeks. Evans stuck by his opinions even though \"the National Farmers' Unions have my scalp under their belt\".<ref name=\"Featherbedding\" /> He later denied as \"fantastic\" rumours that he intended to resign his Parliamentary seat.<ref name=\"Resignation\">\"Mr. Evans and his Resignation\", ''The Times'', 18 April 1950, p. 4.</ref> On 16 May Evans used a debate on the [[Finance Act|Finance Bill]] to set out a full defence of his charges against agriculture.<ref name=\"Finance Bill debate\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 17 May 1950, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Parliamentary activity==\nEvans opposed the opening of [[Battersea Park]] funfair on Sundays, saying it would cause dismay to millions of people.<ref name=\"Sunday opening\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 29 November 1950, p. 7.</ref> Despite his sacking he paid tribute to Attlee for his statesmanlike diplomacy with the [[United States]] over the [[Korean War]].<ref name=\"Korea\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 15 December 1950, p. 8.</ref> He was a frequent member of Parliamentary delegations to other countries, including that to [[Hungary]] in 1946. In 1951 he led a delegation to [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Nyasaland]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Malta]]. He was also a member of a delegation to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1954.<ref name=\"Stenton and Lees\" />\n\nIn 1953 Evans annoyed his own side by speaking against a Labour amendment on the issue of the [[Central African Federation]]. He agreed with the Conservative government that federation would lead to economic development and would make Central Africa the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr Valley]] of Africa.<ref name=\"Central Africa\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 25 March 1953, p. 3.</ref> He was a cautious supporter of German rearmament, because it would assist in the defence against Soviet expansionism.<ref name=\"German rearmament\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 25 February 1954, p. 3.</ref>\n\n==Attitude toward America==\nThe summer of 1956 saw Evans involved in two controversies, first over the sale of the Trinidad Oil Company to the [[Texaco|Texas Oil Company]],<ref name=\"Trinidad Oil\">\"Changing Views On Oil Deal\", ''The Times'', 14 June 1956, p. 7.</ref> and second over his allegation that the United States was discriminating against British shipping.<ref name=\"Flag discrimination\">\"Discrimination At Sea\" (letter), ''The Times'', 10 July 1956, p. 11.</ref> When speaking at the outbreak of the [[Suez Crisis]], Evans was critical of the lack of American support for what he described as the British crusade against totalitarianism.<ref name=\"Suez opening\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 3 August 1956, p. 6.</ref>\n\n==Suez==\nAs the situation became more grave, Evans pressed Prime Minister [[Anthony Eden]] to withhold military action until Parliament had debated it.<ref name=\"Eden question\">\"Parliament\", ''The Times'', 31 October 1956, p. 4.</ref> When Eden called a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] on 1 November 1956, Evans abstained from voting rather than vote with his party against the Government; he was the only Labour Member of Parliament to break the [[Whip (politics)|whip]] but was not disciplined for his failure to vote.<ref name=\"Abstain\">\"Prime Minister To Broadcast\", ''The Times'', 3 November 1956, p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Constituency discontent===\nHowever, Evans' tacit support for the invasion of Suez caused unrest in his constituency. After several local organisations sent in resolutions strongly condemning his action, the Wednesbury divisional Labour Party called a meeting to discuss his future on 17 November. Evans spoke in defence of his position, but the meeting unanimously passed a resolution calling on Evans to resign his seat. A few days later, Evans complied, also resigning from membership of the Labour Party. He declared that when military action had begun, it was \"against the best interests of the British people to divide the House of Commons while fighting was still in progress\".<ref name=\"Suez resignation\">\"Mr. S.

{"title_page": "KTM West Coast railway line", "text_new": "{{KTM West Coast Line|collapse=yes}}\nThe '''West Coast railway line''' runs from [[Padang Besar railway station]] close to the [[Malaysia\u2013Thailand border]] in [[Perlis]] (where it connects with the [[State Railway of Thailand]]) to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] in [[Singapore]]. It is called the West Coast railway line because it serves the West Coast states of [[Peninsular Malaysia]].\n\nThe 1,151-kilometre line is busier than the [[KTM East Coast Line|East Coast railway line]] because the West Coast railway line handles a variety of passenger train services such as the [[KTM ETS]] services, the [[KTM Intercity]] services, the [[International Express]], the [[KTM Komuter]] in the [[Klang Valley]] and [[Greater Penang Conurbation|Greater Penang]], and freight trains. Of this total length, 759&nbsp;km is double-tracked and electrified.\n\nThe major stations on the line include [[KL Sentral]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Butterworth railway station|Butterworth]] in [[Butterworth, Penang]] and [[Johor Bahru Sentral railway station|JB Sentral]] in the south in [[Johor Bahru]].\n\n==Line network==\n===Main trunk line===\nThe West Coast main trunk line stretches from [[Padang Besar railway station|Padang Besar]] on the [[Malaysia-Thailand border]] to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] in Singapore.\n\nThe main trunk line is double-tracked and [[Railway electrification in Malaysia|electrified]] from Padang Besar to [[Gemas railway station|Gemas]]. From Gemas to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint, the line is single-tracked and not electrified. Loops at stations allow trains to pass. Double tracking and electrification works are currently being carried out. \n\nThe West Coast railway line connects with the State Railway of Thailand at Padang Besar, while the East Coast line branches off at [[Gemas railway station|Gemas]].\n\n===Branch lines===\nThe West Coast railway line includes several branch lines from the main trunk line, namely:\n*Bukit Mertajam Junction to [[Butterworth railway station|Butterworth]]\n*Batu Junction to [[Batu Caves Komuter station|Batu Caves]]\n*Port Klang/Bangsar Junction to [[Port Klang Komuter station|Port Klang]] and [[West Port, Malaysia|Westport]], with further branch lines:\n**[[Subang Jaya station|Subang Jaya]] to [[Terminal Skypark Komuter station|Terminal Skypark]] at the [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport|Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah (Subang) Airport]]\n**[[Port Klang Komuter station|Port Klang]] to Northport\n**Pulau Indah to various Wesport shipping terminals\n*Skudai Junction to the [[Port of Tanjung Pelepas]]\n*[[Kempas Baru railway station|Kempas Baru]] to [[Johor Port|Pasir Gudang]]\n\nThe Bukit Mertajam Junction to [[Butterworth railway station|Butterworth]], Batu Junction to [[Batu Caves Komuter station|Batu Caves]], Port Klang Junction to [[Port Klang Komuter station|Port Klang]] station, as well as the branch lines to [[Terminal Skypark Komuter station|Terminal Skypark]] and Northport are double tracked and electrified. \n\nThe line from [[Port Klang Komuter station|Port Klang]] to Westport and its shipping terminals, as well as the branch lines between Skudai Junction and the [[Port of Tanjung Pelepas]] and the [[Kempas Baru railway station|Kempas Baru]] and [[Johor Port|Pasir Gudang]] are single lines and not electrified.\n\nThere are also branch lines where the tracks exist but are not used for any service or closed are:\n*Between [[Tapah Road railway station|Tapah Road]] and [[Teluk Intan]] (abandoned and not connected to the main line)\n*Between [[Seremban railway station|Seremban]] and [[Port Dickson]]\n<!--*Between [[Tasek railway station|Tasek]] and [[Tanjung Rambutan railway station|Tanjung Rambutan]] To be removed as is a portion of the old main line that was abandoned after double tracking, and not connected to the new main line, never used and meant as branch line compared to Teluk Intan branch line\n  -->\nNone of these disused branch lines are double tracked nor electrified.\n\n===Stations===\n====Main Trunk Line====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"1\"  style=\"margin:auto; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

The line began with the construction of branches linking coastal ports with inland tin mining areas before they were gradually linked up by the main truck line running through the interior of the West Coast states of Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nThe latest new lines to be built were the branch lines to [[West Port, Malaysia|West Port]], [[North Port, Malaysia|North Port]], [[Tanjung Pelepas]], [[Pasir Gudang]] and the [[North Butterworth Container Terminal]]. The trunk line had also seen sections becoming disused, abandoned or even removed, with the latest being the closure and subsequent removal of the southernmost stretch of track between the [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] and {{rws|Tanjong Pagar}} in 2011.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===Gemas\u2013Johor Bahru electrification and double-tracking===\nAfter many years of announcements about the intention to upgrade the final stretch of single track of the West Coast Line, the Government began the public display exercise for the Gemas\u2013Johor Bahru electrification and double-tracking project on 27 October 2015. The public display exercise, required for all development of new railways under Section 84 of Malaysia's Land Public Transport Act 2010, will run until 27 January 2016.\n\nAccording to documents on display to the public, construction is expected to begin in 2016 and be completed in 2021.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mot.gov.my/my/projek-pembangunan/projek-pembangunan-rel/projek-gemas-jb| title=(untitled)| website=Portal Ramsi Kementerian Pengangkutan; Ministry of Transport}} {{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe length of the line to be electrified and double-tracked is 197&nbsp;km between Chainage 563.040 at [[Gemas]] dan Chainage 754.180 at [[Johor Bahru]]. The project includes the construction of 11 stations at {{rws|Segamat}}, {{rws|Genuang}}, {{rws|Labis}}, {{rws|Bekok}}, {{rws|Paloh}}, {{rws|Kluang}}, {{rws|Mengkibol}}, {{rws|Rengam}}, {{rws|Layang-Layang}}, {{rws|Kulai}} and {{rws|Kempas Baru}}, and 3 future stations at {{rws|Tenang}}, {{rws|Chamek}} and {{rws|Senai}}. The upgraded line is supposed to cater for at least 22 services daily involving [[KTM ETS]], [[KTM Intercity]] and shuttle train services.\n\nThe documents displayed also stated that the electrification for the stretch will have the same specifications as that of the Seremban-Gemas stretch, name at 25\u00a0kV AC 50&nbsp;Hz single phase and supplied via an overhead catenary. Train operations for this stretch will be integrated with the Train Control Centres at KL Sentral and Gemas. The design speed for the tracks is 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\nOn 11 December 2015, the Chinese company [[China Railway Construction Company]] (CRCC) has been awarded to build the Gemas\u2013Johor Bahru electrification and double-tracking project.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Rail transport in Malaysia}}\n{{Klang Valley train stations}}\n{{Kunming\u2013Singapore railway}}\n\n{{coord missing|Malaysia}}\n\n[[Category:railway lines in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Metre gauge railways in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:railway lines opened in 1885]]\n[[Category:1885 establishments in British Malaya]]\n", "text_old": "{{KTM West Coast Line|collapse=yes}}\nThe '''West Coast railway line''' runs from [[Padang Besar railway station]] close to the [[Malaysia\u2013Thailand border]] in [[Perlis]] (where it connects with the [[State Railway of Thailand]]) to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] in [[Singapore]]. It is called the West Coast railway line because it serves the West Coast states of [[Peninsular Malaysia]].\n\nThe 1,151-kilometre line is busier than the [[KTM East Coast Line|East Coast railway line]] because the West Coast railway line handles a variety of passenger train services such as the [[KTM ETS]] services, the [[KTM Intercity]] services, the [[International Express]], the [[KTM Komuter]] in the [[Klang Valley]] and [[Greater Penang Conurbation|Greater Penang]], and freight trains. Of this total length, 759&nbsp;km is double-tracked and electrified.\n\nThe major stations on the line include [[KL Sentral]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Butterworth railway station|Butterworth]] in [[Butterworth, Penang]] and [[Johor Bahru Sentral railway station|JB Sentral]] in the south in [[Johor Bahru]].\n\n==Line network==\n===Main trunk line===\nThe West Coast main trunk line stretches from [[Padang Besar railway station|Padang Besar]] on the [[Malaysia-Thailand border]] to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] in Singapore.\n\nThe main trunk line is double-tracked and [[Railway electrification in Malaysia|electrified]] from Padang Besar to [[Gemas railway station|Gemas]]. From Gemas to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint, the line is single-tracked and not electrified. Loops at stations allow trains to pass. Double tracking and electrification works are currently being carried out. \n\nThe West Coast railway line connects with the State Railway of Thailand at Padang Besar, while the East Coast line branches off at [[Gemas railway station|Gemas]].\n\n===Branch lines===\nThe West Coast railway line includes several branch lines from the main trunk line, namely:\n*Bukit Mertajam Junction to [[Butterworth railway station|Butterworth]]\n*Batu Junction to [[Batu Caves Komuter station|Batu Caves]]\n*Port Klang/Bangsar Junction to [[Port Klang Komuter station|Port Klang]] and [[West Port,

Komuter station|Batu Caves]], Port Klang Junction to [[Port Klang Komuter station|Port Klang]] station, as well as the branch lines to [[Terminal Skypark Komuter station|Terminal Skypark]] and Northport are double tracked and electrified. \n\nThe line from [[Port Klang Komuter station|Port Klang]] to Westport and its shipping terminals, as well as the branch lines between Skudai Junction and the [[Port of Tanjung Pelepas]] and the [[Kempas Baru railway station|Kempas Baru]] and [[Johor Port|Pasir Gudang]] are single lines and not electrified.\n\nThere are also branch lines where the tracks exist but are not used for any service or closed are:\n*Between [[Tapah Road railway station|Tapah Road]] and [[Teluk Intan]] (abandoned and not connected to the main line)\n*Between [[Seremban railway station|Seremban]] and [[Port Dickson]]\n<!--*Between [[Tasek railway station|Tasek]] and [[Tanjung Rambutan railway station|Tanjung Rambutan]] To be removed as is a portion of the old main line that was abandoned after double tracking, and not connected to the new main line, never used and meant as branch line compared to Teluk Intan branch line\n  -->\nNone of these disused branch lines are double tracked nor electrified.\n\n===Stations===\n====Main Trunk Line====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"1\"  style=\"margin:auto; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!

The line began with the construction of branches linking coastal ports with inland tin mining areas before they were gradually linked up by the main truck line running through the interior of the West Coast states of Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nThe latest new lines to be built were the branch lines to [[West Port, Malaysia|West Port]], [[North Port, Malaysia|North Port]], [[Tanjung Pelepas]], [[Pasir Gudang]] and the [[North Butterworth Container Terminal]]. The trunk line had also seen sections becoming disused, abandoned or even removed, with the latest being the closure and subsequent removal of the southernmost stretch of track between the [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] and {{rws|Tanjong Pagar}} in 2011.\n\n==Projects==\n\n===Gemas\u2013Johor Bahru electrification and double-tracking===\nAfter many years of announcements about the intention to upgrade the final stretch of single track of the West Coast Line, the Government began the public display exercise for the Gemas\u2013Johor Bahru electrification and double-tracking project on 27 October 2015. The public display exercise, required for all development of new railways under Section 84 of Malaysia's Land Public Transport Act 2010, will run until 27 January 2016.\n\nAccording to documents on display to the public, construction is expected to begin in 2016 and be completed in 2021.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mot.gov.my/my/projek-pembangunan/projek-pembangunan-rel/projek-gemas-jb| title=(untitled)| website=Portal Ramsi Kementerian Pengangkutan; Ministry of Transport}} {{dead link|date=November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe length of the line to be electrified and double-tracked is 197&nbsp;km between Chainage 563.040 at [[Gemas]] dan Chainage 754.180 at [[Johor Bahru]]. The project includes the construction of 11 stations at {{rws|Segamat}}, {{rws|Genuang}}, {{rws|Labis}}, {{rws|Bekok}}, {{rws|Paloh}}, {{rws|Kluang}}, {{rws|Mengkibol}}, {{rws|Rengam}}, {{rws|Layang-Layang}}, {{rws|Kulai}} and {{rws|Kempas Baru}}, and 3 future stations at {{rws|Tenang}}, {{rws|Chamek}} and {{rws|Senai}}. The upgraded line is supposed to cater for at least 22 services daily involving [[KTM ETS]], [[KTM Intercity]] and shuttle train services.\n\nThe documents displayed also stated that the electrification for the stretch will have the same specifications as that of the Seremban-Gemas stretch, name at 25\u00a0kV AC 50&nbsp;Hz single phase and supplied via an overhead catenary. Train operations for this stretch will be integrated with the Train Control Centres at KL Sentral and Gemas. The design speed for the tracks is 160&nbsp;km/h.\n\nOn 11 December 2015, the Chinese company [[China Railway Construction Company]] (CRCC) has been awarded to build the Gemas\u2013Johor Bahru electrification and double-tracking project.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Rail transport in Malaysia}}\n{{Klang Valley train stations}}\n{{Kunming\u2013Singapore railway}}\n\n{{coord missing|Malaysia}}\n\n[[Category:railway lines in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Metre gauge railways in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:railway lines opened in 1885]]\n[[Category:1885 establishments in British Malaya]]\n", "name_user": "Draco97", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTM_West_Coast_railway_line"}
