It existed for two separate periods: from 1295 to 1832, and from 1885 to 1918.\n\nAppleby was enfranchised as [[parliamentary borough]] in 1295, and abolished by the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832.  It returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) using the [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc vote]] system. It was represented in the [[House of Commons of England]] until [[Acts of Union 1707|1707]], in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]] from 1707 to 1800, and finally in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] from 1801 to 1832. Its best-known MP was [[William Pitt the Younger]] who became [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister]] in 1783 at the age of 24.\n\nFor the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]] the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|Redistribution of Seats Act]] created a [[county constituency]] of the same name, which returned a single MP elected by the [[first-past-the-post]] system. The county constituency was abolished at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===The borough (1295\u20131832)===\nThe [[parliamentary borough]] of Appleby consisted of the town of [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]], the county town of [[Westmorland]], and was consistently represented in the House of Commons from the [[Model Parliament]] of 1295 until the Reform Act.<ref name = HOP1386>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1386\u20131421)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1422>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/research/constituencies/constituencies-1422-1504 | title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1422\u20131504)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }} (currently unavailable)</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1509>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1509\u20131558)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1558>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/constituencies/appleby\n| title=Appleby\n | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1558\u20131603)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1604>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/constituencies/appleby\n| title=Appleby\n | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1604\u20131629)| accessdate = 27 March 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1640>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/research/constituencies/constituencies-1640-1660 | title= Appleby  \n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1640\u20131660)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}(currently unavailable )</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1660>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1660\u20131690)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1690>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/constituencies/appleby\n| title=Appleby\n | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1690\u20131715)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1715>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1715\u20131754)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1754>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/constituencies/appleby\n | title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1754\u20131790)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1790>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1790\u20131820)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1820>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1820\u20131832)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe right to vote rested with the occupiers of around a hundred [[burgage]] tenements. By the 18th century, the majority of the burgages were owned by the [[Earl of Lonsdale|Lowther]] and [[Earl of Thanet|Tufton]] families, which enabled them to put in reliable tenants at election time and ensure their complete control of who was elected. The seats were frequently kept for members of those families, but Appleby's other representatives included [[William Pitt the younger]], who was MP for Appleby when he became [[Prime Minister]] in 1783 (although he stood down at the following general election when he was instead elected for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]]).\n\nA later member for Appleby was [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]], subsequently (as Earl Grey) the Prime Minister whose administration passed the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832; but Grey's history as a former MP for the town did not save it from losing both its members under the Act. Appleby was regarded as a classic example of a [[pocket borough]], completely in the control of its owners who were also the major local landowners, and with a population of only 1,233 at the 1831 census unlikely to be freed from their influence even by widening the franchise. Nevertheless, as the only county town to be disfranchised, Appleby was one of the more controversial cases in the debates on the reform bill, the opposition making unsuccessful attempts to amend the bill so as to save at least one of its MPs.\n\nAfter abolition the borough was absorbed into the [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] county constituency.\n\n===The county constituency (1885\u20131918)===\nThe Appleby constituency created for the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 election]] was, in full, '''\"The Appleby or Northern Division of Westmorland\"''', and was sometimes referred to as Westmorland North. It consisted of the whole of the northern half of the county, including the towns of [[Ambleside]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] and [[Kirkby Stephen]]. It was abolished at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], the whole county henceforth being united in a single [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] constituency.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1295\u20131660===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!First member!!Second member\n|-\n|1382|| [[William

It existed for two separate periods: from 1295 to 1832, and from 1885 to 1918.\n\nAppleby was enfranchised as [[parliamentary borough]] in 1295, and abolished by the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832.  It returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) using the [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc vote]] system. It was represented in the [[House of Commons of England]] until [[Acts of Union 1707|1707]], in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain]] from 1707 to 1800, and finally in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] from 1801 to 1832. Its best-known MP was [[William Pitt the Younger]] who became [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|Prime Minister]] in 1783 at the age of 24.\n\nFor the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]] the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|Redistribution of Seats Act]] created a [[county constituency]] of the same name, which returned a single MP elected by the [[first-past-the-post]] system. The county constituency was abolished at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===The borough (1295-1832)===\nThe [[parliamentary borough]] of Appleby consisted of the town of [[Appleby-in-Westmorland|Appleby]], the county town of [[Westmorland]], and was consistently represented in the House of Commons from the [[Model Parliament]] of 1295 until the Reform Act.<ref name = HOP1386>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1386-1421)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1422>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/research/constituencies/constituencies-1422-1504 | title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1422-1504)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }} (currently unavailable)</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1509>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1509-1558)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1558>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/constituencies/appleby\n| title=Appleby\n | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1558-1603)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1604>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/constituencies/appleby\n| title=Appleby\n | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1604-1629)| accessdate = 27 March 2019}}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1640>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/research/constituencies/constituencies-1640-1660 | title= Appleby  \n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1640-1660)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}(currently unavailable )</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1660>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1660-1690)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1690>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/constituencies/appleby\n| title=Appleby\n | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1690-1715)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1715>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1715-1754)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1754>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/constituencies/appleby\n | title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1754-1790)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1790>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1790-1820)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref name = HOP1820>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1820-1832/constituencies/appleby\n| title= Appleby\n| publisher= History of Parliament Online (1820-1832)| accessdate = 27 March 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe right to vote rested with the occupiers of around a hundred [[burgage]] tenements. By the 18th century, the majority of the burgages were owned by the [[Earl of Lonsdale|Lowther]] and [[Earl of Thanet|Tufton]] families, which enabled them to put in reliable tenants at election time and ensure their complete control of who was elected. The seats were frequently kept for members of those families, but Appleby's other representatives included [[William Pitt the younger]], who was MP for Appleby when he became [[Prime Minister]] in 1783 (although he stood down at the following general election when he was instead elected for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]]).\n\nA later member for Appleby was [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]], subsequently (as Earl Grey) the Prime Minister whose administration passed the [[Great Reform Act]] of 1832; but Grey's history as a former MP for the town did not save it from losing both its members under the Act. Appleby was regarded as a classic example of a [[pocket borough]], completely in the control of its owners who were also the major local landowners, and with a population of only 1,233 at the 1831 census unlikely to be freed from their influence even by widening the franchise. Nevertheless, as the only county town to be disfranchised, Appleby was one of the more controversial cases in the debates on the reform bill, the opposition making unsuccessful attempts to amend the bill so as to save at least one of its MPs.\n\nAfter abolition the borough was absorbed into the [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] county constituency.\n\n===The county constituency (1885-1918)===\nThe Appleby constituency created for the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 election]] was, in full, '''\"The Appleby or Northern Division of Westmorland\"''', and was sometimes referred to as Westmorland North. It consisted of the whole of the northern half of the county, including the towns of [[Ambleside]], [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] and [[Kirkby Stephen]]. It was abolished at the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], the whole county henceforth being united in a single [[Westmorland (UK Parliament constituency)|Westmorland]] constituency.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1295\u20131660===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!First member!!Second member\n|-\n|1382|| [[William
