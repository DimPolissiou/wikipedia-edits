Paulsen's drum was confiscated in Vads\u00f8 in 1691, while the Bindal drum was bought by a museum official in 1925; [[Vads\u00f8]] and [[Bindal]] being in opposite corners of the Sami world. Paulsens's drum has a typical Northern S\u00e1mi pattern, with several separate levels representing the different layers of spiritual worlds. The Bindal drum has a typical Southern Sami decoration: a [[rhombus]] shaped sun symbol in the center, with other symbols around the sun, representing people, animals, landscape and deities.}}\n\nA '''S\u00e1mi drum''' is a shamanic [[ceremonial drum]] used by the [[S\u00e1mi people]] of Northern Europe. S\u00e1mi ceremonial drums have two chiefly two variations, both [[oval-shaped]]: a bowl drum in which the [[drumhead]] is strapped over a [[burl]], and a [[frame drum]] in which the drumhead stretches over a thin ring of [[bentwood]]. The drumhead is fashioned from reindeer [[Hide (skin)|hide]].\n\nIn [[S\u00e1mi shamanism]], the ''[[noaidi]]'' used the drum to get into a trance, or to obtain information from the future or other realms. The drum was held in one hand, and beaten with the other. While the ''noaidi'' was in trance, his \"free spirit\" was said to leave his body to visit the spiritual world. When applied for [[divination]] purposes, the drum was beaten together with a drum hammer and a ''vuorbi'' ('index' or 'pointer') made of brass or horn. Messages could be interpreted based on where the vuorbi stopped on the membrane, and at which symbols.\n\nThe patterns on the drum membrane reflect the [[worldview]] of the owner and his family, both in religious and worldly matters, such as reindeer herding, hunting, householding as well as relations to their neighbours and to the non-S\u00e1mi community.\n\nMany drums were taken out of their use and S\u00e1mi ownership during the 18th century. A large number of drums were confiscated by S\u00e1mi missionaries and other officials as a part of an intensified Christian mission towards the S\u00e1mi. Other drums were bought by collectors. Between 70 and 80 drums are preserved; the largest collection of drums is at the [[Nordic Museum]] reserves in Stockholm.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Lapponia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johannes Schefferus|Schefferus]]' ''Lapponia'' (1673) is an early source to S\u00e1mi culture and religion]]\n[[File:Sami drum from lule lappmark bottom.jpg|thumb|upright|Lule S\u00e1mi bowl drum]]\n[[File:Freavnantjahke gievrie Koch 2005 04.TIF|thumb|upright|Frame drum (''freavnantjahke gievrie'') with cords]]\nThe [[Northern S\u00e1mi]] terms are ''goavddis'', ''gobdis'' and ''meavrresg\u00e1rri'', while the [[Lule S\u00e1mi language|Lule S\u00e1mi]] and [[Southern S\u00e1mi language|Southern S\u00e1mi]] terms are ''goabdes''  and ''gievrie'', respectively. {{lang-no|runebomme}}, {{lang-sv|n\u00e5jdtrumma}};<ref>Anonymous 1723/1903</ref> In English it is also known as a rune drum or S\u00e1mi shamanic drum.<ref>Liv Helene Willumsen.

First the drums themselves, and what might be interpreted from them. Secondly the reports and treatises on S\u00e1mi topics during the 17th and 18th centuries, written by Swedish and Dano-Norwegian priests, missionaries or other civil servants, like Johannes Schefferus. The third category are statements from Saami themselves, given to court or other official representatives.<ref name=\"R07\"/><ref>[http://www.love.is/roald/kildeskrifter.html Kildetyper]at Roald E.

Here is mentioned a drum with symbols of marine animals, a boat, reindeer and snowshoes. There is also a description of a shaman healing an apparently dead woman by moving his spirit into a whale.<ref name=\"histno\">[http://www.love.is/roald/histnorvegia.htm \"Finnene\", from ''Historia Norvegi\u00e6'']</ref> [[Peder Clauss\u00f8n Friis]] describes a noaidi spirit leaving the body in his ''Norriges oc omliggende \u00d8ers sandf\u00e6rdige Bescriffuelse'' (1632). The oldest description by a S\u00e1mi was made by Anders Huitlok of the Pite S\u00e1mi in 1642 [[:File:S\u00e1mi mythology shaman drum Samisk mytologi schamantrumma 005.png|about this drum that he owned.]] Anders also made a drawing; his story was written down by the German-Swedish bergmeister Hans P.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) rumours were spread that the swedes won their battles with the help of S\u00e1mi witchcraft.<ref name=\"AWJEU\">Westman and Utsi 1998</ref> Such rumours were part of the background for the research that lead to [[Johannes Schefferus]]' book ''[[Lapponia (book)|Lapponia]]'', published in Latin in 1673.<ref>[http://www.ub.uit.no/northernlights/eng/schefferus.htm Johannes Schefferus (1621-1679) in the Web exhibit The Northern Lights Route], Troms\u00f8 University Library, 1999</ref> As preparations to Schefferus' a number of \"clergy correspondences\" (\"pr\u00e4strelationer\") was written by vicars within the S\u00e1mi districts in Sweden.

Authors were [[Hans Skanke]], [[Jens Kildal]], [[Isaac Olsen]], and Johan Randulf (the ''[[N\u00e6r\u00f8y manuscript]]''). These books were part instructions for the missionaries and their co-workers, and part a documentation intended for the government in Copenhagen. Late books within this tradition are [[Pehr H\u00f6gstr\u00f6m]]'s ''Beskrifning \u00d6fwer de til Sweriges Krona lydande Lapmarker'' (1747)<ref>[http://runeberg.org/lapmarker/ Beskrifning \u00f6fwer de til Sweriges Krona lydande Lapmarker]; fulltext at Runeberg.org</ref> in Sweden and [[Knud Leem]]'s ''Beskrivelse over Finmarkens Lapper'' (1767) in Denmark-Norway. And especially [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius|L\u00e6stadius]]' ''[[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]]'' (1839\u201345), which both discusses earlier treatises with an critical approach, and builds upon L\u00e6stadius' own experience.\n\n== The shape of the drums ==\n\n=== Wood ===\nThe drums are always oval; the exact shape of the oval would vary with the wood. The remaining drums are of four different types, within two main groups: bowl drums and frame drums.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/>  \n# Bowl drums, where the wood consists of a [[burl]] shaped into a bowl. The burl usually comes from [[pine]], but sometimes from [[Picea abies|spruce]]. The membrane is attached to the wood with a sinew. \n# Frame drums are shaped by [[Heat bending of wood|wet or heat bending]]; the wood is usually pine, and the membrane is sewed to holes in the frame with a sinew. \n# Ring drums are made from a naturally grown piece of pine wood. There is only one known drum of this type. \n# Angular cut frame drums are made from one piece of wood cut from a three. To bend the wood into an oval, angular cuts are made both in the bottom and the side of the frame. Only two such drums are preserved, both from [[Kemi S\u00e1mi language|Kemi S\u00e1mi]] districts in Finland. The partly preserved [[:File:Runebomme fra Bj\u00f8rsvik Nordfold Steigen.jpg|drum from Bj\u00f8rsvik]] in Nordland is also an angular cut frame drum.\n\nIn his major work on S\u00e1mi drums, ''Die lappische Zaubertrommel'',<ref name=\"M38\">Manker 1938</ref> [[Ernst Manker]] lists 41 frame drums, one ring drum, two angular cut frame drums and 27 bowl drums. Given this numbers, many tend to divide the drums into the two main groups bowl drums and frame drums, seeing the others as variations. Judged by these remaining drums and their known provenance, frame drums seem to be common in the Southern S\u00e1mi areas, and bowl drums seem to be common in the Northern S\u00e1mi areas. The bowl drum is sometimes regarded as a local adjustment of the basic drum type, this being the frame drum.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> The frame drum type has most resemblance to other [[ceremonial drum]]s used by [[indigenous peoples of Siberia]].<ref name=\"RKHR\"/>\n\n=== The membrane and its symbols ===\n[[File:Sami drum distribution of types geography.svg|thumb|350px|A regional typology of drum patterns, with some variations used by [[K.B.

Lars Olsen, who described his uncle's drum, the [[Bindal drum]], in 1885, said that the hide usually was taken from the neck of a calf because of its proper thickness; the sex of the calf was probably not important, according to Olsen.<ref name=\"LP10\">Pareli 2010</ref> The symbols were painted with a paste made from [[alder]]bark.<ref name=\"AS12\"/><ref name=\"M38\"/>\n\nThe motives on a drum reflect the [[worldview]] of the owner and his family, both in terms of religious beliefs and in their modes of subsistence.<ref name=\"AW01\">Westman 2001</ref> A fictitious world is depicted by images of reindeer, both domesticated and wild, and of carnivorous predators that pose a threat to the flock. The modes of subsistence are presented by scenes of wild game hunting, boats with fishing nets, and reindeer herding. Additional scenery on the drum consist of mountains, lakes, people, deities, as well as the camp site with tents and storages houses. Symbols of alien civilization, such as churches and houses, represent the threats from the surrounding and expanding non-S\u00e1mi community.<ref name=\"AWJEU\"/><ref>Original Swedish quote: \"{{lang|se|Trummans figurer visar den v\u00e4rld man r\u00f6rde sig i.

The Lule S\u00e1mi drum reflects an owner who found his mode of subsistence chiefly through hunting, rather than herding.\n\nA typhology{{typo help inline|reason=similar to typhlology|date=November 2019}} based on the structure of the patterns can be divided into three main categories:<ref name=\"RKHR\"/>\n# Southern S\u00e1mi, characterized by the rhombus shaped sun cross in the center\n# Central S\u00e1mi, where the membrane is divided in two by a horizontal line, often with a sun symbol in the lower section\n# Northern S\u00e1mi, where the membrane is divided by horizontal lines into three or five separate levels representing the different layers of spiritual worlds: heavens, the world of the living and an underworld.\n\nIn Manker's overview of 71 known drums, there are 42 Southern S\u00e1mi drums, 22 Central S\u00e1mi drums and seven Northern S\u00e1mi drums.<ref name=\"M38\"/>\n\nThe [[Bindal drum]] is a typical Southern S\u00e1mi drum, with the sun symbol in center. Its last owner also explained that the symbols on the membrane were organized in four directions, according to the [[cardinal direction]]s around the sun. South is described as the summer side or the direction of life, and contains symbols for the S\u00e1mi's life in the fell during summer: the ''[[goahti]]'', the storehouse or ''njalla'', the flock of reindeer, and the pastures. North is described as the side of death, and contains symbols for sickness, death and wickedness.<ref name=\"LP10\">Pareli 2010</ref>\n\nKjellstr\u00f6m and Rydving have summed up the symbols of the drums in these categories: nature, reindeer, bears, moose, other mammals (wolf, beaver, small fur animals), birds, fishes, hunting, fishing, reindeer herding, the camp site \u2013 with goahti, njalla and other storehouses, the non-S\u00e1mi village \u2013 often represented by the church, people, communications (skiing, reindeer with [[pulk]], boats), and deities and their world. Sometimes even the use of the drum itself is depicted.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/><ref>The private website thuleia.com has an overview of [http://www.thuleia.com/shamandrum.html Shaman\u00b4s drum symbols in Scandinavia], slightly different from Kjellstr\u00f6m and Rydving categories.</ref>\n\nThe reindeer herding is mainly depicted with a circular symbol for the [[Animal pound|pound]] that was used to gather, mark and milk the flock. This symbol is found on 75% of the Southern S\u00e1mi drums, but not on any northern or eastern drums.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> The symbol for the pound is always placed in the lower half of the drum. Reindeer are represented as singular line figures, as fully modeled figures or by their antlers.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> The camp site is usually shown as a triangle symbolizing the tent/goahti.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> The S\u00e1mi storehouse (''njalla'') is depicted on many drums from different areas. The ''njalla'' is a small house in [[bear cache]] style, built on top of a cut tree. It is usually depicted with its ladder in front.\n\n[[S\u00e1mi religion|S\u00e1mi deities]] are shown on several drum membranes. These are the high god ''R\u00e1\u00f0\u00f0i'', the [[demiurge]] and [[God the Sustainer|sustainer]] ''[[Waralden Olmai|Varaldi olmmai]]'', the thunder and fertility god ''[[Horagalles|Horagallis]]'', the weather god ''[[Bieggolmai|Bieggolmm\u00e1i]]'', the hunting god ''[[Lieaibolmmai|Leaibolmm\u00e1i]]'', the sun god ''[[Beaivi]]'' / ''Biejjie'', the  [[Akka (spirit)|mother goddesses]] ''M\u00e1ttar\u00e1hkk\u00e1'', ''S\u00e1r\u00e1hkk\u00e1'', ''Juoks\u00e1hkk\u00e1'' og ''Uks\u00e1hkk\u00e1'', the riding ''[[Ruohtta|Ruto]]'' who brought sickness and death, and ''J\u00e1bme\u00e1hkk\u00e1'' \u2013 the empress of the death realms.\n\nSome matters from the non-S\u00e1mi world also appears on several drums. These are interpreted as attempts to understand and master the new impulses brought into the S\u00e1mi society.<ref name=\"AW01\"/> Churches, houses and horses appear on several drums, and drums from [[Tornetr\u00e4sk|Torne]] and [[Kemi]] districts show both the city, the church and the ''lapp commissary''.<ref name=\"AW01\"/>\n\nInterpretation of the drum symbols might be difficult, and there are given different explanations to some of the symbols. There has often been assumed that the S\u00e1mi deliberately gave wrong explanations when they presented their drums to missionaries and other Christian audiences, in order to reduce the impression of heathenry and underline the Christian impact of Sami culture.<ref>Liv Helene Willumsen. ''D\u00f8mt til ild og b\u00e5l, trolldomsprosessene i Skottland og Finnmark''. Orkana forlag, 2013. 978-82-8104-203-2. Chapter on [[Anders Paulsen]], pages 336-353</ref><ref name=\"M50\">Manker 1950</ref> There is also an opposite assumption that some of the symbols has been overinterpreted as religious motives while they actually represented matters from timely, everyday life.\n\nH\u00e5kan Rydving have evaluated the drum symbols from a perspective of source criticism, and divides them into four categories:<ref name=\"R07\"/>\n# Preserved drums that were explained by their owners. These are only two drums: [[Anders Paulsen]]'s drum and the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]].\n# Preserved drums that were explained by other people, contemporary to the owners. These are five drums, four Southern Sami and one Ume Sami. \n# Lost drums that were explained by contemporary, either the owner or other people. These are four drums.\n# Preserved drums without a contemporary explanation. These are the majority of the 70 known drums.\n\nRydving and Kjellstr\u00f6m have demonstrated that both [[:File:S\u00e1mi mythology shaman drum Samisk mytologi schamantrumma 008.png|Olov Graan's drum]] fra Lycksele<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> and the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]]<ref name=\"R07\">Rydving 2007</ref> have been ''spiritualized'' through [[Ernst Manker|Manker]]'s interpretations: When the explanations are compared, it appears as if Graan relates the symbols to householding and modes of subsistence, where Manker sees deities and spirits. This underlines the problems of interpretation.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> Symbols that Graan explains as snowy weather, a ship, rain and squirrels in the trees, are interpreted by Manker as the wind god Bieggolmai/Biegk\u00e5lmaj, a boat sacrifice, a weather god and \u2013 among other suggestions \u2013 as a forest spirit.<ref name=\"R07\"/> At the Freavnantjahke gievrie there is a symbol explained by the owner as \"a Sami riding in his pulk behind his reindeer\", while Manker suggests that \"this might be an ordinary sleigh ride, but we might as well assume that this is the noaidi, the drum owner, going on an important errand into the spiritual world\". On the other hand, one might suggest that the owner of the Freavnantjahke gievrie, Bendik Andersen, is under-communicating the spiritual content of the drum when the symbols usually recognized as the three mother goddesses are explained as \"men guarding the reindeer\".\n\n=== Accessories ===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center|| width = 120 | image1 = Sami rune drum hammer history museum Oslo.jpg | image2 = Viser til runebomme fra J\u00e5mafjell.jpg | footer = The drum hammer from Rendalen (left) has a typical, symmetric T-shape.<ref>[http://www.khm.uio.no/om/tjenester/foto/presse/bilder-yngre-jernalder/Cf21939_12_C26831a_HM.jpg?vrtx=view-as-webpage Hammer til runebomme fra Nordset, Rendalen, Hedmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113142635/http://www.khm.uio.no/om/tjenester/foto/presse/bilder-yngre-jernalder/Cf21939_12_C26831a_HM.jpg?vrtx=view-as-webpage |date=2013-11-13 }}; at Kulturhistorisk museum, Oslo</ref> This hammer from the 11th century is regarded an indicator for early S\u00e1mi presence in southern Norway.<ref name=\"LP91\">Leif Pareli. \"Runebommehammeren fra Rendalen: Et minne etter samer i S\u00f8r-Norge i middelalderen?\".

The ''vuorbi'' was used for divination.\n\nThe cords are leather straps nailed or tied to the frame or to the bottom of the drum. They had pieces of bone or metal tied to them. The owner of the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]], Bendix Andersen Fr\u00f8yningsfjell, explained to [[Thomas von Westen]] in 1723 that the leather straps and their decorations of tin, bone and brass were offers of gratitude to the drum, given by the owner as a response to luck gained from the drum's instructions.<ref name=\"Q1903\">Anonymous in Qvigstad 1903</ref> The frame of the Freavnantjahke gievrie also had 11 tin nails in it, in a cross shape.

Drums are now used both as a musical instrument and as a symbol of S\u00e1mi identity.]]\nErnst Manker summarized the use of the drum, regarding both trance and divination:<ref>Manker 1938/1950; as quoted by Kjellstr\u00f6m & Rydving 1998</ref>\n* before use, the membrane was tightened by holding the drum close to the fire \n* the user stood on his knees, or sat with his legs crossed, holding the drum in his left hand\n* the [[vuorbi]] was placed on the membrane, either on a fixed place or randomly\n* the hammer was held in the right hand; the membrane was hit either with one of the hammer heads, or with the flat side of the hammer\n* the drumming started at slow pace, and grew wilder\n* if the drummer fell into trance, his drum was placed upon him, with the painted membrane facing downwards\n* the way of the vuorbi across the membrane, and the places where it stopped, was interpreted as significant\n\n[[Samuel Rheen]], who was a priest in [[Kvikkjokk]] 1664\u20131671, was one of the first to write about S\u00e1mi religion. His impression was that many S\u00e1mi, but not all, used the drum for divination. Rheen mentioned four matters in which the drum could give answers:\n# to seek knowledge about how things were at other places\n# to seek knowledge about luck, misfortune, health, and illness\n# to cure diseases\n# to learn what deity one should sacrifice unto\nOf these four ways of use mentioned by Rheen, one knows from other sources that the first of them was only performed by the noaidi.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> Based on the sources, one might get the impression that the use of the drum was gradually \"democratized\", so that there in some regions there was a drum in each household, that the father of the household could seek to for advice.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> Yet, the most original use of the drum \u2013 getting into trance, seem to have been a speciality for the noaidi.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/>\n\nSources seem to agree that in Southern S\u00e1mi districts in the 18th century, each household had its own drum. These were mostly used for divination purposes.<ref name=\"RK12\">Kristensen 2012</ref> The types and structure of motives on the Southern S\u00e1mi drums confirm a use for divination. On the other hand, the structure of the Northern S\u00e1mi drum motives, with its hierarchical structure of spiritual worlds, represent a mythological universe it which it was the noaidi's privilege to wander.<ref name=\"AW01\"/><ref name=\"RK12\"/>\n\nThe drum was usually brought along during nomadic wanderings. There are also known some cases where the drum was hidden close to one of the regulars' campsites. Inside the [[lavvu]] and the [[goahti]], the drum was always placed in the ''boa\u0161\u0161u'', the space behind the fireplace that was considered the \"holy room\" within the goahti.<ref name=\"AS12\"/>\n\nSeveral of the contemporary sources describe a duality in the view of the drums: They were seen both as an occult device, and as a divination tool for practical purposes.<ref name=\"\u00c5VK07\"/> Drums were inherited. Among those who owned drums in the 18th century, not all of them described themselves as active users of their drum. At least that was what they said when the drums were confiscated.<ref name=\"\u00c5VK07\"/>\n\nThere is no known evidence that the drum or the noaidi had any role in child birth or funeral rituals.<ref name=\"AW01\"/>\n\nSome sources suggest that the drum was manufactured with the aid of secret rituals. However, Manker<ref name=\"M38\"/> made a photo documentary describing the process of manufacturing the physical drum. Selection of motives for the membrane, or the philosophy behind it, are not described in any sources. It is known that the inauguration of the drum where done by rituals that involved the whole household.\n\n=== In trance ===\nThe ''noaidi'' used the drum to achieve a state of trance. He hit the drum with an intense rhythm until he came into a sort of trance or sleep. While in this sleep, his free spirit could travel into the spiritual worlds, or to other places in the material world. The episode mentioned in ''Historia Norvegi\u00e6'' tells about a ''noaidi'' who traveled to the spiritual world and fought against enemy spirits in order to heal the sick.<ref name=\"histno\"/> In the writings of [[Peder Clauss\u00f8n Friis]] (1545\u20131614) there is described a S\u00e1mi in Bergen who could supposedly [[Astral projection|travel in the material world while he was in trance]]: A S\u00e1mi named Jakob made his spiritual journey to Germany to learn about the health of a [[Hanseatic League|German merchant's]] family.<ref>[http://www.love.is/roald/friis.htm Excerpt from ''Norriges oc omliggende \u00d8ers sandf\u00e6rdige Bescriffuelse''] (1632) at Roald E. Kristiansen's website ''Samisk religion''.</ref>\n\nBoth [[Nicolai Lundius]] (ca 1670), [[Isaac Olsen]] (1717) and [[Jens Kildal]] (ca. 1730) describe noaidis traveling to the spiritual worlds where they negotiated with the death spirits, especially ''J\u00e1bme\u00e1hkka'' \u2013 the ruler of the death realms, about the health and life of people.<ref name=\"AW01\"/> This journey involved a risk for the noaidis own life and health.<ref name=\"AWJEU\"/>\n\n=== Divination and fortune ===\nIn the writings of both [[Samuel Rheen]] and Isaac Olsen the drum is mentioned as a part of the preparations for bear hunt.<ref name=\"HM07\"/><ref name=\"AW01\"/> Rheen says that the noaidi could give information about hunting fortune, while Olsen suggests that the noaidi was able to manipulate the bear to move into hunting range. The noaidi \u2013 or drum owner \u2013 was a member of the group of hunters, following close to the spear bearer. The noaidi also sat at a prominent place during the feast after the hunting.<ref name=\"AW01\"/><ref>Ragnhild Myrstad (1996).

(''Stensilserie B''; 46)</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]]'' (1840\u201345), [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius]] writes that the S\u00e1mi used his drum as an Oracle, and consulted it when something important came up. \"Just like any other kind of [[fortune-telling]] with cards or [[dowsing]]. One should not consider every drum owner a magician.\"<ref>As quoted by Mebius 2007</ref> A common practice was to let the ''vuorbi'' move across the membrane, visiting the different symbols.

([http://www.samikopiija.org/govat/doc/art_aas.pdf pdf])</ref> Such practices are described for the [[Bindal drum]], the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]] and the [[Velfjord drum]].\n\n=== Women ===\nWhether women were allowed to use the drum has been discussed, but no consensus has been reached. On the one hand, some sources say that women were not even allowed to touch the drum,<ref name=\"LP10\"/> and during migration, women should follow another route than the sleigh that carried the drum.<ref name=\"AW01\"/> On the other hand, the whole family was involved in the initiation of the drum.<ref name=\"LP10\"/><ref name=\"AW01\"/> Also, the participation of [[joik]]ing women was of importance for a successful soul journey.<ref name=\"AW01\"/> May-Lisbeth Myrhaug has reinterpreted the sources from the 17th and 18th century, and suggests that there are evidence of female noaidi, even soul traveling female noaidi.<ref name=\"HM07\"/><ref>May-Lisbeth Myrhaug (1997).

Pax forlag. {{ISBN|82-530-1866-5}}</ref>\n\n== Drums after the drum time ==\nIn the 17th and 18th century, several actions were made to confiscate drums, both in Sweden and in Denmark-Norway. [[Thomas von Westen]] and his colleagues considered the drums to be \"the Bible of the S\u00e1mi\", and wanted to eradicate their idolatry by the roots by destroying or removing the drums.<ref name=\"BP02\"/> Any uncontrolled, idol-worshipping S\u00e1mi were considered a threat to the government.<ref name=\"AWJEU\"/> The increased missionary efforts towards the S\u00e1mi in the early 18th century might be explained as a consequence of the desire to controle the citizens under the [[Sovereignty Act|absolute monarchy]] in Denmark-Norway, and also as a consequence of the increased emphasis on an individual Christian faith suggested in [[pietism]].\n\nIn [[\u00c5sele]], Sweden, 2 drums were collected in 1686, 8 drums in 1689 and 26 drums in 1725, mainly of the Southern S\u00e1mi type.<ref name=\"AW01\">Westman 2001</ref> Thomas von Westen collected ca 100 drums from the Southern S\u00e1mi district,<ref name=\"AWJEU\"/> 8 of them were collected at [[Sn\u00e5sa]] in 1723. 70 of von Westen's drums were lost in the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728]].<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> von Westen found few drums during his journeys in the Northern S\u00e1mi districts between 1715 and 1730. This might be explained with the advanced christening of the S\u00e1mi in north, so that the drums were already destroyed. It might alternatively be explained with diffent use on the drums in Northern and Southern S\u00e1mi culture. While the drum was a common household item in Southern S\u00e1mi culture, it might have been a rare object, reserved for the few, educated ''noaidi'' in Northern S\u00e1mi culture.<ref name=\"AWJEU\"/><ref name=\"AW01\"/>\n\nProbably the best-known is the Linn\u00e9 Drum \u2013 a drum that was given to [[Carl Linnaeus]] during his visits in the northern [[Sweden]].

Paulsen's drum was confiscated in Vads\u00f8 in 1691, while the Bindal drum was bought by a museum official in 1925; [[Vads\u00f8]] and [[Bindal]] being in opposite corners of the Sami world. Paulsens's drum has a typical Northern S\u00e1mi pattern, with several separate levels representing the different layers of spiritual worlds. The Bindal drum has a typical Southern Sami decoration: a [[rhombus]] shaped sun symbol in the center, with other symbols around the sun, representing people, animals, landscape and deities.}}\n\nA '''S\u00e1mi drum''' is a shamanic [[ceremonial drum]] used by the [[S\u00e1mi people]] of Northern Europe. S\u00e1mi ceremonial drums have two chiefly two variations, both [[oval-shaped]]: a bowl drum in which the [[drumhead]] is strapped over a [[burl]], and a [[frame drum]] in which the drumhead stretches over a thin ring of [[bentwood]]. The drumhead is fashioned from reindeer [[Hide (skin)|hide]].\n\nIn [[S\u00e1mi shamanism]], the ''[[noaidi]]'' used the drum to get into a trance, or to obtain information from the future or other realms. The drum was held in one hand, and beaten with the other. While the ''noaidi'' was in trance, his \"free spirit\" was said to leave his body to visit the spiritual world. When applied for [[divination]] purposes, the drum was beaten together with a drum hammer and a ''vuorbi'' ('index' or 'pointer') made of brass or horn. Messages could be interpreted based on where the vuorbi stopped on the membrane, and at which symbols.\n\nThe patterns on the drum membrane reflect the world view of the owner and his family, both in religious and worldly matters, such as reindeer herding, hunting, householding as well as relations to their neighbours and to the non-S\u00e1mi community.\n\nMany drums were taken out of their use and S\u00e1mi ownership during the 18th century. A large number of drums were confiscated by S\u00e1mi missionaries and other officials as a part of an intensified Christian mission towards the S\u00e1mi. Other drums were bought by collectors. Between 70 and 80 drums are preserved; the largest collection of drums is at the [[Nordic Museum]] reserves in Stockholm.\n\n== Terminology ==\n[[File:Lapponia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johannes Schefferus|Schefferus]]' ''Lapponia'' (1673) is an early source to S\u00e1mi culture and religion]]\n[[File:Sami drum from lule lappmark bottom.jpg|thumb|upright|Lule S\u00e1mi bowl drum]]\n[[File:Freavnantjahke gievrie Koch 2005 04.TIF|thumb|upright|Frame drum (''freavnantjahke gievrie'') with cords]]\nThe [[Northern S\u00e1mi]] terms are ''goavddis'', ''gobdis'' and ''meavrresg\u00e1rri'', while the [[Lule S\u00e1mi language|Lule S\u00e1mi]] and [[Southern S\u00e1mi language|Southern S\u00e1mi]] terms are ''goabdes''  and ''gievrie'', respectively. {{lang-no|runebomme}}, {{lang-sv|n\u00e5jdtrumma}};<ref>Anonymous 1723/1903</ref> In English it is also known as a rune drum or S\u00e1mi shamanic drum.<ref>Liv Helene Willumsen.

First the drums themselves, and what might be interpreted from them. Secondly the reports and treatises on S\u00e1mi topics during the 17th and 18th centuries, written by Swedish and Dano-Norwegian priests, missionaries or other civil servants, like Johannes Schefferus. The third category are statements from Saami themselves, given to court or other official representatives.<ref name=\"R07\"/><ref>[http://www.love.is/roald/kildeskrifter.html Kildetyper]at Roald E. Kristiansen's website ''Samisk religion''.</ref> The fourth are the sporadic references to drums and S\u00e1mi shamanism in other sources, such as ''Historia Norvegi\u00e6'' (late 12th century).\n\nThe oldest mentioning of a S\u00e1mi drum and shamanism is in the anonymous ''[[Historia Norvegi\u00e6]]'' (late 12th century). Here is mentioned a drum with symbols of marine animals, a boat, reindeer and snowshoes. There is also a description of a shaman healing an apparently dead woman by moving his spirit into a whale.<ref name=\"histno\">[http://www.love.is/roald/histnorvegia.htm \"Finnene\", from ''Historia Norvegi\u00e6'']</ref> [[Peder Clauss\u00f8n Friis]] describes a noaidi spirit leaving the body in his ''Norriges oc omliggende \u00d8ers sandf\u00e6rdige Bescriffuelse'' (1632). The oldest description by a S\u00e1mi was made by Anders Huitlok of the Pite S\u00e1mi in 1642 [[:File:S\u00e1mi mythology shaman drum Samisk mytologi schamantrumma 005.png|about this drum that he owned.]] Anders also made a drawing; his story was written down by the German-Swedish bergmeister Hans P.

During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348) rumours were spread that the swedes won their battles with the help of S\u00e1mi witchcraft.<ref name=\"AWJEU\">Westman and Utsi 1998</ref> Such rumours were part of the background for the research that lead to [[Johannes Schefferus]]' book ''[[Lapponia (book)|Lapponia]]'', published in Latin in 1673.<ref>[http://www.ub.uit.no/northernlights/eng/schefferus.htm Johannes Schefferus (1621-1679) in the Web exhibit The Northern Lights Route], Troms\u00f8 University Library, 1999</ref> As preparations to Schefferus' a number of \"clergy correspondences\" (\"pr\u00e4strelationer\") was written by vicars within the S\u00e1mi districts in Sweden.

Authors were [[Hans Skanke]], [[Jens Kildal]], [[Isaac Olsen]], and Johan Randulf (the ''[[N\u00e6r\u00f8y manuscript]]''). These books were part instructions for the missionaries and their co-workers, and part a documentation intended for the government in Copenhagen. Late books within this tradition are [[Pehr H\u00f6gstr\u00f6m]]'s ''Beskrifning \u00d6fwer de til Sweriges Krona lydande Lapmarker'' (1747)<ref>[http://runeberg.org/lapmarker/ Beskrifning \u00f6fwer de til Sweriges Krona lydande Lapmarker]; fulltext at Runeberg.org</ref> in Sweden and [[Knud Leem]]'s ''Beskrivelse over Finmarkens Lapper'' (1767) in Denmark-Norway. And especially [[Lars Levi L\u00e6stadius|L\u00e6stadius]]' ''[[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]]'' (1839\u201345), which both discusses earlier treatises with an critical approach, and builds upon L\u00e6stadius' own experience.\n\n== The shape of the drums ==\n\n=== Wood ===\nThe drums are always oval; the exact shape of the oval would vary with the wood. The remaining drums are of four different types, within two main groups: bowl drums and frame drums.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/>  \n# Bowl drums, where the wood consists of a [[burl]] shaped into a bowl. The burl usually comes from [[pine]], but sometimes from [[Picea abies|spruce]]. The membrane is attached to the wood with a sinew. \n# Frame drums are shaped by [[Heat bending of wood|wet or heat bending]]; the wood is usually pine, and the membrane is sewed to holes in the frame with a sinew. \n# Ring drums are made from a naturally grown piece of pine wood. There is only one known drum of this type. \n# Angular cut frame drums are made from one piece of wood cut from a three. To bend the wood into an oval, angular cuts are made both in the bottom and the side of the frame. Only two such drums are preserved, both from [[Kemi S\u00e1mi language|Kemi S\u00e1mi]] districts in Finland. The partly preserved [[:File:Runebomme fra Bj\u00f8rsvik Nordfold Steigen.jpg|drum from Bj\u00f8rsvik]] in Nordland is also an angular cut frame drum.\n\nIn his major work on S\u00e1mi drums, ''Die lappische Zaubertrommel'',<ref name=\"M38\">Manker 1938</ref> [[Ernst Manker]] lists 41 frame drums, one ring drum, two angular cut frame drums and 27 bowl drums. Given this numbers, many tend to divide the drums into the two main groups bowl drums and frame drums, seeing the others as variations. Judged by these remaining drums and their known provenance, frame drums seem to be common in the Southern S\u00e1mi areas, and bowl drums seem to be common in the Northern S\u00e1mi areas. The bowl drum is sometimes regarded as a local adjustment of the basic drum type, this being the frame drum.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> The frame drum type has most resemblance to other [[ceremonial drum]]s used by [[indigenous peoples of Siberia]].<ref name=\"RKHR\"/>\n\n=== The membrane and its symbols ===\n[[File:Sami drum distribution of types geography.svg|thumb|350px|A regional typology of drum patterns, with some variations used by [[K.B.

Lars Olsen, who described his uncle's drum, the [[Bindal drum]], in 1885, said that the hide usually was taken from the neck of a calf because of its proper thickness; the sex of the calf was probably not important, according to Olsen.<ref name=\"LP10\">Pareli 2010</ref> The symbols were painted with a paste made from [[alder]]bark.<ref name=\"AS12\"/><ref name=\"M38\"/>\n\nThe motives on a drum reflect the [[Weltanschaung|world view]] of the owner and his family, both in terms of religious beliefs and in their modes of subsistence.<ref name=\"AW01\">Westman 2001</ref> A fictitious world is depicted by images of reindeer, both domesticated and wild, and of carnivorous predators that pose a threat to the flock. The modes of subsistence are presented by scenes of wild game hunting, boats with fishing nets, and reindeer herding. Additional scenery on the drum consist of mountains, lakes, people, deities, as well as the camp site with tents and storages houses. Symbols of alien civilization, such as churches and houses, represent the threats from the surrounding and expanding non-S\u00e1mi community.<ref name=\"AWJEU\"/><ref>Original Swedish quote: \"{{lang|se|Trummans figurer visar den v\u00e4rld man r\u00f6rde sig i.

The Lule S\u00e1mi drum reflects an owner who found his mode of subsistence chiefly through hunting, rather than herding.\n\nA typhology{{typo help inline|reason=similar to typhlology|date=November 2019}} based on the structure of the patterns can be divided into three main categories:<ref name=\"RKHR\"/>\n# Southern S\u00e1mi, characterized by the rhombus shaped sun cross in the center\n# Central S\u00e1mi, where the membrane is divided in two by a horizontal line, often with a sun symbol in the lower section\n# Northern S\u00e1mi, where the membrane is divided by horizontal lines into three or five separate levels representing the different layers of spiritual worlds: heavens, the world of the living and an underworld.\n\nIn Manker's overview of 71 known drums, there are 42 Southern S\u00e1mi drums, 22 Central S\u00e1mi drums and seven Northern S\u00e1mi drums.<ref name=\"M38\"/>\n\nThe [[Bindal drum]] is a typical Southern S\u00e1mi drum, with the sun symbol in center. Its last owner also explained that the symbols on the membrane were organized in four directions, according to the [[cardinal direction]]s around the sun. South is described as the summer side or the direction of life, and contains symbols for the S\u00e1mi's life in the fell during summer: the ''[[goahti]]'', the storehouse or ''njalla'', the flock of reindeer, and the pastures. North is described as the side of death, and contains symbols for sickness, death and wickedness.<ref name=\"LP10\">Pareli 2010</ref>\n\nKjellstr\u00f6m and Rydving have summed up the symbols of the drums in these categories: nature, reindeer, bears, moose, other mammals (wolf, beaver, small fur animals), birds, fishes, hunting, fishing, reindeer herding, the camp site \u2013 with goahti, njalla and other storehouses, the non-S\u00e1mi village \u2013 often represented by the church, people, communications (skiing, reindeer with [[pulk]], boats), and deities and their world. Sometimes even the use of the drum itself is depicted.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/><ref>The private website thuleia.com has an overview of [http://www.thuleia.com/shamandrum.html Shaman\u00b4s drum symbols in Scandinavia], slightly different from Kjellstr\u00f6m and Rydving categories.</ref>\n\nThe reindeer herding is mainly depicted with a circular symbol for the [[Animal pound|pound]] that was used to gather, mark and milk the flock. This symbol is found on 75% of the Southern S\u00e1mi drums, but not on any northern or eastern drums.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> The symbol for the pound is always placed in the lower half of the drum. Reindeer are represented as singular line figures, as fully modeled figures or by their antlers.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> The camp site is usually shown as a triangle symbolizing the tent/goahti.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> The S\u00e1mi storehouse (''njalla'') is depicted on many drums from different areas. The ''njalla'' is a small house in [[bear cache]] style, built on top of a cut tree. It is usually depicted with its ladder in front.\n\n[[S\u00e1mi religion|S\u00e1mi deities]] are shown on several drum membranes. These are the high god ''R\u00e1\u00f0\u00f0i'', the [[demiurge]] and [[God the Sustainer|sustainer]] ''[[Waralden Olmai|Varaldi olmmai]]'', the thunder and fertility god ''[[Horagalles|Horagallis]]'', the weather god ''[[Bieggolmai|Bieggolmm\u00e1i]]'', the hunting god ''[[Lieaibolmmai|Leaibolmm\u00e1i]]'', the sun god ''[[Beaivi]]'' / ''Biejjie'', the  [[Akka (spirit)|mother goddesses]] ''M\u00e1ttar\u00e1hkk\u00e1'', ''S\u00e1r\u00e1hkk\u00e1'', ''Juoks\u00e1hkk\u00e1'' og ''Uks\u00e1hkk\u00e1'', the riding ''[[Ruohtta|Ruto]]'' who brought sickness and death, and ''J\u00e1bme\u00e1hkk\u00e1'' \u2013 the empress of the death realms.\n\nSome matters from the non-S\u00e1mi world also appears on several drums. These are interpreted as attempts to understand and master the new impulses brought into the S\u00e1mi society.<ref name=\"AW01\"/> Churches, houses and horses appear on several drums, and drums from [[Tornetr\u00e4sk|Torne]] and [[Kemi]] districts show both the city, the church and the ''lapp commissary''.<ref name=\"AW01\"/>\n\nInterpretation of the drum symbols might be difficult, and there are given different explanations to some of the symbols. There has often been assumed that the S\u00e1mi deliberately gave wrong explanations when they presented their drums to missionaries and other Christian audiences, in order to reduce the impression of heathenry and underline the Christian impact of Sami culture.<ref>Liv Helene Willumsen. ''D\u00f8mt til ild og b\u00e5l, trolldomsprosessene i Skottland og Finnmark''. Orkana forlag, 2013. 978-82-8104-203-2. Chapter on [[Anders Paulsen]], pages 336-353</ref><ref name=\"M50\">Manker 1950</ref> There is also an opposite assumption that some of the symbols has been overinterpreted as religious motives while they actually represented matters from timely, everyday life.\n\nH\u00e5kan Rydving have evaluated the drum symbols from a perspective of source criticism, and divides them into four categories:<ref name=\"R07\"/>\n# Preserved drums that were explained by their owners. These are only two drums: [[Anders Paulsen]]'s drum and the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]].\n# Preserved drums that were explained by other people, contemporary to the owners. These are five drums, four Southern Sami and one Ume Sami. \n# Lost drums that were explained by contemporary, either the owner or other people. These are four drums.\n# Preserved drums without a contemporary explanation. These are the majority of the 70 known drums.\n\nRydving and Kjellstr\u00f6m have demonstrated that both [[:File:S\u00e1mi mythology shaman drum Samisk mytologi schamantrumma 008.png|Olov Graan's drum]] fra Lycksele<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> and the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]]<ref name=\"R07\">Rydving 2007</ref> have been ''spiritualized'' through [[Ernst Manker|Manker]]'s interpretations: When the explanations are compared, it appears as if Graan relates the symbols to householding and modes of subsistence, where Manker sees deities and spirits. This underlines the problems of interpretation.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> Symbols that Graan explains as snowy weather, a ship, rain and squirrels in the trees, are interpreted by Manker as the wind god Bieggolmai/Biegk\u00e5lmaj, a boat sacrifice, a weather god and \u2013 among other suggestions \u2013 as a forest spirit.<ref name=\"R07\"/> At the Freavnantjahke gievrie there is a symbol explained by the owner as \"a Sami riding in his pulk behind his reindeer\", while Manker suggests that \"this might be an ordinary sleigh ride, but we might as well assume that this is the noaidi, the drum owner, going on an important errand into the spiritual world\". On the other hand, one might suggest that the owner of the Freavnantjahke gievrie, Bendik Andersen, is under-communicating the spiritual content of the drum when the symbols usually recognized as the three mother goddesses are explained as \"men guarding the reindeer\".\n\n=== Accessories ===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center|| width = 120 | image1 = Sami rune drum hammer history museum Oslo.jpg | image2 = Viser til runebomme fra J\u00e5mafjell.jpg | footer = The drum hammer from Rendalen (left) has a typical, symmetric T-shape.<ref>[http://www.khm.uio.no/om/tjenester/foto/presse/bilder-yngre-jernalder/Cf21939_12_C26831a_HM.jpg?vrtx=view-as-webpage Hammer til runebomme fra Nordset, Rendalen, Hedmark] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113142635/http://www.khm.uio.no/om/tjenester/foto/presse/bilder-yngre-jernalder/Cf21939_12_C26831a_HM.jpg?vrtx=view-as-webpage |date=2013-11-13 }}; at Kulturhistorisk museum, Oslo</ref> This hammer from the 11th century is regarded an indicator for early S\u00e1mi presence in southern Norway.<ref name=\"LP91\">Leif Pareli. \"Runebommehammeren fra Rendalen: Et minne etter samer i S\u00f8r-Norge i middelalderen?\".

The ''vuorbi'' was used for divination.\n\nThe cords are leather straps nailed or tied to the frame or to the bottom of the drum. They had pieces of bone or metal tied to them. The owner of the [[Freavnantjahke gievrie]], Bendix Andersen Fr\u00f8yningsfjell, explained to [[Thomas von Westen]] in 1723 that the leather straps and their decorations of tin, bone and brass were offers of gratitude to the drum, given by the owner as a response to luck gained from the drum's instructions.<ref name=\"Q1903\">Anonymous in Qvigstad 1903</ref> The frame of the Freavnantjahke gievrie also had 11 tin nails in it, in a cross shape.

Drums are now used both as a musical instrument and as a symbol of S\u00e1mi identity.]]\nErnst Manker summarized the use of the drum, regarding both trance and divination:<ref>Manker 1938/1950; as quoted by Kjellstr\u00f6m & Rydving 1998</ref>\n* before use, the membrane was tightened by holding the drum close to the fire \n* the user stood on his knees, or sat with his legs crossed, holding the drum in his left hand\n* the [[vuorbi]] was placed on the membrane, either on a fixed place or randomly\n* the hammer was held in the right hand; the membrane was hit either with one of the hammer heads, or with the flat side of the hammer\n* the drumming started at slow pace, and grew wilder\n* if the drummer fell into trance, his drum was placed upon him, with the painted membrane facing downwards\n* the way of the vuorbi across the membrane, and the places where it stopped, was interpreted as significant\n\n[[Samuel Rheen]], who was a priest in [[Kvikkjokk]] 1664\u20131671, was one of the first to write about S\u00e1mi religion. His impression was that many S\u00e1mi, but not all, used the drum for divination. Rheen mentioned four matters in which the drum could give answers:\n# to seek knowledge about how things were at other places\n# to seek knowledge about luck, misfortune, health, and illness\n# to cure diseases\n# to learn what deity one should sacrifice unto\nOf these four ways of use mentioned by Rheen, one knows from other sources that the first of them was only performed by the noaidi.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> Based on the sources, one might get the impression that the use of the drum was gradually \"democratized\", so that there in some regions there was a drum in each household, that the father of the household could seek to for advice.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> Yet, the most original use of the drum \u2013 getting into trance, seem to have been a speciality for the noaidi.<ref name=\"RKHR\"/>\n\nSources seem to agree that in Southern S\u00e1mi districts in the 18th century, each household had its own drum. These were mostly used for divination purposes.<ref name=\"RK12\">Kristensen 2012</ref> The types and structure of motives on the Southern S\u00e1mi drums confirm a use for divination. On the other hand, the structure of the Northern S\u00e1mi drum motives, with its hierarchical structure of spiritual worlds, represent a mythological universe it which it was the noaidi's privilege to wander.<ref name=\"AW01\"/><ref name=\"RK12\"/>\n\nThe drum was usually brought along during nomadic wanderings. There are also known some cases where the drum was hidden close to one of the regulars' campsites. Inside the [[lavvu]] and the [[goahti]], the drum was always placed in the ''boa\u0161\u0161u'', the space behind the fireplace that was considered the \"holy room\" within the goahti.<ref name=\"AS12\"/>\n\nSeveral of the contemporary sources describe a duality in the view of the drums: They were seen both as an occult device, and as a divination tool for practical purposes.<ref name=\"\u00c5VK07\"/> Drums were inherited. Among those who owned drums in the 18th century, not all of them described themselves as active users of their drum. At least that was what they said when the drums were confiscated.<ref name=\"\u00c5VK07\"/>\n\nThere is no known evidence that the drum or the noaidi had any role in child birth or funeral rituals.<ref name=\"AW01\"/>\n\nSome sources suggest that the drum was manufactured with the aid of secret rituals. However, Manker<ref name=\"M38\"/> made a photo documentary describing the process of manufacturing the physical drum. Selection of motives for the membrane, or the philosophy behind it, are not described in any sources. It is known that the inauguration of the drum where done by rituals that involved the whole household.\n\n=== In trance ===\nThe ''noaidi'' used the drum to achieve a state of trance. He hit the drum with an intense rhythm until he came into a sort of trance or sleep. While in this sleep, his free spirit could travel into the spiritual worlds, or to other places in the material world.

One should not consider every drum owner a magician.\"<ref>As quoted by Mebius 2007</ref> A common practice was to let the ''vuorbi'' move across the membrane, visiting the different symbols.

Pax forlag. {{ISBN|82-530-1866-5}}</ref>\n\n== Drums after the drum time ==\nIn the 17th and 18th century, several actions were made to confiscate drums, both in Sweden and in Denmark-Norway. [[Thomas von Westen]] and his colleagues considered the drums to be \"the Bible of the S\u00e1mi\", and wanted to eradicate their idolatry by the roots by destroying or removing the drums.<ref name=\"BP02\"/> Any uncontrolled, idol-worshipping S\u00e1mi were considered a threat to the government.<ref name=\"AWJEU\"/> The increased missionary efforts towards the S\u00e1mi in the early 18th century might be explained as a consequence of the desire to controle the citizens under the [[Sovereignty Act|absolute monarchy]] in Denmark-Norway, and also as a consequence of the increased emphasis on an individual Christian faith suggested in [[pietism]].\n\nIn [[\u00c5sele]], Sweden, 2 drums were collected in 1686, 8 drums in 1689 and 26 drums in 1725, mainly of the Southern S\u00e1mi type.<ref name=\"AW01\">Westman 2001</ref> Thomas von Westen collected ca 100 drums from the Southern S\u00e1mi district,<ref name=\"AWJEU\"/> 8 of them were collected at [[Sn\u00e5sa]] in 1723. 70 of von Westen's drums were lost in the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728]].<ref name=\"RKHR\"/> von Westen found few drums during his journeys in the Northern S\u00e1mi districts between 1715 and 1730. This might be explained with the advanced christening of the S\u00e1mi in north, so that the drums were already destroyed. It might alternatively be explained with diffent use on the drums in Northern and Southern S\u00e1mi culture. While the drum was a common household item in Southern S\u00e1mi culture, it might have been a rare object, reserved for the few, educated ''noaidi'' in Northern S\u00e1mi culture.<ref name=\"AWJEU\"/><ref name=\"AW01\"/>\n\nProbably the best-known is the Linn\u00e9 Drum \u2013 a drum that was given to [[Carl Linnaeus]] during his visits in the northern [[Sweden]].

At 13, she wrote a criticism of [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s feminist work ''[[Aurora Leigh]]''; at 14, Levy's first poem, \"Ida Grey: A Story of Woman's Sacrifice\", was published in the journal ''Pelican''. Her family was supportive of women's education and encouraged Amy's literary interests; in 1876, she was sent to [[Brighton and Hove High School]] and later studied at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. Levy was the first Jewish student at Newnham when she arrived in 1879 but left before her final year without taking her exams.<ref>{{cite book |last=Beckman |title=Amy Levy: Her Life and Letters |year=2005 |publisher= |isbn= |page=55}}</ref>\n\nHer circle of friends included [[Clementina Black]], [[Ellen Wordsworth Darwin]], [[Dollie Radford]], [[Eleanor Marx]] (daughter of [[Karl Marx]]), and [[Olive Schreiner]].

In 1886, Levy began writing a series of essays on Jewish culture and literature for ''The Jewish Chronicle'', including ''The Ghetto at Florence'', ''The Jew in Fiction'', ''Jewish Humour'', and ''Jewish Children.''\n\nLevy's works of poetry, including the daring ''A Ballad of Religion and Marriage'', reveal her feminist concerns.  ''[[Xantippe and Other Verses]]'' (1881) includes \"Xantippe\", a poem in the voice of Socrates's wife; the volume ''A Minor Poet and Other Verse'' (1884) includes more dramatic monologues as well as lyric poems.

She had sent several poems to her friend Violet Piaget, also known as Vernon Lee, confessing her love. These poems include her famous works \"To Vernon Lee\" and \"New Love, New Life.\" Both of these pieces express messages of unrequited love to a member of a similar group.

At 13, she wrote a criticism of [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s feminist work ''[[Aurora Leigh]]''; at 14, Levy's first poem, \"Ida Grey: A Story of Woman's Sacrifice\", was published in the journal ''Pelican''. Her family was supportive of women's education and encouraged Amy's literary interests; in 1876, she was sent to [[Brighton and Hove High School]] and later studied at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. Levy was the first Jewish student at Newnham when she arrived in 1879 but left before her final year without taking her exams.<ref>{{cite book |last=Beckman |title=Amy Levy: Her Life and Letters |year=2005 |publisher= |isbn= |page=55}}</ref>\n\nHer circle of friends included [[Clementina Black]], [[Ellen Wordsworth Darwin]], [[Dollie Radford]], [[Eleanor Marx]] (daughter of [[Karl Marx]]), and [[Olive Schreiner]]. While travelling in [[Florence]] in 1886, Levy met [[Vernon Lee]], a fiction writer and literary theorist six years her senior, and fell in love with her.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ledger |first=Sally |title=The New Woman: Fiction and Feminism at the Fin de Si\u00e8cle |year=1997 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-4093-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e0i8AAAAIAAJ}}</ref> Both women went on to explore the themes of [[History of lesbianism|sapphic love]] in their works. Lee inspired Levy's poem \"To Vernon Lee\".\n\n==Literary career==\n''[[The Romance of a Shop]]'' (1888), Levy's first novel, is regarded as an early \"[[New Woman]]\" novel and depicts four sisters who experience the difficulties and opportunities afforded to women running a business in 1880s London,<ref>{{cite book |last=Bernstein |first=Susan David |title=The Romance of a Shop |year=2006 |publisher=Broadview Press |isbn=1-55111-566-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/romanceofshop0000levy }}</ref> Levy wrote her second novel, ''Reuben Sachs'' (1888), to fill the literary need for \"serious treatment&nbsp;... of the complex problem of Jewish life and Jewish character\", which she identified and discussed in her 1886 article \"The Jew in Fiction.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Beckman |title=Amy Levy: Her Life and Letters |year=2005 |publisher= |isbn= |page=159}}</ref>\n\nLevy wrote stories, essays, and poems for popular or literary periodicals; the stories \"Cohen of Trinity\" and \"Wise in Their Generation\", both published in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s magazine ''[[The Woman's World]]'', are among her most notable. In 1886, Levy began writing a series of essays on Jewish culture and literature for ''The Jewish Chronicle'', including ''The Ghetto at Florence'', ''The Jew in Fiction'', ''Jewish Humour'', and ''Jewish Children.''\n\nLevy's works of poetry, including the daring ''A Ballad of Religion and Marriage'', reveal her feminist concerns.  ''[[Xantippe and Other Verses]]'' (1881) includes \"Xantippe\", a poem in the voice of Socrates's wife; the volume ''A Minor Poet and Other Verse'' (1884) includes more dramatic monologues as well as lyric poems. Her final book of poems, ''A London Plane-Tree'' (1889), contains lyrics that are among the first to show the influence of French symbolism.<ref>\"Levy, Clemintina Black, and Liza of Lambeth\", Emma Francis, in Naomi Hetherington and Nadia Valman (eds), ''Amy Levy: Critical Essays''.</ref>\n\n== Queer Speculations ==\nAmy Judith Levy remains a topic of discussion amongst scholars in terms of whether or not she is to be considered a Victorian queer writer. She had sent several poems to her friend Violet Piaget, also known as Vernon Lee, confessing her love. These poems include her famous works \"To Vernon Lee\" and \"New Love, New Life.\" Both of these pieces express messages of unrequited love to a member of a similar group. Scholars continue to debate if these gestures were that of friendship or intense passion. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole section|date=November 2018}}\n\n== Suicide ==\nLevy suffered from episodes of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] from an early age. In her later years, her depression worsened in connection to her distress surrounding her romantic relationships and her awareness of her growing deafness. Two months away from her 28th birthday, she committed suicide \"at the residence of her parents ...

[[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} The eleven movements of a symmetrical structure employ three to five voices in different combinations. Bach used means of [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt an earlier dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorales from the motet were part of a manuscript collection of chorale settings around 1735. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. The work, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\nResponsible for church music in [[Leipzig]] in his position as [[Thomaskantor]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed cycles of [[Church cantata (Bach)|church cantatas]] for the Sundays and feast days of the Lutheran liturgical calendar. He wrote some church cantatas for occasions such as weddings and funerals. He also composed [[Motet (Bach)|motets]], probably as comparable occasional works.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} These works are scored for choir, with optional [[basso continuo]] and instruments playing ''colla parte'' with the voices. For most of them, an [[Autograph (manuscript)|autograph manuscript]] is missing, posing problems for dating them.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=V}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of six motets historically regarded as a \"canon\" of motets,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} and assigned numbers in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] of BWV 225\u2013230.{{sfn|Dubin|2007}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] dated  the motets to Bach's Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter believed in 1912, that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was written for a specific funeral in 1723,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} while [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]]. Three of the chorales are contained in a manuscript collection of Bach's chorale settings by Johann Ludwig Dietel, a student of Bach at the [[Thomasschule]]. This collection is dated around 1735, which is therefore the latest possible date for this motet.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for up to five voices, [[SATB|SSATB]],{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} as only few of Bach's compositions of Latin church music, such as the [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, and the [[Mass for the Dresden court (Bach)|Missa in B-minor]] written for the Dresden court in 1733.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}}\n\n=== Text ===\nThe text for {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}}\" with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:1\u20132, 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the passage reflects Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. In the motet, the The six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers take as their text one verse from the epistle writing.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}} \n\n=== Chorale melody ===\nThe chorale melody was composed by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]] (1653) and first appeared in his hymnal ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]''.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} It is unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing [[colla parte]] in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}\n\nIn the following table, the movement number is followed by the beginning of the text, its source, the voices, and [[Key (music)|key]] and [[time signature]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n<!--! scope=\"col\" | BD-->\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}} || verse 1 || SATB || {{nowrap|[[E minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=1}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen|italic=no}} || verse 2 || SSATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Denn das Gesetz|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=2}} || SSA || [[G major]] || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}} || verse 3 || SSATB || E minor || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#6|6]] || {{lang|la|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=9}} || SSATB || G major || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#7|7]] || {{lang|de|Weg, weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}} || verse 4 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#8|8]] || {{lang|en|So aber Christus in euch ist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=10}} || ATB || [[C major]] || 12/8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#9|9]] || {{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen|italic=no}} || verse 5 || SSAT || [[A minor]] || 2/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#10|10]] || {{lang|de|So nun der Geist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=11}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#11|11]] || {{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}} || verse 6 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|}\n\n=== Movements ===\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas.

Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei.|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the following verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Defiance is expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony, and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude, and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The fugue is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen!|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice, with two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Good night\" often.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}} The chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matching compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"you stay with me even in sorrow, Jesus, my joy\".{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nBach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, up to ilustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived. Three of the chorales, movements 1 (which is the same as 11), 3 and 7 are contained in Dietel's manuscript, a collection of 149 of Bach's chorale settings, dated around 1735.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}} In the five-part setting of movement 3, Dietel omitted the second soprano part.{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} Like most of Bach's output, the motet was not published in the composer's lifetime. It first appeared in print in a collection of motets by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] in 1802/03,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=99}} edited by [[Johann Gottfried Schicht]], then the Gewandhauskapellmeister.{{sfn|Wolf, Staehelin|2002|p=269}}\n\nWith the other motets, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was published in 1892 in volume 39 of the [[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (BGA), edited by [[Franz W\u00fcllner]]. The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=I}}\n\n=== Date and purpose ===\nBach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter was the first to state, in the ''Bach-Jahrbuch'' of 1912, that the motets were music commissioned for special occasions.{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} He assigned a specific date to {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, the funeral on 18 July 1723 of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is no conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to state the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, arguing for a date in the 1720s, assuming that the work was then newly composed.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} According to Melamed, there is evidence that the motet is rather a compilation of partly older music, looking at the four-part setting of the chorale, which seems unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the [[cantus firmus]] in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Weimar or even earlier.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} [[Richard D. P. Jones]] stated that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n=== Recordings ===\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been recorded more than 60 times,{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfnref|ArkivMusic|2020}} Performers have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small choir or larger group, continuo, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]]. [[Harry Christophers]] directed a recording by [[The Sixteen]] in 1989. [[Masaaki Suzuki]] conducted performances of the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] in 2009, using instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited sources ===\n''Bach Digital''\n* {{cite web\n| url = https://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000284\n| title =  Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227; BC C 5 \n| website = [[Bach Digital]]\n| year = 2020\n| accessdate = 19 March 2020\n| ref = {{sfnref|Bach Digital|2020}}\n}}\n\n''Books''\n* {{cite book\n| last = Ameln\n| first = Konrad\n| url = https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/shop/product/details/BA5193/\n| title = Bach, Johann Sebastian / Jesu, meine Freude for five-part mixed choir in E minor BWV 227\n| website = [[B\u00e4renreiter]]\n| date = 1965\n| accessdate = 19 March 2020\n| ref = harv\n}} ISMN 979-0-00-649848-2\n* {{cite web\n| last = Gardiner\n| first = John Eliot\n| authorlink = John Eliot Gardiner\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT350\n| title = Music in the Castle of Heaven: A Portrait of Johann Sebastian Bach\n| publisher = Penguin UK\n| date = 2013\n| pages = 350\u2013352\n| isbn = 978-1-84-614721-0\n| ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last = Hofmann\n| first = Klaus\n| authorlink = Klaus Hofmann\n| url = https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/shop/product/details/BA5193/\n| title = J.

[[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} The eleven movements of a symmetrical structure employ three to five voices in different combinations. Bach used means of [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt an earlier dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorales from the motet were part of a manuscript collection of chorale settings around 1735. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. The work, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\nResponsible for church music in [[Leipzig]] in his position as [[Thomaskantor]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed cycles of [[Church cantata (Bach)|church cantatas]] for the Sundays and feast days of the Lutheran liturgical calendar. He wrote some church cantatas for occasions such as weddings and funerals. He also composed [[Motet (Bach)|motets]], probably as comparable occasional works.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} These works are scored for choir, with optional [[basso continuo]] and instruments playing ''colla parte'' with the voices. For most of them, an [[Autograph (manuscript)|autograph manuscript]] is missing, posing problems for dating them.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=V}}\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of six motets historically regarded as a \"canon\" of motets,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} and assigned numbers in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]] of BWV 225\u2013230.{{sfn|Dubin|2007}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] dated  the motets to Bach's Leipzig period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=98}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter believed in 1912, that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was written for a specific funeral in 1723,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} while [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]]. Three of the chorales are contained in a manuscript collection of Bach's chorale settings by Johann Ludwig Dietel, a student of Bach at the [[Thomasschule]]. This collection is dated around 1735, which is therefore the latest possible date for this motet.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for up to five voices, [[SATB|SSATB]],{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} as only few of Bach's compositions of Latin church music, such as the [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, and the [[Mass for the Dresden court (Bach)|Missa in B-minor]] written for the Dresden court in 1733.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}}\n\n=== Text ===\nThe text for {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}}\" with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:1\u20132, 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the passage reflects Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. In the motet, the The six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers take as their text one verse from the epistle writing.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}} \n\n=== Chorale melody ===\nThe chorale melody was composed by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]] (1653) and first appeared in his hymnal ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]''.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} It is unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=202}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing [[colla parte]] in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}\n\nIn the following table, the movement number is followed by the beginning of the text, its source, the voices, and [[Key (music)|key]] and [[time signature]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Movements of Bach's {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Time\n<!--! scope=\"col\" | BD-->\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#1|1]] || {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude|italic=no}} || verse 1 || SATB || {{nowrap|[[E minor]]}} || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#2|2]] || {{lang|la|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=1}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#3|3]] || {{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen|italic=no}} || verse 2 || SSATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#4|4]] || {{lang|la|Denn das Gesetz|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=2}} || SSA || [[G major]] || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#5|5]] || {{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}} || verse 3 || SSATB || E minor || 3/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#6|6]] || {{lang|la|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=9}} || SSATB || G major || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#7|7]] || {{lang|de|Weg, weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}} || verse 4 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#8|8]] || {{lang|en|So aber Christus in euch ist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=10}} || ATB || [[C major]] || 12/8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#9|9]] || {{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen|italic=no}} || verse 5 || SSAT || [[A minor]] || 2/4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#10|10]] || {{lang|de|So nun der Geist|italic=no}} || {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Romans|chapter=8|verse=11}} || SSATB || E minor || 3/2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[#11|11]] || {{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}} || verse 6 || SATB || E minor || {{music|common-time}}\n|}\n\n=== Movements ===\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas.

The text, in the first person, speaks of longing for Jesus.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Jones noted that the tenor part is particularly expressive.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The last movement has exactly the same music to the different text of the last stanza, creating a frame.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 2 ====\nThe second movement begins with excerpts from the Epistle to the Romans with \"{{lang|de|Es ist nun nichts Verdammliches an denen, die in Christo Jesu sind|italic=no}}\" (Now there is nothing damnable in those who are in Christ Jesus).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The difference of living in the flesh and the spirit is an aspect that will be repeated  throughout the motet.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The movement is also in E minor, but for five voices.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=4}} The text is rendered first in rhetorical homophony.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\nIn setting the first sentence, Bach accented the word \"nichts\" (nothing), repeating it twice, with long rests and echo dynamics. Jones noted that dramatic word painting of this kind was in the tradition of 17th-century motets, such as by [[Johann Christoph Bach]] and [[Johann Michael Bach]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 3 ====\n[[File:Picardy third Bach - BWV 81.7, mm. 12-13.png|thumb|upright=1.2|End of the third movement]]\nThe third movement is a five-part setting of the second stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=13}} \"{{lang|de|Unter deinen Schirmen bin ich f\u00fcr den St\u00fcrmen aller Feinde frei.|italic=no}}\" (Under your protection I am safe from the storms of all enemies).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} While the soprano provides the chorale melody, the lower voices supply vivid lines expressing the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 4 ====\nThe fourth movement sets the following verse from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Denn das Gesetz des Geistes, der da lebendig machet in Christo Jesu, hat mich frei gemacht von dem Gesetz der S\u00fcnde und des Todes|italic=no}}\" (For the law of the spirit, which gives life in Christ Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The thought is set for the two sopranos and alto, beginning in G major.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=15}} The sopranos often move in \"beatific\" third parallels.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 5 ====\nThe fifth movement is a setting of the third stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=16}} \"{{lang|de|Trotz dem alten Drachen|italic=no}}\" (Defiance to the old dragon).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The defiant opposition, also to death, fear and the rage of the world, is expressed without the chorale melody, which is freely paraphrased in the soprano.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Five voices take part in dramatic illustration of defiance, in the same rhetorical style as the beginning of the second movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} Defiance is expressed in powerful [[unison]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The voices also depict standing firmly and singing, again in rhetorical homophony, and reinforced in unison.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|pp=16\u201322}} [[John Eliot Gardiner]] noted that the firm stance against opposition could depict [[Martin Luther]]'s attitude, and also the composer's own stance.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT352 352]}}\n\n==== 6 ====\nThe central sixth movement sets verse 9 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|Ihr aber seid nicht fleischlich, sondern geistlich|italic=no}}\" (You, however, are not of the flesh, but rather of the Spirit).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Again beginning in G major, the tenor begins with a fugue theme that stresses the word \"geistlich\" (of the Spirit) by a long melisma in fast notes, while the opposite \"fleischlich\" is a long note stretched over the bar-line.{{sfn|Gardiner|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT351 351]}} The alto enters during the melisma. All five voices participate in a lively fugue,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|pp=22\u201328}} the only one within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The fugue is a double fugue, with a first theme for the first line, another for the second,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}} \"so anders Gottes Geist in euch wohnet\" (since the Spirit of God lives otherwise in you),{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} and then both combined.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 7 ====\nThe seventh movement is a four-part setting of the fourth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=30}} \"{{lang|de|Weg mit allen Sch\u00e4tzen|italic=no}}\" (Away with all treasures).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} While the soprano sings the chorale melody, the lower voices intensify the gesture dramatically: \"weg\" is repeated several times in fast succession.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Dahn 7|2018}} Throughout the movement, the lower voices intensify the expressiveness of the text.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n==== 8 ====\nThe eighth movement sets verse 10 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So aber Christus in euch ist, so ist der Leib zwar tot um der S\u00fcnde willen; der Geist aber ist das Leben um der Gerechtigkeit willen|italic=no}}\" (However if Christ is in you, then the body is dead indeed for the sake of sin; but the spirit is life for the sake of righteousness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} As in the fourth movement, it is set as a trio, this time for alto, tenor and bass, beginning in C major.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=33}} Third parallels in the upper voices resemble those in the fourth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=205}}\n\n==== 9 ====\nThe ninth movement is a setting of the fifth stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=36}} \"{{lang|de|Gute Nacht, o Wesen, das die Welt erlesen!|italic=no}}\" (Good night, existence).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} For the rejection of everything earthly, Bach composed a [[chorale fantasia]], with the cantus firmus in the alto voice, with two sopranos and tenor repeating \"Good night\" often.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|pp=36\u201341}} Jones pointed out that the absence of a bass may depict that \"the world\" lacks a firm foundation in Christ.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\nThe chorale melody used in this movement is slightly different from the one in the other settings within the motet.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}} It is a version which Bach used mostly in his earlier time in Weimar and before, while he used the other version exclusively in Leipzig. Melamed concluded that the movement may date from an earlier period.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} For Gardiner, the \"sublime\" music suggests the style of Bach's Weimar period.{{sfn|Gardiner|2012}}{{rp|10}} Jones, however, found the \"bewitchingly lyrical setting\" matching compositions from the mid-1720s in Leipzig,{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204}} comparing the music to the Sarabande from the [[Partitas for keyboard (Bach)|Partita No. 3, BWV 827]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n==== 10 ====\nThe tenth movement sets verse 11 from the Epistle, \"{{lang|de|So nun der Geist des, der Jesum von den Toten auferwecket hat, in euch wohnet|italic=no}}\" (So now the spirit that awakened Jesus from the dead dwells in you).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In symmetry, the music recalls that of the second movement.{{sfn|Wolf|2003|pp=42\u201345}}\n\n==== 11 ====\nThe motet ends with the same four-part setting as in the beginning, now with the text of the last stanza of the hymn,{{sfn|Wolf|2003|p=46}} \"{{lang|de|Weicht, ihr Trauergeister|italic=no}}\" (Hence, you spirits of sadness).{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}{{sfn|Dahn 1|2018}} The final line repeats the beginning, on the same melody: \"you stay with me even in sorrow, Jesus, my joy\".{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nBach's vivid setting of the contrasting texts, up to ilustrating single words, results in music of an unusual dramatic range.{{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} [[Christoph Wolff]] summarised: {{quote|This diversified structure of five-, four-, and three-part movements, with shifting configurations of voices and a highly interpretive word-tone relationship thoughout, wisely and sensibly combines choral exercise with theological education.{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}}}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nAfter Bach's death, the motets, unlike much of his other music, were kept continuously in the repertoire of the [[Thomanerchor]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}}\n\n=== Manuscripts and publication ===\nAs for most of Bach's motets, the autograph score of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has not survived. Three of the chorales, movements 1 (which is the same as 11), 3 and 7 are contained in Dietel's manuscript, a collection of 149 of Bach's chorale settings, dated around 1735.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}} In the five-part setting of movement 3, Dietel omitted the second soprano part.{{sfn|Dahn 3|2018}} Like most of Bach's output, the motet was not published in the composer's lifetime. It first appeared in print in a collection of motets by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] in 1802/03,{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=99}} edited by [[Johann Gottfried Schicht]], then the Gewandhauskapellmeister.{{sfn|Wolf, Staehelin|2002|p=269}}\n\nWith the other motets, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was published in 1892 in volume 39 of the [[Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe]] (BGA), edited by [[Franz W\u00fcllner]]. The [[New Bach Edition]] (''Neue Bach-Ausgabe'', NBA) published the score in 1965, edited by {{ill|Konrad Ameln|de}}, with critical commentary published in 1967.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} In 1995, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the vocal parts of the six motets BWV 225\u2013230 from the NBA in one volume, with a preface by [[Klaus Hofmann]].{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} The motets were published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 1975, edited by [[G\u00fcnter Graulich]], and again in 2003, edited by [[Uwe Wolf (musicologist)|Uwe Wolf]], as part of ''Stuttgarter Bach-Ausgaben'', a complete edition of Bach's vocal works.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=I}}\n\n=== Date and purpose ===\nBach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85}} Bernhard Friedrich Richter was the first to state, in the ''Bach-Jahrbuch'' of 1912, that the motets were music commissioned for special occasions.{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=VII}} He assigned a specific date to {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, the funeral on 18 July 1723 of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R. Melamed wrote in his 1995 book about Bach's motets that this is no conclusive evidence for a motet performance, but that the date was still \"nearly universally accepted\".{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}} The order of that particular service was found in 1982, mentioning neither a motet nor even the chorale.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}\n\n{{ill|Friedrich Smend|de}} was the first to state the motet's symmetrical structure, a feature which can also be found in Bach's ''[[St John Passion]]'' of 1724 and ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' of 1727, arguing for a date in the 1720s, assuming that the work was then newly composed.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86]}} According to Melamed, there is evidence that the motet is rather a compilation of partly older music, looking at the four-part setting of the chorale, which seems unusual for a basically five-part work, and at the older version of the chorale melody used as the [[cantus firmus]] in the ninth movement, which suggests an origin of that movement in Weimar or even earlier.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}} [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that the motet might be intended not for a funeral but for the education of the [[Thomanerchor]], as also [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'', BWV 225]].{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=249}} [[Richard D. P. Jones]] stated that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\n=== Recordings ===\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} has been recorded more than 60 times,{{sfn|ArkivMusic|2020}} mostly in combination with other motets by Bach.{{sfnref|ArkivMusic|2020}} Performers have to decide if they will use a boys' choir (as Bach had in mind) or a mixed choir, a small choir or larger group, continuo, and instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Wolf|2002|p=VII}}{{sfn|Veen|2010}} In 1985, [[Philippe Herreweghe]] led the [[Collegium Vocale Gent]] and [[La Chapelle Royale]]. [[Harry Christophers]] directed a recording by [[The Sixteen]] in 1989. [[Masaaki Suzuki]] conducted performances of the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] in 2009, using instruments playing ''colla parte''.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited sources ===\n''Bach Digital''\n* {{cite web\n| url = https://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalWork_work_00000284\n| title =  Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227; BC C 5 \n| website = [[Bach Digital]]\n| year = 2020\n| accessdate = 19 March 2020\n| ref = {{sfnref|Bach Digital|2020}}\n}}\n\n''Books''\n* {{cite book\n| last = Ameln\n| first = Konrad\n| url = https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/shop/product/details/BA5193/\n| title = Bach, Johann Sebastian / Jesu, meine Freude for five-part mixed choir in E minor BWV 227\n| website = [[B\u00e4renreiter]]\n| date = 1965\n| accessdate = 19 March 2020\n| ref = harv\n}} ISMN 979-0-00-649848-2\n* {{cite web\n| last = Gardiner\n| first = John Eliot\n| authorlink = John Eliot Gardiner\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lSBuAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT350\n| title = Music in the Castle of Heaven: A Portrait of Johann Sebastian Bach\n| publisher = Penguin UK\n| date = 2013\n| pages = 350\u2013352\n| isbn = 978-1-84-614721-0\n| ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| last = Hofmann\n| first = Klaus\n| authorlink = Klaus Hofmann\n| url = https://www.baerenreiter.com/en/shop/product/details/BA5193/\n| title = J.

However, because swelling is a common occurrence in pregnancy, its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre-eclampsia is not high. [[Pitting edema]] (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a health care provider.\n\nIn general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice. Further, a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Diagnosis, therefore, depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression after delivery.\n\n==Causes==\nThere is no definitive known cause of pre-eclampsia, though it is likely related to a number of factors.

The placenta of women with pre-eclampsia is abnormal and characterized by poor trophoblastic invasion.<ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" /> It is thought that this results in oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the release of factors that promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and other possible reactions.<ref name=Ei2012/><ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" /><ref name=DrifeMagowan>{{Cite book | last1 = Drife | first1 = James O. | last2 = Magowan | first2 = Brian | name-list-format = vanc | title = Clinical obstetrics and gynecology | year = 2004 | publisher = Saunders | location = Edinburgh, New York | isbn = 978-0-7020-1775-9 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/clinicalobstetri0000unse/page/367 367\u201370] | url = https://archive.org/details/clinicalobstetri0000unse/page/367 }}</ref>\n\nThe clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia are associated with general endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction and end-organ ischemia.<ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" /> Implicit in this generalized endothelial dysfunction may be an imbalance of [[angiogenic]] and [[anti-angiogenic]] factors.<ref name=Al2014 /> Both circulating and placental levels of [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) are higher in women with pre-eclampsia than in women with normal pregnancy.<ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" /> sFlt-1 is an anti-angiogenic protein that antagonizes [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF), both of which are proangiogenic factors.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Soluble [[endoglin]] (sEng) has also been shown to be elevated in women with pre-eclampsia and has anti-angiogenic properties, much like sFlt-1 does.<ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" />\n\nBoth sFlt-1 and sEng are upregulated in all pregnant women to some extent, supporting the idea that hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|maternal immune tolerance]] for a foreign placenta, it is not surprising that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled [[spiral arteries]] in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.\n\nOxidative stress may also play an important part in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the enzyme [[xanthine oxidase]] (XO) and this enzyme mainly occurs in the liver. One hypothesis is that the increased purine catabolism from placental hypoxia results in increased ROS production in the maternal liver and release into the maternal circulation that causes endothelial cell damage.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McMaster-Fay RA | title = Pre-eclampsia: a disease of oxidative stress resulting from the catabolism of DNA (primarily fetal) to uric acid by xanthine oxidase in the maternal liver; a hypothesis. | journal = Bioscience Hypotheses | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | pages = 35\u201343 | doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.01.002}}</ref>\n\nAbnormalities in the maternal [[immune system]] and insufficiency of [[gestational immune tolerance]] seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward [[T helper cell|Th<sub>1</sub> responses]] and the production of [[Interferon gamma|IFN-\u03b3]]. The origin of IFN-\u03b3 is not clearly identified and could be the [[natural killer cell]]s of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of [[T helper cells]], alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of [[regulatory T cell]]s in pregnancy.<ref name=\"Laresgoiti-Servitje\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Laresgoiti-Servitje E, G\u00f3mez-L\u00f3pez N, Olson DM | title = An immunological insight into the origins of pre-eclampsia | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 510\u201324 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20388637 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq007 | url = http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/5/510?etoc }}</ref> Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers.<ref name=\"Laresgoiti-Servitje\" /> It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal [[Nucleated red blood cell|erythroblasts]] as well as [[cell-free fetal DNA]] are increased in the maternal circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia.

These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells.

However, because swelling is a common occurrence in pregnancy, its utility as a distinguishing factor in pre-eclampsia is not high. [[Pitting edema]] (unusual swelling, particularly of the hands, feet, or face, notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on) can be significant, and should be reported to a health care provider.\n\nIn general, none of the signs of pre-eclampsia are specific, and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice. Further, a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn. Diagnosis, therefore, depends on finding a coincidence of several pre-eclamptic features, the final proof being their regression after delivery.\n\n==Causes==\nThere is no definitive known cause of pre-eclampsia, though it is likely related to a number of factors.

The placenta of women with pre-eclampsia is abnormal and characterized by poor trophoblastic invasion.<ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" /> It is thought that this results in oxidative stress, hypoxia, and the release of factors that promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and other possible reactions.<ref name=Ei2012/><ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" /><ref name=DrifeMagowan>{{Cite book | last1 = Drife | first1 = James O. | last2 = Magowan | first2 = Brian | name-list-format = vanc | title = Clinical obstetrics and gynecology | year = 2004 | publisher = Saunders | location = Edinburgh, New York | isbn = 978-0-7020-1775-9 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/clinicalobstetri0000unse/page/367 367\u201370] | url = https://archive.org/details/clinicalobstetri0000unse/page/367 }}</ref>\n\nThe clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia are associated with general endothelial dysfunction, including vasoconstriction and end-organ ischemia.<ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" /> Implicit in this generalized endothelial dysfunction may be an imbalance of [[angiogenic]] and [[anti-angiogenic]] factors.<ref name=Al2014 /> Both circulating and placental levels of [[soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]] (sFlt-1) are higher in women with pre-eclampsia than in women with normal pregnancy.<ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" /> sFlt-1 is an anti-angiogenic protein that antagonizes [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[placental growth factor]] (PIGF), both of which are proangiogenic factors.<ref name=Lancet2010/> Soluble [[endoglin]] (sEng) has also been shown to be elevated in women with pre-eclampsia and has anti-angiogenic properties, much like sFlt-1 does.<ref name=\"Mustafa 2012 1\u201319\" />\n\nBoth sFlt-1 and sEng are upregulated in all pregnant women to some extent, supporting the idea that hypertensive disease in pregnancy is a normal pregnancy adaptation gone awry. As natural killer cells are intimately involved in placentation and placentation involves a degree of [[Immune tolerance in pregnancy|maternal immune tolerance]] for a foreign placenta, it is not surprising that the maternal immune system might respond more negatively to the arrival of some placentae under certain circumstances, such as a placenta which is more invasive than normal. Initial maternal rejection of the placental cytotrophoblasts may be the cause of the inadequately remodeled [[spiral arteries]] in those cases of pre-eclampsia associated with shallow implantation, leading to downstream hypoxia and the appearance of maternal symptoms in response to upregulated sFlt-1 and sEng.\n\nOxidative stress may also play an important part in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the enzyme [[xanthine oxidase]] (XO) and this enzyme mainly occurs in the liver. One hypothesis is that the increased purine catabolism from placental hypoxia results in increased ROS production in the maternal liver and release into the maternal circulation that causes endothelial cell damage.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McMaster-Fay RA | title = Pre-eclampsia: a disease of oxidative stress resulting from the catabolism of DNA (primarily fetal) to uric acid by xanthine oxidase in the maternal liver; a hypothesis. | journal = Bioscience Hypotheses | year = 2008 | volume = 1 | pages = 35\u201343 | doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.01.002}}</ref>\n\nAbnormalities in the maternal [[immune system]] and insufficiency of [[gestational immune tolerance]] seem to play major roles in pre-eclampsia. One of the main differences found in pre-eclampsia is a shift toward [[T helper cell|Th<sub>1</sub> responses]] and the production of [[Interferon gamma|IFN-\u03b3]]. The origin of IFN-\u03b3 is not clearly identified and could be the [[natural killer cell]]s of the uterus, the placental dendritic cells modulating responses of [[T helper cells]], alterations in synthesis of or response to regulatory molecules, or changes in the function of [[regulatory T cell]]s in pregnancy.<ref name=\"Laresgoiti-Servitje\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Laresgoiti-Servitje E, G\u00f3mez-L\u00f3pez N, Olson DM | title = An immunological insight into the origins of pre-eclampsia | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 510\u201324 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20388637 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq007 | url = http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/16/5/510?etoc }}</ref> Aberrant immune responses promoting pre-eclampsia may also be due to an altered fetal allorecognition or to inflammatory triggers.<ref name=\"Laresgoiti-Servitje\" /> It has been documented that fetal cells such as fetal [[Nucleated red blood cell|erythroblasts]] as well as [[cell-free fetal DNA]] are increased in the maternal circulation in women who develop pre-eclampsia.

These cells differentiate into many placental cells types, including extravillous trophoblast cells.

He made his major-league debut at age 21 in 1946 and was a mainstay in the Yankees' lineup during the team's championship years beginning in 1949 and continuing through 1962. Despite his short stature (he was 5 feet 7 inches tall), Berra was a [[Glossary of baseball#P|power hitter]] and strong [[Catcher#Defensive_plays|defensive catcher]]. Berra played 18 seasons with the Yankees before retiring after the 1963 season.

Berra remained with the Mets for the next decade, serving the last four years as their manager. He returned to the Yankees in 1976, coaching them for eight seasons and managing for two, before coaching the [[Houston Astros]]. He was one of seven managers to lead both American and [[National League]] teams to the World Series.
