It is designed to prevent a black-out and [[g-LOC]] (g-induced loss of consciousness) caused by the blood pooling in the lower part of the body when under acceleration, thus depriving the brain of blood.<ref name=Balldin>{{cite book |author=Balldin, Ulf I |title=Acceleration effects on fighter pilots.

Hypoxia first causes a [[greyout (medical)|greyout]] (a dimming of the vision), also called brownout, followed by [[tunnel vision]] and ultimately complete loss of vision 'blackout' followed by g-induced Loss Of Consciousness or 'g-LOC'. The danger of g-LOC to aircraft pilots is magnified because on relaxation of g there is a period of disorientation before full sensation is re-gained.\nA g-suit does not so much increase the g-threshold, but makes it possible to sustain high g longer without excessive physical fatigue.  The resting g-tolerance of a typical person is anywhere from 3\u20135 g depending on the person.  A g-suit will typically add 1&nbsp;g of tolerance to that limit.  Pilots still need to practice the 'g-straining maneuver' that consists of tensing the abdominal muscles in order to tighten blood vessels so as to reduce blood pooling in the lower body.  High g is not comfortable, even with a g-suit.  In older [[fighter aircraft]], 6&nbsp;g was considered a high level, but with modern fighters 9&nbsp;g or more can be sustained structurally{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} making the pilot the critical factor in maintaining high maneuverability in close [[dogfight|aerial combat]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Design ==\nA g-suit is a special garment and generally takes the form of tightly-fitting [[trousers]], which fit either under or over (depending on the design) the [[flight suit]] worn by the aviator or astronaut. The trousers are fitted with inflatable bladders which, when pressurized through a g-sensitive [[valve]] in the aircraft or spacecraft, press firmly on the abdomen and legs, thus restricting the draining of blood away from the brain during periods of high acceleration. In addition, in some modern very high-g aircraft, the Anti-g suit effect is augmented by a small amount of pressure applied to the lungs ([[partial pressure]] breathing), which also enhances resistance to high G. The effects of anti-g suits and partial pressure breathing are straightforward to replicate in a simulator, although only continuous g  can be produced artificially in devices such as [[centrifuge]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nVarious designs of g-suit have been developed. They first used water-filled bladders around the lower body and legs. Later designs used air under pressure to inflate the bladders. These g-suits were lighter than the liquid-filled versions and are still in extensive use. However, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company [[Life Support Systems AG]] and the German [[:de:Autoflug|Autoflug]] collaborated to design the new Libelle suit for use with the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] aircraft, which reverts to liquid as the medium and improves on performance. The Libelle suit is under consideration for adoption by the [[United States Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofluglibelle.de/|title=Informationsseite \u2013 DENIC eG|website=www.autofluglibelle.de}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAs early as 1917, there were documented cases of pilots' [[g-LOC|loss of consciousness due to g]] (G-LOC) that were referred to as \"fainting in the air\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Head, Henry |title=The sense of stability and balance in the air. |journal=In: Milford H, ed.

Hypoxia first causes a [[greyout (medical)|greyout]] (a dimming of the vision), also called brownout, followed by [[tunnel vision]] and ultimately complete loss of vision 'blackout' followed by g-induced Loss Of Consciousness or 'g-LOC'. The danger of g-LOC to aircraft pilots is magnified because on relaxation of g there is a period of disorientation before full sensation is re-gained.\nA g-suit does not so much increase the g-threshold, but makes it possible to sustain high g longer without excessive physical fatigue.  The resting g-tolerance of a typical person is anywhere from 3\u20135 g depending on the person.  A g-suit will typically add 1&nbsp;g of tolerance to that limit.  Pilots still need to practice the 'g-straining maneuver' that consists of tensing the abdominal muscles in order to tighten blood vessels so as to reduce blood pooling in the lower body.  High g is not comfortable, even with a g-suit.  In older [[fighter aircraft]], 6&nbsp;g was considered a high level, but with modern fighters 9&nbsp;g or more can be sustained structurally{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} making the pilot the critical factor in maintaining high maneuverability in close [[dogfight|aerial combat]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Design ==\nA g-suit is a special garment and generally takes the form of tightly-fitting [[trousers]], which fit either under or over (depending on the design) the [[flight suit]] worn by the aviator or astronaut. The trousers are fitted with inflatable bladders which, when pressurized through a g-sensitive [[valve]] in the aircraft or spacecraft, press firmly on the abdomen and legs, thus restricting the draining of blood away from the brain during periods of high acceleration. In addition, in some modern very high-g aircraft, the Anti-g suit effect is augmented by a small amount of pressure applied to the lungs ([[partial pressure]] breathing), which also enhances resistance to high G. The effects of anti-g suits and partial pressure breathing are straightforward to replicate in a simulator, although only continuous g  can be produced artificially in devices such as [[centrifuge]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nVarious designs of g-suit have been developed. They first used water-filled bladders around the lower body and legs. Later designs used air under pressure to inflate the bladders. These g-suits were lighter than the liquid-filled versions and are still in extensive use. However, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] company [[Life Support Systems AG]] and the German [[:de:Autoflug|Autoflug]] collaborated to design the new Libelle suit for use with the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] aircraft, which reverts to liquid as the medium and improves on performance. The Libelle suit is under consideration for adoption by the [[United States Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofluglibelle.de/|title=Informationsseite \u2013 DENIC eG|website=www.autofluglibelle.de}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAs early as 1917, there were documented cases of pilots' [[g-LOC|loss of consciousness due to g]] (G-LOC) that were referred to as \"fainting in the air\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Head, Henry |title=The sense of stability and balance in the air. |journal=In: Milford H, ed.

Aviator g-suits apply uniform pressure to the lower legs to minimize the effects of high acceleration but research from the [[Canadian Space Agency]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/astronauts/osm_g-suit.asp|title=Canadian Space Agency|website=space.gc.ca|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204104813/http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/astronauts/osm_g-suit.asp|archive-date=2005-12-04|df=}}</ref> implies there might be a benefit in having a suit for [[astronauts]] that uses a \"milking action\" to increase blood flow to the upper body.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n=== Red Bull Air Race ===\n\nPilots in [[Red Bull Air Race World Championship]] have worn a g-suit called g-Race Suit since the 2009 season. The g-race suit is a liquid (water) filled, autonomous and aircraft independent working full-body g-protection system. It is tailor-made for each pilot and can be fine adjusted via lacings.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe g-race suit contains four so-called \"fluid muscles\" which are sealed, liquid-filled tubes. Each fluid muscle extends from the shoulder to the ankle. Two fluid muscles \u2013 each filled with approximately 1 litre of fluid  for a total of around {{convert|4|l|usgal}} per g-race suit \u2013 are routed vertically on the front side of the g-race suit and two are routed vertically on the rear side of the g-race suit. The suit weighs on average {{convert|6.5|kg|lb}} in total, and its fabric is made out of a special mix of [[Twaron]] and [[Nomex]]. The counter pressure effect occurs instantaneously without any time delay versus an up to two second delay before reaching full system protection in standard pneumatic, inflatable g-suits. The race pilot utilizes the g-race suit interactively by muscle straining and breathing techniques to achieve an improved [[cardiac output]] and thus improved G-protection.<ref name=\"g-race suit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullairrace.com/cs/Satellite/en_air/Article/New-Anti-G-Race-Suit-021238613644607?CategoryName=Red+Bull+Air+Race&p=1238611393596 |title=New Anti G-Race Suit |work=RedBullAirRace.com |year=2009 |access-date=2009-07-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715164735/http://www.redbullairrace.com/cs/Satellite/en_air/Article/New-Anti-G-Race-Suit-021238613644607?CategoryName=Red+Bull+Air+Race&p=1238611393596 |archive-date=2011-07-15 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[High-G training]]\n* [[Aviation medicine]]\n* [[Acceleration]]\n* [[Aerial warfare|Air combat]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|G-suits}}\n* [http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/antigsuit.html Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy & Spaceflight \u2013 Anti G Suits]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060819021947/http://www.physiol.usyd.edu.au/info/brhistory.html University of Sydney \u2013 History of the Department of Physiology]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090204070231/http://www.lssag.ch/website%2003%2014.html Libelle G-Multiplus]\n\n[[Category:Science and technology in Canada]]\n[[Category:Canadian inventions]]\n[[Category:Aircrew clothing]]\n[[Category:Environmental suits]]\n[[Category:Aviation medicine]]\n[[Category:Military aviation]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-suit"}

It is one of the earliest arcade games powered by the [[Sega System 24]] [[arcade system board]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:ARC Bonanza Bros. (Bonanza Brothers).png|thumb|left|Arcade screenshot]]\nBonanza Bros. is a [[shooter game|shooter]] [[platform game]] where players take the role of one or both of the brothers Robo (1P, red) and Mobo (2P, blue) (Mike and Spike in some PAL versions), who were modeled on [[The Blues Brothers]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The object of the game is to travel stealthily around each building while avoiding guards, retrieve several objects within a time limit, and move to the roof where a [[blimp]] is expecting the player with the loot. In this fashion the plot and gameplay resemble the older [[Atari 2600]] title ''[[Keystone Kapers]]'', but with added features that are similar to the ones in ''[[Lock 'n' Chase]]''. Two players can play cooperatively at the same time, as the screen is always split in two.\n\nThe places the brothers burgle include a bank, a millionaire's mansion, a casino, a mint, an [[art gallery]] and a treasury. While similar in graphics and gameplay, the story and the Bonanza Bros.' role changes from the original Japanese to the early western versions: in the former, the duo are thieves attempting to steal valuable treasures for profit whilst avoiding getting arrested; in the latter, they are recruited by the Police Chief of Badville to test security facilities and help the police recover evidence from various crooked businesses and institutions, but on the threat of jail if they fail to do so.\n\nThe player can walk, jump, shoot and move behind a column or large furniture, which allows both hiding and dodging shots from the guards, which can't be neutralized definitively, only stunned for a few seconds using the gun or pressing a door against them. They are alerted by sounds or with the Brothers entering their field of vision, and then either hide, call for help or fire against the player. Some guards have a [[riot shield]] and can only be hit when moving away. A player loses a [[1-up|life]] if hit by a guard's projectile or melee attack, attacked by a dog, or pressed by a door. Losing a life in these ways causes the player to drop all items. Running out of time both costs players a life and forces them to restart the stage.\n\n==Ports==\nThe arcade game was ported to the [[Sega Mega Drive]], [[Master System]], [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD|TurboGrafx-CD]] (Japan only), [[ZX Spectrum]] (Europe only), [[Amstrad CPC]] (Europe only), [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Sharp X68000]] (Japan only) and [[Atari ST]], with minor graphics differences, depending on the system, and some changes in the gameplay, mainly in the bonus stages.\n\n==Legacy==\nIt was included in the Japanese version of ''[[Sonic Gems Collection]]'' (it was removed in the Western release). It has also seen a [[Sega Ages]] release on the [[PlayStation 2]], and that version was included in the English compilation ''[[Sega Classics Collection]]''. The game appeared as part of the ''[[Sega Genesis Collection]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game next appeared in ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. Then the game is also playable in [[Sega Genesis Classics]] for [[PlayStation 4|PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and for PC\n\nThere are also 3 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] to the game. The first is called \"''[[Puzzle & Action: Tant-R]]''\" which was released in the year 1992, the second called \"''[[Puzzle & Action: Ichidant-R]]''\", which was released in the year 1994. These two arcade games were ported to the [[Sega Mega Drive]] and [[Sega Saturn]], and later packaged with the [[Sega Ages]] release of ''Bonanza Bros''. on the [[PlayStation 2]].

He studied [[engineering]] at the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] and graduated with a degree in [[Mechanical Engineering]] with Distinction in 1945. He then completed an MA in [[Economics]] in 1949 and his Ph.D. in [[Economics]] in 1953 both at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=populationassociation>[http://www.populationassociation.org/sidebar/paa-fund-campaign/honored-members/richard-a-easterlin/ Richard A.

Accessed November 15, 2017. \"Richard Easterlin was born in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, in 1926 and studied engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology, where he earned an ME degree with distinction in 1945.\"</ref>\n\nHe became interested in [[demography]] and [[population studies]] through his participation as a Research Associate from 1953 to 1955 in the landmark ''Study of population Redistribution and Economic Growth in the United States'' conducted by [[Simon Kuznets]] and Dorothy Thomas.\n\n==Academic career==\nWhilst completing his postgraduate studies, Easterlin worked as Instructor from 1948 to 1953 at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. After completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] he became an [[Assistant Professor]] of Economics from 1953 to 1956. He was also a Research Associate of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] from 1955 to 1956. From 1956 to 1960 he was an [[Associate Professor]] of Economics and also a Visiting Professor at Stanford University in 1960 to 1961. From 1956 to 1966 he was also a Member of the Research Staff [[National Bureau of Economic Research]]. He was then a full Professor of Economics from 1960 to 1978 and was the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor in Economics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1978 to 1982.\n\nWhilst at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], Easterlin served as the Chairman of the Department of Economics from 1958 to 1960, from 1961 to 1962 and in 1965 and 1968.
