As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism.

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June 2019, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Their claim it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters are demanding an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings, and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer youth in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June 2019 protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June 2019, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

By: Kalfatovic, Martin R., American National Biography (from Oxford University Press), 2010</ref>\n\nIn 1923 Savage applied for a Summer art program sponsored by the French government; although being more than qualified, she was turned down by the international judging committee solely because she was a black person.<ref>Bearden & Henderson, ''AHOAA'', p.&nbsp;169\u2013170</ref> Savage was deeply upset and questioned the committee, beginning the first of many public fights for [[equality before the law|equal rights]] in her life. Though appeals were made to the French government to reinstate the award, they had no effect and Savage was unable to study at the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts.<ref name=\":1\" /> The incident got press coverage on both sides of the Atlantic, and eventually, the sole supportive committee member sculptor [[Hermon Atkins MacNeil]] \u2013 who at one time had shared a studio with [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]] \u2013 invited her to study with him. She later cited him as one of her teachers.\n\nAfter completing studies at Cooper Union, Savage worked in Manhattan steam laundries to support herself and her family. Her father had been paralyzed by a stroke, and the family's home destroyed by a hurricane.  Her family from Florida moved into her small West 137th Street apartment. During this time she obtained her first commission for a bust of [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] for the Harlem Library. Her outstanding sculpture brought more commissions, including one for a bust of [[Marcus Garvey]]. Her bust of [[William Pickens]] Sr., a key figure in the [[NAACP]], earned praise for depicting an African American in a more humane, neutral way as opposed to stereotypes of the time, as did many of her works.<ref>{{cite book | title= Challenge of the Modern: African-American Artists 1925\u20131945 | publisher= The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York | volume= 1 | date= 2003 | location = New York, NY | isbn= 0-942949-24-2}}</ref> \n\nIn 1923 Savage married [[Robert Lincoln Poston]], a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Garvey.<ref>Ancestry.com shows Florida Divorce Index dated 1941 for James Savage from Augusta, in Palm Beach County.</ref>  Poston died of pneumonia aboard a ship while returning from [[Liberia]] as part of a [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] delegation in 1924. In 1925 Savage won a scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in Rome.  This scholarship covered only tuition, and she was not able to raise money for travel and living expenses. Thus, she was unable to attend. In the 1920s writer and eccentric [[Joe Gould (bohemian)|Joe Gould]] became infatuated with Savage. He wrote her \"endless letters,\" telephoned her constantly, and wanted to marry her.

Savage cultivated a garden and sold pigeons, chickens, and eggs.  The K-B Products Corporation, the world's largest growers of mushrooms at that time, employed Savage as a laboratory assistant in the company's cancer research facility. She acquired a car and learned to drive to enable her commute. Herman K. Knaust, director of the laboratory, encouraged Savage to pursue her artistic career and provided her with art supplies. Savage created and taught art and sculpted friends and neighbors. Her last commissioned work was for Knaust and was that of the American journalist and author Poultney Bigelow, whose father, John, was U.S. Minister to France during the Civil War.\nHer few neighbors said that she was always making something with her hands.<ref>AHOAAA, p.&nbsp;179.</ref>\n\nMuch of her work is in clay or plaster, as she could not often afford bronze.

The [[Great Depression]] had almost stopped art sales. She pushed on, and in 1934 became the first African-American artist to be elected to the [[National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=African American Almanac|last=Bracks|first=Lean'tin|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2012|isbn=9781578593231|location=Canton, MI|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericana0000brac}}</ref> She then launched the Savage Studio of Arts and Crafts, located in a basement on West 143rd Street in [[Harlem]]. She opened her studio to anyone who wanted to [[Painting|paint]], [[Drawing|draw]], or sculpt. Her many young students included the future nationally-known artists [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Norman Lewis (artist)|Norman Lewis]], and [[Gwendolyn Knight]]. Another student was the sociologist [[Kenneth B. Clark]] whose later research contributed to the 1954 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that ruled school segregation unconstitutional. Her school evolved into the [[Harlem Community Art Center]]; 1500 people of all ages and abilities participated in her workshops, learning from her multi-cultural staff, and showing work around New York City. Funds from the [[Works Progress Administration]] helped, but old struggles of discrimination were revived between Savage and WPA officials who objected to her having a leadership role.<ref>AHOAAA p.&nbsp;174.</ref>\n\nSavage was one of four women and only two African Americans to receive a professional commission from the Board of Design of the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].<ref name=\":1\" /> She created [https://web.archive.org/web/20170312063758/http://www.1939nyworldsfair.com/worlds_fair/wf_tour/zone-2/the-harp.htm ''Lift Every Voice and Sing''] (also known as \"The Harp\"), inspired by [[Lift Every Voice and Sing|the song]] by [[James Weldon Johnson|James Weldon]] and [[Rosamond Johnson]].  The 16-foot-tall [[Plasterwork|plaster]] sculpture was the most popular and most photographed work at the fair; small metal souvenir copies were sold, and many postcards of the piece were purchased. The work reinterpreted the musical instrument to feature 12 singing African-American youth in graduated heights as its strings, with the harp's sounding board transformed into an arm and a hand. In the front, a kneeling young man offered music in his hands.<ref name=\"Biography.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/augusta-savage-40495#profile|title=Augusta Savage|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>  Savage did not have funds to have it cast in [[bronze]] or to move and store it.  Like other temporary installations, the sculpture was destroyed at the close of the fair.<ref name=\"Biography.com\" />\n\n[[File:AugustaSavage.jpg|thumb|Augusta Savage working on a sculpture]]\nSavage opened two galleries whose shows were well attended and well reviewed, but few sales resulted and the galleries closed.  The last major showing of her work occurred in 1939.<ref name=\":1\" /> Deeply depressed by her financial struggle, in the 1940s Savage moved to a farmhouse in Saugerties, New York. While in Saugerties, she established close ties with her neighbors and welcomed family and friends from New York City to her rural home.  Savage cultivated a garden and sold pigeons, chickens, and eggs.  The K-B Products Corporation, the world's largest growers of mushrooms at that time, employed Savage as a laboratory assistant in the company's cancer research facility. She acquired a car and learned to drive to enable her commute. Herman K. Knaust, director of the laboratory, encouraged Savage to pursue her artistic career and provided her with art supplies. Savage created and taught art and sculpted friends and neighbors. Her last commissioned work was for Knaust and was that of the American journalist and author Poultney Bigelow, whose father, John, was U.S. Minister to France during the Civil War.\nHer few neighbors said that she was always making something with her hands.<ref>AHOAAA, p.&nbsp;179.</ref>\n\nMuch of her work is in clay or plaster, as she could not often afford bronze. One of her most famous [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] is titled ''Gamin'' which is on permanent display at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] in Washington, D.C.; a life-sized version is in the collection of the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]]. At the time of its creation, ''Gamin'', which is modeled after a Harlem youth, was voted most popular in an exhibition of over 200 works by black artists.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Black Women of the Harlem Renaissance Era|last =|first =|publisher = Rowman & Littlefield|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-8108-8542-4|location = London, United Kingdom|pages = 193}}</ref> Her style can be described as realistic, expressive, and sensitive.

{"title_page": "Conservation and restoration of neon objects", "text_new": "{{morefootnotes|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:King Cross repair, Poznan.jpg|thumbnail|right|Repairing an historical neon sign in situ]]\nThe '''conservation and restoration of neon objects''' is the process of caring for and maintaining neon objects (artworks), and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to ensure their long-term viability, when desired.\n\n==Neon Technology==\n[[Georges Claude]], a French engineer, developed neon technology in 1910.  Claude introduced neon technology in [[Paris]], and it later became popular in America during the 1920s for use in advertising signage. Its popularity rose until the 1940s, after which neon signage was used less due to the invention of inexpensive plastics.\n\nNeon lights are low-pressure gas discharge bulbs. They produce light by charging [[noble gases]] in glass cathode tubes with electricity.\n\n===Tubes===\nNeon bulbs are composed of noble gases sealed in glass tubing. The tubing can be bent by a professional glass blower or neon vendor into a variety of shapes to produce different imagery or text. The tube is vacuum-pumped to remove all air, after which a small amount of selected gases are pumped into the tube prior to permanently sealing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stern |first=Rudi |date=1979 |title=Let There Be Neon |url=https://www.amazon.com/Let-there-neon-Rudi-Stern/dp/0810912554 |location=New York |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers |page=132 |isbn=0-8109-1255-4}}</ref>\n\nEach end of the tube is fitted with metal terminals called electrodes, also as known as cathodes.  When the electrodes are connected an energy source, the tube will glow as the gas becomes electrically excited. Different gases produce different colors; in addition, the glass tubing can also be coated or tinted, and different tubing and gas combinations produce a range of 150 colors.\n\n===Gases===\nNoble gases are sealed inside airtight cathode tubes, and produce light when they are electrically excited. Different gases and gas combinations will produce different colors, and are used in varying degrees in neon lights:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Gas!! Frequency of Use!! Color Produced\n|-\n| [[Neon]]|| Very Popular || Orange-Red\n|-\n| [[Argon]] || Very Popular || Blue-Lavender\n|-\n| [[Yellow Phosphor]] || Common || Yellow; Orange\n|-\n| [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]|| Common || Blue; Green; Yellow\n|-\n| [[Helium]] || Common || White\n|-\n| [[Xenon]] || Rare || Blue-White\n|-\n| [[Krypton]] || Rare || White-Green\n|}\n\n==Neon in fine art==\nPrior to the 1960s, neon technology was associated with advertising and was not considered fine art. In the 1960s, visual artists began experimenting with neon in mixed media and installation artworks. Prominent neon artworks during this time include [[Jasper Johns]]\u2019 ''Field Painting'' (c. 1963-1964), [[James Rosenquist|James Rosenquist\u2019s]] ''Tumbleweed'' (1963-1966), and [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s]] ''Green Shirt'' (1965-1967).\n\nChryssa, a Greek artist, is largely credited with establishing neon as a visual art form. She was very active in the 1960s and 70s and created large-scale works with a focus on and constant incorporation of neon.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/arts/chryssa-artist-who-saw-neons-potential-as-a-medium-dies-at-79.html |title=Chryssa, Artist Who Saw Neon\u2019s Potential as a Medium, Dies at 79|last=Fox|first=Margalit|publisher=Arts |date=18 January 2014 |website=The New York Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref> Other artists began exploring the neon technology in 1970s, and have continued to do so in contemporary art making.\n\nSome artists both design and create neon artworks by learning the skill set; however, the majority of artists rely on professional neon vendors to fabricate artworks following the artists\u2019 design.\n\nNeon artworks can be found in many permanent public collections, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL, and the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, D.C. In 1981, [[Lili Lakich]] and Richard Jenkins founded the [[Museum of Neon Art]] (MONA) in Los Angeles, whose collection preserves and exhibits historical neon advertisements and neon fine art.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-neon-downtown25-2009sep25-story.html |title=L.A.'s Museum of Neon Art is Glowing, Glowing, Gone|last=DiMassa|first=Cara Mia|date=25 September 2009 |website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref>  In 2009, the museum closed its Los Angeles location, and reopened in November, 2015, in [[Glendale, California]].\n\n==Collection care and maintenance of neon artworks==\n\n===Unpacking===\nUnpacking a neon artwork slowly and carefully will help avoid damage. As the glass tubes are fragile, they may become damaged during shipping. Preparing a condition report of the work after receipt will document if any of the tubes or components were cracked or broken during transit, and can be addressed prior to display. Unpacking artworks in teams of at least two people will better allow safer handling of the work, and may aid in documentation and recording.\n\n===Cleaning===\nOver time, neon artworks may collect dust. To ensure safety of personnel and the artwork, neon artworks should be turned off and unplugged prior to any cleaning. Trained professionals may undertake cleaning the work with approved materials such as a feather duster or dry paintbrush. The use of water or other cleaning liquids may pose a safety hazard due to potential contact with the electrical components. A professional conservator, specialist, or electrician should be consulted whenever:\n\n*Any component of the artwork requires more than a light dusting.\n*Part or all of the neon tubes are flickering/failing to illuminate.\n* There is any rusting of the metal support structures. \n*The piece incurs any damage.\n\n===Electrical safety===\n'''Outlets:''' Neon artworks require electricity in order to function. A building electrical engineer should always be consulted prior to installing and displaying a neon artwork to confirm safe use of an electrical outlet. An outlet should never be overloaded. If an outlet feels warm, an electrician should be consulted before further use.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nfpa.org/safety-information/for-consumers/causes/electrical/electrical-safety-in-the-home/electrical-safety-tips|title=Electrical Safety Tips |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2015 |website=National Fire Prevention Association |access-date=2 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n'''Cords:''' Electrical cords connecting a neon artwork to a power source should be checked on a regular basis for any signs of fraying or wear and tear. The placement of cords is also important. If cords are run in high traffic areas, they may pose a tripping hazard to visitors, which could potentially result in personal injury and damage to the cord and/or artwork. The placement of cords in and against walls and out of traffic areas provide better safety and use. Use of [[extension cords]] are not recommended, as they increase the risk of potential electrical and tripping hazards. Review of the artwork and its installation, including outlet and cord placement, by curatorial, installation, and electrical staff will help ensure the safety of the artwork.\n\n'''Transformers:''' A transformer  is used to convert electricity into use by the neon sign. Transformers last approximate ten to fifteen years, and older transformers may fail or pose safety risks, and require replacement. Failure to replace an older transformer may result in flickering in the neon artwork, or complete failure to light. It is important to consult an electrical engineer or professional to confirm the voltage type and requirements for the replacement transformer. When cataloging a neon artwork, the transformer type and age may be noted in the artwork record, along with a reminder about potential future transformer replacements.\n\nLike other media, neon artworks should be monitored and condition reports performed on a regular basis. If an artwork appears to flicker or fails to illuminate, the work can first be assessed on display. Potential problems may include damage to the tubes, disruptions to the electrical components, including frayed wires or unplugged cords, or potential disruptions of the electrical supply (such as a power outage in the building or circuit). Prior to removing from display, the work should be turned off and disconnected from the electrical source. Flickering may indicate a problem with gas pressures inside the tubes (possibly a result of age and/or damaged tubes) or a failing transformer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/25-signs.htm|title=The Preservation of Historic Signs|last=Auer |first=Michael J. |date=October 1991| publisher=Preservation Briefs|website=National Park Service|access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Handling damaged neon===\nCracked or damaged neon tubes present potential health risks from contact with broken glass and exposure to mercury, a heavy metal contaminant, in gas form.  Though any mercury vapor, if present, will be in small amounts,<ref>{{cite web|title=IMERC Fact Sheet Mercury Use in Lighting|url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/lighting.cfm |date=2008|website=Interstate Mercury Education & Reduction Clearinghouse|publisher=Northeast Management Waste Officials' Association|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> steps should still be taken to avoid contamination. If a neon tube appears damaged, it should not be handled. If handling is required for removal, barrier gloves, such as nitrile, and protective covering, such an apron or smock, will help avoid potential contamination to personnel. Broken tubes should be stored separately from other collection items to avoid contamination, and clearly labeled with hazard labels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Contaminated Museum Collections|url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/upload/Contaminated_Collections_FAQs.pdf|date=2006 |website=Interior Museum|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> The broken tubes will require assessment from a professional conservator/neon specialist.\n\n==Re-fabrication==\nNeon technology is non-archival. The gases have limited lifespans, and older electrical components will degrade over time. This may result in a limited display capacity for a neon work, e.g. diminished or intermittent light, or a complete loss of function, as well as pose safety risks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Winslow|first1=Margaret|title=Conservation of Rafael Ferrer's Neon Corner|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/http://www.delart.org/conservation-of-rafael-ferrers-neon-corner/|publisher=Delaware Art Museum|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other traditional art mediums, such as painting, conservation for neon artworks and other new materials does not necessarily focus on preserving and repairing the original materials. As neon is a newer technology and media, there is less data available about how the media changes over time and how to inhibit further degradation. In order to successfully conserve a contemporary artwork such as neon, the conservator must \n* identify the materials and understand are they were applied and function.\n*collect detailed information about their alteration overt time.\n*preserve the artist's intent, which must therefore be documented.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chiantore|first1=Oscar|last2=Rava |first2=Antonio|date=2012 |title=Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|page=16 |isbn=978-1-60606-104-6}}</ref>\n\nIf the media or technology cannot be safely recovered or addressed, new and replacement technology may be used to return the artwork closest to the state originally envisioned by the artist. This refabrication may be undertaken by a conservator, or potentially by the artist himself/herself. This may include replacing the neon tubes, electrical components such as cords and transformers, the work's support structure, or other media included in the work.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hileman|first1=Kristen|title=BMA Voices: Re-fabricating a beloved sculpture|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/bma-voices-re-fabricating-a-beloved-sculpture/|website=BMA Blog|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn example of refabrication is the conservation of [[Rockne Krebs]]' ''Miami Line''. In 1984, the Miami-Dade County's Art in Public Places program commissioned Krebs to create a public artwork for the Metrorail bridge. The resulting work, ''Miami Line'', consisted of a rainbow of neon lights spanning the 1,540 bridge. Over time, the vibrations caused by trains on the bridge caused the neon lights to burn out, and by 2013, the entire work was no longer illuminated. The Art in Public Places program worked with the artist's estate to develop a plan to recreate the work using LED lights, which would be resistant to train vibrations, but still maintain the visual effect created by the artist. Electrical assessments and conservation of the work began in 2014, and the work will be relit upon completion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Art in Public Places Annual Report 2014|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/mayor/library/memos-and-reports/2015/04/04.22.15-Art-in-Public-Places-Annual-Report-FY-2014.pdf|publisher=Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs|page=10|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the case of a potentially burnt out neon tube, a conservator may identify the burned out tube portion of a neon artwork through use of a neon light tester, also known as a [[test light]] or voltage tester. This electronic test device is used to determine whether an electric current is running through the equipment being tested.\n\n==Replication==\nReplication differs from Re-fabrication in that the original artwork is not altered, and instead a copy is produced for temporary exhibition purposes. While the replica may not contain the same materials used in the original artwork, the finished product is approximately identical of the original.\n\nReplication can only be undertaken with the approval of the artist or the artist's estate.

Claude introduced neon technology in [[Paris]], and it later became popular in America during the 1920s for use in advertising signage. Its popularity rose until the 1940s, after which neon signage was used less due to the invention of inexpensive plastics.\n\nNeon lights are low-pressure gas discharge bulbs. They produce light by charging [[noble gases]] in glass cathode tubes with electricity.\n\n===Tubes===\nNeon bulbs are composed of noble gases sealed in glass tubing. The tubing can be bent by a professional glass blower or neon vendor into a variety of shapes to produce different imagery or text. The tube is vacuum-pumped to remove all air, after which a small amount of selected gases are pumped into the tube prior to permanently sealing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stern |first=Rudi |date=1979 |title=Let There Be Neon |url=https://www.amazon.com/Let-there-neon-Rudi-Stern/dp/0810912554 |location=New York |publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers |page=132 |isbn=0-8109-1255-4}}</ref>\n\nEach end of the tube is fitted with metal terminals called electrodes, also as known as cathodes.  When the electrodes are connected an energy source, the tube will glow as the gas becomes electrically excited. Different gases produce different colors; in addition, the glass tubing can also be coated or tinted, and different tubing and gas combinations produce a range of 150 colors.\n\n===Gases===\nNoble gases are sealed inside airtight cathode tubes, and produce light when they are electrically excited. Different gases and gas combinations will produce different colors, and are used in varying degrees in neon lights:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Gas!! Frequency of Use!! Color Produced\n|-\n| [[Neon]]|| Very Popular || Orange-Red\n|-\n| [[Argon]] || Very Popular || Blue-Lavender\n|-\n| [[Yellow Phosphor]] || Common || Yellow; Orange\n|-\n| [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]|| Common || Blue; Green; Yellow\n|-\n| [[Helium]] || Common || White\n|-\n| [[Xenon]] || Rare || Blue-White\n|-\n| [[Krypton]] || Rare || White-Green\n|}\n\n==Neon in fine art==\nPrior to the 1960s, neon technology was associated with advertising and was not considered fine art. In the 1960s, visual artists began experimenting with neon in mixed media and installation artworks. Prominent neon artworks during this time include [[Jasper Johns]]\u2019 ''Field Painting'' (c. 1963-1964), [[James Rosenquist|James Rosenquist\u2019s]] ''Tumbleweed'' (1963-1966), and [[Robert Rauschenberg|Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s]] ''Green Shirt'' (1965-1967).\n\nChryssa, a Greek artist, is largely credited with establishing neon as a visual art form. She was very active in the 1960s and 70s and created large-scale works with a focus on and constant incorporation of neon.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/arts/chryssa-artist-who-saw-neons-potential-as-a-medium-dies-at-79.html |title=Chryssa, Artist Who Saw Neon\u2019s Potential as a Medium, Dies at 79|last=Fox|first=Margalit|publisher=Arts |date=18 January 2014 |website=The New York Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref> Other artists began exploring the neon technology in 1970s, and have continued to do so in contemporary art making.\n\nSome artists both design and create neon artworks by learning the skill set; however, the majority of artists rely on professional neon vendors to fabricate artworks following the artists\u2019 design.\n\nNeon artworks can be found in many permanent public collections, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], Chicago, IL, and the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, D.C. In 1981, [[Lili Lakich]] and Richard Jenkins founded the [[Museum of Neon Art]] (MONA) in Los Angeles, whose collection preserves and exhibits historical neon advertisements and neon fine art.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-neon-downtown25-2009sep25-story.html |title=L.A.'s Museum of Neon Art is Glowing, Glowing, Gone|last=DiMassa|first=Cara Mia|date=25 September 2009 |website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref>  In 2009, the museum closed its Los Angeles location, and reopened in November, 2015, in [[Glendale, California]].\n\n==Collection care and maintenance of neon artworks==\n\n===Unpacking===\nUnpacking a neon artwork slowly and carefully will help avoid damage. As the glass tubes are fragile, they may become damaged during shipping. Preparing a condition report of the work after receipt will document if any of the tubes or components were cracked or broken during transit, and can be addressed prior to display. Unpacking artworks in teams of at least two people will better allow safer handling of the work, and may aid in documentation and recording.\n\n===Cleaning===\nOver time, neon artworks may collect dust. To ensure safety of personnel and the artwork, neon artworks should be turned off and unplugged prior to any cleaning. Trained professionals may undertake cleaning the work with approved materials such as a feather duster or dry paintbrush. The use of water or other cleaning liquids may pose a safety hazard due to potential contact with the electrical components. A professional conservator, specialist, or electrician should be consulted whenever:\n\n*Any component of the artwork requires more than a light dusting.\n*Part or all of the neon tubes are flickering/failing to illuminate.\n* There is any rusting of the metal support structures. \n*The piece incurs any damage.\n\n===Electrical safety===\n'''Outlets:''' Neon artworks require electricity in order to function. A building electrical engineer should always be consulted prior to installing and displaying a neon artwork to confirm safe use of an electrical outlet. An outlet should never be overloaded. If an outlet feels warm, an electrician should be consulted before further use.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nfpa.org/safety-information/for-consumers/causes/electrical/electrical-safety-in-the-home/electrical-safety-tips|title=Electrical Safety Tips |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2015 |website=National Fire Prevention Association |access-date=2 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\n'''Cords:''' Electrical cords connecting a neon artwork to a power source should be checked on a regular basis for any signs of fraying or wear and tear. The placement of cords is also important. If cords are run in high traffic areas, they may pose a tripping hazard to visitors, which could potentially result in personal injury and damage to the cord and/or artwork. The placement of cords in and against walls and out of traffic areas provide better safety and use. Use of [[extension cords]] are not recommended, as they increase the risk of potential electrical and tripping hazards. Review of the artwork and its installation, including outlet and cord placement, by curatorial, installation, and electrical staff will help ensure the safety of the artwork.\n\n'''Transformers:''' A transformer  is used to convert electricity into use by the neon sign. Transformers last approximate ten to fifteen years, and older transformers may fail or pose safety risks, and require replacement. Failure to replace an older transformer may result in flickering in the neon artwork, or complete failure to light. It is important to consult an electrical engineer or professional to confirm the voltage type and requirements for the replacement transformer. When cataloging a neon artwork, the transformer type and age may be noted in the artwork record, along with a reminder about potential future transformer replacements.\n\nLike other media, neon artworks should be monitored and condition reports performed on a regular basis. If an artwork appears to flicker or fails to illuminate, the work can first be assessed on display. Potential problems may include damage to the tubes, disruptions to the electrical components, including frayed wires or unplugged cords, or potential disruptions of the electrical supply (such as a power outage in the building or circuit). Prior to removing from display, the work should be turned off and disconnected from the electrical source. Flickering may indicate a problem with gas pressures inside the tubes (possibly a result of age and/or damaged tubes) or a failing transformer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/25-signs.htm|title=The Preservation of Historic Signs|last=Auer |first=Michael J. |date=October 1991| publisher=Preservation Briefs|website=National Park Service|access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Handling damaged neon===\nCracked or damaged neon tubes present potential health risks from contact with broken glass and exposure to mercury, a heavy metal contaminant, in gas form.  Though any mercury vapor, if present, will be in small amounts,<ref>{{cite web|title=IMERC Fact Sheet Mercury Use in Lighting|url=http://www.newmoa.org/prevention/mercury/imerc/factsheets/lighting.cfm |date=2008|website=Interstate Mercury Education & Reduction Clearinghouse|publisher=Northeast Management Waste Officials' Association|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> steps should still be taken to avoid contamination. If a neon tube appears damaged, it should not be handled. If handling is required for removal, barrier gloves, such as nitrile, and protective covering, such an apron or smock, will help avoid potential contamination to personnel. Broken tubes should be stored separately from other collection items to avoid contamination, and clearly labeled with hazard labels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Contaminated Museum Collections|url=https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/museum/upload/Contaminated_Collections_FAQs.pdf|date=2006 |website=Interior Museum|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior |accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> The broken tubes will require assessment from a professional conservator/neon specialist.\n\n==Re-fabrication==\nNeon technology is non-archival. The gases have limited lifespans, and older electrical components will degrade over time. This may result in a limited display capacity for a neon work, e.g. diminished or intermittent light, or a complete loss of function, as well as pose safety risks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Winslow|first1=Margaret|title=Conservation of Rafael Ferrer's Neon Corner|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/http://www.delart.org/conservation-of-rafael-ferrers-neon-corner/|publisher=Delaware Art Museum|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other traditional art mediums, such as painting, conservation for neon artworks and other new materials does not necessarily focus on preserving and repairing the original materials. As neon is a newer technology and media, there is less data available about how the media changes over time and how to inhibit further degradation. In order to successfully conserve a contemporary artwork such as neon, the conservator must \n* identify the materials and understand are they were applied and function.\n*collect detailed information about their alteration overt time.\n*preserve the artist's intent, which must therefore be documented.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chiantore|first1=Oscar|last2=Rava |first2=Antonio|date=2012 |title=Conserving Contemporary Art: Issues, Methods, Materials, and Research |location=Los Angeles, CA |publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|page=16 |isbn=978-1-60606-104-6}}</ref>\n\nIf the media or technology cannot be safely recovered or addressed, new and replacement technology may be used to return the artwork closest to the state originally envisioned by the artist. This refabrication may be undertaken by a conservator, or potentially by the artist himself/herself. This may include replacing the neon tubes, electrical components such as cords and transformers, the work's support structure, or other media included in the work.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hileman|first1=Kristen|title=BMA Voices: Re-fabricating a beloved sculpture|url=http://blog.artbma.org/2014/11/bma-voices-re-fabricating-a-beloved-sculpture/|website=BMA Blog|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAn example of refabrication is the conservation of [[Rockne Krebs]]' ''Miami Line''. In 1984, the Miami-Dade County's Art in Public Places program commissioned Krebs to create a public artwork for the Metrorail bridge. The resulting work, ''Miami Line'', consisted of a rainbow of neon lights spanning the 1,540 bridge. Over time, the vibrations caused by trains on the bridge caused the neon lights to burn out, and by 2013, the entire work was no longer illuminated. The Art in Public Places program worked with the artist's estate to develop a plan to recreate the work using LED lights, which would be resistant to train vibrations, but still maintain the visual effect created by the artist. Electrical assessments and conservation of the work began in 2014, and the work will be relit upon completion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Art in Public Places Annual Report 2014|url=http://www.miamidade.gov/mayor/library/memos-and-reports/2015/04/04.22.15-Art-in-Public-Places-Annual-Report-FY-2014.pdf|publisher=Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs|page=10|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the case of a potentially burnt out neon tube, a conservator may identify the burned out tube portion of a neon artwork through use of a neon light tester, also known as a [[test light]] or voltage tester. This electronic test device is used to determine whether an electric current is running through the equipment being tested.\n\n==Replication==\nReplication differs from Re-fabrication in that the original artwork is not altered, and instead a copy is produced for temporary exhibition purposes. While the replica may not contain the same materials used in the original artwork, the finished product is approximately identical of the original.\n\nReplication can only be undertaken with the approval of the artist or the artist\u2019s estate. Bruce Nauman is an artist who requires four criteria be met to replicate his original neon artworks. These criteria are:\n# The original neon must still be in existence and in working order.\n# The current owner must agree to loan the work prior to the creation of a replica.\n# The display credit line for the loaned artwork acknowledges the work on view is an exhibition copy and acknowledges the owner of the original artwork.\n# The replica will be destroyed at the completion of the exhibition, which must be proven through photographic documentation.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Conservation of Bruce Nauman's Neon Templates|url=http://theglasshouse.org/learn/the-conservation-of-bruce-naumans-neon-templates/|website=The Glass House |publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Neon artists==\n[[File:CHRYSSA 1995.005CN.0891 derivedA5.jpg|thumb|right|Folded Forms, a neon artwork by Chryssa, 1990-1995, Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art]]\n*[[Stephen Antonakos]]\n* [[Chryssa]] \n* [[Shezad Dawood]]\n* [[Frida Blumenberg]]\n* [[Tracey Emin]]\n* [[Dan Flavin]]\n* [[Michael Hayden (artist)|Michael Hayden]]\n* [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]]\n* [[Joseph Kosuth]] \n* [[Piotr Kowalski]] \n* [[Lili Lakich]]  \n* [[Mario Merz]] \n* [[Victor Millonzi]]\n* [[Maurizio Nannucci]] \n* [[Bruce Nauman]]\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Navarro]] \n* [[Keith Sonnier]]\n* [[Tim White-Sobieski]]\n*[[Willem Volkersz]]\n\n==Neon studios and conservators==\n*'''Light Writers Neon, Inc.'''
