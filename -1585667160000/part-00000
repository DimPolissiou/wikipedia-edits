The difference between the two terms is not related to choice of analytical platform: although metabonomics is more associated with [[NMR spectroscopy]] and metabolomics with [[mass spectrometry]]-based techniques, this is simply because of usages amongst different groups that have popularized the different terms. While there is still no absolute agreement, there is a growing consensus that 'metabolomics' places a greater emphasis on metabolic profiling at a cellular or organ level and is primarily concerned with normal endogenous metabolism. 'Metabonomics' extends metabolic profiling to include information about perturbations of metabolism caused by environmental factors (including diet and toxins), disease processes, and the involvement of extragenomic influences, such as [[gut microflora]]. This is not a trivial difference; metabolomic studies should, by definition, exclude metabolic contributions from extragenomic sources, because these are external to the system being studied. However, in practice, within the field of human disease research there is still a large degree of overlap in the way both terms are used, and they are often in effect synonymous.<ref name = DGRref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson DG | title = Metabonomics in toxicology: a review | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 809\u201322 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15689416 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfi102 }}</ref>\n\n==Exometabolomics==\n{{main|Exometabolomics}}\nExometabolomics, or \"metabolic footprinting\", is the study of extracellular metabolites.

This complex mixture can be simplified prior to detection by separating some analytes from others. Separation achieves various goals: analytes which cannot be resolved by the detector may be separated in this step; in MS analysis [[Ion suppression in liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry|ion suppression]] is reduced; the retention time of the analyte serves as information regarding its identity.  This separation step is not mandatory and is often omitted in NMR and \"shotgun\" based approaches such as [[shotgun lipidomics]].\n\n[[Gas chromatography]] (GC), especially when interfaced with mass spectrometry ([[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|GC-MS]]), is a widely used separation technique for metabolomic analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogbaga CC, Stepien P, Dyson BC, Rattray NJ, Ellis DI, Goodacre R, Johnson GN | title = Biochemical Analyses of Sorghum Varieties Reveal Differential Responses to Drought | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = e0154423 | date = 6 May 2016 | pmid = 27153323 | pmc = 4859509 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0154423 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1154423O }}</ref> GC offers very high chromatographic resolution, and can be used in conjunction with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) or a mass spectrometer (GC-MS).

In cases where greater resolving power is required, two-dimensional chromatography ([[GCxGC]]) can be applied.\n\n[[High performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) has emerged as the most common separation technique for metabolomic analysis. With the advent of [[electrospray ionization]], HPLC was coupled to MS. In contrast with [[Gas-liquid chromatography|GC]], HPLC has lower chromatographic resolution, but requires no derivatization for polar molecules, and separates molecules in the liquid phase. Additionally HPLC has the advantage that a much wider range of analytes can be measured with a higher sensitivity than GC methods.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gika HG, Theodoridis GA, Wingate JE, Wilson ID | title = Within-day reproducibility of an HPLC-MS-based method for metabonomic analysis: application to human urine | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 3291\u2013303 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17625818 | doi = 10.1021/pr070183p }}</ref>\n\n[[Capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) has a higher theoretical separation efficiency than HPLC (although requiring much more time per separation), and is suitable for use with a wider range of metabolite classes than is GC.

[[GC-MS]] was the first hyphenated technique to be developed. Identification leverages the distinct patterns in which analytes fragment which can be thought of as a mass spectral fingerprint; libraries exist that allow identification of a metabolite according to this [[fragmentation pattern]] {{Examples|date=April 2019}}. MS is both sensitive and can be very specific. There are also a number of techniques which use MS as a stand-alone technology: the sample is infused directly into the mass spectrometer with no prior separation, and the MS provides sufficient selectivity to both separate and to detect metabolites.\n\nFor analysis by mass spectrometry the analytes must be imparted with a charge and transferred to the gas phase. [[Electron ionization]] (EI) is the most common ionization technique applies to GC separations as it is amenable to low pressures.  EI also produces fragmentation of the analyte, both providing structural information while increasing the complexity of the data and possibly obscuring the molecular ion. [[Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization]] (APCI) is an atmospheric pressure technique that can be applied to all the above separation techniques.  APCI is a gas phase ionization method slightly more aggressive ionization than ESI which is suitable for less polar compounds. [[Electrospray ionization]] (ESI) is the most common ionization technique applied in LC/MS. This soft ionization is most successful for polar molecules with ionizable functional groups. Another commonly used soft ionization technique is [[Secondary electrospray ionization|secondary electrospray ionization (SESI)]].\n\nSurface-based mass analysis has seen a resurgence in the past decade, with new MS technologies focused on increasing sensitivity, minimizing background, and reducing sample preparation.  The ability to analyze metabolites directly from biofluids and tissues continues to challenge current MS technology, largely because of the limits imposed by the complexity of these samples, which contain thousands to tens of thousands of metabolites.  Among the technologies being developed to address this challenge is Nanostructure-Initiator MS (NIMS),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Northen TR, Yanes O, Northen MT, Marrinucci D, Uritboonthai W, Apon J, Golledge SL, Nordstr\u00f6m A, Siuzdak G | display-authors = 6 | title = Clathrate nanostructures for mass spectrometry | journal = Nature | volume = 449 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1033\u20136 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17960240 | doi = 10.1038/nature06195 | bibcode = 2007Natur.449.1033N }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Woo HK, Northen TR, Yanes O, Siuzdak G | title = Nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry: a protocol for preparing and applying NIMS surfaces for high-sensitivity mass analysis | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | pages = 1341\u20139 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18714302 | doi = 10.1038/NPROT.2008.110 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/896641 }}</ref> a desorption/ ionization approach that does not require the application of matrix and thereby facilitates small-molecule (i.e., metabolite) identification. [[MALDI]] is also used however, the application of a MALDI matrix can add significant background at <1000 Da that complicates analysis of the low-mass range (i.e., metabolites). In addition, the size of the resulting matrix crystals limits the spatial resolution that can be achieved in tissue imaging. Because of these limitations, several other matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches have been applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues.\n\n[[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) was one of the first matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches used to analyze metabolites from biological samples.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} SIMS uses a high-energy primary ion beam to desorb and generate secondary ions from a surface. The primary advantage of SIMS is its high spatial resolution (as small as 50&nbsp;nm), a powerful characteristic for tissue imaging with MS. However, SIMS has yet to be readily applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues because of its limited sensitivity at >500 Da and analyte fragmentation generated by the high-energy primary ion beam. [[Desorption electrospray ionization]] (DESI) is a matrix-free technique for analyzing biological samples that uses a charged solvent spray to desorb ions from a surface. Advantages of DESI are that no special surface is required and the analysis is performed at ambient pressure with full access to the sample during acquisition.  A limitation of DESI is spatial resolution because \"focusing\" the charged solvent spray is difficult. However, a recent development termed [[Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization|laser ablation ESI]] (LAESI) is a promising approach to circumvent this limitation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Most recently, ion trap techniques such as [[orbitrap]] mass spectrometry are also applied to metabolomics research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghaste|first=Manoj|last2=Mistrik|first2=Robert|last3=Shulaev|first3=Vladimir|date=June 2016|title=Applications of Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) and Orbitrap Based High Resolution Mass Spectrometry in Metabolomics and Lipidomics|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=17|issue=6|pages=816|doi=10.3390/ijms17060816|pmid=27231903|pmc=4926350}}</ref>\n\n[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy is the only detection technique which does not rely on separation of the analytes, and the sample can thus be recovered for further analyses.

The difference between the two terms is not related to choice of analytical platform: although metabonomics is more associated with [[NMR spectroscopy]] and metabolomics with [[mass spectrometry]]-based techniques, this is simply because of usages amongst different groups that have popularized the different terms. While there is still no absolute agreement, there is a growing consensus that 'metabolomics' places a greater emphasis on metabolic profiling at a cellular or organ level and is primarily concerned with normal endogenous metabolism. 'Metabonomics' extends metabolic profiling to include information about perturbations of metabolism caused by environmental factors (including diet and toxins), disease processes, and the involvement of extragenomic influences, such as [[gut microflora]]. This is not a trivial difference; metabolomic studies should, by definition, exclude metabolic contributions from extragenomic sources, because these are external to the system being studied. However, in practice, within the field of human disease research there is still a large degree of overlap in the way both terms are used, and they are often in effect synonymous.<ref name = DGRref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson DG | title = Metabonomics in toxicology: a review | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 809\u201322 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15689416 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfi102 }}</ref>\n\n==Exometabolomics==\n{{main|Exometabolomics}}\nExometabolomics, or \"metabolic footprinting\", is the study of extracellular metabolites.

This complex mixture can be simplified prior to detection by separating some analytes from others. Separation achieves various goals: analytes which cannot be resolved by the detector may be separated in this step; in MS analysis [[Ion suppression in liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry|ion suppression]] is reduced; the retention time of the analyte serves as information regarding its identity.  This separation step is not mandatory and is often omitted in NMR and \"shotgun\" based approaches such as [[shotgun lipidomics]].\n\n[[Gas chromatography]] (GC), especially when interfaced with mass spectrometry ([[Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry|GC-MS]]), is a widely used separation technique for metabolomic analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogbaga CC, Stepien P, Dyson BC, Rattray NJ, Ellis DI, Goodacre R, Johnson GN | title = Biochemical Analyses of Sorghum Varieties Reveal Differential Responses to Drought | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = e0154423 | date = 6 May 2016 | pmid = 27153323 | pmc = 4859509 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0154423 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1154423O }}</ref> GC offers very high chromatographic resolution, and can be used in conjunction with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) or a mass spectrometer (GC-MS).

In cases where greater resolving power is required, two-dimensional chromatography ([[GCxGC]]) can be applied.\n\n[[High performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC) has emerged as the most common separation technique for metabolomic analysis. With the advent of [[electrospray ionization]], HPLC was coupled to MS. In contrast with [[Gas-liquid chromatography|GC]], HPLC has lower chromatographic resolution, but requires no derivatization for polar molecules, and separates molecules in the liquid phase. Additionally HPLC has the advantage that a much wider range of analytes can be measured with a higher sensitivity than GC methods.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gika HG, Theodoridis GA, Wingate JE, Wilson ID | title = Within-day reproducibility of an HPLC-MS-based method for metabonomic analysis: application to human urine | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = 3291\u2013303 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17625818 | doi = 10.1021/pr070183p }}</ref>\n\n[[Capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) has a higher theoretical separation efficiency than HPLC (although requiring much more time per separation), and is suitable for use with a wider range of metabolite classes than is GC.

[[GC-MS]] was the first hyphenated technique to be developed. Identification leverages the distinct patterns in which analytes fragment which can be thought of as a mass spectral fingerprint; libraries exist that allow identification of a metabolite according to this [[fragmentation pattern]] {{Examples|date=April 2019}}. MS is both sensitive and can be very specific. There are also a number of techniques which use MS as a stand-alone technology: the sample is infused directly into the mass spectrometer with no prior separation, and the MS provides sufficient selectivity to both separate and to detect metabolites.\n\nFor analysis by mass spectrometry the analytes must be imparted with a charge and transferred to the gas phase. [[Electron ionization]] (EI) is the most common ionization technique applies to GC separations as it is amenable to low pressures.  EI also produces fragmentation of the analyte, both providing structural information while increasing the complexity of the data and possibly obscuring the molecular ion. [[Atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization]] (APCI) is an atmospheric pressure technique that can be applied to all the above separation techniques.  APCI is a gas phase ionization method slightly more aggressive ionization than ESI which is suitable for less polar compounds. [[Electrospray ionization]] (ESI) is the most common ionization technique applied in LC/MS. This soft ionization is most successful for polar molecules with ionizable functional groups. Another commonly used soft ionization technique is [[Secondary electrospray ionization|secondary electrospray ionization (SESI)]].\n\nSurface-based mass analysis has seen a resurgence in the past decade, with new MS technologies focused on increasing sensitivity, minimizing background, and reducing sample preparation.  The ability to analyze metabolites directly from biofluids and tissues continues to challenge current MS technology, largely because of the limits imposed by the complexity of these samples, which contain thousands to tens of thousands of metabolites.  Among the technologies being developed to address this challenge is Nanostructure-Initiator MS (NIMS),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Northen TR, Yanes O, Northen MT, Marrinucci D, Uritboonthai W, Apon J, Golledge SL, Nordstr\u00f6m A, Siuzdak G | display-authors = 6 | title = Clathrate nanostructures for mass spectrometry | journal = Nature | volume = 449 | issue = 7165 | pages = 1033\u20136 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17960240 | doi = 10.1038/nature06195 | bibcode = 2007Natur.449.1033N }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Woo HK, Northen TR, Yanes O, Siuzdak G | title = Nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry: a protocol for preparing and applying NIMS surfaces for high-sensitivity mass analysis | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | pages = 1341\u20139 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18714302 | doi = 10.1038/NPROT.2008.110 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/896641 }}</ref> a desorption/ ionization approach that does not require the application of matrix and thereby facilitates small-molecule (i.e., metabolite) identification. [[MALDI]] is also used however, the application of a MALDI matrix can add significant background at <1000 Da that complicates analysis of the low-mass range (i.e., metabolites). In addition, the size of the resulting matrix crystals limits the spatial resolution that can be achieved in tissue imaging. Because of these limitations, several other matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches have been applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues.\n\n[[Secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) was one of the first matrix-free desorption/ionization approaches used to analyze metabolites from biological samples.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} SIMS uses a high-energy primary ion beam to desorb and generate secondary ions from a surface. The primary advantage of SIMS is its high spatial resolution (as small as 50&nbsp;nm), a powerful characteristic for tissue imaging with MS. However, SIMS has yet to be readily applied to the analysis of biofluids and tissues because of its limited sensitivity at >500 Da and analyte fragmentation generated by the high-energy primary ion beam. [[Desorption electrospray ionization]] (DESI) is a matrix-free technique for analyzing biological samples that uses a charged solvent spray to desorb ions from a surface. Advantages of DESI are that no special surface is required and the analysis is performed at ambient pressure with full access to the sample during acquisition.  A limitation of DESI is spatial resolution because \"focusing\" the charged solvent spray is difficult. However, a recent development termed [[Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization|laser ablation ESI]] (LAESI) is a promising approach to circumvent this limitation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Most recently, ion trap techniques such as [[orbitrap]] mass spectrometry are also applied to metabolomics research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ghaste|first=Manoj|last2=Mistrik|first2=Robert|last3=Shulaev|first3=Vladimir|date=June 2016|title=Applications of Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) and Orbitrap Based High Resolution Mass Spectrometry in Metabolomics and Lipidomics|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=17|issue=6|pages=816|doi=10.3390/ijms17060816|pmid=27231903|pmc=4926350}}</ref>\n\n[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy is the only detection technique which does not rely on separation of the analytes, and the sample can thus be recovered for further analyses.

More exciting is the prospect of predicting the function of unknown [[gene]]s by comparison with the metabolic perturbations caused by deletion/insertion of known genes. Such advances are most likely to come from [[model organism]]s such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. The [[Benjamin Cravatt III|Cravatt laboratory]] at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] has recently applied this technology to [[mammal]]ian systems, identifying the ''N''-acyltaurines as previously uncharacterized endogenous substrates for the enzyme [[fatty acid amide hydrolase]] (FAAH) and the monoalkylglycerol ethers (MAGEs) as endogenous substrates for the uncharacterized [[hydrolase]] [[KIAA1363]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saghatelian A, Trauger SA, Want EJ, Hawkins EG, Siuzdak G, Cravatt BF | title = Assignment of endogenous substrates to enzymes by global metabolite profiling | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 45 | pages = 14332\u20139 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15533037 | doi = 10.1021/bi0480335 | url = http://www.scripps.edu/cravatt/pdf/SaghatelianTrauger2004.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiang KP, Niessen S, Saghatelian A, Cravatt BF | title = An enzyme that regulates ether lipid signaling pathways in cancer annotated by multidimensional profiling | journal = Chemistry & Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1041\u201350 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17052608 | doi = 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.08.008 }}</ref>\n\nMetabologenomics is a novel approach to integrate metabolomics and genomics data by correlating microbial-exported metabolites with predicted biosynthetic genes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goering AW, McClure RA, Doroghazi JR, Albright JC, Haverland NA, Zhang Y, Ju KS, Thomson RJ, Metcalf WW, Kelleher NL | display-authors = 6 | title = Metabologenomics: Correlation of Microbial Gene Clusters with Metabolites Drives Discovery of a Nonribosomal Peptide with an Unusual Amino Acid Monomer | journal = ACS Central Science | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 99\u2013108 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 27163034 | pmc = 4827660 | doi = 10.1021/acscentsci.5b00331 }}</ref> This bioinformatics-based pairing method enables natural product discovery at a larger-scale by refining non-targeted metabolomic analyses to identify small molecules with related biosynthesis and to focus on those that may not have previously well known structures.\n\n[[Fluxomics]] is a further development of metabolomics. The disadvantage of metabolomics is that it only provides the user with steady-state level information, while fluxomics determines the reaction rates of metabolic reactions and can trace metabolites in a biological system over time.\n\n[[Nutrigenomics]] is a generalised term which links genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to human nutrition. In general a metabolome in a given body fluid is influenced by endogenous factors such as age, sex, body composition and genetics as well as underlying pathologies. The large bowel microflora are also a very significant potential confounder of metabolic profiles and could be classified as either an endogenous or exogenous factor. The main exogenous factors are diet and drugs. Diet can then be broken down to nutrients and non- nutrients.  Metabolomics is one means to determine a biological endpoint, or metabolic fingerprint, which reflects the balance of all these forces on an individual's metabolism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors =

After his release from a B.C. jail last fall, a rapper calling himself Lolo Lanski posted his song Dedman to SoundCloud and YouTube. It had over 80,000 downloads as of this week.

The largest organized Indo-Canadian gang presence is in British Columbia. These Indo-Canadian gangs belong to Jatt Sikhs clans rooted in Indian Rural Punjab. There is likelyhood that they migrated to canada to avoid Indian law after committing crimes\n\nThe largest gangs are:\n\n* Dhak-Duhre- UN coalition (Most of the original leaders such as Sandip Duhre, Sukh Dhak and Gurmit Dhak have been killed. It is now believed to be decentralized but the associates of the leaders are still believed to control different crime groups and keep in contact with each other, the Dhak-Duhre coalition is known to have developed strong ties with UN and waged a war against the Wolf Pack (Various factions of the IS, Red Scorpions and Hell's Angels aligned with each other led by the bacon brothers)\n* Punjabi Mafia- Currently dismantled with former factions still operating. (Originally founded by [[Ranjit Cheema]], Raj Benji and Robbie Kandola, later co-led with [[Bindy Johal]])\n* Independent Soldiers- Currently has two factions (one led by Caucasians and other being Indians, mostly Punjabis lead by the Adiwal brothers) Indo-Canadians make up most of the gang along with a small number of Fijians and Hindus, although there has been a significant increase of Caucasians in the gang in recent times who have risen up through the ranks. This organization is part of the Wolf Pack and was founded by Jimsher Dosanjh.\n* Sanghera Crime Group- Founded by Uddham Sanghera, this gang is believed to be responsible for over 100 shootings in the South Slope Gang war in Vancouver. The VPD has targeted and for the most part been able to capture and sentence, members of the Sanghera family although it is believed that the remnants of the organization are still active.\n* Malhi-Buttar coalition- This organization was a coalition made up of two groups, one led by T.J Malhi which was based in Richmond and the other led by the Buttar brothers (Kelly, Bal and Manny Buttar) based in South Vancouver. This group is now defunct after the deaths of most of its senior leadership and imprisonment of most of its members. This organization was the other group involved in the South Slope gang war against the Sanghera crime group.\n* Brothers Keepers- This organization was founded by Gavin Grewal and most of its members and leadership are formerly aligned with the Red Scorpions. This organization is active mainly in Metro Vancouver but is believed to have made inroads into the interior region of British Columbia and Vancouver Island. The Brothers  Keepers are lead by the Dhaliwal crime group and the Grewal crime group.\n* Kang crime Group- This gang was formerly a part of the Brothers Keepers organizations but due to differences between members had splintered and formed a new organization. The Kang crime group is known to be in a war with the Brothers Keepers for control of territory in Metro Vancouver. This organization is thought to be based in Burnaby, British Columbia although it has a presence in other cities of Metro Vancouver as well.\n* Chahil crime group- This organization is one of 2 groups waging war in the Townline Hill area of Abbotsford, British Columbia. This group is aligned with the Red Scorpians.\n* Grewal/Dhaliwal crime group- This is the second group involved in the gang war of the Townline hill area of Abbotsford, British Columbia\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Primetimecrime, Indo\" >{{Cite news\n |title=Stepping up the ranks\n |date=Oct 1, 2005\n |author=Kim Bolan\n |newspaper=Vancouver Sun\n |url=http://www.primetimecrime.com/Recent/Organized%20Crime/VS20051001Indo.htm\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ICV, 2014-09-10\" >{{Cite web\n |author=Rattan Mall\n |date=September 10, 2014\n |website= Indo-Canadian Voice\n |title=34 South Asian victims in gang-related homicides January 2006-March 2014\n |url=http://www.voiceonline.com/34-south-asian-victims-in-gang-related-homicides-jan-2006-mar-2014-more-in-another-special-gang-article-on-friday/\n}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.warriorsreligion.com/resources/deathlist\n* http://indocanadiangangs.blogspot.ca/\n\n{{Organized crime groups in Canada}}\n{{Organized crime groups in America}}\n\n[[Category:Gangs in Canada]]\n[[Category:Organized crime in Canada]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Canadian English|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox criminal organization\n| name                = Indo-Canadian organized crime\n| image               = \n|ethnicity= Mostly [[Punjabis|Indian Punjabi]]\n| caption             = \n| founding location   = [[British Columbia]]\n| founded by          = \n| years active        = 1990s \u2013 present\n| territory           = [[Punjab, India]], Canada (mainly in the provinces of [[British Columbia]], [[Ontario]], and [[Alberta]]), [[California]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| membership est      = \n| criminal activities =  [[Drug trafficking]], [[weapon trafficking]], [[robbery]], [[contract killing]], [[fraud]], [[money laundering]], [[chop shop]], [[counterfeiting]], [[extortion]], [[illegal gambling]], and [[murder]]\n}}\n\n'''Indo-Canadian organized crime''' groups are based in Canada and predominantly of [[Indian people|Indian]] origin.

It comes from a spelling alteration of the abbreviation \"docs\" (for \"documents\") and refers to \"compiling and releasing a dossier of personal information on someone\".<ref name=Wired>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/03/doxing/ |title= What Is Doxing? |first=Mat |last=Honan |date=2014-03-06 |magazine=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |accessdate=2014-12-10 }}</ref> Essentially, doxing is revealing and publicizing records of an individual, which were previously private or difficult to obtain.\n\nThe term dox derives from the slang \"dropping dox\" which, according to ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' writer Mat Honan, was \"an old-school revenge tactic that emerged from hacker culture in 1990s\". Hackers operating outside the law in that era used the breach of an opponent's [[anonymity]] as a means to expose opponents to harassment or legal repercussions.<ref name=Wired />\n\nConsequently, doxing often comes with a negative connotation, because it can be a vehicle for revenge via the violation of privacy.<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\">{{cite magazine |title=Doxing: An Etymology |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/doxing-an-etymology/284283/ |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Megan |last=Garber |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2014-12-10 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nInitial efforts around doxing were largely related to internet discussion forums on [Usenet]. One of the first documented doxing events was the publication of a \"Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies\"<ref>\n{{cite web|author=Fomin, V. |title=Usenet: Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies |url= https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.culture.usenet/i7615F8Fnak/YA_jh0BfhGYJ}}</ref> which listed names, email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing addresses of individuals the author objected to.\n\n[[Doxware]] is a [[cryptovirology]] attack invented by Adam Young and further developed with Moti Yung that carries out doxing extortion via [[malware]]. It was first presented at [[West Point]] in 2003. The attack is rooted in game theory and was originally dubbed \"non-zero sum games and survivable malware\".<ref name=\"iaw2003\">{{Cite conference | last1 = Young | first1 = A. | title = Non-Zero Sum Games and Survivable Malware | pages = 24\u201329| conference = IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society Information Assurance Workshop| year = 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe attack is summarized in the book ''Malicious Cryptography'' as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The attack weiner from the extortion attack in the following way. In the extortion attack, the victim is denied access to its own valuable information and has to pay to get it back, where in the attack that is presented here the victim retains access to the information but its disclosure is at the discretion of the computer virus.<ref name=\"maliciouscrypto\">{{cite book|author=A. Young, [[Moti Yung|M. Yung]]|title=Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=0-7645-4975-8}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDoxware is the converse of [[ransomware]]. In a ransomware attack (originally called cryptoviral extortion), the malware encrypts the victim's data and demands payment to provide the needed decryption key. In the doxware cryptovirology attack, the attacker or malware steals the victim's data and threatens to publish it unless a fee is paid.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Common techniques ==\nOnce people have been exposed through doxing, they may be targeted for harassment through methods such as harassment in person, fake signups for mail and pizza deliveries, or through [[swatting]] (dispatching armed police to their house through spoofed tips).\n\nA hacker may obtain an individual's dox without making the information public. A hacker may look for this information in order to extort or coerce a known or unknown target. Also, a hacker may harvest a victim's information in order to break into their Internet accounts, or to take over their social media accounts.<ref>{{cite web|title = What Is Doxing?|url = https://www.wired.com/2014/03/doxing/|website = WIRED|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe victim may also be shown their details as proof that they have been doxed in order to intimidate. The perpetrator may use this fear and intimidation to gain power over the victim in order to extort or coerce. Doxing is therefore a standard tactic of online harassment and has been used by people associated with [[4chan]] and in the [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]] and [[vaccine controversies]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/10/16/doxx-dark-web-letter-bitcoin-ransom/|title=Someone is blackmailing dark web users to pay up or get doxxed|last=Mix|date=2017-10-16|work=The Next Web|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hern|first1=Alex|title=Gamergate hits new low with attempts to send Swat teams to critics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/13/gamergate-hits-new-low-with-attempts-to-send-swat-teams-to-critics|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Mulvaney|first1=Nicole|title=Recent wave of swatting nationwide fits definition of terrorism, Princeton police chief says|url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2015/06/princeton_swatting_incidents_schools_malls_hoaxes.html|website=NJ.com|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Liebl|first1=Lance|title=The dangers and ramifications of doxxing and swatting|url=http://www.gamezone.com/originals/the-dangers-and-ramifications-of-doxxing-and-swatting|website=Gamezone}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Diresta & Lotan|title=How antivaxxers influence legislation|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/06/antivaxxers-influencing-legislation/|website=Wired|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe ethics of doxing by journalists, on matters that they assert are issues of [[public interest]], is an area of much controversy.

It comes from a spelling alteration of the abbreviation \"docs\" (for \"documents\") and refers to \"compiling and releasing a dossier of personal information on someone\".<ref name=Wired>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/03/doxing/ |title= What Is Doxing? |first=Mat |last=Honan |date=2014-03-06 |magazine=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |accessdate=2014-12-10 }}</ref> Essentially, doxing is revealing and publicizing records of an individual, which were previously private or difficult to obtain.\n\nThe term dox derives from the slang \"dropping dox\" which, according to ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' writer Mat Honan, was \"an old-school revenge tactic that emerged from hacker culture in 1990s\". Hackers operating outside the law in that era used the breach of an opponent's [[anonymity]] as a means to expose opponents to harassment or legal repercussions.<ref name=Wired />\n\nConsequently, doxing often comes with a negative connotation, because it can be a vehicle for revenge via the violation of privacy.<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\">{{cite magazine |title=Doxing: An Etymology |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/doxing-an-etymology/284283/ |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Megan |last=Garber |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2014-12-10 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nInitial efforts around doxing were largely related to internet discussion forums on [Usenet]. One of the first documented doxing events was the publication of a \"Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies\"<ref>\n{{cite web|author=Fomin, V. |title=Usenet: Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies |url= https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.culture.usenet/i7615F8Fnak/YA_jh0BfhGYJ}}</ref> which listed names, email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing addresses of individuals the author objected to.\n\n[[Doxware]] is a [[cryptovirology]] attack invented by Adam Young and further developed with Moti Yung that carries out doxing extortion via [[malware]]. It was first presented at [[West Point]] in 2003. The attack is rooted in game theory and was originally dubbed \"non-zero sum games and survivable malware\".<ref name=\"iaw2003\">{{Cite conference | last1 = Young | first1 = A. | title = Non-Zero Sum Games and Survivable Malware | pages = 24\u201329| conference = IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society Information Assurance Workshop| year = 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe attack is summarized in the book ''Malicious Cryptography'' as follows:\n\n<blockquote>The attack differs from the extortion attack in the following way. In the extortion attack, the victim is denied access to its own valuable information and has to pay to get it back, where in the attack that is presented here the victim retains access to the information but its disclosure is at the discretion of the computer virus.<ref name=\"maliciouscrypto\">{{cite book|author=A. Young, [[Moti Yung|M. Yung]]|title=Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=0-7645-4975-8}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDoxware is the converse of [[ransomware]]. In a ransomware attack (originally called cryptoviral extortion), the malware encrypts the victim's data and demands payment to provide the needed decryption key. In the doxware cryptovirology attack, the attacker or malware steals the victim's data and threatens to publish it unless a fee is paid.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Common techniques ==\nOnce people have been exposed through doxing, they may be targeted for harassment through methods such as harassment in person, fake signups for mail and pizza deliveries, or through [[swatting]] (dispatching armed police to their house through spoofed tips).\n\nA hacker may obtain an individual's dox without making the information public. A hacker may look for this information in order to extort or coerce a known or unknown target. Also, a hacker may harvest a victim's information in order to break into their Internet accounts, or to take over their social media accounts.<ref>{{cite web|title = What Is Doxing?|url = https://www.wired.com/2014/03/doxing/|website = WIRED|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref>\n\nThe victim may also be shown their details as proof that they have been doxed in order to intimidate. The perpetrator may use this fear and intimidation to gain power over the victim in order to extort or coerce.

The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of [[Fetsund]].\n\nFet was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). The new municipality of [[R\u00e6lingen]] was separated from Fet on 1 July 1929. The part of [[Enebakk]] municipality lying east of lake [[\u00d8yeren]] was transferred to Fet in 1962.\n\n==General information==\n===Name===\nThe name ([[Old Norse]]: ''Fit'') was first recorded in 1321 (''a Fit''). The word ''fit'' means 'vigorous [[meadow]]'.\n\n===Coat-of-arms===\nThe [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times. They were granted on 19 December 1986. The arms show a [[Peavey (tool)|logging hook]], which was used in the area to haul the logs cut in the surrounding [[forest]]s. The [[log driving|logs were transported]] over the streams and lakes to the [[sawmill]]s. The people used long poles with hooks to haul the logs. The colours of the arms are green and silver because the name is derived from an old word describing a field (green) near a lake (silver).<ref>{{cite web|author=Norske Kommunev\u00e5pen|date=1990|title=Nye kommunev\u00e5bener i Norden|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/nor/f/fet.htm|accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref> \n\n{{See also2|Coats-of-arms for [[\u00c5snes]], [[Jondal]], [[Marker, Norway|Marker]], and [[Nordre Land]]}}\n\n{| style=\"float: center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Number of minorities (1st and 2nd generation) in Fet by country of origin in 2017'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/selectvarval/Define.asp?subjectcode=&ProductId=&MainTable=FolkInnvkatLand&nvl=&PLanguage=1&nyTmpVar=true&CMSSubjectArea=befolkning&KortNavnWeb=innvbef&StatVariant=&checked=true |title=Immigrants and Norwegian-born to immigrant parents, by immigration category, country background and percentages of the population |language=English |publisher=ssb.no |accessdate=25 June 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702101705/https://www.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/selectvarval/Define.asp?subjectcode=&ProductId=&MainTable=FolkInnvkatLand&nvl=&PLanguage=1&nyTmpVar=true&CMSSubjectArea=befolkning&KortNavnWeb=innvbef&StatVariant=&checked=true |archivedate=2 July 2015 }}</ref>\n \n|-\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Ancestry\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Number\n|-\n| {{flag|Poland}}||455\n|-\n| {{flag|Lithuania}}||167\n|-\n| {{flag|Sweden}}||105\n|-\n| {{flag|Germany}}||79\n|-\n| {{flag|Sri Lanka}}||73\n|-\n| {{flag|Pakistan}}||72\n|-\n| {{flag|Denmark}}||67\n|-\n| {{flag|Vietnam}}||67\n|}\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Lensemuseet.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Logging museum on the water]]\nFet is located on the eastern side of [[\u00d8yeren|Lake \u00d8yeren]] and includes the point at which the [[Glomma|River Glomma]] enters the lake.

The TFD has 94 employees: 92 uniformed firefighters and 2 civilian employees. The department is directly responsible for over 41,000 residents living within the 6.23 square miles of Teaneck. Furthermore, The TFD routinely provides mutual aid to 6 surrounding communities in Bergen County (Boro of Bergenfield, Boro of Bogota, City of Englewood, City of Hackensack, Boro of New Milford and Village of Ridgefield Park), further assisting an additional 139,000 people over an additional 18.52 square miles.\n\n== History ==\nThe first organized fire protection in The Township of Teaneck was a combination (part paid & part volunteer) police organization called the Hackensack Township Protection Society. They provided structure and equipment for residents to use in their own individual fire defense. Prior to the formation of The Teaneck Fire Department, both the Hackensack Society and The Englewood Fire Department responded into Teaneck. However, both organizations were hampered by astronomically long response times due to the lack of well kempt roads and steep hills. These problems lasted until 1895 when Teaneck gained its first fire company.\n\nTeaneck\u2019s first fire company was Defender Hook & Ladder which was formed on August 12, 1895 and quartered at 722 New Bridge Road. They provided immediate fire protection to the New Bridge sections of Teaneck, southern portions of New Milford and the Cherry Hill neighborhood of River Edge. When Teaneck commingled its 4 independent fire companies into The Teaneck Fire Department (paid municipal department), Defender Hook & Ladder did not join the municipal department and went on to become New Milford Fire Company 2. They did however continue to respond in Teaneck until 1933. \n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/History-2179/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nThe question of forming Teaneck's first volunteer company was first considered in the summer of 1904 by the residents of Manhattan Heights and Selvage developments. Prior to the end of 1904, the residents officially formed the Upper Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association. They organized as Company #1 and were quartered at 1188 Teaneck Road. Organizers included Kenloch V. Ridley and Walter Kaltenback, the first paid chief of department and the first paid firefighter respectively when the department transitioned to a career (paid) department. Company #1 protected north of Cedar Lane to the Bergenfield, the sections of Teaneck known as Manhattan Heights, West Englewood Park and Upper Teaneck. They also responded as the second due engine in the remaining three districts. Company #1 was called upon to fight their first fire on December 8, 1904. On October 6, 1906 they held their first drill. Both of these would be first's in the history of The Teaneck Fire Department. In 1907 the company was forced to move to 18 Fairview Avenue but also obtained Teaneck's first motorized fire apparatus. The building at 18 Fairview Avenue was Fire Headquarters from 1915 until 1920\n\nTeaneck's second volunteer company was formed in 1908 by the residents of Bogota Park as the Cedar Volunteer Firemen's Association and organized Hose Company #2. From 1907 to 1913 they were located in a member's barn on Linden Avenue. Company #2 protected north to West Englewood Park, and west of the West Shore railroad to the Hackensack River. In 1912 a new station was constructed on Kenwood Place which remained Station 2 and housed Engine 2 until 1953.\n\nThe Lower Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association was the third Company was organized in October 1911 as Hose Company #1. They were quartered in a member's barn on the south end of Teaneck Road. They served the section of town known as Lower Teaneck. In 1914 the members rented a garage at 375 Queen Anne Road to store equipment and serve the expanding South Queen Anne Road business district. Shortly before World War I, in 1913 the Company acquired two building lots on Morningside Terrace, and in 1920 completed building their quarters on the lots. This was 395 Morningside Terrace which was Station 3 and housed Engine 3 from 1920 until 1990.\n\nThe Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen's Association, the 4th and final volunteer company, was organized in 1911 and quartered in a blacksmith shop at Glenwood Ave and Fabry Terrace until 1913. In 1913 they relocated to Glenwood Ave and Hemlock Terrace South. When Teaneck went to a career department in 1915, The Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen retained their status as a complete volunteer company and responded to first alarm fires in their district and also to second alarm fires in all other parts of the Township. They remained active until 1948 when they were disbanded and its members went on to organize the [https://www.teaneckambulance.org/ Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/History-2179/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 American LaFrance Type 75.jpg|1920 American LaFrance Type 75\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon.jpg|1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon\nFile:1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon.jpg|1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck.jpg|1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1926 American LaFrance Type 94 Converted Quadruple Truck.jpg|1926 American LaFrance Type 14 Converted Quadruple Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1929 American LaFrance Type 145.jpg|1929 American LaFrance Type 145\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine.jpg|1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department Chiefs Car 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan.jpg|Chief of Department's 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Teaneck's Fire Chiefs<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/firedept/100th_Anniversary.html|title=Teaneck Public Library|website=www.teaneck.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|Kenloch V.

Prior to them, \"banging\" locomotive rims were the primary means of alerting the department of a fire. In 1895, Locomotive rims were mounted on gallows with enameled signs. When there was a fire, residents would take a bent metal flat stock, go to the nearest \"gong\" and tap out the number, according to the number code on the sign. Other residents hearing the signal was then expected to repeat the signal at the gong nearest them. There were up to 46 gongs throughout the town, this lasted up until 1920.\n\n===== 1920 - 1948 =====\n\nIn 1920, residents began to dial the operator and ask for the Teaneck Fire Department to report a fire. The operator then transferred the call to the Teaneck Fire Department. The firefighter on the desk (deskman) would then ring the appropriate fire stations on a plug-type switchboard. This ring would set off World War I surplus air raid sirens at the fire stations. Members reporting to the stations to answer the alarm would pick up the phone. This would stop the siren and allow members to copy dispatch info onto a chalkboard. These lines were leased from New York Telephone.\n\nIn 1929, an extension from the Teaneck Police Department was connected to the Fire Department switchboard. There were 46 Police call boxes, painted red and left unlocked. Red and white rings were painted on the utility poles where the box was located. Also during the year, the Teaneck Chamber of Commerce began to push for a better fire alarm system. During 1932 the leased phone lines began to give problems to the TFD and a resident. Alarms rang a home phone on Penn Avenue and telephone calls to the same resident set off the air raid sirens at Station 2. The Teaneck Fire Department also produced new box number locations.\n\nIn 1933, the air raid siren at Fire Headquarters was replaced with an air horn. The air horn sounded the box numbers and special signals.\n\n1937 marked the introduction of the telegraph fire alarm boxes in Teaneck. 40 boxes were placed in service. Bells were installed in the fire houses.\n\nIn 1940, the air raid sirens were used only for air raid warnings and snow days. Phone lines to the stations became municipal. The telegraph box system was made up of 4 box circuits and 1 local circuit in headquarters which was connected to a 16\" gong.\n\n1940 through 1957 saw significant changes for communication with the implementation of voice radio. A two-way radio was installed in the Chief's car and Rescue 1. The radio frequency was 1630KC AM with an FCC Call Sign of KEE888. Radios were installed in the fire stations. Upon an alarm, two taps sounded on the Headquarters circuit and the box number was sounded on the station bells and over the air horns. Two announcements were made over the municipal voice lines to the stations. Each station had an amplifier and a speaker. There would be two tones then the announcement of the alarm over the radio.\n\nIn 1948, Teaneck Fire switched over to 33.8600&nbsp;MHz AM, with the same Call sign. Also, 1948 marked the introduction of Master Boxes to the Teaneck Telegraph Fire Alarm System. All schools, a car dealership, a chemical test facility, a bowling alley, a night club and two taxpayer buildings were the first the Master Box customers.\n\n===== 1957 - 1988 =====\n\nFrom 1957\u20131988, the number of circuits expanded to 16 box circuits and 2 alarm circuits. The use of the air horn was limited to General Alarms. The Teaneck Fire Department switched to 155.6100, sharing the frequency with the Police and DPW. By 1960 all apparatus had two-way radios. In 1968, the boxes were revised, splitting the town up into 6 zones rather than 4. In 1969, the Teaneck Fire Department split off and began operating on 158.8200. From 1970 - 1972, many street boxes were added, as well as numerous master boxes.\n\n===== 1988 - 1997 =====\nMunicipal voice lines to the stations and police were placed out of service. Box numbers were no longer sent out over the bells for telephone alarms of fire. Radios in the stations were replaced with tone-activated models. The two taps were no longer sent over the circuits.\n\nIn 1995, The Teaneck Fire Department added radio alarm boxes to the system.\n\nIn 1997, Municipal voice lines were reestablished to the stations and Police Headquarters. A voice line from Fire Headquarters to the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps was established. Dispatch procedures remained the same. The inside wire was used primarily for administrative messages, but sometimes used for dispatching during multiple alarms ongoing. 13 radio tie lines were also incorporated into the system. Also, a fireground frequency of 156.000&nbsp;MHz was established.\n\n===== 2003 - Present =====\nIn 2003, Computer communications (via T1 lines) was established to all stations (Police, DPW, TVAC, Recreation Department and Municipal Court). These lines were piggybacked on the fire alarm cables. Teaneck has the traditional telegraph boxes (both Gamewell and SAFA) and also has wireless radio boxes. Teaneck has about 33 radio boxes. Teaneck continues to add telegraph boxes to their system. The telegraph system gets quite a workout in Teaneck as it receives many box pulls for confirmed fires.\n\nTeaneck's 2002 Annual Township Managers Report states, \"Teaneck's municipal fire alarm system continued to be the best way to report fires, smoke and other emergencies to the Fire Department. In August 2002, Teaneck suffered a wide area failure of commercial telephone service when a severe lightning storm knocked out hundreds of phone lines in the northwest section of Teaneck. While the telephone company diligently sent a large force and immediately began repairs, many households lacked telephone service for up to four days.\" The report continued on saying \"In 2002, 91 fires and emergencies were reported via the fire alarm boxes. The instant alarm signals helped limit the damage and injuries in fires occurring at [Holy Name Hospital], [Glenpointe Marriott], a senior citizen apartment house (twice), a single family home, and other public and commercial occupancies. Dozens of smoke emergencies were signaled through the system, in some cases preventing smoldering materials or objects from reaching the stage of open flaming. In other cases, boxes were used to get help for hazardous conditions, leaks and rescue situations.....There were only 30 street malicious false alarms, less than 1% of Fire Department runs.\"\n\nTeaneck's 2003 Annual Township Managers Report states, \"...boxes were pulled 104 times, of which 18 were malicious false alarms.\"\n\nTeaneck's municipal fire alarm system is continuously maintained and cared for and is still active as of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backtaps.com/activesystems.htm#Teaneck|title=Towns with Telegraph Fire Alarm Systems Still In Service|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nTeaneck Fire Department is a career fire department that has 92 uniformed members, out of a total of 94 authorized positions, including 31 officers and 61 firefighters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/Fire/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref> 83 uniformed members are assigned to 4 platoons (shifts) and 9 members are in the administrative, fire prevention and training bureaus.

The headquarters officer (Captain or Lieutenant) that does not ride the ladder truck is detailed as the Safety Officer for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour.\n\nAs of 11/15/2018 (the consolidation of Engine 1 with Ladder 1 and the closing of Rescue 1 due to the lack of hiring by the township), the minimum staffing has been: 1 Tour Commander, 3 Officers and 11 Firefighters. When this is in effect, Ladder 1 rides with the Headquarters Captain or Lieutenant & 3 firefighters, Engines 2 & 3 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 2 firefighters, and Engine 4 rides with 3 firefighters with 1 firefighter as an Acting Lieutenant for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour. \n\n=== Fire Prevention Bureau ===\nThe Fire Prevention Bureau is the enforcement agency for the Township's Fire Code, which is aimed at controlling fire hazards in all structures in the community. The Fire Code mandates periodic inspections, which includes inspections of schools, local businesses, factories, hospitals, nursing homes, all commercial businesses, industrial and office buildings in the community. All new construction, including renovations and additions, are inspected by a fire official before a certificate of occupancy is issued. The bureau consists of 3 Lieutenants (1 is the Fire Official) and 1 Clerk (Secretary). Fire Prevention is also assisted by the on duty platoon which performs some inspections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> These allow each shift to familiarize themselves with the various occupancies, types of buildings and uncommon building layouts within the township.\n\n=== Fire Training Bureau ===\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department, a recognized New Jersey Division of Fire Safety Eligible Organization, conducts thousands of man-hours of training every year. Many of the training courses delivered by the Training Bureau are courses and training materials that have been developed by the New Jersey Division of Fire Safety and the National Fire Academy. Other materials presented consisted of courses developed by the Federal Government or in house using resident subject-matter experts. Whether it is through classroom, presentations, hands-on, federal, state or regional sponsored training, below are some examples of training the department and it members constantly undertake.\n\nUniformed members of the department continuously attend education courses covering a broad variety of subjects, including but not limited to: building construction; foam operations; fire pump/apparatus pump operations; rapid intervention team (RIT) operations; tower ladder operations; aerial operations at night; emergency \"bailout\" evacuation devices and technique refresher; confined space operations; decontamination/warming truck operations; EVOC of fire apparatus, a formalized driving program; forcible entry/exit; cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (recertification); automatic external defibrillators (recertification); and first responder recertification. In addition, uniformed members attended classroom sessions on: SCBA breathing techniques/smoke inhalation; asbestos awareness; hazardous materials (refresher); specialized tool/equipment usage and care; incident management; cardiac emergencies; township workplace harassment training; and PEOSHA mandated annual training on workplace hazards.\n\nThe Fire Department ensures that its members are capable of addressing emerging threats that are appearing nationally and globally. Some classes members have participated in: Active Shooter, Bakken Fuel Emergencies, Hydrogen Cyanide in Fireground operations, MRI Safety in Fire Response, and proper utilization of Personal Radiation Detectors. The department also sends members to Responding to Terrorist Bombing Incidents at New Mexico Tech sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Foam Firefighting School at Texas A&M TEEX, and the Security and Emergency Response Training Center in Boulder, Colo., for advanced training in dealing with Rail Emergencies.\n\n=== Fire Investigation Unit ===\nUnder the direction of the Chief of Department and the Fire Official the unit conducts investigations of all fires for origin and cause. In cases of arson, the unit coordinates with the [https://www.teanecknj.gov/Police-Department/ Teaneck Police Department], the [https://www.bcpo.net/ Bergen County Prosecutor's Office], the Bergen County Arson Squad and other State and Federal agencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> The Unit is on call and consists of: 1 Battalion Chief, 2 Lieutenants, and 5 Firefighters.\n\n=== Fire Alarm Bureau ===\nThe Township has 315 fire alarm boxes strategically located throughout the Township. The fire alarm boxes are used to report fires, pre fire smoke conditions and a variety of other incidents including medical emergencies, electrical accidents, steam leaks, etc.  The majority of boxes are dual use, relaying alarms from protected premises such as schools, places of public assembly, high rises, etc., as well as being available to bystanders to manually report fires and emergencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref>\n\n== Communications ==\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is dispatched out of Fire Headquarters at 1231 Teaneck Road. The Fire Department has two frequencies: the dispatch or \"main\" channel (158.82000&nbsp;MHz) and a fireground channel. (156.00000&nbsp;MHz)\n\n== Operations ==\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is 1 of only 3 fully career departments in Bergen County (Teaneck, Hackensack and Englewood) There are 3 other departments in Bergen County that use both career & volunteer members (combination): Bergenfield & [[Cresskill, New Jersey|Cresskill]] are mostly volunteer departments with a small contingent of career members, and [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]], which is mostly career with a small contingent of volunteer members\n\nAs of 2017, the department serves the second largest populous (\u224841,311), third most households (\u224814,024) and seventh largest area (6.226 square miles) in Bergen County. Furthermore, when requested they regularly respond on mutual aid to: Hackensack, Englewood, Bergenfield, Bogota, Ridgefield Park & [[New Milford, New Jersey|New Milford]]. The department responds 24 hours a day and works closely with the [https://www.teanecknj.gov/police-department Teaneck Police Department] & Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps to respond to approximately 3,200 to 4,200 calls per year involving mainly: structure fires, vehicle fires, electrical emergencies, natural gas releases, carbon monoxide incidents, explosions, rescues, outside fires, vehicle extrication's, waterborne rescue, forcing entry, service calls etc. Due to the ambulance corps abundant membership and active participation, the fire department typically does not respond on every EMS call. However, they are available to do so and frequently are on standby when the ambulance corps is dispatched. Instead the department responds: automatically on all severe calls (E.g. trauma, CPR etc.), when the ambulance corps requests them (E.g. forcible entry, calls on highways, lift assists etc.), or when the ambulance corps is unable to respond (E.g. holidays, weekends, overnights, multiple calls etc.).\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department operates out of 4 firehouses. There are 3 engines, 1 ladder truck, 3 spare engines, 1 spare ladder truck, along with various special and support units. A Battalion Chief is usually the daily tour commander and is in charge of all 4 stations.\n\nThe department has an authorized strength of 94 members: 1 Chief of Department, 2 Deputy Chiefs, 4 Battalion Chiefs, 5 Captains, (1 is the Training & Safety Officer) 19 Lieutenants (3 are Fire Prevention Officers) 61 Firefighters & 2 Clerks. (Secretaries, 1 is in Fire Prevention & 1 is Administrative)\n\nThe primary goal of the Teaneck Fire Department is to prevent fires from occurring. When a fire does occur the goal is to immediately protect life and property by promptly confining, controlling and extinguishing the fire while rescuing any trapped occupant. The average response time of the Teaneck Fire Department is three minutes from time of notification to arrival on the scene (below the recommended four minute response time).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMotor vehicle accidents occurs quite often in Teaneck due to the major highways ([[New Jersey Route 4|Rt. 4]], [[Interstate 95|Rt. 95]] & [[Interstate 80|Rt. 80]]) that are within the department's jurisdictions and main thoroughfares (Teaneck Rd, Queen Anne Rd, River Rd, Glenwood Ave, West Englewood Ave, West Forest Ave, Cedar Ln, Degraw Ave) that pass through and/or are in the town.

The TFD has 94 employees: 92 uniformed firefighters and 2 civilian employees. The department is directly responsible for over 41,000 residents living within the 6.23 square miles of Teaneck. Furthermore, The TFD routinely provides mutual aid to 6 surrounding communities in Bergen County (Boro of Bergenfield, Boro of Bogota, City of Englewood, City of Hackensack, Boro of New Milford and Village of Ridgefield Park), further assisting an additional 139,000 people over an additional 18.52 square miles.\n\n== History ==\nThe first organized fire protection in The Township of Teaneck was a combination (part paid & part volunteer) police organization called the Hackensack Township Protection Society. They provided structure and equipment for residents to use in their own individual fire defense. Prior to the formation of The Teaneck Fire Department, both the Hackensack Society and The Englewood Fire Department responded into Teaneck. However, both organizations were hampered by astronomically long response times due to the lack of well kempt roads and steep hills. These problems lasted until 1895 when Teaneck gained its first fire company.\n\nTeaneck\u2019s first fire company was Defender Hook & Ladder which was formed on August 12, 1895 and quartered at 722 New Bridge Road. They provided immediate fire protection to the New Bridge sections of Teaneck, southern portions of New Milford and the Cherry Hill neighborhood of River Edge. When Teaneck commingled its 4 independent fire companies into The Teaneck Fire Department (paid municipal department), Defender Hook & Ladder did not join the municipal department and went on to become New Milford Fire Company 2. They did however continue to respond in Teaneck until 1933. \n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/History-2179/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nThe question of forming Teaneck's first volunteer company was first considered in the summer of 1904 by the residents of Manhattan Heights and Selvage developments. Prior to the end of 1904, the residents officially formed the Upper Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association. They organized as Company #1 and were quartered at 1188 Teaneck Road. Organizers included Kenloch V. Ridley and Walter Kaltenback, the first paid chief of department and the first paid firefighter respectively when the department transitioned to a career (paid) department. Company #1 protected north of Cedar Lane to the Bergenfield, the sections of Teaneck known as Manhattan Heights, West Englewood Park and Upper Teaneck. They also responded as the second due engine in the remaining three districts. Company #1 was called upon to fight their first fire on December 8, 1904. On October 6, 1906 they held their first drill. Both of these would be first's in the history of The Teaneck Fire Department. In 1907 the company was forced to move to 18 Fairview Avenue but also obtained Teaneck's first motorized fire apparatus. The building at 18 Fairview Avenue was Fire Headquarters from 1915 until 1920\n\nTeaneck's second volunteer company was formed in 1908 by the residents of Bogota Park as the Cedar Volunteer Firemen's Association and organized Hose Company #2. From 1907 to 1913 they were located in a member's barn on Linden Avenue. Company #2 protected north to West Englewood Park, and west of the West Shore railroad to the Hackensack River. In 1912 a new station was constructed on Kenwood Place which remained Station 2 and housed Engine 2 until 1953.\n\nThe Lower Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association was the third Company was organized in October 1911 as Hose Company #1. They were quartered in a member's barn on the south end of Teaneck Road. They served the section of town known as Lower Teaneck. In 1914 the members rented a garage at 375 Queen Anne Road to store equipment and serve the expanding South Queen Anne Road business district. Shortly before World War I, in 1913 the Company acquired two building lots on Morningside Terrace, and in 1920 completed building their quarters on the lots. This was 395 Morningside Terrace which was Station 3 and housed Engine 3 from 1920 until 1990.\n\nThe Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen's Association, the 4th and final volunteer company, was organized in 1911 and quartered in a blacksmith shop at Glenwood Ave and Fabry Terrace until 1913. In 1913 they relocated to Glenwood Ave and Hemlock Terrace South. When Teaneck went to a career department in 1915, The Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen retained their status as a complete volunteer company and responded to first alarm fires in their district and also to second alarm fires in all other parts of the Township. They remained active until 1948 when they were disbanded and its members went on to organize the [https://www.teaneckambulance.org/ Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/|title=A Brief History of The Teaneck Fire Department|last=Robertson|first=Larry|date=|website=Teaneck.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 American LaFrance Type 75.jpg|1920 American LaFrance Type 75\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon.jpg|1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon\nFile:1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon.jpg|1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck.jpg|1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1926 American LaFrance Type 94 Converted Quadruple Truck.jpg|1926 American LaFrance Type 14 Converted Quadruple Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1929 American LaFrance Type 145.jpg|1929 American LaFrance Type 145\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine.jpg|1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department Chiefs Car 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan.jpg|Chief of Department's 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Teaneck's Fire Chiefs<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/firedept/100th_Anniversary.html|title=Teaneck Public Library|website=www.teaneck.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|Kenloch V.

Prior to them, \"banging\" locomotive rims were the primary means of alerting the department of a fire. In 1895, Locomotive rims were mounted on gallows with enameled signs. When there was a fire, residents would take a bent metal flat stock, go to the nearest \"gong\" and tap out the number, according to the number code on the sign. Other residents hearing the signal was then expected to repeat the signal at the gong nearest them. There were up to 46 gongs throughout the town, this lasted up until 1920.\n\n===== 1920 - 1948 =====\n\nIn 1920, residents began to dial the operator and ask for the Teaneck Fire Department to report a fire. The operator then transferred the call to the Teaneck Fire Department. The firefighter on the desk (deskman) would then ring the appropriate fire stations on a plug-type switchboard. This ring would set off World War I surplus air raid sirens at the fire stations. Members reporting to the stations to answer the alarm would pick up the phone. This would stop the siren and allow members to copy dispatch info onto a chalkboard. These lines were leased from New York Telephone.\n\nIn 1929, an extension from the Teaneck Police Department was connected to the Fire Department switchboard. There were 46 Police call boxes, painted red and left unlocked. Red and white rings were painted on the utility poles where the box was located. Also during the year, the Teaneck Chamber of Commerce began to push for a better fire alarm system. During 1932 the leased phone lines began to give problems to the TFD and a resident. Alarms rang a home phone on Penn Avenue and telephone calls to the same resident set off the air raid sirens at Station 2. The Teaneck Fire Department also produced new box number locations.\n\nIn 1933, the air raid siren at Fire Headquarters was replaced with an air horn. The air horn sounded the box numbers and special signals.\n\n1937 marked the introduction of the telegraph fire alarm boxes in Teaneck. 40 boxes were placed in service. Bells were installed in the fire houses.\n\nIn 1940, the air raid sirens were used only for air raid warnings and snow days. Phone lines to the stations became municipal. The telegraph box system was made up of 4 box circuits and 1 local circuit in headquarters which was connected to a 16\" gong.\n\n1940 through 1957 saw significant changes for communication with the implementation of voice radio. A two-way radio was installed in the Chief's car and Rescue 1. The radio frequency was 1630KC AM with an FCC Call Sign of KEE888. Radios were installed in the fire stations. Upon an alarm, two taps sounded on the Headquarters circuit and the box number was sounded on the station bells and over the air horns. Two announcements were made over the municipal voice lines to the stations. Each station had an amplifier and a speaker. There would be two tones then the announcement of the alarm over the radio.\n\nIn 1948, Teaneck Fire switched over to 33.8600&nbsp;MHz AM, with the same Call sign. Also, 1948 marked the introduction of Master Boxes to the Teaneck Telegraph Fire Alarm System. All schools, a car dealership, a chemical test facility, a bowling alley, a night club and two taxpayer buildings were the first the Master Box customers.\n\n===== 1957 - 1988 =====\n\nFrom 1957\u20131988, the number of circuits expanded to 16 box circuits and 2 alarm circuits. The use of the air horn was limited to General Alarms. The Teaneck Fire Department switched to 155.6100, sharing the frequency with the Police and DPW. By 1960 all apparatus had two-way radios. In 1968, the boxes were revised, splitting the town up into 6 zones rather than 4. In 1969, the Teaneck Fire Department split off and began operating on 158.8200. From 1970 - 1972, many street boxes were added, as well as numerous master boxes.\n\n===== 1988 - 1997 =====\nMunicipal voice lines to the stations and police were placed out of service. Box numbers were no longer sent out over the bells for telephone alarms of fire. Radios in the stations were replaced with tone-activated models. The two taps were no longer sent over the circuits.\n\nIn 1995, The Teaneck Fire Department added radio alarm boxes to the system.\n\nIn 1997, Municipal voice lines were reestablished to the stations and Police Headquarters. A voice line from Fire Headquarters to the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps was established. Dispatch procedures remained the same. The inside wire was used primarily for administrative messages, but sometimes used for dispatching during multiple alarms ongoing. 13 radio tie lines were also incorporated into the system. Also, a fireground frequency of 156.000&nbsp;MHz was established.\n\n===== 2003 - Present =====\nIn 2003, Computer communications (via T1 lines) was established to all stations (Police, DPW, TVAC, Recreation Department and Municipal Court). These lines were piggybacked on the fire alarm cables. Teaneck has the traditional telegraph boxes (both Gamewell and SAFA) and also has wireless radio boxes. Teaneck has about 33 radio boxes. Teaneck continues to add telegraph boxes to their system. The telegraph system gets quite a workout in Teaneck as it receives many box pulls for confirmed fires.\n\nTeaneck's 2002 Annual Township Managers Report states, \"Teaneck's municipal fire alarm system continued to be the best way to report fires, smoke and other emergencies to the Fire Department. In August 2002, Teaneck suffered a wide area failure of commercial telephone service when a severe lightning storm knocked out hundreds of phone lines in the northwest section of Teaneck. While the telephone company diligently sent a large force and immediately began repairs, many households lacked telephone service for up to four days.\" The report continued on saying \"In 2002, 91 fires and emergencies were reported via the fire alarm boxes. The instant alarm signals helped limit the damage and injuries in fires occurring at [Holy Name Hospital], [Glenpointe Marriott], a senior citizen apartment house (twice), a single family home, and other public and commercial occupancies. Dozens of smoke emergencies were signaled through the system, in some cases preventing smoldering materials or objects from reaching the stage of open flaming. In other cases, boxes were used to get help for hazardous conditions, leaks and rescue situations.....There were only 30 street malicious false alarms, less than 1% of Fire Department runs.\"\n\nTeaneck's 2003 Annual Township Managers Report states, \"...boxes were pulled 104 times, of which 18 were malicious false alarms.\"\n\nTeaneck's municipal fire alarm system is continuously maintained and cared for and is still active as of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backtaps.com/activesystems.htm#Teaneck|title=Towns with Telegraph Fire Alarm Systems Still In Service|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nTeaneck Fire Department is a career fire department that has 92 uniformed members, out of a total of 94 authorized positions, including 31 officers and 61 firefighters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/Fire/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref> 83 uniformed members are assigned to 4 platoons (shifts) and 9 members are in the administrative, fire prevention and training bureaus.

The tour commander is in charge of the platoon on duty and is usually a Battalion Chief or on occasion the Deputy Chief of Operations (radio [[call sign]]: Car 32). The tour commander reports to the Chief of the Department (radio call sign: Car 30). Each platoon consists of: 1 Battalion Chief, 1 Captain, 4 Lieutenants and 15-16 Firefighters.\n\nAt full staffing the riding assignments tend to be the following: Car 32 is manned by the tour commander (Battalion Chief or Deputy Chief of Operations), Ladder 1 rides with 1 Captain or 1 Lieutenant & 5 firefighters. Engines 2, 3 & 4 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 3 Firefighters. The headquarters officer (Captain or Lieutenant) that does not ride the ladder truck is detailed as the Safety Officer for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour.\n\nAs of 11/15/2018 (the consolidation of Engine 1 with Ladder 1 and the closing of Rescue 1 due to the lack of hiring by the township), the minimum staffing has been: 1 Tour Commander, 3 Officers and 11 Firefighters. When this is in effect, Ladder 1 rides with the Headquarters Captain or Lieutenant & 3 firefighters, Engines 2 & 3 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 2 firefighters, and Engine 4 rides with 3 firefighters with 1 firefighter as an Acting Lieutenant for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour. \n\n=== Fire Prevention Bureau ===\nThe Fire Prevention Bureau is the enforcement agency for the Township's Fire Code, which is aimed at controlling fire hazards in all structures in the community. The Fire Code mandates periodic inspections, which includes inspections of schools, local businesses, factories, hospitals, nursing homes, all commercial businesses, industrial and office buildings in the community. All new construction, including renovations and additions, are inspected by a fire official before a certificate of occupancy is issued. The bureau consists of 3 Lieutenants (1 is the Fire Official) and 1 Clerk (Secretary). Fire Prevention is also assisted by the on duty platoon which performs some inspections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> These allow each shift to familiarize themselves with the various occupancies, types of buildings and uncommon building layouts within the township.\n\n=== Fire Training Bureau ===\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department, a recognized New Jersey Division of Fire Safety Eligible Organization, conducts thousands of man-hours of training every year. Many of the training courses delivered by the Training Bureau are courses and training materials that have been developed by the New Jersey Division of Fire Safety and the National Fire Academy. Other materials presented consisted of courses developed by the Federal Government or in house using resident subject-matter experts. Whether it is through classroom, presentations, hands-on, federal, state or regional sponsored training, below are some examples of training the department and it members constantly undertake.\n\nUniformed members of the department continuously attend education courses covering a broad variety of subjects, including but not limited to: building construction; foam operations; fire pump/apparatus pump operations; rapid intervention team (RIT) operations; tower ladder operations; aerial operations at night; emergency \"bailout\" evacuation devices and technique refresher; confined space operations; decontamination/warming truck operations; EVOC of fire apparatus, a formalized driving program; forcible entry/exit; cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (recertification); automatic external defibrillators (recertification); and first responder recertification. In addition, uniformed members attended classroom sessions on: SCBA breathing techniques/smoke inhalation; asbestos awareness; hazardous materials (refresher); specialized tool/equipment usage and care; incident management; cardiac emergencies; township workplace harassment training; and PEOSHA mandated annual training on workplace hazards.\n\nThe Fire Department ensures that its members are capable of addressing emerging threats that are appearing nationally and globally. Some classes members have participated in: Active Shooter, Bakken Fuel Emergencies, Hydrogen Cyanide in Fireground operations, MRI Safety in Fire Response, and proper utilization of Personal Radiation Detectors. The department also sends members to Responding to Terrorist Bombing Incidents at New Mexico Tech sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Foam Firefighting School at Texas A&M TEEX, and the Security and Emergency Response Training Center in Boulder, Colo., for advanced training in dealing with Rail Emergencies.\n\n=== Fire Investigation Unit ===\nUnder the direction of the Chief of Department and the Fire Official the unit conducts investigations of all fires for origin and cause. In cases of arson, the unit coordinates with the [https://www.teanecknj.gov/Police-Department/ Teaneck Police Department], the [https://www.bcpo.net/ Bergen County Prosecutor's Office], the Bergen County Arson Squad and other State and Federal agencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> The Unit is on call and consists of: 1 Battalion Chief, 2 Lieutenants, and 5 Firefighters.\n\n=== Fire Alarm Bureau ===\nThe Township has 315 fire alarm boxes strategically located throughout the Township.

The Fire Department has two frequencies: the dispatch or \"main\" channel (158.82000&nbsp;MHz) and a fireground channel. (156.00000&nbsp;MHz)\n\n== Operations ==\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is 1 of only 3 fully career departments in Bergen County (Teaneck, Hackensack and Englewood) There are 3 other departments in Bergen County that use both career & volunteer members (combination): Bergenfield & [[Cresskill, New Jersey|Cresskill]] are mostly volunteer departments with a small contingent of career members, and [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]], which is mostly career with a small contingent of volunteer members\n\nAs of 2017, the department serves the second largest populous (\u224841,311), third most households (\u224814,024) and seventh largest area (6.226 square miles) in Bergen County. Furthermore, when requested they regularly respond on mutual aid to: Hackensack, Englewood, Bergenfield, Bogota, Ridgefield Park & [[New Milford, New Jersey|New Milford]]. The department responds 24 hours a day and works closely with the [https://www.teanecknj.gov/police-department Teaneck Police Department] & Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps to respond to approximately 3,200 to 4,200 calls per year involving mainly: structure fires, vehicle fires, electrical emergencies, natural gas releases, carbon monoxide incidents, explosions, rescues, outside fires, vehicle extrication's, waterborne rescue, forcing entry, service calls etc. Due to the ambulance corps abundant membership and active participation, the fire department typically does not respond on every EMS call. However, they are available to do so and frequently are on standby when the ambulance corps is dispatched. Instead the department responds: automatically on all severe calls (E.g. trauma, CPR etc.), when the ambulance corps requests them (E.g. forcible entry, calls on highways, lift assists etc.), or when the ambulance corps is unable to respond (E.g. holidays, weekends, overnights, multiple calls etc.).\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department operates out of 4 firehouses. There are 3 engines, 1 ladder truck, 3 spare engines, 1 spare ladder truck, along with various special and support units. A Battalion Chief is usually the daily tour commander and is in charge of all 4 stations.\n\nThe department has an authorized strength of 94 members: 1 Chief of Department, 2 Deputy Chiefs, 4 Battalion Chiefs, 5 Captains, (1 is the Training & Safety Officer) 19 Lieutenants (3 are Fire Prevention Officers) 61 Firefighters & 2 Clerks. (Secretaries, 1 is in Fire Prevention & 1 is Administrative)\n\nThe primary goal of the Teaneck Fire Department is to prevent fires from occurring. When a fire does occur the goal is to immediately protect life and property by promptly confining, controlling and extinguishing the fire while rescuing any trapped occupant. The average response time of the Teaneck Fire Department is three minutes from time of notification to arrival on the scene (below the recommended four minute response time).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMotor vehicle accidents occurs quite often in Teaneck due to the major highways ([[New Jersey Route 4|Rt. 4]], [[Interstate 95|Rt. 95]] & [[Interstate 80|Rt. 80]]) that are within the department's jurisdictions and main thoroughfares (Teaneck Rd, Queen Anne Rd, River Rd, Glenwood Ave, West Englewood Ave, West Forest Ave, Cedar Ln, Degraw Ave) that pass through and/or are in the town.

Her professional career continued by acting in a movie called \"Doostam\" (Friends) directed by [[Abdollah Eskandari]].

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G.

He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

When [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]] raised the matter in a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June 1945, the American copy could not be found.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=457\u2013458}} The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement. It removed the British right of consultation on the use of nuclear weapons,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} allowed for limited sharing of technical information between the United States, Britain and Canada,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=245\u2013254}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=281\u2013283}} and continued the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=34\u201335}} although the latter was renamed the [[Combined Development Agency]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=352\u2013353}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=285}}\n\nIn 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the United States available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=307\u2013308}} This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=310}} Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK, the rest would be kept in the US and Canada.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=281\u2013283}} The offer was rejected by the British on the grounds that it was not \"compatible with our status as a first-class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance\".{{sfn|Baylis|1995|p=75}}\n\nAs a counter-offer, the British proposed limiting the British programme in return for American bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=309\u2013310}} The opposition of key American officials, including [[Lewis Strauss]] from the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and Senators [[Bourke B. Hickenlooper]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]] of the [[Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE), coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist [[Klaus Fuchs]], as an [[atomic spy]], caused the proposal to be dropped.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312\u2013314}} The June 1951 defection of [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]], who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, reinforced the Americans' distrust of British security arrangements.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=74\u201375}}\n\n=== Eisenhower administration ===\nThe first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in [[Western Australia]] in [[Operation Hurricane]] on 3 October 1952,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=493\u2013495}}\nbut although it was more advanced than the American bombs of 1946, Britain was still several years behind in nuclear weapons technology.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=474\u2013475}} On 1 November, the United States conducted [[Ivy Mike]], the first [[nuclear test]] of a true [[thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] (also known as a hydrogen bomb).{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=16\u201320}} The JCAE saw little benefit for the United States from sharing technology with Britain.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974b|pp=498\u2013500}} The [[Soviet Union]] responded to Ivy Mike with the test of [[Joe 4]], a [[boosted fission weapon]] on 12 August 1953.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=27\u201330}} This prompted President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], who was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] in January 1953, to inform the [[United States Congress]] that the McMahon Act, which he considered a \"terrible piece of legislation\" and \"one of the most deplorable incidents in American history of which he personally felt ashamed\", was obsolete.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}}\n\n[[File:International Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (second from right) and Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] (left foreground) meet for talks in Bermuda in March 1957 to repair the rift created by the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]].]]\nAt the three-power Bermuda Conference in December 1953, Eisenhower and Churchill,{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=200\u2013201}} who had become prime minister again on 25 October 1951,{{sfn|Farmelo|2013|pp=372\u2013375}} discussed the possibility of the United States giving Britain access to American nuclear weapons in wartime.{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=200\u2013201}} This came to be called [[Project E]].{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=429\u2013430}} There were technical and legal issues that had to be overcome before American bombs could be carried in British aircraft. The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement. With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n==Negotiation==\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK.

Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P. Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost USD $12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war. The sale of nuclear reactors for submarines and nuclear fuel for them and other military reactors was permitted. Only Britain qualified as a nation that had made substantial progress.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=232\u2013233}} The bill passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and was signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=234\u2013236}} The 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed by Dulles and [[Samuel Hood, 6th Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]], the British Minister in Washington, DC, on 3 July,<ref name=\"full text\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/56_4.pdf |title=Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=1 June 2017 }}</ref> and approved by Congress on 30 July.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=238}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Details of the agreement===\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 080709-D-7203C-008.jpg|thumb|left|UK Defence Minister [[Des Browne]] (right) addresses a reception hosted by US Defense Secretary [[Robert M.

In return, the British provided the details of seven of theirs, including [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)#Green Grass|Green Grass]]; Pennant, the boosted device which had been detonated in the Grapple Z test on 22 August; Flagpole, the two-stage device scheduled for 2 September; Burgee, scheduled for 23 September; and the three-stage Halliard 3. The Americans were impressed with the British designs, particularly with Halliard 1, the heavier version of Halliard 3. Cook therefore changed the Grapple Z programme to fire Halliard 1 instead of Halliard 3.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=202\u2013205}} Macmillan noted in his diary, with satisfaction that:{{quote|in some respects we are as far, and even further, advanced in the art than our American friends.

After finishing this work, Thompson and his brother moved to [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]]. Maurice began working as an engineer on a railroad being built in the area, and the Thompson brothers married sisters.\n\nIn 1871 the brothers opened a law office together. In 1873 Maurice resumed submitting articles for publication ([[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]] published his first), after which he undertook a series of articles on [[archery]]. He was published in ''[[New York Tribune]]'', ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', and ''[[Harper's Monthly]]''. His first book appeared in 1875 and over the ensuing years he wrote in different genres, including novels and poetry.\n\nThompson was elected to the Indiana State Legislature in 1879. His brother Will moved to [[Seattle, Washington]] and became Western Counsel for the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railroad]], and remained active in Confederate affairs, as well as publishing a poem, \"High Tide at Gettysburg\".\n\n==Writing==\nThompson became well known as a [[American literary regionalism|local colorist]], with works ranging from local history to archery. His first book, ''Hoosier Mosaics'', published in 1875, was a collection of short stories illustrating the people and atmosphere of small [[Indiana]] towns. He followed it with a successful compilation of his published essays, ''[[The Witchery of Archery]]'', which was well received for its wit and use of common language. At this same time, Thompson also published several collections of naturalistic poetry, though they weren't well received at the time.\n\nThompson wrote the poem \"To the South\" that was reprinted in [[George Washington Cable]]'s influential and controversial essay, \"The Freedmen's Case in Equity\" in 1885.
