The episode first aired in the United States on December 9, 2001, on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network. It was written by [[Steven Maeda]] and directed by [[Tony Wharmby]]. The episode is a \"monster-of-the-week\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]], or overarching fictional history, of ''The X-Files''. The episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 5.1 and was viewed by 5.38 million households. It received mixed to positive reviews from television critics.\n\nThe show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s; this season focuses on the investigations of [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). In this episode, a vicious murderer named Irwin Lukesh, capable of jumping between parallel universes, shoots Doggett using Reyes' gun. [[Brad Follmer]] opens an investigation to figure out the truth. They eventually deduce that Lukesh is the real murderer.\n\nMaeda wrote the episode after being inspired by the situation of a real-life French journalist, [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]], who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and was created by Maeda in the hopes that he would go on to be a memorable villain. Effects expert [[Mat Beck]] created the unique visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. To create the effect of a parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) monitors Irwin Lukesh, a suspected [[serial killer]] who cuts out his victims' tongues. While pursuing him, Reyes goes into an apartment building and is attacked by Lukesh with a razor. [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), observes the pursuit electronically and hears a scream. He rushes to help Reyes and finds her dying, her throat cut. Doggett chases Lukesh into an alleyway, where the killer seemingly vanishes. Lukesh then appears behind Doggett and fires at him with Reyes' gun.\n\nThe setting then changes; Doggett arrives at Reyes' new apartment with a housewarming gift. Neither seems to be aware of the previous events. Reyes then receives a phone call from [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), who informs her that Doggett has been shot and is being taken to the hospital. Reyes tells Skinner that Doggett is in her apartment, but then finds that he has vanished. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] matches the bullet surgically removed from Doggett with Reyes' gun and she is questioned by [[Brad Follmer]] ([[Cary Elwes]]), but she insists that Doggett was with her at the time of the shooting. Meanwhile, Lukesh watches the interrogation and identifies Reyes as the shooter.\n\nDoggett regains consciousness, but is breathing with the help of a respirator.  Meanwhile, Lukesh goes to his apartment where he lives with his disabled mother. As he prepares to fix her lunch, he goes to his freezer and pulls out a bag containing a human tongue, intending to surreptitiously feeding it to her, as he has many times before. Reyes performs a background check on Lukesh, and becomes convinced that he is in fact responsible for the shooting. Reyes goes to Doggett, and through a computer setup that enables him to tap out words on a screen, Doggett tells her that Lukesh shot him but that Doggett also saw her with her throat cut.\n\nLukesh then returns to the alleyway where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because two versions of the same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.\n\nDoggett tells Reyes that, in order to resolve the situation, she must turn off his respirator and allow him to die, but she refuses. Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next, Skinner convinces Reyes to go back to her apartment while he, Scully, and Follmer monitor her. She returns and is attacked by Lukesh. The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head, killing him. Reyes then returns to the hospital, closing her eyes as she shuts off Doggett's respirator.  As she opens her eyes, the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared earlier. Reyes, stunned and fighting back tears, embraces Doggett as he, evidently unaware of any of the previous events, asks her what is wrong.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/episodeguide/nine/page4.shtml |title=4-D |publisher=[[BBC]]|work=BBC Cult|accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Hitchcock, Alfred 02.jpg|The episode's villain, Lukesh, was inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.|200px|thumb|right]]\nWriter [[Steven Maeda]] had previously written the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]] episodes \"[[Redrum (The X-Files)|Redrum]]\" and \"[[Vienen]]\"; due to their success, Maeda was asked to pen a ninth season standalone episode. His efforts were hampered by the fact that, due to the departure of [[David Duchovny]], the show had changed considerably. Maeda was inspired to write the episode after learning the story of a French journalist name [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]], who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid.

The episode first aired in the United States on December 9, 2001, on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network. It was written by [[Steven Maeda]] and directed by [[Tony Wharmby]]. The episode is a \"monster-of-the-week\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]], or overarching fictional history, of ''The X-Files''. The episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 5.1 and was viewed by 5.38 million households. It received mixed to positive reviews from television critics.\n\nThe show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s; this season focuses on the investigations of [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). In this episode, a vicious murderer named Irwin Lukesh, capable of jumping between parallel universes, shoots Doggett using Reyes' gun. [[Brad Follmer]] opens an investigation to figure out the truth. They eventually deduce that Lukesh is the real murderer.\n\nMaeda wrote the episode after being inspired by the situation of a real-life French journalist, [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]], who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and was created by Maeda in the hopes that he would go on to be a memorable villain. Effects expert [[Mat Beck]] created the unique visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. To create the effect of a parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) monitors Irwin Lukesh, a suspected [[serial killer]] who cuts out his victims' tongues. While pursuing him, Reyes goes into an apartment building and is attacked by Lukesh with a razor. [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), observes the pursuit electronically and hears a scream. He rushes to help Reyes and finds her dying, her throat cut. Doggett chases Lukesh into an alleyway, where the killer seemingly vanishes. Lukesh then appears behind Doggett and fires at him with Reyes' gun.\n\nThe setting then changes; Doggett arrives at Reyes' new apartment with a housewarming gift. Neither seems to be aware of the previous events. Reyes then receives a phone call from [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), who informs her that Doggett has been shot and is being taken to the hospital. Reyes tells Skinner that Doggett is in her apartment, but then finds that he has vanished. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] matches the bullet surgically removed from Doggett with Reyes' gun and she is questioned by [[Brad Follmer]] ([[Cary Elwes]]), but she insists that Doggett was with her at the time of the shooting. Meanwhile, Lukesh watches the interrogation and identifies Reyes as the shooter.\n\nDoggett regains consciousness, but is breathing with the help of a respirator.  Meanwhile, Lukesh goes to his apartment where he lives with his disabled mother. As he prepares to fix her lunch, he goes to his freezer and pulls out a bag containing a human tongue, intending to surreptitiously feeding it to her, as he has many times before. Reyes performs a background check on Lukesh, and becomes convinced that he is in fact responsible for the shooting. Reyes goes to Doggett, and through a computer setup that enables him to tap out words on a screen, Doggett tells her that Lukesh shot him but that Doggett also saw her with her throat cut.\n\nLukesh then returns to the alleyway where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because two versions of the same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.\n\nDoggett tells Reyes that, in order to resolve the situation, she must turn off his respirator and allow him to die, but she refuses. Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next, Skinner convinces Reyes to go back to her apartment while he, Scully, and Follmer monitor her. She returns and is attacked by Lukesh. The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head, killing him. Reyes then returns to the hospital, closing her eyes as she shuts off Doggett's respirator.  As she opens her eyes, the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared earlier. Reyes, stunned and fighting back tears, embraces Doggett as he, evidently unaware of any of the previous events, asks her what is wrong.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/episodeguide/nine/page4.shtml |title=4-D |publisher=[[BBC]]|work=BBC Cult|accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:Hitchcock, Alfred 02.jpg|The episode's villain, Lukesh, was inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.|200px|thumb|right]]\nWriter [[Steven Maeda]] had previously written the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]] episodes \"[[Redrum (The X-Files)|Redrum]]\" and \"[[Vienen]]\"; due to their success, Maeda was asked to pen a ninth season standalone episode.
