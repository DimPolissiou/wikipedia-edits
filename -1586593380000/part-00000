It must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride in a 1:10 ratio before use.  A volumetric infusion pump is used for slow administration (0.5&nbsp;mL/min for the initial 30 minutes) to minimize the possibility of allergic reactions. If no reactions are noted, the rate is increased to 1&nbsp;mL/min for another 30 minutes, and then if still no reaction is evident, to 2&nbsp;mL/min for the remainder of the procedure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reference.medscape.com/drug/hbat-botulinum-antitoxin-heptavalent-999488|title=HBAT (botulinum antitoxin, heptavalent) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more.|website=reference.medscape.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Passive immunity]]\n* [[Antitoxin]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* CDC/MMWR (March 19, 2010): [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5910a4.htm \u201cInvestigational Heptavalent Botulinum Antitoxin (HBAT) to Replace Licensed Botulinum Antitoxin AB and Investigational Botulinum Antitoxin E\u201d].\n* FDA News Release (March 22, 2013): [https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm345128.htm \u201cFDA approves first Botulism Antitoxin for use in neutralizing all seven known botulinum nerve toxin serotypes\u201d].\n\n[[Category:Antitoxins]]\n[[Category:Immune system]]\n[[Category:Immunology]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Biological warfare]]\n[[Category:Botulism]]\n", "name_user": "Kahtar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Repair CS1 error(s), replaced: website=www. \u2192 website=", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptavalent_botulism_antitoxin"}

The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low, smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\nAlpine newts are blackish\u2013grey to bluish on the sides and the back, while their belly is an unspotted orange. Males also have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Females are of a more drab, mottled colour than males. Body shape and colour differ slightly among the subspecies.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u20138 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|4-5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are usually light brown-yellow and darker towards the tail, which ends in a small, pointed filament.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n==Taxonomy and Systematics==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768, as ''Triton alpestris'' from mount [[\u00d6tscher]] in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin), by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]].{{r|Laurenti1768}} Laurenti thought that males, females and larvae were different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. As this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages, the alpine newt was split off as [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, it was argued that a gilled newt Laurenti had described as ''Proteus tritonius'' in fact represented a larva of the alpine newt. The name ''Ichthyosaura'', introduced by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] in 1801 for that larva,{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nThe subdivision of the alpine newt is controversial. A number of subspecies have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} However, there are clearly distinct ancient [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]] within the species (see section ''Evolution'' below). Several authors therefore argued that the alpine newt might even represent several [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 accepted four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this has been considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\nFour subspecies were recognised in the ''Handbook of the Amphibians and Reptiles of Europe'' (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} and this has been followed by a 2010 monograph{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=16-36}} and ''Salamanders of the Old World'' (2014):{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=214}}\n\n*Alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}: The [[nominate subspecies|nominate]], northernmost and most widespread subspecies.

It reaches southern Denmark in the north. In the south, it occurs until just north of Mediterranean France and in the Alps.\n\n* The ''eastern group'' of the nominate subspecies is found in the [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece, and until Bulgaria in the east as well as in the southern Carpathians in Romania.\n\n* The Appenine alpine newt (''I. a. apuana'') is separated from the northern subspecies by the [[Po valley]]. It occurs from extreme southeastern France over the [[Apennines]] until [[Lazio]] in central Italy. Isolated populations from three mountain lakes in [[Cantabria]] have also been considered as different subspecies, ''I. a. inexpectata''.\n\n* The Cantabrian alpine newt (''I. a. cyreni'') is found in the [[Cantabrian mountains]] of northern Spain, isolated from the rest of the species' range. An isolated population in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] of central Spain is probably the result of an introduction.\n\n* The Greek Alpine newt (''I. a. veluchiensis'') is found from the Greek mainland to the northern [[Peloponnese]], where the southernmost populations of the alpine newt occur.\n\nAlpine newts have been deliberately introduced to various places in Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==Habitat==\n\nLike other newts, the alpine newt depends on both humid, cover-rich land habitats as well as aquatic breeding sites. It tolerates a wide range of conditions. In its terrestrial phase, it is mainly found in forested and recently cleared areas, where it hides under logs, stones or in small [[burrow]]s. Breeding sites can vary from temporary puddles to ponds, large reservoirs and quiet parts of streams, and the species is relatively tolerant regarding temperature and [[eutrophication]].{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv | thumb | right | Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg | thumb | right | Paedomorphic adult (above) and larva (below) of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nThe aquatic phase starts as soon as ice starts to disappear, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August. Alpine newts tend to visit the same breeding sites again each year.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Like in other newts, males perform a [[courtship display]], which differs somewhat from other species. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while and, fans its tail to stimulate the female and waves [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with rivals' display.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}  Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}\n\nFemales attach their eggs individually to water plants or other objects. They lay clutches of 70\u2013390 eggs, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (with a 2.5\u20133 mm capsule). Incubation time depends on temperature, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks. They [[metamorphose]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year. [[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults retain a larva-like appearance with [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is common. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts can co-occur and interbreed, but appear to prefer different prey.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\nThe alpine newt reaches [[sexual maturity]] at around three years in males, and four to five years in females, and can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\nFeeding takes place mainly during the night. Alpine newts take various [[invertebrates]] such as [[earthworms]], [[isopod]]s, small insects and [[crane fly]] and [[mayfly]] larvae, but also eggs and larvae of other amphibians. Their predators include snakes, birds and fish.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt [[population]]s have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular phylogenetic]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Fossil remains of the alpine newt were found in the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be its [[sister species]].{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nAnalyses showed that populations fall into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which only in part correspond to described [[subspecies]] (see below).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the [[Miocene]] or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial DNA]] show different population structures, which may results from [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages. The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of population retreat, expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt is classified as [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]; the population trend however is \"Decreasing\".{{r|iucn}} Threats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats, as well as the introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]], to breeding sites.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}} In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by [[chytridiomycosis]],{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, [[eradication]] was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3-4 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite url | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ cite web |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

The tail is half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body and laterally compressed. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low, smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\nAlpine newts are blackish\u2013grey to bluish on the sides and the back, while their belly is an unspotted orange. Males also have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Females are of a more drab, mottled colour than males. Body shape and colour differ slightly among the subspecies.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u20138 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|4-5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. They are usually light brown-yellow and darker towards the tail, which ends in a small, pointed filament.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n==Taxonomy and Systematics==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768, as ''Triton alpestris'' from mount [[\u00d6tscher]] in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin), by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]].{{r|Laurenti1768}} Laurenti thought that males, females and larvae were different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. As this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages, the alpine newt was split off as [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, it was argued that a gilled newt Laurenti had described as ''Proteus tritonius'' in fact represented a larva of the alpine newt. The name ''Ichthyosaura'', introduced by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] in 1801 for that larva,{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nThe subdivision of the alpine newt is controversial. A number of subspecies have been described, but many were not recognised by later authors. Differences in shape and colour are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} However, there are clearly distinct ancient [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]] within the species (see section ''Evolution'' below). Several authors therefore argued that the alpine newt might even represent several [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} An article from 2018 accepted four species,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this has been considered premature in ''Amphibian Species of the World''.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\nFour subspecies were recognised in the ''Handbook of the Amphibians and Reptiles of Europe'' (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} and this has been followed by a 2010 monograph{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=16-36}} and ''Salamanders of the Old World'' (2014):{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=214}}\n\n*Alpine newt \u2013 ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}: The [[nominate subspecies|nominate]], northernmost and most widespread subspecies.

It reaches southern Denmark in the north. In the south, it occurs until just north of mediterranean France and in the Alps.\n\n* The ''eastern group'' of the nominate subspecies is found in the [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece, and until Bulgaria in the east as well as in the southern Carpathians in Romania.\n\n* The Appenine alpine newt (''I. a. apuana'') is separated from the northern subspecies by the [[Po valley]]. It occurs from the extrem southeastern France over the [[Apennines]] until [[Lazio]] in central Italy. Isolated populations from three mountain lakes in [[Cantabria]] have also been considered as different subspecies, ''I. a. inexpectata''.\n\n* The Cantabrian alpine newt (''I. a. cyreni'') is found in the [[Cantabrian mountains]] of northern Spain, isolated from the rest of the species' range. An isolated population in the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] of central Spain is probably the result of an introduction.\n\n* The Greek Alpine newt (''I. a. veluchiensis'') is found from the Greek mainland to the northern [[Peloponnese]], where the southernmost populations of the alpine newt occur.\n\nAlpine newts have been deliberately introduced to various places in Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==Habitat==\n\nLike other newts, the alpine newt depends on both humid, cover-rich land habitats as well as aquatic breeding sites. It tolerates a wide range of conditions. In its terrrestrial phase, it is mainly found in forested and recently cleared areas, where it hides under logs, stones or in small [[burrow]]s. Breeding sites can vary from temporary puddles to ponds, large reservoirs and quiet parts of streams, and the species is relatively tolerant regarding temperature and [[eutrophication]].{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\n==Life and behaviour==\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv | thumb | right | Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n[[File:Mesotriton alpestris apuanus04.jpg | thumb | right | Paedomorphic adult (above) and larva (below) of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nThe aquatic phase starts as soon as ice starts to disappear, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August. Alpine newts tend to visit the same breeding sites again each year.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Like in other newts, males perform a [[courtship display]], which differs somewhat from other species. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while and, fans its tail to stimulate the female and waves [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with rivals' display.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}  Experiments suggested that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}\n\nFemales attach their eggs individually to water plants or other objects. They lay clutches of 70\u2013390 eggs, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (with a 2.5\u20133 mm capsule). Incubation time depends on temperature, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks. They [[metamorphose]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year. [[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults retain a larva-like appearance with [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is common. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts can co-occur and interbreed, but appear to prefer different prey.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\nThe alpine newt reaches [[sexual maturity]] at around three years in males, and four to five years in females, and can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\nFeeding takes place mainly during the night. Alpine newts take various [[invertebrates]] such as [[earthworms]], [[isopod]]s, small insects and [[crane fly]] and [[mayfly]] larvae, but also eggs and larvae of other amphibians. Their predators include snakes, birds and fish.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt [[population]]s have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular phylogenetic]] estimate.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Fossil remains of the alpine newt were found in the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be its [[sister species]].{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nAnalyses showed that populations fall into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which only in part correspond to described [[subspecies]] (see below).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the [[Miocene]] or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial DNA]] show different population structures, which may results from [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages. The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of population retreat, expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt is classified as [[Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]]; the population trend however is \"Decreasing\".{{r|iucn}} Threats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats, as well as the introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]], to breeding sites.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}} In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=216}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by [[chytridiomycosis]],{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, [[eradication]] was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3-4 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite url | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ cite web |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

Objects, people and situations that remind Nikki of the love of her life still haunt her. Resigned to life alone, Nikki visits an art gallery she often frequented with Garret and sees a man ([[Ed Harris|Harris in a dual role]]) whose resemblance to her husband stuns her.  She returns to the gallery several more times, hoping to see him.  Eventually, Nikki identifies him as a professor at a small local college.  She finds \"Tom\" on the internet and visits an art class he is teaching; but she is emotionally overwhelmed and flees.  Eventually, Nikki calms down and invites Tom to give her private, at home,  tutoring in painting.  She doesn't disclose to him his physical resemblance to her late husband.\n\nNikki and Tom become lovers, to the emotional distress of her neighbor ([[Robin Williams]]), who has hoped to attract her interest romantically since the death of Garret, his friend.  The strain of keeping Tom a secret from her friends and family, who would immediately recognize the uncanny resemblance, begins to wear on Nikki, Tom, and the relationship.  Nikki is not alone in keeping secrets in the relationship.  Tom, who is divorced for 10 years from his ex-wife yet still maintains a close friendship with her, does not tell Nikki he suffers from a severe heart ailment.   When Nikki\u2019s adult daughter Summer visits unexpectedly, finding Tom at the house, she flies into a rage repulsed by Tom\u2019s appearance.  Tom believes her outrage is triggered simply by his presence.   \nTom, puzzled by the daughter's reaction, accepts when Nikki asks him to fly off to Mexico with her. At a resort often visited by Garret and Nikki when they were married, Tom discovers a photo of Nikki and her husband by the bar, notices the resemblance and also realizes that a psychologically imbalanced Nikki has brought him to the very place her husband died.  Tom confronts her with the resemblance and Nikki runs off into the raging surf, perhaps to commit suicide.  She is rescued by Tom and they later hold one another in bed with the knowledge the relationship isn't based on anything more than his physical similarity to Garret and is doomed.\n\nA year later, Summer finds an art gallery card in Nikki's mail that turns out to be an invitation to a memorial display of Tom's art.  Tom has died of his heart condition but produced an outpouring of art in his last year.

Objects, people and situations that remind Nikki of the love of her life still haunt her. Resigned to life alone, Nikki visits an art gallery she often frequented with Garret and sees a man ([[Ed Harris|Harris in a dual role]]) whose resemblance to her husband stuns her.  She returns to the gallery several more times, hoping to see him.  Eventually, Nikki identifies him as a professor at a small local college.  She finds \"Tom\" on the internet and visits an art class he is teaching; but she is emotionally overwhelmed and flees.  Eventually, Nikki calms down and invites Tom to give her private, at home,  tutoring in painting.  She doesn't disclose to him his physical resemblance to her late husband.\n\nNikki and Tom become lovers, to the emotional distress of her neighbor ([[Robin Williams]]), who has hoped to attract her interest romantically since the death of Garret, his friend.  The strain of keeping Tom a secret from her friends and family, who would immediately recognize the uncanny resemblance, begins to wear on Nikki, Tom, and the relationship.  Nikki is not alone in keeping secrets in the relationship.  Tom, who is divorced for 10 years from his ex-wife yet still maintains a close friendship with her, does not tell Nikki he suffers from a severe heart ailment.   When Nikki\u2019s adult daughter Summer visits unexpectedly, finding Tom at the house, she flies into a rage repulsed by Tom\u2019s appearance.  Tom believes her outrage is triggered simply by his presence.   \nTom, puzzled by the daughter's reaction, accepts when Nikki asks him to fly off to Mexico with her. At a resort often visited by Garret and Nikki when they were married, Tom discovers a photo of Nikki and her husband by the bar, notices the resemblance and also realizes that a psychologically imbalanced Nikki has brought him to the very place her husband died.  Tom confronts her with the resemblance and Nikki runs off into the raging surf, perhaps to commit suicide.  She is rescued by Tom and they later hold one another in bed with the knowledge the relationship isn't based in anything more than his physical similarities to Garret and is doomed.\n\nA year later, Summer finds an art gallery card in Nikki's mail that turns out to be an invitation to a memorial display of Tom's art.  Tom has died of his heart condition but produced an outpouring of art in his last year.  Nikki attends the reception hosted by Tom's ex-wife and tearfully sees Tom's painting of the two of them titled \"The Face of Love\". He has painted a haunting self portrait of himself with Nikki standing in her pool at her home looking at him.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Annette Bening]] as Nikki\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Tom/Garrett\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Roger\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] as Ann, Tom's ex-wife\n* [[Jess Weixler]] as Summer\n* [[Linda Park]] as Jan\n* Jeffrey Vincent Parise\n* Kim Farris as Hostess\n* Leah Shaw as Farmers market shopper\n* Chelsea O'Connor as Gallery Waitress\n* Deana Molle' as Couple #2\n* Yuki Bird as Waitress\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe film was shot in [[Los Angeles]] in 2012, and produced by Mockingbird Pictures.\n\n=== Release ===\nIn May 2013 [[IFC Films]] acquired the rights of the film to distribute in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite news|title=IFC Films Buys 'The Face of Love'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/ifc-films-buys-the-face-of-love|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=indiewire.com|date=16 May 2013}}</ref> The film was released in September 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cannes: IFC Lands \u2018The Face Of Love\u2019|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/05/cannes-ifc-lands-us-on-the-face-of-love/|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=deadline.com|date=16 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Face of Love'' has an approval rating of 43% based on 68 reviews, with a rating of 5.2/10.

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss his marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.  In paintings such as ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]],'' ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross|The Christ of Saint John on the Cross]]'' and ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]],'' Dal\u00ed sought to synthesize Christian [[iconography]] with images of material disintegration inspired by [[nuclear physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed Bio, Art on 5th|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504050531/http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|archive-date=4 May 2006|access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 461-63</ref> His later Nuclear Mysticism works included ''[[La Gare de Perpignan]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'' (1968\u201370).\n\nDal\u00ed's keen interest in natural science and [[mathematics and art|mathematics]] was further manifested by the proliferation of images of DNA and [[rhinoceros horn]] shapes in works from the mid-1950s.

In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Workers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959. He had official meetings with General Franco in June 1956, October 1968 and May 1974.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 486, 543, 553</ref> In 1968 Dal\u00ed stated that on Franco's death there should be no return to democracy and Spain should become an absolute monarchy.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 525-27</ref> In September 1975 Dal\u00ed publicly supported Franco's decision to execute three alleged Basque terrorists and repeated his support for an absolute monarchy, adding: \"Personally, I'm against freedom; I'm for the Holy Inquisition.\"  In the following days he fled to New York after his home in Port Lligat was stoned and he had received numerous death threats.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 560-62</ref> When King Juan Carlos visited the ailing Dal\u00ed in August 1981, the painter told him: \"I have always been an anarchist and a monarchist.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 587</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed espoused a mystical view of Catholicism and In his later years he claimed to be a Catholic and an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Descharnes, Gilles N\u00e9ret|url=https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed, 1904-1989|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|year=1994|isbn=978-3-8228-0298-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166 166]|quote=Dal\u00ed, dualist as ever in his approach, was now claiming to be both an agnostic and a Roman Catholic.}}</ref>  He was interested in the writings of the Jesuit priest and philosopher [[Teilhard de Chardin]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=McNeese|first=Tim|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed|publisher=Chelsea House|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7910-8837-1|location=|page=102}}</ref> and his [[Omega Point]] theory. Dal\u00ed's painting ''[[Tuna Fishing (painting)|Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier)]]'' (1967) was inspired by his reading of Chardin.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 525</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nDal\u00ed's sexuality had a profound influence on his work. He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

He submitted ''Dialogue on the Beach (Unsatisfied Desires)'' (1928) to the Barcelona Autumn Salon for 1928 but the work was rejected because \"it was not fit to be exhibited in any gallery habitually visited by the numerous public little prepared for certain surprises.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 287</ref> The resulting scandal was widely covered in the Barcelona press and prompted a popular Madrid illustrated weekly to publish an interview with the now controversial artist.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 186-190</ref>\n\nSome trends in Dal\u00ed's work that would continue throughout his life were already evident in the 1920s.

Don Salvador Dal\u00ed y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala, and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her.

Works included ''[[Basket of Bread]]'', ''Atomic and Uranian Melancholic Ideal'', and ''My Wife Nude Contemplating her own Body Transformed into Steps, the Three Vertebrae of a Column, Sky and Architecture''.

Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

({{lang-tr|Balkan Sava\u015flar\u0131}}, literally \"the Balkan Wars\" or ''Balkan Facias\u0131'', meaning \"the Balkan Tragedy\",{{lang-gr|\u039f\u03b9

Peninsula]] in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the first war. In the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria fought against all four original combatants of the first war along with facing a surprise attack from Romania from the north. The conflicts ended catastrophically for the Ottoman Empire, which lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Clark|2013|pp=45, 559}} The war set the stage for the [[July Crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914]] and thus served as a \"prelude to the [[First World War]]\".{{sfn|Hall|2000}}\n\nBy the early 20th century, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] had achieved independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule. In 1912 these countries formed the [[Balkan League]]. The First Balkan War had three main causes:{{sfn|Helmreich|1938}}{{sfn|Hall|2000}}\n\n# The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples.\n# The [[Great Power]]s quarreled amongst themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.\n# Most importantly, the Balkan League had been formed, and its members were confident that it could defeat the Turks.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire lost all its European territories to the west of the River [[Maritsa]] as a result of the two Balkan Wars, which thus delineated present-day Turkey's western border. A large influx of Turks started to flee into the [[Anatolia|Ottoman heartland]] from the lost lands. By 1914, the remaining core region of the Ottoman Empire had experienced a population increase of around 2.5 million because of the flood of immigration from the Balkans.\n\nCitizens of Turkey regard the Balkan Wars as a major disaster (''Balkan harbi facias\u0131'') in the [[Ottoman Empire#Defeat and dissolution (1908\u20131922)|nation's history]]. The unexpected fall and sudden relinquishing of Turkish-dominated European territories created a [[Psychological trauma|psycho-traumatic]] event amongst many Turks that triggered the ultimate [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|collapse]] of the empire itself within five years. [[Naz\u0131m Pasha]], Chief of Staff of the [[Ottoman Army]], was held responsible for the failure and was assassinated on 23 January 1913 during the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'\u00e9tat]].<ref>Gul Tokay. \"Ottoman diplomacy, the Balkan Wars and the Great Powers\". In Dominik Geppert, William Mulligan, Andreas Rose, eds. ''The Wars before the Great War'' {{ISBN|978-1-107-06347-1}}, 2015, p. 70</ref>\n\nThe [[First Balkan War]] began when the League member states attacked the Ottoman Empire on 8 October 1912 and ended eight months later with the signing of the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] on 30 May 1913. The [[Second Balkan War]] began on 16 June 1913. Both Serbia and Greece, utilizing the argument that the war had been prolonged, repudiated important particulars of the pre-war treaty and retained occupation of all the conquered districts in their possession, which were to be divided according to specific predefined boundaries. Seeing the treaty as trampled, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] (made in secret by its former allies, Serbia and Greece) and commenced military action against them. The more numerous combined Serbian and Greek armies repelled the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] from the west and the south. [[Romania]], having taken no part in the conflict, had intact armies to strike with and invaded Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty between the two states. The Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and advanced in Thrace regaining [[Adrianople]]. In the resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War in addition to being forced to cede the ex-Ottoman south-third of [[Dobruja|Dobroudja province]] to [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Winston Churchill|title=[[The World Crisis]], 1911\u20131918|year=1931|publisher=Thornton Butterworth|p=278}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Map-of-Ottoman-Empire-1900.png|thumb|left|Map of the Ottoman Empire in 1900, with the names of the [[Vilayet|Ottoman provinces]].]]\n\n[[File:Balkan troubles1.jpg|thumb|Germany, France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Britain attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the Balkans to prevent a general European war. They were successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in 1914.]]\n\n[[File:Meurtre de Nazim Pacha illustration, 9 February 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Naz\u0131m Pasha]], the chief of staff of the Ottoman army, was assassinated by [[Young Turks]] due to his failure.]]\nThe background to the wars lies in the incomplete emergence of [[nation-states]] on the European territory of the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 19th century. Serbia had gained substantial territory during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878]], while Greece acquired [[Thessaly]] in 1881 (although [[Treaty of Constantinople (1897)|it lost a small area]] back to the Ottoman Empire in 1897) and Bulgaria (an autonomous [[principality]] since 1878) incorporated the formerly distinct province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] (1885). All three countries, as well as Montenegro, sought additional territories within the large Ottoman-ruled region known as [[Rumelia]], comprising Eastern Rumelia, [[Albania]], Macedonia, and [[Thrace]].\n\n===Policies of the Great Powers===\nThroughout the 19th century, the [[Great Power]]s shared different aims over the \"[[Eastern Question]]\" and the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. [[Russia]] wanted access to the \"warm waters\" of the [[Mediterranean]] from the Black Sea; it pursued a [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic]] foreign policy and therefore supported Bulgaria and Serbia. Britain wished to deny Russia access to the \"warm waters\" and supported the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, although it also supported a limited expansion of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] as a backup plan in case integrity of the Empire was no longer possible. France wished to strengthen its position in the region, especially in the [[Levant]] (today's [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Israel]]).\n\n[[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]] wished for a continuation of the existence of the Ottoman Empire, since both were troubled multinational entities and thus the collapse of the one might weaken the other. The Habsburgs also saw a strong Ottoman presence in the area as a counterweight to the Serbian nationalistic call to their own Serb subjects in [[Bosnia]], Vojvodina and other parts of the empire. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s primary aim at the time seems to have been the denial of access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] to another major sea power. [[The German Empire]], in turn, under the \"[[Drang nach Osten]]\" policy, aspired to turn the Ottoman Empire into its own de facto colony, and thus supported its integrity.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Bulgaria and Greece contended for Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace. Ethnic Greeks sought the forced \"Hellenization\" of ethnic Bulgars, who sought \"Bulgarization\" of Greeks ([[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire#Bulgarians|Rise of nationalism]]). Both nations sent armed irregulars into Ottoman territory to protect and assist their ethnic kindred. From 1904, there was low intensity warfare in Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army (the [[Struggle for Macedonia]]). After the [[Young Turks|Young Turk revolution]] of July 1908, the situation changed drastically.\n\n===Young Turk Revolution===\n{{Main|Young Turk Revolution}}\nThe 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] saw the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire and the start of the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to re-adopt the long defunct [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and [[Ottoman parliament|parliament]]. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament. However, following the Sultan's [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|attempted counter-coup]], the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.\n\nAt the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the ''de jure'' Ottoman province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it had occupied since 1878 (see ''[[Bosnian Crisis]]''). Bulgaria declared independence as it had done in 1878, but this time the independence was internationally recognised. The Greeks of the autonomous [[Cretan State]] proclaimed unification with Greece, though the opposition of the Great Powers prevented the latter action from taking practical effect. It has large influence in the consequent world order.\n\n===Reaction in the Balkan States===\n\nSerbia was frustrated in the north by Austria-Hungary's incorporation of Bosnia. In March 1909, Serbia was forced to accept the annexation and restrain anti-Habsburg agitation by Serbian nationalists. Instead, the Serbian government (PM: [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]]) looked to formerly Serb territories in the south, notably \"Old Serbia\" (the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and the province of [[Kosovo]]).\n\nOn 15 August 1909, the [[Military League]], a group of Greek officers, took action against the government to reform their country's national government and reorganize the army. The Military League found itself unable to create a new political system, until the League summoned the Cretan politician [[Eleutherios Venizelos]] to Athens as its political adviser. Venizelos persuaded king [[George I of Greece#Later reign and assassination|George I]] to revise the constitution and asked the League to disband in favor of a National Assembly. In March 1910, the Military League dissolved itself.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9052680 \"Military League\"], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online</ref>\n\nBulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia,<ref name=\"Congress\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/12.htm|title = THE BALKAN WARS|publisher=[[US Library of Congress]]| accessdate =15 April 2008 }}</ref> also looked to annex districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia. In August 1910, Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom.\n\n===Balkan League===\n{{Main|Balkan League}}\n[[File:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bulgarian forces waiting to start their assault on [[Adrianople]]]]\n\nFollowing the Italian victory in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u20131912 and a series of three revolts in Ottoman held Albania the Young Turks fell from power after a coup. The Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire and fulfill their desires of expansion.\n\nWith the initial encouragement of Russian agents, a series of agreements was concluded between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912. Military victory against the Ottoman Empire would not be possible while it could bring reinforcements from Asia. The condition of the Ottoman railways of the time was not advanced, so most reinforcements would have to come by sea through the [[Aegean Sea]]. Greece was the only Balkan country with a navy powerful enough to deny use of the Aegean to the Ottoman Empire, thus a treaty between Greece and Bulgaria became necessary; it was signed in May 1912.\n\nMontenegro concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria later that year. Bulgaria signed treaties with Serbia to divide the territory of northern Macedonia.\n\nThis alliance between Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro became known as the Balkan League; its existence was undesirable to all the Great Powers. The League was loose at best, though secret liaison officers were exchanged between the Greek and the Serbian army after the war began. Greece delayed the start of the war several times in the summer of 1912, to better prepare her navy, but Montenegro declared war on 8 October (25 September [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]). Following an ultimatum to the Ottoman Empire, the remaining members of the alliance entered the conflict on 17 October.\n\n==First Balkan War==\n{{Main|First Balkan War}}\n[[File:Balkan belligerants 1914.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Territorial changes as a result of the First Balkan war, as of April 1913 showing the prewar agreed line of expansion between [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]]]\n[[File:King George I of Greece and Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria at Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The apple of discord: King [[George I of Greece]] and Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] at Thessaloniki, December 1912. Despite their alliance, Greco-Bulgarian antagonism over the city and Macedonia in general did not abate.]]\n\nThe three Slavic allies (Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro) had laid out extensive plans to coordinate their war efforts, in continuation of their secret prewar settlements and under close Russian supervision (Greece was not included). Serbia and Montenegro would attack in the theater of Sandjak, Bulgaria and Serbia in Macedonia and Thrace.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire's situation was difficult. Its population of about 26 million people provided a massive pool of manpower, but three-quarters of the population and nearly all of [[Islam in the Ottoman Empire|the Muslim component]] lived in the Asian part of the Empire. Reinforcements had to come from Asia mainly by sea, which depended on the result of battles between the Turkish and Greek navies in the Aegean.\n\nWith the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman Empire activated three Army HQs: the Thracian HQ in [[Constantinople]], the Western HQ in Salonika, and the Vardar HQ in [[Skopje]], against the Bulgarians, the Greeks and the Serbians respectively. Most of their available forces were allocated to these fronts. Smaller independent units were allocated elsewhere, mostly around heavily fortified cities.\n\nMontenegro was the first that declared war on 8 October{{sfn|Hall|2000}} (25 September O.S.). Its main thrust was towards [[Shkodra]], with secondary operations in the [[Novi Pazar]] area. The rest of the Allies, after giving a common ultimatum, declared war a week later. Bulgaria attacked towards Eastern Thrace, being stopped only at the outskirts of [[Constantinople]] at the [[\u00c7atalca]] line and the isthmus of the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], while secondary forces captured Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. Serbia attacked south towards [[Skopje]] and [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] and then turned west to present-day [[Albania]], reaching the [[Adriatic]], while a second Army captured [[Kosovo]] and linked with the Montenegrin forces. Greece's main forces attacked from [[Thessaly]] into Macedonia through the [[Sarantaporo]] strait. On 7 November, in response to an Ottoman initiative, they entered into negotiations for the surrender of Salonika. With the Greeks on hand, and the Bulgarian 7th Rila Division moving rapidly from the north, Hassan Tahsin Pasha considered his position to be hopeless. {{sfn|Hall|2000|p=61}}. The Greeks offered more attractive terms than the Bulgarians did. On 8 November, Tahsin Pasha agreed to terms, and 26,000 Ottoman troops passed over into Greek captivity. Before the Greeks entered the city, a German warship whisked the former sultan Abdul Hamid out of Salonika to continue his exile across the Bosporus from Constantinople. With their army in Salonika, the Greeks took positions to the east and northeast, including [[Nigrita]]. On 12 November (on 26 October 1912, [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]) Greece expanded its occupied area and linked up with the Serbian army to the northwest, while its main forces turned east towards [[Kavala]], reaching the Bulgarians. Another Greek army attacked into [[Epirus]] towards [[Ioannina]].<ref name=\"BA01\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011972 Balkan Wars] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.</ref>\n\nOn the naval front, the Ottoman fleet twice exited the [[Dardanelles]] and was twice defeated by the [[Greek Navy]], in the battles of [[Naval Battle of Elli|Elli]] and [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Lemnos]]. Greek dominance on the [[Aegean Sea]] made it impossible for the Ottomans to transfer the planned troops from the Middle East to the Thracian (against the Bulgarian) and to the Macedonian (against the Greeks and Serbians) fronts.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} According to E.J. Erickson the Greek Navy also played a crucial, albeit indirect role, in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing no less than three Thracian Corps (see [[First Balkan War]], the Bulgarian theater of operations), a significant portion of the Ottoman Army there, in the all-important opening round of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} After the defeating of the Ottoman fleet the Greek Navy was also free to liberate the islands of the Aegean. General [[Nikola Ivanov]] identified the activity of the Greek Navy as the chief factor in the general success of the allies.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}}{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=65}}\n\nIn January, after a successful coup by young army officers, the Ottoman Empire decided to continue the war. After a failed Ottoman counter-attack in the Western-Thracian front, Bulgarian forces, with the help of the Serbian Army, managed to conquer [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|Adrianople]], while Greek forces managed to take [[Ioannina]] after defeating the Ottomans in the [[battle of Bizani]]. In the joint Serbian-Montenegrin theater of operation, the Montenegrin army besieged and captured the [[Shkodra]], ending the Ottoman presence in Europe west of the \u00c7atalca line after nearly 500 years. The war ended officially with the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] on 30(17) May 1913.\n\n==Second Balkan War==\n{{Main|Second Balkan War}}\n[[File:With the conquered Turk (1913) cholera patients arriving.png|thumb|250px|[[Cholera]] was common among the soldiers of the combatant nations]]\n[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912\u20131913)]]\n\nThough the Balkan allies had fought together against the common enemy, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original document for the Balkans league, Serbia promised Bulgaria most of Macedonia. But before the first war come to an end, Serbia (in violation of the previous agreement) and Greece revealed their plan to keep possession of the territories that their forces had occupied. This act prompted the tsar of Bulgaria to invade his allies. The Second Balkan War broke out on 29(16) June 1913 when Bulgaria attacked its erstwhile allies in the First Balkan War, Serbia and Greece, while Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire intervened later against Bulgaria, with Romania attacking Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty.\n\nWhen the Greek army had entered [[Thessaloniki]] in the First Balkan War ahead of the Bulgarian 7th division by only a day, they were asked to allow a Bulgarian battalion to enter the city. Greece accepted in exchange for allowing a Greek unit to enter the city of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]. The Bulgarian unit that entered Thessaloniki turned out to be an 18,000-strong division instead of the battalion, something which caused concern among the Greeks, who viewed it as a Bulgarian attempt to establish a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over the city. In the event, due to the urgently needed reinforcements in the Thracian front, Bulgarian Headquarters was soon forced to remove its troops from the city (while the Greeks agreed by mutual treaty to remove their units based in [[Serres]]) and transport them to Dedea\u011fa\u00e7 (modern [[Alexandroupolis]]), but still it left behind a battalion that started fortifying its positions.\n\nGreece had also allowed the Bulgarians to control the stretch of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople railroad that lay in Greek-occupied territory, since Bulgaria controlled the largest part of this railroad towards Thrace. After the end of the operations in Thrace\u2014and confirming Greek concerns\u2014Bulgaria was not satisfied with the territory it controlled in Macedonia and immediately asked Greece to relinquish its control over Thessaloniki and the land north of [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], effectively handing over all Aegean Macedonia. These unacceptable demands, with the Bulgarian refusal to demobilize its army after the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] had ended the common war against the Ottomans, alarmed Greece, which decided to also keep its army mobilized.\n\nSimilarly, in northern Macedonia, the tension between Serbia and Bulgaria due to the latter's aspirations over [[Vardar Macedonia]] generated many incidents between their respective armies, prompting Serbia to keep its army mobilized. Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one fourth, as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it. Seeing the omens, Greece and Serbia started a series of negotiations and signed a treaty on 1 June(19 May) 1913. With this treaty, a mutual border was agreed between the two countries, together with an agreement for mutual military and diplomatic support in case of a Bulgarian or/and Austro-Hungarian attack. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], being well informed, tried to stop the upcoming conflict on 8 June, by sending an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. But Bulgaria, by making the acceptance of Russian [[arbitration]] conditional, in effect denied any discussion, causing Russia to repudiate its alliance with Bulgaria (see Russo-Bulgarian military convention signed 31 May 1902).\n\nThe Serbs and the Greeks had a military advantage on the eve of the war because their armies confronted comparatively weak Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War and suffered relatively light casualties,{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} while the Bulgarians were involved in heavy fighting in Thrace. The Serbs and Greeks had time to fortify their positions in Macedonia. The Bulgarians also held some advantages, controlling internal communication and supply lines.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}}\n\nOn 29(16) June 1913, General Savov, under direct orders of Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]], issued attacking orders against both Greece and Serbia without consulting the Bulgarian government and without any official declaration of war.<ref name=\"macedonia-istinata\">{{cite web| date= Winter 1995| url= http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| title= THE MACEDONIAN ENIGMA| publisher= Magazine: Australia &World Affairs| accessdate= 15 April 2008| last= George Phillipov| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420191403/http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| archivedate= 20 April 2008|url-status = dead}}</ref> During the night of 30(17) June 1913, they attacked the Serbian army at [[Bregalnica river]] and then the Greek army in [[Nigrita]]. The Serbian army resisted the sudden night attack, while most of soldiers did not even know who they were fighting with, as Bulgarian camps were located next to Serbs and were considered allies. Montenegro's forces were just a few kilometers away and also rushed to the battle. The Bulgarian attack was halted.\n\nThe Greek army was also successful.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} {{Better citation needed|reason= False citation/page 117 is wrong|date=April 2020}} It retreated according to plan for two days while [[Thessaloniki]] was cleared of the remaining Bulgarian regiment.

Part proceeded east and occupied [[Western Thrace]]. The rest of the Greek army advanced up to the [[Struma River]] valley, defeating the Bulgarian army in the battles of [[Battle of Doiran (1913)|Doiran]] and Mt. Beles, and continued its advance to the north towards [[Sofia]]. In the [[Battle of Kresna Gorge|Kresna straits]], the Greeks were ambushed by the Bulgarian 2nd and 1st Army newly arrived from the Serbian front that had already taken defensive positions there following the Bulgarian victory at [[battle of Kalimanci|Kalimanci]].\n\n[[File:Battle of Kilkis1913.jpg|thumb|Greek lithograph of the [[Battle of Kilkis\u2013Lachanas]]]]\nBy 30 July, the Greek army was outnumbered by the counter-attacking Bulgarian army, which attempted to encircle the Greeks in a [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]-type battle, by applying pressure on their flanks.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=121}} The Greek army was exhausted and faced logistical difficulties. The battle was continued for 11 days, between 29 July and 9 August over 20&nbsp;km of a maze of forests and mountains with no conclusion. The Greek King, seeing that the units he fought were from the Serbian front, tried to convince the Serbs to renew their attack, as the front ahead of them was now thinner, but the Serbs declined. By then, news came of the Romanian advance toward Sofia and its imminent fall. Facing the danger of encirclement, Constantine realized that his army could no longer continue hostilities, agreed to [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]' proposal and accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice as this had been communicated through Romania.\n\nRomania had raised an army and declared war on Bulgaria on 10 July(27 June) as it had from 28(15) June officially warned Bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new Balkan war, due to Bulgaria's refusal to cede the fortress of Silistra as promised before the First Balkan war in exchange for Romanian neutrality. Its forces encountered little resistance and by the time the Greeks accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice they had reached [[Vrazhdebna]], {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} from the center of [[Sofia]].\n\nSeeing the military position of the Bulgarian army the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] decided to intervene. They attacked, and, finding no opposition, managed to recover eastern [[Thrace]] with its fortified city of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], regaining an area in Europe which was only slightly larger than the present-day European territory of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n==Reactions among the Great Powers during the wars==\n[[File:Bazar Tirana (ca. 1900)2.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana]] [[Bazaar]] at the turn of the 20th century.]]\n[[File:Serbian poster celebrating victory over Bulgarina in the second Balkan war.jpg|thumb|Serbian propaganda poster, depicting king Alexander I beating the losing Bulgarian ruler.]]\n\nThe developments that led to the '''First Balkan War''' did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers, but although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the [[Eastern Question|territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire]], which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventive effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:\n\n*[[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<ref name=\"Stowell1\">{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory|authorlink=Ellery Cory Stowell | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-104-48758-4 | page =94 }}</ref> But it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans over Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which it had long-held ambitions, and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies France and Britain, as a reward for participating in the upcoming [[World War I|Great War]] against the [[Central Powers]].\n*[[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French, however, failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.\n*The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time, it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances the British had given to the Russians in regard to their expansion there.\n*[[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for a port on the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with significant Slav populations that campaigned against German-Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But Austria-Hungary failed to secure German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances\u2014even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and passed notes to that effect to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.\n*[[German Empire|Germany]], already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But, in her effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, was toying with the idea of replacing the Balkan area of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in her [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders\u2014an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments.\n\nThe '''Second Balkan war''' was a catastrophic blow to Russian policies in the Balkans, which for centuries had focused on access to the \"warm seas\". First, it marked the end of the Balkan League, a vital arm of the Russian system of defense against Austria-Hungary. Second, the clearly pro-Serbian position Russia had been forced to take in the conflict, mainly due to the disagreements over land partitioning between Serbia and Bulgaria, caused a permanent break-up between the two countries. Accordingly, Bulgaria reverted its policy to one closer to the [[Central Powers]]' understanding over an anti-Serbian front, due to its new national aspirations, now expressed mainly against Serbia. As a result, Serbia was isolated militarily against its rival Austria-Hungary, a development that eventually doomed Serbia in the coming war a year later. But, most damaging, the new situation effectively trapped Russian foreign policy: After 1913, Russia could not afford losing its last ally in this crucial area and thus had no alternatives but to unconditionally support Serbia when the crisis between Serbia and Austria broke out in 1914. This was a position that inevitably drew her, although unwillingly, into a World War with devastating results for her, since she was less prepared (both militarily and socially) for that event than any other Great Power.\n\nAustria-Hungary took alarm at the great increase in Serbia's territory at the expense of its national aspirations in the region, as well as Serbia's rising status, especially to Austria-Hungary's Slavic populations. This concern was shared by Germany, which saw Serbia as a satellite of Russia.

({{lang-tr|Balkan Sava\u015flar\u0131}}, literally \"the Balkan Wars\" or ''Balkan Facias\u0131'', meaning \"the Balkan Tragedy\") consisted of two conflicts that took place in the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in 1912 and 1913. Four Balkan states defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the first war. In the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria fought against all four original combatants of the first war along with facing a surprise attack from Romania from the north. The conflicts ended catastrophically for the Ottoman Empire, which lost the bulk of its territory in Europe. Austria-Hungary, although not a combatant, became relatively weaker as a much enlarged Serbia pushed for union of the South Slavic peoples.{{sfn|Clark|2013|pp=45, 559}} The war set the stage for the [[July Crisis|Balkan crisis of 1914]] and thus served as a \"prelude to the [[First World War]]\".{{sfn|Hall|2000}}\n\nBy the early 20th century, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] had achieved independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], but large elements of their ethnic populations remained under Ottoman rule. In 1912 these countries formed the [[Balkan League]]. The First Balkan War had three main causes:{{sfn|Helmreich|1938}}{{sfn|Hall|2000}}\n\n# The Ottoman Empire was unable to reform itself, govern satisfactorily, or deal with the rising ethnic nationalism of its diverse peoples.\n# The [[Great Power]]s quarreled amongst themselves and failed to ensure that the Ottomans would carry out the needed reforms. This led the Balkan states to impose their own solution.\n# Most importantly, the Balkan League had been formed, and its members were confident that it could defeat the Turks.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire lost all its European territories to the west of the River [[Maritsa]] as a result of the two Balkan Wars, which thus delineated present-day Turkey's western border. A large influx of Turks started to flee into the [[Anatolia|Ottoman heartland]] from the lost lands. By 1914, the remaining core region of the Ottoman Empire had experienced a population increase of around 2.5 million because of the flood of immigration from the Balkans.\n\nCitizens of Turkey regard the Balkan Wars as a major disaster (''Balkan harbi facias\u0131'') in the [[Ottoman Empire#Defeat and dissolution (1908\u20131922)|nation's history]]. The unexpected fall and sudden relinquishing of Turkish-dominated European territories created a [[Psychological trauma|psycho-traumatic]] event amongst many Turks that triggered the ultimate [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|collapse]] of the empire itself within five years. [[Naz\u0131m Pasha]], Chief of Staff of the [[Ottoman Army]], was held responsible for the failure and was assassinated on 23 January 1913 during the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'\u00e9tat]].<ref>Gul Tokay. \"Ottoman diplomacy, the Balkan Wars and the Great Powers\". In Dominik Geppert, William Mulligan, Andreas Rose, eds. ''The Wars before the Great War'' {{ISBN|978-1-107-06347-1}}, 2015, p. 70</ref>\n\nThe [[First Balkan War]] began when the League member states attacked the Ottoman Empire on 8 October 1912 and ended eight months later with the signing of the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] on 30 May 1913. The [[Second Balkan War]] began on 16 June 1913. Both Serbia and Greece, utilizing the argument that the war had been prolonged, repudiated important particulars of the pre-war treaty and retained occupation of all the conquered districts in their possession, which were to be divided according to specific predefined boundaries. Seeing the treaty as trampled, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] (made in secret by its former allies, Serbia and Greece) and commenced military action against them. The more numerous combined Serbian and Greek armies repelled the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked into [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] from the west and the south. [[Romania]], having taken no part in the conflict, had intact armies to strike with and invaded Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty between the two states. The Ottoman Empire also attacked Bulgaria and advanced in Thrace regaining [[Adrianople]]. In the resulting [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], Bulgaria lost most of the territories it had gained in the First Balkan War in addition to being forced to cede the ex-Ottoman south-third of [[Dobruja|Dobroudja province]] to [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Winston Churchill|title=[[The World Crisis]], 1911\u20131918|year=1931|publisher=Thornton Butterworth|p=278}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Map-of-Ottoman-Empire-1900.png|thumb|left|Map of the Ottoman Empire in 1900, with the names of the [[Vilayet|Ottoman provinces]].]]\n\n[[File:Balkan troubles1.jpg|thumb|Germany, France, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Britain attempting to keep the lid on the simmering cauldron of imperialist and nationalist tensions in the Balkans to prevent a general European war. They were successful in 1912 and 1913 but did not succeed in 1914.]]\n\n[[File:Meurtre de Nazim Pacha illustration, 9 February 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Naz\u0131m Pasha]], the chief of staff of the Ottoman army, was assassinated by [[Young Turks]] due to his failure.]]\nThe background to the wars lies in the incomplete emergence of [[nation-states]] on the European territory of the Ottoman Empire during the second half of the 19th century. Serbia had gained substantial territory during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878]], while Greece acquired [[Thessaly]] in 1881 (although [[Treaty of Constantinople (1897)|it lost a small area]] back to the Ottoman Empire in 1897) and Bulgaria (an autonomous [[principality]] since 1878) incorporated the formerly distinct province of [[Eastern Rumelia]] (1885). All three countries, as well as Montenegro, sought additional territories within the large Ottoman-ruled region known as [[Rumelia]], comprising Eastern Rumelia, [[Albania]], Macedonia, and [[Thrace]].\n\n===Policies of the Great Powers===\nThroughout the 19th century, the [[Great Power]]s shared different aims over the \"[[Eastern Question]]\" and the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. [[Russia]] wanted access to the \"warm waters\" of the [[Mediterranean]] from the Black Sea; it pursued a [[Pan-Slavism|pan-Slavic]] foreign policy and therefore supported Bulgaria and Serbia. Britain wished to deny Russia access to the \"warm waters\" and supported the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, although it also supported a limited expansion of [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] as a backup plan in case integrity of the Empire was no longer possible. France wished to strengthen its position in the region, especially in the [[Levant]] (today's [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], and [[Israel]]).\n\n[[Habsburg]]-ruled [[Austria-Hungary]] wished for a continuation of the existence of the Ottoman Empire, since both were troubled multinational entities and thus the collapse of the one might weaken the other. The Habsburgs also saw a strong Ottoman presence in the area as a counterweight to the Serbian nationalistic call to their own Serb subjects in [[Bosnia]], Vojvodina and other parts of the empire. [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s primary aim at the time seems to have been the denial of access to the [[Adriatic Sea]] to another major sea power. [[The German Empire]], in turn, under the \"[[Drang nach Osten]]\" policy, aspired to turn the Ottoman Empire into its own de facto colony, and thus supported its integrity.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Bulgaria and Greece contended for Ottoman Macedonia and Thrace. Ethnic Greeks sought the forced \"Hellenization\" of ethnic Bulgars, who sought \"Bulgarization\" of Greeks ([[Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire#Bulgarians|Rise of nationalism]]). Both nations sent armed irregulars into Ottoman territory to protect and assist their ethnic kindred. From 1904, there was low intensity warfare in Macedonia between the Greek and Bulgarian bands and the Ottoman army (the [[Struggle for Macedonia]]). After the [[Young Turks|Young Turk revolution]] of July 1908, the situation changed drastically.\n\n===Young Turk Revolution===\n{{Main|Young Turk Revolution}}\nThe 1908 [[Young Turk Revolution]] saw the reinstatement of constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire and the start of the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. When the revolt broke out, it was supported by intellectuals, the army, and almost all the ethnic minorities of the Empire, and forced Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] to re-adopt the long defunct [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] and [[Ottoman parliament|parliament]]. Hopes were raised among the Balkan ethnicities of reforms and autonomy, and elections were held to form a representative, multi-ethnic, Ottoman parliament. However, following the Sultan's [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|attempted counter-coup]], the liberal element of the Young Turks was sidelined and the nationalist element became dominant.\n\nAt the same time, in October 1908, Austria-Hungary seized the opportunity of the Ottoman political upheaval to annex the ''de jure'' Ottoman province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it had occupied since 1878 (see ''[[Bosnian Crisis]]''). Bulgaria declared independence as it had done in 1878, but this time the independence was internationally recognised. The Greeks of the autonomous [[Cretan State]] proclaimed unification with Greece, though the opposition of the Great Powers prevented the latter action from taking practical effect. It has large influence in the consequent world order.\n\n===Reaction in the Balkan States===\n\nSerbia was frustrated in the north by Austria-Hungary's incorporation of Bosnia. In March 1909, Serbia was forced to accept the annexation and restrain anti-Habsburg agitation by Serbian nationalists. Instead, the Serbian government (PM: [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]]) looked to formerly Serb territories in the south, notably \"Old Serbia\" (the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and the province of [[Kosovo]]).\n\nOn 15 August 1909, the [[Military League]], a group of Greek officers, took action against the government to reform their country's national government and reorganize the army. The Military League found itself unable to create a new political system, until the League summoned the Cretan politician [[Eleutherios Venizelos]] to Athens as its political adviser. Venizelos persuaded king [[George I of Greece#Later reign and assassination|George I]] to revise the constitution and asked the League to disband in favor of a National Assembly. In March 1910, the Military League dissolved itself.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9052680 \"Military League\"], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online</ref>\n\nBulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of her independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia,<ref name=\"Congress\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://countrystudies.us/bulgaria/12.htm|title = THE BALKAN WARS|publisher=[[US Library of Congress]]| accessdate =15 April 2008 }}</ref> also looked to annex districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia. In August 1910, Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom.\n\n===Balkan League===\n{{Main|Balkan League}}\n[[File:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bulgarian forces waiting to start their assault on [[Adrianople]]]]\n\nFollowing the Italian victory in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911\u20131912 and a series of three revolts in Ottoman held Albania the Young Turks fell from power after a coup. The Balkan countries saw this as an opportunity to attack the Ottoman Empire and fulfill their desires of expansion.\n\nWith the initial encouragement of Russian agents, a series of agreements was concluded between Serbia and Bulgaria in March 1912. Military victory against the Ottoman Empire would not be possible while it could bring reinforcements from Asia. The condition of the Ottoman railways of the time was not advanced, so most reinforcements would have to come by sea through the [[Aegean Sea]]. Greece was the only Balkan country with a navy powerful enough to deny use of the Aegean to the Ottoman Empire, thus a treaty between Greece and Bulgaria became necessary; it was signed in May 1912.\n\nMontenegro concluded agreements between Serbia and Bulgaria later that year. Bulgaria signed treaties with Serbia to divide the territory of northern Macedonia.\n\nThis alliance between Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro became known as the Balkan League; its existence was undesirable to all the Great Powers. The League was loose at best, though secret liaison officers were exchanged between the Greek and the Serbian army after the war began. Greece delayed the start of the war several times in the summer of 1912, to better prepare her navy, but Montenegro declared war on 8 October (25 September [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]). Following an ultimatum to the Ottoman Empire, the remaining members of the alliance entered the conflict on 17 October.\n\n==First Balkan War==\n{{Main|First Balkan War}}\n[[File:Balkan belligerants 1914.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Territorial changes as a result of the First Balkan war, as of April 1913 showing the prewar agreed line of expansion between [[Serbia]] and [[Bulgaria]]]]\n[[File:King George I of Greece and Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria at Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The apple of discord: King [[George I of Greece]] and Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] at Thessaloniki, December 1912. Despite their alliance, Greco-Bulgarian antagonism over the city and Macedonia in general did not abate.]]\n\nThe three Slavic allies (Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro) had laid out extensive plans to coordinate their war efforts, in continuation of their secret prewar settlements and under close Russian supervision (Greece was not included). Serbia and Montenegro would attack in the theater of Sandjak, Bulgaria and Serbia in Macedonia and Thrace.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire's situation was difficult. Its population of about 26 million people provided a massive pool of manpower, but three-quarters of the population and nearly all of [[Islam in the Ottoman Empire|the Muslim component]] lived in the Asian part of the Empire. Reinforcements had to come from Asia mainly by sea, which depended on the result of battles between the Turkish and Greek navies in the Aegean.\n\nWith the outbreak of the war, the Ottoman Empire activated three Army HQs: the Thracian HQ in [[Constantinople]], the Western HQ in Salonika, and the Vardar HQ in [[Skopje]], against the Bulgarians, the Greeks and the Serbians respectively. Most of their available forces were allocated to these fronts. Smaller independent units were allocated elsewhere, mostly around heavily fortified cities.\n\nMontenegro was the first that declared war on 8 October{{sfn|Hall|2000}} (25 September O.S.). Its main thrust was towards [[Shkodra]], with secondary operations in the [[Novi Pazar]] area. The rest of the Allies, after giving a common ultimatum, declared war a week later. Bulgaria attacked towards Eastern Thrace, being stopped only at the outskirts of [[Constantinople]] at the [[\u00c7atalca]] line and the isthmus of the [[Gallipoli peninsula]], while secondary forces captured Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. Serbia attacked south towards [[Skopje]] and [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] and then turned west to present-day [[Albania]], reaching the [[Adriatic]], while a second Army captured [[Kosovo]] and linked with the Montenegrin forces. Greece's main forces attacked from [[Thessaly]] into Macedonia through the [[Sarantaporo]] strait. On 7 November, in response to an Ottoman initiative, they entered into negotiations for the surrender of Salonika. With the Greeks on hand, and the Bulgarian 7th Rila Division moving rapidly from the north, Hassan Tahsin Pasha considered his position to be hopeless. {{sfn|Hall|2000|p=61}}. The Greeks offered more attractive terms than the Bulgarians did. On 8 November, Tahsin Pasha agreed to terms, and 26,000 Ottoman troops passed over into Greek captivity. Before the Greeks entered the city, a German warship whisked the former sultan Abdul Hamid out of Salonika to continue his exile across the Bosporus from Constantinople. With their army in Salonika, the Greeks took positions to the east and northeast, including [[Nigrita]]. On 12 November (on 26 October 1912, [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]]) Greece expanded its occupied area and linked up with the Serbian army to the northwest, while its main forces turned east towards [[Kavala]], reaching the Bulgarians. Another Greek army attacked into [[Epirus]] towards [[Ioannina]].<ref name=\"BA01\">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011972 Balkan Wars] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.</ref>\n\nOn the naval front, the Ottoman fleet twice exited the [[Dardanelles]] and was twice defeated by the [[Greek Navy]], in the battles of [[Naval Battle of Elli|Elli]] and [[Naval Battle of Lemnos|Lemnos]]. Greek dominance on the [[Aegean Sea]] made it impossible for the Ottomans to transfer the planned troops from the Middle East to the Thracian (against the Bulgarian) and to the Macedonian (against the Greeks and Serbians) fronts.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} According to E.J. Erickson the Greek Navy also played a crucial, albeit indirect role, in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing no less than three Thracian Corps (see [[First Balkan War]], the Bulgarian theater of operations), a significant portion of the Ottoman Army there, in the all-important opening round of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}} After the defeating of the Ottoman fleet the Greek Navy was also free to liberate the islands of the Aegean. General [[Nikola Ivanov]] identified the activity of the Greek Navy as the chief factor in the general success of the allies.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=333}}{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=65}}\n\nIn January, after a successful coup by young army officers, the Ottoman Empire decided to continue the war. After a failed Ottoman counter-attack in the Western-Thracian front, Bulgarian forces, with the help of the Serbian Army, managed to conquer [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|Adrianople]], while Greek forces managed to take [[Ioannina]] after defeating the Ottomans in the [[battle of Bizani]]. In the joint Serbian-Montenegrin theater of operation, the Montenegrin army besieged and captured the [[Shkodra]], ending the Ottoman presence in Europe west of the \u00c7atalca line after nearly 500 years. The war ended officially with the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] on 30(17) May 1913.\n\n==Second Balkan War==\n{{Main|Second Balkan War}}\n[[File:With the conquered Turk (1913) cholera patients arriving.png|thumb|250px|[[Cholera]] was common among the soldiers of the combatant nations]]\n[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912\u20131913)]]\n\nThough the Balkan allies had fought together against the common enemy, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original document for the Balkans league, Serbia promised Bulgaria most of Macedonia. But before the first war come to an end, Serbia (in violation of the previous agreement) and Greece revealed their plan to keep possession of the territories that their forces had occupied. This act prompted the tsar of Bulgaria to invade his allies. The Second Balkan War broke out on 29(16) June 1913 when Bulgaria attacked its erstwhile allies in the First Balkan War, Serbia and Greece, while Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire intervened later against Bulgaria, with Romania attacking Bulgaria from the north in violation of a peace treaty.\n\nWhen the Greek army had entered [[Thessaloniki]] in the First Balkan War ahead of the Bulgarian 7th division by only a day, they were asked to allow a Bulgarian battalion to enter the city. Greece accepted in exchange for allowing a Greek unit to enter the city of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]]. The Bulgarian unit that entered Thessaloniki turned out to be an 18,000-strong division instead of the battalion, something which caused concern among the Greeks, who viewed it as a Bulgarian attempt to establish a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] over the city. In the event, due to the urgently needed reinforcements in the Thracian front, Bulgarian Headquarters was soon forced to remove its troops from the city (while the Greeks agreed by mutual treaty to remove their units based in [[Serres]]) and transport them to Dedea\u011fa\u00e7 (modern [[Alexandroupolis]]), but still it left behind a battalion that started fortifying its positions.\n\nGreece had also allowed the Bulgarians to control the stretch of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople railroad that lay in Greek-occupied territory, since Bulgaria controlled the largest part of this railroad towards Thrace. After the end of the operations in Thrace\u2014and confirming Greek concerns\u2014Bulgaria was not satisfied with the territory it controlled in Macedonia and immediately asked Greece to relinquish its control over Thessaloniki and the land north of [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], effectively handing over all Aegean Macedonia. These unacceptable demands, with the Bulgarian refusal to demobilize its army after the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] had ended the common war against the Ottomans, alarmed Greece, which decided to also keep its army mobilized.\n\nSimilarly, in northern Macedonia, the tension between Serbia and Bulgaria due to the latter's aspirations over [[Vardar Macedonia]] generated many incidents between their respective armies, prompting Serbia to keep its army mobilized. Serbia and Greece proposed that each of the three countries reduce its army by one fourth, as a first step to facilitate a peaceful solution, but Bulgaria rejected it. Seeing the omens, Greece and Serbia started a series of negotiations and signed a treaty on 1 June(19 May) 1913. With this treaty, a mutual border was agreed between the two countries, together with an agreement for mutual military and diplomatic support in case of a Bulgarian or/and Austro-Hungarian attack. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], being well informed, tried to stop the upcoming conflict on 8 June, by sending an identical personal message to the Kings of Bulgaria and Serbia, offering to act as arbitrator according to the provisions of the 1912 Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. But Bulgaria, by making the acceptance of Russian [[arbitration]] conditional, in effect denied any discussion, causing Russia to repudiate its alliance with Bulgaria (see Russo-Bulgarian military convention signed 31 May 1902).\n\nThe Serbs and the Greeks had a military advantage on the eve of the war because their armies confronted comparatively weak Ottoman forces in the First Balkan War and suffered relatively light casualties,{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}} while the Bulgarians were involved in heavy fighting in Thrace. The Serbs and Greeks had time to fortify their positions in Macedonia. The Bulgarians also held some advantages, controlling internal communication and supply lines.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=117}}\n\nOn 29(16) June 1913, General Savov, under direct orders of Tsar [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]], issued attacking orders against both Greece and Serbia without consulting the Bulgarian government and without any official declaration of war.<ref name=\"macedonia-istinata\">{{cite web| date= Winter 1995| url= http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| title= THE MACEDONIAN ENIGMA| publisher= Magazine: Australia &World Affairs| accessdate= 15 April 2008| last= George Phillipov| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420191403/http://macedonia-istinata.hit.bg/MacEnigma.html| archivedate= 20 April 2008|url-status = dead}}</ref> During the night of 30(17) June 1913, they attacked the Serbian army at [[Bregalnica river]] and then the Greek army in [[Nigrita]]. The Serbian army resisted the sudden night attack, while most of soldiers did not even know who they were fighting with, as Bulgarian camps were located next to Serbs and were considered allies.

Then, the Greek army counter-attacked and defeated the Bulgarians at [[Battle of Kilkis|Kilkis]] (Kukush), after which the mostly Bulgarian town was plundered and burnt and part of its mostly Bulgarian population massacred by the Greek army.<ref>{{cite book|author=International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars|title=Report of the International Commission to Inquire Into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keWGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA279|year=1914|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|page=279}}</ref> {{Better citation needed |reason= There is no clear evidence of a massacre as a fact, only a belief from Donchev|date=April 2020}} Following the capture of Kilkis, the Greek army's pace was not quick enough to prevent the retaliatory destruction of [[Nigrita]], [[Serres]], and [[Doxato]] and massacres of non-combatant Greek inhabitants at [[Sidirokastro]] and Doxato by the Bulgarian army.<ref>Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars, published by the Endowment Washington, D.C. 1914, p. 97-99 [http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/en/carnegie/chapter2_2.html pp.79\u201395]</ref> The Greek army then divided its forces and advanced in two directions. Part proceeded east and occupied [[Western Thrace]]. The rest of the Greek army advanced up to the [[Struma River]] valley, defeating the Bulgarian army in the battles of [[Battle of Doiran (1913)|Doiran]] and Mt. Beles, and continued its advance to the north towards [[Sofia]]. In the [[Battle of Kresna Gorge|Kresna straits]], the Greeks were ambushed by the Bulgarian 2nd and 1st Army newly arrived from the Serbian front that had already taken defensive positions there following the Bulgarian victory at [[battle of Kalimanci|Kalimanci]].\n\n[[File:Battle of Kilkis1913.jpg|thumb|Greek lithograph of the [[Battle of Kilkis\u2013Lachanas]]]]\nBy 30 July, the Greek army was outnumbered by the counter-attacking Bulgarian army, which attempted to encircle the Greeks in a [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]-type battle, by applying pressure on their flanks.{{sfn|Hall|2000|p=121}} The Greek army was exhausted and faced logistical difficulties. The battle was continued for 11 days, between 29 July and 9 August over 20&nbsp;km of a maze of forests and mountains with no conclusion. The Greek King, seeing that the units he fought were from the Serbian front, tried to convince the Serbs to renew their attack, as the front ahead of them was now thinner, but the Serbs declined. By then, news came of the Romanian advance toward Sofia and its imminent fall. Facing the danger of encirclement, Constantine realized that his army could no longer continue hostilities, agreed to [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]' proposal and accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice as this had been communicated through Romania.\n\nRomania had raised an army and declared war on Bulgaria on 10 July(27 June) as it had from 28(15) June officially warned Bulgaria that it would not remain neutral in a new Balkan war, due to Bulgaria's refusal to cede the fortress of Silistra as promised before the First Balkan war in exchange for Romanian neutrality. Its forces encountered little resistance and by the time the Greeks accepted the Bulgarian request for armistice they had reached [[Vrazhdebna]], {{convert|7|mi|km|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} from the center of [[Sofia]].\n\nSeeing the military position of the Bulgarian army the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] decided to intervene. They attacked, and, finding no opposition, managed to recover eastern [[Thrace]] with its fortified city of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], regaining an area in Europe which was only slightly larger than the present-day European territory of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n==Reactions among the Great Powers during the wars==\n[[File:Bazar Tirana (ca. 1900)2.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana]] [[Bazaar]] at the turn of the 20th century.]]\n[[File:Serbian poster celebrating victory over Bulgarina in the second Balkan war.jpg|thumb|Serbian propaganda poster, depicting king Alexander I beating the losing Bulgarian ruler.]]\n\nThe developments that led to the '''First Balkan War''' did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers, but although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the [[Eastern Question|territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire]], which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventive effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:\n\n*[[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<ref name=\"Stowell1\">{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory|authorlink=Ellery Cory Stowell | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-104-48758-4 | page =94 }}</ref> But it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans over Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which it had long-held ambitions, and on which it had just secured a secret agreement of expansion from its allies France and Britain, as a reward for participating in the upcoming [[World War I|Great War]] against the [[Central Powers]].\n*[[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austria-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French, however, failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.\n*The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time, it encouraged Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances the British had given to the Russians in regard to their expansion there.\n*[[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for a port on the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with significant Slav populations that campaigned against German-Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But Austria-Hungary failed to secure German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances\u2014even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and passed notes to that effect to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.\n*[[German Empire|Germany]], already heavily involved in internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But, in her effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, was toying with the idea of replacing the Balkan area of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in her [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders\u2014an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments.\n\nThe '''Second Balkan war''' was a catastrophic blow to Russian policies in the Balkans, which for centuries had focused on access to the \"warm seas\". First, it marked the end of the Balkan League, a vital arm of the Russian system of defense against Austria-Hungary. Second, the clearly pro-Serbian position Russia had been forced to take in the conflict, mainly due to the disagreements over land partitioning between Serbia and Bulgaria, caused a permanent break-up between the two countries. Accordingly, Bulgaria reverted its policy to one closer to the [[Central Powers]]' understanding over an anti-Serbian front, due to its new national aspirations, now expressed mainly against Serbia. As a result, Serbia was isolated militarily against its rival Austria-Hungary, a development that eventually doomed Serbia in the coming war a year later. But, most damaging, the new situation effectively trapped Russian foreign policy: After 1913, Russia could not afford losing its last ally in this crucial area and thus had no alternatives but to unconditionally support Serbia when the crisis between Serbia and Austria broke out in 1914. This was a position that inevitably drew her, although unwillingly, into a World War with devastating results for her, since she was less prepared (both militarily and socially) for that event than any other Great Power.\n\nAustria-Hungary took alarm at the great increase in Serbia's territory at the expense of its national aspirations in the region, as well as Serbia's rising status, especially to Austria-Hungary's Slavic populations. This concern was shared by Germany, which saw Serbia as a satellite of Russia. This contributed significantly to the two Central Powers' willingness to go to war as soon as possible.\n\nFinally, when [[Black Hand (Serbia)|a Serbian backed organization]] assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne]], causing the 1914 [[July Crisis]], no-one could stop the conflict and the [[First World War]] broke out.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSoviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated in ''Voini I Narodo-Nacelenie Europi'' (1960) that in the first and second Balkan wars there were 122,000 killed in action, 20,000 dead of wounds, and 82,000 dead of disease.\n[[File:Zapleneti turski topovi od strana na srpskata vojska pred crkata vo Kumanovo, Balkanska vojna, 1912.tif|thumb|Captured Turkish cannons by the Serbian army, displayed in front of a church in [[Kumanovo]], 1912]]\n\n==All Balkan War conflicts==\n===First Balkan War conflicts===\n====Bulgarian-Ottoman battles====\n{| style=\"width:76%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.
