The theme of the [[Romantic poetry|romantic]] composition reflects the [[Jews]]' 2,000-year-old hope of returning to the [[Land of Israel]], restoring it, and reclaiming it as a free and sovereign nation. Its lyrics are adapted from a poem by [[Naftali Herz Imber]], a Jewish poet from Z\u0142ocz\u00f3w (today [[Zolochiv]], Ukraine), which was then in the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] under Austrian  rule.

It did not officially become the national anthem until November 2004, when an abbreviated and edited version was sanctioned by the [[Knesset]]<ref name=VivianEden/> in an amendment to the Flag and Coat-of-Arms Law (now renamed the Flag, Coat-of-Arms, and National Anthem Law).\n\nIn its modern rendering, the official text of the anthem incorporates only the first stanza and refrain of the original poem. The predominant theme in the remaining stanzas is the establishment of a [[self-determination|sovereign]] and free nation in the Land of Israel, a hope largely seen as fulfilled with the founding of the State of Israel.\n\n===Music===\n\n:<score sound=\"1\">\n\\relative c' { \n  \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n  \\tempo 4 = 80\n  \\key f \\major\n  \\time 4/4\n  d8 e f g a4 a8 a bes a bes d a4. a8 g4 g8 g f4 f e8 d e f d4.\n}\n</score>\n\nThe melody for \"Hatikvah\" derives from \"[[La Mantovana]]\", a 16th-century [[Italian culture|Italian]] song, composed by Giuseppe Cenci (Giuseppino del Biado) ca. 1600 with the text \"Fuggi, fuggi, fuggi da questo cielo\". Its earliest known appearance in print was in the del Biado's collection of [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s. It was later known in early 17th-century [[Italy]] as {{Citation | title = Ballo di Mantova}}. This melody gained wide currency in [[Renaissance Europe]], under various titles, such as the {{Citation | language = Polish  | title = Pod Krakowem}}, {{Citation | language = Romanian | title = Cucuruz cu frunza-n sus |trans-title=[[Maize]] with up-standing leaves}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFUAKNSBMJ8|title=Cucuruz cu frunza-n sus - Didina Curea|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>Lyrics:  https://lyricstranslate.com/en/cucuruz-cu-frunza-n-sus-traditional-version-no-2-maize-raised-leaf-traditional-version.html</ref> and the {{Citation | language = Ukrainian | title = Kateryna Kucheryava}}.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://torban.org/torban4b.html | title = IV.

Cohen himself recalled many years later that he had hummed Hatikvah based on the melody from the song he had heard in [[Romania]], {{Citation | title = Carul cu boi |trans-title=The Ox-Driven Cart}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adTjy-TIW_Q|title=Carul cu boi|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjq_rZPgoWI|title=\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05db\u05d5\u05d2\u05df - \u05de\u05e0\u05d2\u05d9\u05e0\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d4 (\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dd \u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05d9)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>Lyrics: https://lyricstranslate.com/en/carul-cu-boi-ox-driven-cart.html</ref>\n\nThe harmony of \"Hatikvah\" follows a [[Major and minor#Major and minor scales|minor scale]], which is often perceived as mournful in tone and is uncommon in national anthems. As the title \"The Hope\" and the words suggest, the import of the song is optimistic and the overall spirit uplifting.\n\n===Use in sporting events===\nThe Israeli national anthem is used in several European sporting events<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/245166|title=Israeli judoka wins gold, hears Hatikva at Europe championship|website=Israel National News}}</ref> since the [[Arab world|Arab states]] barred Israel from participating in their own continent's sporting bodies.

But he did not object to the singing of \"Hatikvah\", and in fact endorsed it.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.lookstein.org/resources/hatikvah1.htm | first = Rav | last = Kook | title = Response to Hatikvah | quote = In more recent years, some Israeli Mizrahi (Eastern) Jews have criticised the song's western perspective. For Iraqi and Persian Jews, for example, the Land of Israel was in the west, and it was to this direction that they focused their prayers.}}</ref>\n\n===Objections by non-Jewish Israelis===\n''Liberalism and the Right to Culture'', written by Avishai Margalit and Moshe Halbertal, provides a social scientific perspective on the cultural dynamics in Israel, a country that is a vital home to many diverse religious groups. More specifically, Margalit and Halbertal cover the various responses towards \"Hatikvah\", which they establish as the original anthem of a Zionist movement, one that holds a two thousand year long hope of returning to the homeland (\u201cZion and Jerusalem\u201d) after a long period of exile.\n\nTo introduce the controversy of Israel's national anthem, the authors provide two instances where \"Hatikvah\" is rejected for the estrangement that it creates between the minority cultural groups of Israel and its national Jewish politics. Those that object find trouble in the mere fact that the national anthem is exclusively Jewish while a significant proportion of the state's citizenry is not Jewish and lacks any connection to the anthem's content and implications.\n\nAs Margalit and Halbertal continue to discuss, \"Hatikvah\" symbolises for many Arab-Israelis the struggle of loyalty that comes with having to dedicate oneself to either their historical or religious identity.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Margalit|first=Avishai|last2=Halbertal|first2=Moshe|orig-year=2004|title=Liberalism and the Right to Culture|journal=Social Research: An International Quarterly|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=71|pages=494\u2013497}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab Israelis]] object to \"Hatikvah\" due to its explicit allusions to Jewishness.

It did not officially become the national anthem until November 2004, when an abbreviated and edited version was sanctioned by the [[Knesset]]<ref name=VivianEden/> in an amendment to the Flag and Coat-of-Arms Law (now renamed the Flag, Coat-of-Arms, and National Anthem Law).\n\nIn its modern rendering, the official text of the anthem incorporates only the first stanza and refrain of the original poem. The predominant theme in the remaining stanzas is the establishment of a [[self-determination|sovereign]] and free nation in the Land of Israel, a hope largely seen as fulfilled with the founding of the State of Israel.\n\n===Music===\n\n:<score sound=\"1\">\n\\relative c' { \n  \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\"\n  \\tempo 4 = 80\n  \\key f \\major\n  \\time 4/4\n  d8 e f g a4 a8 a bes a bes d a4. a8 g4 g8 g f4 f e8 d e f d4.\n}\n</score>\n\nThe melody for \"Hatikvah\" derives from \"[[La Mantovana]]\", a 16th-century [[Italian culture|Italian]] song, composed by Giuseppe Cenci (Giuseppino del Biado) ca. 1600 with the text \"Fuggi, fuggi, fuggi da questo cielo\". Its earliest known appearance in print was in the del Biado's collection of [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s. It was later known in early 17th-century [[Italy]] as {{Citation | title = Ballo di Mantova}}. This melody gained wide currency in [[Renaissance Europe]], under various titles, such as the {{Citation | language = Polish  | title = Pod Krakowem}}, {{Citation | language = Romanian | title = Cucuruz cu frunza-n sus |trans-title=[[Maize]] with up-standing leaves}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFUAKNSBMJ8|title=Cucuruz cu frunza-n sus - Didina Curea|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>Lyrics:  https://lyricstranslate.com/en/cucuruz-cu-frunza-n-sus-traditional-version-no-2-maize-raised-leaf-traditional-version.html</ref> and the {{Citation | language = Ukrainian | title = Kateryna Kucheryava}}.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://torban.org/torban4b.html | title = IV.

Cohen himself recalled many years later that he had hummed Hatikvah based on the melody from the song he had heard in [[Romania]], {{Citation | title = Carul cu boi |trans-title=The Ox-Driven Cart}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adTjy-TIW_Q|title=Carul cu boi|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjq_rZPgoWI|title=\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05db\u05d5\u05d2\u05df - \u05de\u05e0\u05d2\u05d9\u05e0\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d4 (\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dd \u05e8\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05d9)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>Lyrics: https://lyricstranslate.com/en/carul-cu-boi-ox-driven-cart.html</ref>\n\nThe harmony of \"Hatikvah\" follows a [[Major and minor#Major and minor scales|minor scale]], which is often perceived as mournful in tone and is uncommon in national anthems. As the title \"The Hope\" and the words suggest, the import of the song is optimistic and the overall spirit uplifting.\n\n===Use in sporting events===\nThe Israeli national anthem is used in several European sporting events<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/245166|title=Israeli judoka wins gold, hears Hatikva at Europe championship|website=Israel National News}}</ref> since the [[Arab world|Arab states]] barred Israel from participating in their own continent's sporting bodies.

More specifically, Margalit and Halbertal cover the various responses towards \"Hatikvah\", which they establish as the original anthem of a Zionist movement, one that holds a two thousand year long hope of returning to the homeland (\u201cZion and Jerusalem\u201d) after a long period of exile.\n\nTo introduce the controversy of Israel's national anthem, the authors provide two instances where \"Hatikvah\" is rejected for the estrangement that it creates between the minority cultural groups of Israel and its national Jewish politics. Those that object find trouble in the mere fact that the national anthem is exclusively Jewish while a significant proportion of the state's citizenry is not Jewish and lacks any connection to the anthem's content and implications.\n\nAs Margalit and Halbertal continue to discuss, \"Hatikvah\" symbolises for many Arab-Israelis the struggle of loyalty that comes with having to dedicate oneself to either their historical or religious identity.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Margalit|first=Avishai|last2=Halbertal|first2=Moshe|orig-year=2004|title=Liberalism and the Right to Culture|journal=Social Research: An International Quarterly|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=71|pages=494\u2013497}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab Israelis]] object to \"Hatikvah\" due to its explicit allusions to Jewishness.
