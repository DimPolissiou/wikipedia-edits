His childhood hobbies were forming statues from Anzali marshes mud and listening to music. He began his art studies since youth. After finishing primary education, he went to [[Tehran]] in 1938 and entered the Music School, which was directed by Mr. Minbashian then, for composing and passed the entrance tests; but at that time, the foreign professors of the school returned to their home countries and he was not able to follow his agenda. Therefore, he started studying and familiarizing with traditional arts in the School of Fine Arts. In 1941, he entered the Beautiful Arts School. The first period of the school (1941\u20131945) announced three graduates in painting and Ziapour received the first place and the first class cultural medal from the school and headed to France by the scholarship presented by that country's government and continued studying in [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in [[visual arts]] field.<ref>Faslnameh, 76.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, after his first return to Iran, the academy painters including Javad Hamidi, Hossein Kazemi,... assembled and the remarkable activity of contemporary painting in Iran was established.<ref>Sami-Azar, 21.</ref> In 1949, Ziapour established the artistic board \"[[Fighting Cock Society|Fighting Cock]]\", which was a leading committee in the field of modern arts in literature, theater, music and painting, and started printing a magazine with the same name with his proponents and presented his theory about [[visual arts]] (painting) called \"Refute of the Theories of Past and Contemporary Ideologies -from Primitive to [[Surrealism]]\". During his artistic activity as a painter, he was always considered as the leader of [[futurism]] and the developer of modern art and is the initiator of artistic criticism in Iran.<ref>Saber Tehrani, Introduction.</ref> Ziapour contended in four fronts: the followers of past methods, the degenerate modernists who had returned from abroad, the mass traditionalists, the followers of the old European method. His effort was to preserve the Iranian identity by leaning on the capacity of native culture, but speak by a global tongue and present it and eventually bring honor to his [[Culture of Iran|Iranian culture]].<ref>Sami-Azar, 22.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, he was offered a job from the National General Agency of Beautiful Arts and performed many cultural-artistic activities, jobs and missions like founding the female and male high schools for visual arts, [[decorative arts]] school, dean of [[anthropology]] museum, etc. In 1979, he retired from public service and since then until his final days of life, he performed research, writing and teaching at the schools of dramatic and decorative arts, Islamic Art Collective, [[Tarbiat Modares University|Tarbiat Modares]] and Al-Zahra Universities.<ref>Hariri, 9.</ref> In 79 years of age, Ziapour died at the Tus hospital of Tehran on Tuesday, December 21, 1999, as a result of heart failure after spending a difficult period of disease, and two days later on December 23, he was buried at the artists section of [[Behesht-e Zahra]].<ref>Maleki, behind the book.</ref>\n\n== Fighting Cock Society ==\n\nAfter his first return to Iran (1949), he founded the artistic society of [[Fighting Cock Society|Fighting Cock]], which was a leading society in the fields of modern art about literature, theater, music and painting, and also started printing a magazine with the same name. The location of the society was the Ziapour Atelier at the [[Taleghani Ave|Takht-e Jamshid Avenue]]. He announced the goal of the Fighting Cock Society \"Contending Conservatism and Traditionalism far from the Realities of the Time\" and picked a poem by [[Farrukhi Sistani]] as the motto of the society:\n\n\u0641\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0634\u062a \u0648 \u06a9\u0647\u0646 \u0634\u062f \u062d\u062f\u06cc\u062b \u0627\u0633\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0631/ \u0633\u062e\u0646 \u0646\u0648 \u0622\u0631 \u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u062d\u0644\u0627\u0648\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u062f\u06af\u0631\n\n'''Meaning''': ''The tale of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] became a legend and an old one. State new words which have a different sweet taste.''\n\nEventually, the opponents, who had introduced the Fighting Cock Magazine a publication associated with the [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh Party]] and believed [[cubism]] equal to [[communism]], caused Ziapour's interrogation at the Official Misdemeanors Court and the banning of the magazine. Then be published another magazine titled \"Kavir\", which was also banned, and then continued reflecting his thoughts at the publication \"Claw of Cock\".<ref>Saber Tehrani, 54, 91, 102.</ref>\n\n== Theory ==\nZiapour presented his art theory and view as a thesis titled \"Refute of the Theories of Past and Contemporary Ideologies from Primitive to [[Surrealism]]\" in October 1948 to cultural and journal societies; and in it, after presenting a short history of Occidental art ideologies, he considered all those ideologies ineffective for the main goal of painting and stated most of them as covers for supplying things other than painting. By that thesis, he became very close to the definition of single and abstract painting and looked at the material of modern painting, whose cleansing from literary, historical, social and so on is necessary in order to achieve an independent function of color, line, light and creative [[Composition (visual arts)|compositions]].<ref>Sami-Azar, 21.</ref> The general conclusions stated in the theory are:\n# The color and design are types of a far abnormal form and composition that the painting should act based on.\n# The more abnormal the concept in the painting is from the aspect of organization, the more complete and valuable from the aspect of specialty it is.\n# The concept of the painting, should not present the subject, the phrase and the result \"like normal writings\"; since every line and color, every form and every composition, is by itself possessing the subject and phrase and result and subsequently the concept; therefor, any form and picture and concept inclined to the familiar nature is contradictory with the profession of painting.\n# The more the natural and close unnatural pictures are replaced by combinations of color and design and other professional factors, the more the painting progresses towards perfection, where it can earn its beauties and individual pleasures further.\n# If the painting contains natural or close unnatural pictures, the artist should deliberately destroy them so that it becomes dissimilar to the normal nature in order to show the artistic factors completely and without any parasites.\n# In painting without a picture, which means outside natural and close unnatural pictures, the artist understands their own assignment and knows that they should directly perform artistic factors, i.e. forming more accurate and pleasant synchronizations and more lively and meaningful designs, in order to make specialized beauties. In this stage, both the artist and the public, especially those who \"believed to have understood specialized beauty by realizing normal and visual concepts like their own memories and wishes\", understand their assignments; and from now on, they refer directly to artistic factors in order to understand the beauty of the painting, not to the visual concepts or the picture itself. That will be the first stage where the artist and the public both find out the truth about specialized beauty or specialized [[aesthetics]].\n# Until now, painting has not reached its limits of specialized art and beauty and has had a very close interaction with other beautiful arts especially the literature of \"descriptive events\". By applying this theory, an ideology which we call \"perfect\" is born that separates the limits and borders of painting from other arts. This place, i.e. \"the perfect ideology\", will be the true home of professional and specialized painting- apart from other arts; and from here, painting will show itself with a more extensive concept.\n# The beauty of painting is different from that of other fine arts, and should be inspected separately.\n# No new method is ever born without the required environment; and no request can ever be ahead of the current request of its time; because every request has a factor; and surely the main factor of any motivated request in the society has a requester. Therefor, my theory is not outside the demand of my current time and can not be.<ref>Ziapour, 12\u201315.</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nZiapour's works are famous because of possessing original Iranian concepts, simplification of figures, loyalty to the traditional levels along with [[Geometry|geometric]] lines of [[cubism]], awareness of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] and generally the special style of painting. His research trip to [[Dasht-e Kavir|Kavir]] and various Iranian regions for [[Anthropology|anthropological]] inspections, guided his attention towards [[nomad]]ic lifestyle. He saw their behaviors, customs and traditions, clothes and [[adornment]]s worth noticing and utilized those resources in his works and because of his research inclination toward farming lifestyle,

mentioned as \"the father of modern Iranian painting\".<ref>Ayandeh No Newspaper, December 25, 2006</ref> Besides having been a leading painter and the head of the futuristic movement, he has had many research activities in the fields of [[anthropology]], study and familiarization with language, public culture, clothing and decorative designs of different regions of Iran, and their results are currently used in universities as reference books. During his cultural and artistic activity, Ziapour has performed giving more than 85 lectures, presenting more than 70 cultural and artistic articles, writing more than 28 books in the fields of [[Persian clothing|Iranian clothing]], art and history and also creating about 40 paintings and two statues.<ref>Mir-Emadi</ref> He was one of the founders of the artistic [[Fighting Cock Society]].\n\n== Biography ==\nJalil Ziapour was born in [[Bandar-e Anzali]] on 1920. His childhood hobbies were forming statues from Anzali marshes mud and listening to music. He began his art studies since youth. After finishing primary education, he went to [[Tehran]] in 1938 and entered the Music School, which was directed by Mr. Minbashian then, for composing and passed the entrance tests; but at that time, the foreign professors of the school returned to their home countries and he was not able to follow his agenda. Therefore, he started studying and familiarizing with traditional arts in the School of Fine Arts. In 1941, he entered the Beautiful Arts School. The first period of the school (1941\u20131945) announced three graduates in painting and Ziapour received the first place and the first class cultural medal from the school and headed to France by the scholarship presented by that country's government and continued studying in [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in [[visual arts]] field.<ref>Faslnameh, 76.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, after his first return to Iran, the academy painters including Javad Hamidi, Hossein Kazemi,... assembled and the remarkable activity of contemporary painting in Iran was established.<ref>Sami-Azar, 21.</ref> In 1949, Ziapour established the artistic board \"[[Fighting Cock Society|Fighting Cock]]\", which was a leading committee in the field of modern arts in literature, theater, music and painting, and started printing a magazine with the same name with his proponents and presented his theory about [[visual arts]] (painting) called \"Refute of the Theories of Past and Contemporary Ideologies -from Primitive to [[Surrealism]]\". During his artistic activity as a painter, he was always considered as the leader of [[futurism]] and the developer of modern art and is the initiator of artistic criticism in Iran.<ref>Saber Tehrani, Introduction.</ref> Ziapour contended in four fronts: the followers of past methods, the degenerate modernists who had returned from abroad, the mass traditionalists, the followers of the old European method. His effort was to preserve the Iranian identity by leaning on the capacity of native culture, but speak by a global tongue and present it and eventually bring honor to his [[Culture of Iran|Iranian culture]].<ref>Sami-Azar, 22.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, he was offered a job from the National General Agency of Beautiful Arts and performed many cultural-artistic activities, jobs and missions like founding the female and male high schools for visual arts, [[decorative arts]] school, dean of [[anthropology]] museum, etc. In 1979, he retired from public service and since then until his final days of life, he performed research, writing and teaching at the schools of dramatic and decorative arts, Islamic Art Collective, [[Tarbiat Modares University|Tarbiat Modares]] and Al-Zahra Universities.<ref>Hariri, 9.</ref> In 79 years of age, Ziapour died at the Tus hospital of Tehran on Tuesday, December 21, 1999, as a result of heart failure after spending a difficult period of disease, and two days later on December 23, he was buried at the artists section of [[Behesht-e Zahra]].<ref>Maleki, behind the book.</ref>\n\n== Fighting Cock Society ==\n\nAfter his first return to Iran (1949), he founded the artistic society of [[Fighting Cock Society|Fighting Cock]], which was a leading society in the fields of modern art about literature, theater, music and painting, and also started printing a magazine with the same name. The location of the society was the Ziapour Atelier at the [[Taleghani Ave|Takht-e Jamshid Avenue]]. He announced the goal of the Fighting Cock Society \"Contending Conservatism and Traditionalism far from the Realities of the Time\" and picked a poem by [[Farrukhi Sistani]] as the motto of the society:\n\n\u0641\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0634\u062a \u0648 \u06a9\u0647\u0646 \u0634\u062f \u062d\u062f\u06cc\u062b \u0627\u0633\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0631/ \u0633\u062e\u0646 \u0646\u0648 \u0622\u0631 \u06a9\u0647 \u0646\u0648 \u0631\u0627 \u062d\u0644\u0627\u0648\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a \u062f\u06af\u0631\n\n'''Meaning''': ''The tale of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] became a legend and an old one. State new words which have a different sweet taste.''\n\nEventually, the opponents, who had introduced the Fighting Cock Magazine a publication associated with the [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh Party]] and believed [[cubism]] equal to [[communism]], caused Ziapour's interrogation at the Official Misdemeanors Court and the banning of the magazine. Then be published another magazine titled \"Kavir\", which was also banned, and then continued reflecting his thoughts at the publication \"Claw of Cock\".<ref>Saber Tehrani, 54, 91, 102.</ref>\n\n== Theory ==\nZiapour presented his art theory and view as a thesis titled \"Refute of the Theories of Past and Contemporary Ideologies from Primitive to [[Surrealism]]\" in October 1948 to cultural and journal societies; and in it, after presenting a short history of Occidental art ideologies, he considered all those ideologies ineffective for the main goal of painting and stated most of them as covers for supplying things other than painting. By that thesis, he became very close to the definition of single and abstract painting and looked at the material of modern painting, whose cleansing from literary, historical, social and so on is necessary in order to achieve an independent function of color, line, light and creative [[Composition (visual arts)|compositions]].<ref>Sami-Azar, 21.</ref> The general conclusions stated in the theory are:\n# The color and design are types of a far abnormal form and composition that the painting should act based on.\n# The more abnormal the concept in the painting is from the aspect of organization, the more complete and valuable from the aspect of specialty it is.\n# The concept of the painting, should not present the subject, the phrase and the result \"like normal writings\"; since every line and color, every form and every composition, is by itself possessing the subject and phrase and result and subsequently the concept; therefor, any form and picture and concept inclined to the familiar nature is contradictory with the profession of painting.\n# The more the natural and close unnatural pictures are replaced by combinations of color and design and other professional factors, the more the painting progresses towards perfection, where it can earn its beauties and individual pleasures further.\n# If the painting contains natural or close unnatural pictures, the artist should deliberately destroy them so that it becomes dissimilar to the normal nature in order to show the artistic factors completely and without any parasites.\n# In painting without a picture, which means outside natural and close unnatural pictures, the artist understands their own assignment and knows that they should directly perform artistic factors, i.e. forming more accurate and pleasant synchronizations and more lively and meaningful designs, in order to make specialized beauties. In this stage, both the artist and the public, especially those who \"believed to have understood specialized beauty by realizing normal and visual concepts like their own memories and wishes\", understand their assignments; and from now on, they refer directly to artistic factors in order to understand the beauty of the painting, not to the visual concepts or the picture itself. That will be the first stage where the artist and the public both find out the truth about specialized beauty or specialized [[aesthetics]].\n# Until now, painting has not reached its limits of specialized art and beauty and has had a very close interaction with other beautiful arts especially the literature of \"descriptive events\". By applying this theory, an ideology which we call \"perfect\" is born that separates the limits and borders of painting from other arts. This place, i.e. \"the perfect ideology\", will be the true home of professional and specialized painting- apart from other arts; and from here, painting will show itself with a more extensive concept.\n# The beauty of painting is different from that of other fine arts, and should be inspected separately.\n# No new method is ever born without the required environment; and no request can ever be ahead of the current request of its time; because every request has a factor; and surely the main factor of any motivated request in the society has a requester. Therefor, my theory is not outside the demand of my current time and can not be.<ref>Ziapour, 12\u201315.</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nZiapour's works are famous because of possessing original Iranian concepts, simplification of figures, loyalty to the traditional levels along with [[Geometry|geometric]] lines of [[cubism]], awareness of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] and generally the special style of painting. His research trip to [[Dasht-e Kavir|Kavir]] and various Iranian regions for [[Anthropology|anthropological]] inspections, guided his attention towards [[nomad]]ic lifestyle. He saw their behaviors, customs and traditions, clothes and [[adornment]]s worth noticing and utilized those resources in his works and because of his research inclination toward farming lifestyle, nomadic concepts appeared in his works in an [[Allegory|allegorical]] way.\n\nJournalistic illustrations, researches on Iran and cultural and educational activities left him less time for creating more works.<ref>Sami-Azar, 21.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Name\n!Style\n!Technique\n!Size\n|-\n|1944\n|'''Himself'''\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[Impressionism]]\n| rowspan=\"10\" |[[Oil

He has remained a continual member for nearly three decades and has developed numerous other projects including [[\u00c6on Spoke]], Onward with Love, and recent his solo work. Masvidal was ranked in ''[[Loudwire]]''<nowiki/>'s 66 Best Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists Of All Time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/top-hard-rock-metal-guitarists-of-all-time/|title=The 66 Best Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All Time|last=Staff|first=Loudwire|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> and 50 Best Metal Songwriters of All Time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/best-metal-songwriters/|title=50 Best Metal Songwriters of All Time|last=DiVita|first=Joe|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early years were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar with [[Carlos Molina (guitarist)|Carlos Molina]], and in college, with jazz musician, Dave Weissbrot who inspired his love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Masvidal developed an interest in mysticism and esoteric topics from a young age, becoming an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and eventually a practitioner of [[Buddhist meditation]] by his late 20s. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] In Miami, where the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed. Masvidal's eclectic musical tastes ranging from classical to rock, jazz, fusion, and metal along with a innate passion for mysticism came to inform much of his work with Cynic and other projects. Masvidal wrote in detail about early life experiences in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Cynic (1988 - 1995, first hiatus) ===\n{{Main articles|Cynic (band)}}\n[[File:Masvidal with Death - Human era.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Masvidal with [[Death (metal band)|Death]]|alt=|left]]\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.

After fulfilling their obligations with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992. In 2013, Masvidal joined forces with other original members of the Death ''Human'' line up and toured worldwide in honor of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s legacy with the group DTA (Death to All).[[File:Cynic, Focus (1993).jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic, ''Focus'' (1993)|alt=]]1993 saw the release of the \u201cprogressive landmark\u201d album, ''[[Focus (Cynic album)|Focus]]'' on [[Roadrunner Records]].
