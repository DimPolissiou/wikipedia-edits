Unless they used a fantastic setting (as in ''Princess Knight'') or a backdrop of a distant time or place, romantic love for the heroine remained essentially taboo.

By far the most common form, ''shoujo''{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, follows [[English phonology]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, preserves the spelling, and requires only [[ASCII]] input. The [[Hepburn romanization]] ''sh\u014djo'' uses a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] for the long vowel, though the prevalence of [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|Latin-1]] fonts often results in a [[circumflex]] instead, as in ''sh\u00f4jo''. Many English-language texts just ignore long vowels, using ''shojo'', potentially leading to confusion with \u51e6\u5973 (''[[Sh\u014djo|shojo]]'', lit. \"virgin\") as well as other possible meanings. Finally, transliterators may use ''[[Nihon-shiki]]''-type mirroring of the ''[[kana]]'' spelling: ''sy\u00f4jyo'', or ''syoujyo''.\n\n==Western adoption==\n{{Original research|date=July 2008}}\nWestern fans classify a wide variety of titles as ''sh\u014djo'', even though their Japanese creators label them differently.

In their ''sh\u014djo'' manga range, publisher [[Viz Media]] attempted a re-appropriation of the term, providing the following definition:\n\n{{quotation |'''sh\u00f4\u00b7jo''' (sho'jo) ''n.''

Unless they used a fantastic setting (as in ''Princess Knight'') or a backdrop of a distant time or place, romantic love for the heroine remained essentially taboo. But the average age of the readership rose, and its interests changed. In the mid-1960s one of the few female artists in the field, [[Yoshiko Nishitani]], began to draw stories featuring contemporary Japanese teenagers in love.

By far the most common form, ''shoujo''{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, follows [[English phonology]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}, preserves the spelling, and requires only [[ASCII]] input. The [[Hepburn romanization]] ''sh\u014djo'' uses a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] for the long vowel, though the prevalence of [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|Latin-1]] fonts often results in a [[circumflex]] instead, as in ''sh\u00f4jo''. Many English-language texts just ignore long vowels, using ''shojo'', potentially leading to confusion with \u51e6\u5973 (''[[Sh\u014djo|shojo]]'', lit. \"virgin\") as well as other possible meanings. Finally, transliterators may use ''[[Nihon-shiki]]''-type mirroring of the ''[[kana]]'' spelling: ''sy\u00f4jyo'', or ''syoujyo''.\n\n==Western adoption==\n{{Original research|date=July 2008}}\nWestern fans classify a wide variety of titles as ''sh\u014djo'', even though their Japanese creators label them differently. Anything non-offensive and featuring female characters may classify as ''sh\u014djo'' manga, such as the ''[[sh\u014dnen]]'' comedy series ''[[Azumanga Daioh]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goetz |first1=Melanie |title=MIT Anime Showings: Synopses - Azumanga Daioh |url=http://web.mit.edu/anime/www/Showings/Azumanga_Daioh.shtml |website=MIT Anime Club |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205105824/http://web.mit.edu/anime/www/Showings/Azumanga_Daioh.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2008 |date=August 19, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Similarly, as romance has become a common element of many ''sh\u014djo'' works, any title with romance \u2013 such as the ''[[sh\u014dnen]]'' series ''[[Love Hina]]''<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chobot |first1=Jessica |title=Shojo Showdown: Making sense of the manga genres |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/13/shojo-showdown |website=[[IGN]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104011708/https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/13/shojo-showdown |archivedate=November 4, 2019 |date=December 13, 2005 |url-status=live}}</ref> or the ''[[seinen]]'' series ''[[Oh My Goddess!]]'' \u2013 tend to get mislabeled.\n\nThis confusion also extends beyond the fan community; articles aimed at the mainstream also widely misrepresent the terms. In an introduction to anime and manga, British writer [[Jon Courtenay Grimwood]] writes: \"''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'' comes from [[Rumiko Takahashi]], one of the best-known of all ''sh\u00f4jo'' writers. Imagine a very Japanese equivalent of ''[[Sweet Valley High]]'' or ''[[Melrose Place]]''. It has Takahashi's usual and highly successful mix of teenagers and romance, with darker clouds of adolescence hovering.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grimwood |first1=Jon Courtenay |authorlink1=Jon Courtenay Grimwood |title=Every Picture... |journal=Books Quarterly |date=2006 |issue=19 |page=42}}</ref> Takahashi is a famous ''sh\u014dnen'' [[manga artist]], but ''Maison Ikkoku'', one of her few ''[[Seinen manga|seinen]]'' titles and serialized in ''[[Big Comic Spirits]]'' magazine, is aimed at males in their 20s.\n\n[[Rachel Matt Thorn|Rachel Thorn]], who has made a career out of studying girls' comics, attempts to clarify the matter by explaining that \"''sh\u00f4jo'' manga are manga published in ''sh\u00f4jo'' magazines (as defined by their publishers)\".<ref name=\"Thorn 2004\"/> However, English publishers and stores have problems retailing ''sh\u014djo'' titles, including its spelling. Licensees such as [[Dark Horse Comics]] have misidentified several of the ''seinen'' titles, and in particular, manga and anime intended for a younger audience in Japan often contains violent or mature themes that would be targeted toward an older demographic in the US.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shojo Update: Your Comments and Our Answers |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/654.html |website=[[ICv2]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103235333/https://icv2.com/articles/comics/view/654/shojo-update |archivedate=November 3, 2019 |date=August 22, 2001 |url-status=live}}</ref> In this way licensees often either voluntarily [[censorship|censor]] titles or re-market them toward an older audience. In the less conservative [[Europe]]an markets, content that might be heavily edited or cut in an English-language release often remains in [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and other translated editions.\n\nAs one effect of these variations, American companies have moved to use the borrowed words that have gained name-value in fan communities, but to separate them from the Japanese meaning. In their ''sh\u014djo'' manga range, publisher [[Viz Media]] attempted a re-appropriation of the term, providing the following definition:\n\n{{quotation |'''sh\u00f4\u00b7jo''' (sho'jo) ''n.''

For instance, [[Frederik L. Schodt]] identifies [[Akimi Yoshida]]'s ''[[Banana Fish]]'' as:\n\n{{quotation|...one of the few girls' manga a red-blooded Japanese male adult could admit to reading without blushing.

The [[screenplay]] by [[Robert Getchell]] is the third [[feature film]] adaptation of the 1923 novel ''[[Stella Dallas (novel)|Stella Dallas]]'' by [[Olive Higgins Prouty]]. Previous film versions were ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1937) and the silent film ''[[Stella Dallas (1925 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1925).\n\nThe title character is a vulgar and unfashionable single mother living in [[Watertown (city), New York|Watertown, NY]], who, determined to give her daughter Jenny all the opportunities she never had, ultimately makes a selfless sacrifice to ensure her happiness.

Stella is fiercely independent and proud and is determined to do well by this child and take on whatever jobs she must to raise her daughter properly. When Jenny is 4 years old, her father suddenly reappears on the scene and is determined to get to know his daughter. At first reluctant to allow this, Stella is persuaded to allow contact, and a happy bond develops between the father and daughter. As Jenny ([[Trini Alvarado]]) grows up, she becomes torn between her father's rich and well-connected background, and her loyalty and love for her mother who is poor and vulgar but devoted to her daughter. She also despises the perceived relationship she sees developing between Stella and Ed Munn who is now a broken alcoholic. Jenny eventually meets and falls for a boy from her fathers 'world' and Stella realizes that now, the disparities in her own and Jennys father's backgrounds might jeopardize her daughter's future happiness.

Its ''[[Ts\u016bsh\u014dg\u014d]]'' ([[code name]]) was {{nihongo|''Sugi''|\u6749|\"Cryptomeria\"}}. The 8th Division consisted of troops from the [[T\u014dhoku region]] of Japan, primarily [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]], [[Akita Prefecture|Akita]] and [[Yamagata Prefecture]]s. Its first commander was General [[Tatsumi Naofumi]], formerly commander of the [[Sendai]] Garrison.\n\n==Division history==\nAs the tensions with Russia grew after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Triple Intervention]], the 8th Division was engaged in intensive cold-climate training, setting the stage for the infamous [[Hakk\u014dda Mountains incident]] in January 1902, where 199 of 210 members of its 5th Infantry Regiment froze to death in [[Hakk\u014dda Mountains]].\n\nAfter the [[Russo-Japanese War]] began, the 8th Division was mobilized in June 1904. It was initially earmarked for a projected Japanese invasion of [[Primorskaya Oblast]] on the Siberian mainland, but was sent as a reserve force for the [[Siege of Port Arthur]] instead after that plan was shelved. It was then earmarked for the proposed [[Invasion of Sakhalin]], but the [[13th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|13th Division]] was sent instead, The 8th Division remained in reserve until assigned as reinforcements at  [[Battle of Sandepu]] in January 1905. It acted with distinction, repelling a Russian counterattack together with the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|5th Division]]. In February 1905, the division participated in [[Battle of Mukden]]. \n\nFrom 1910, the 8th Division was assigned to garrison duties in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]], and it also participated in the [[Siberian Intervention]] starting in 1921. During [[Siberian Intervention]], the 8th division was assigned to garrison [[Khabarovsk Krai]] and [[Amur Oblast]].\n\nThe 8th Division (initially only the [[4th Mixed Brigade (Imperial Japanese Army)|4th Brigade]] participated in the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in the aftermath of the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931 and was assigned to [[Jiandao]]. The bulk of the division arrived in April 1932, and the division was at the [[Battle of Rehe]] from February 1933. It subsequently remained in [[Manchukuo]] as a garrison force. From 1937, the 8th division was subordinated to the [[Kwantung Army]].  On 13 January 1938, the division was assigned to [[Third Army (Japan)|3rd Army]] remaining in [[Suiyang County]]. In 1939, its 32nd Infantry Regiment was transferred to the newly formed [[24th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|24th Division]], thus converting 8th Division to a [[triangular division|triangular format]]. The division participated in the [[Kantokuen]] special training maneuvers in July 1941. On 19 September 1941, the 8th Division was subordinated to the [[Twentieth Army (Japan)|20th Army]] to perform a defense duties at [[Soviet Union]] border, together with [[25th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|25th Division]]. It remained in Manchukuo through most of the early stages of the [[Pacific War]].\n\nIn February 1944, a three detachments were formed (infantry battalion, artillery battalion and engineers company). These were combined into 11th Independent Mixed Regiment, and sent to [[Poluwat]] in June 1944, as the war situation in then Pacific grew increasingly difficult for Japan. Because of the lack of food and large number of wounded due American air raids, two of the three battalions were relocated to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in September 1944.\n\nIn July 1944, the 8th Division was reassigned from [[Mudanjiang]] to the [[Philippines]] under the command of General [[Yamashita Tomoyuki]]'s [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army|14th Area Army]].

[[Glacier]]s erode by multiple processes: abrasion/scouring, [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]], ice thrusting and [[ice lens|glacially-induced spalling]]. Glaciers crack pieces of bedrock off in the process of plucking, producing the larger erratics. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood, producing smaller [[glacial till]].  In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. Glacially-induced spalling occurs when [[ice lens]] formation with the rocks below the glacier spall off layers of rock, providing smaller debris which is ground into the glacial basal material to become till.<ref name=Bell2008>{{Cite journal  | last =  Bell | first =  Robin E. | authorlink =   | title = The role of subglacial water in ice-sheet mass balance | journal =    [[Nature Geoscience]] | volume =  1  | issue =  5802 | pages =    297\u2013304| date =  27 April 2008 | url =   | doi= 10.1038/ngeo186| id =    | bibcode=2008NatGe...1..297B}}</ref><ref name=Rempel2008>{{Cite journal  | last =  Rempel | first =   A.

They were formed between 14,000 & 70,000 years before the present. The deposited debris can be traced back to the origin by both the nature of the materials released and the continuous path of debris release. Some paths extend more than {{convert|3000|km|mi}} distant from the point at which the ice floes originally broke free.<ref name=Bond1999/>\n\nThe location and altitude of ice-rafted boulders relative to the modern landscape has been used to identify the highest level of water in proglacial lakes (e.g., [[Lake Musselshell]] in central [[Montana]]) and temporary lakes (e.g., [[Lake Lewis]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state. Ice-rafted debris is deposited when the iceberg strands on the shore and subsequently melts, or drops out of the ice floe as it melts. Hence all erratic deposits are deposited below the actual high water level of the lake; however the measured altitude of ice-rafted debris can be used to estimate the lake surface elevation.\n\n[[Image:Angular glacial erratic on Lambert Dome-750px.jpg|thumb|right|Angular glacial erratic on [[Lembert Dome]].]]\nThis is accomplished by recognizing that on a fresh-water lake, the [[iceberg]] floats until the volume of its ice-rafted debris exceeds  5% of the volume of the iceberg.

Erratics were once considered evidence of a vast flood approximately 10,000 years ago,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} similar to the legendary floods described in the texts of [[ancient civilizations]] throughout the world. Ancient [[legend]]s of an epic flood come from many cultures including [[Mesoamerican]], [[Sumer]]ian ([[Epic of Gilgamesh]]), [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] ([[Old Testament]]) and [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indian]] culture. Among others, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[politician]], jurist and theologian {{ill|Bernhard Friedrich Kuhn|de}} saw glaciers as a possible solution as early as 1788. However the idea of ice ages and glaciation as a geological force took a while to be accepted. [[Ignaz Venetz]] (1788 \u2014 1859), a Swiss engineer, naturalist, and glaciologist was one of the first scientists to recognize glaciers as a major force in shaping the earth.\n\nIn the 19th century, many scientists came to favor erratics as evidence for the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] ([[ice age]]) 10,000 years ago, rather than a flood. [[Geologist]]s have suggested that [[landslide]]s or rockfalls initially dropped the rocks on top of glacial ice. The glaciers continued to move, carrying the rocks with them. When the ice melted, the erratics were left in their present locations.\n\nCharles Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'' (v. 1, 1830)<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AOcJAAAAMAAJ <!-- quote=charles lyell principles of geology. --> ''Principles of Geology''], Volume 1; Sir Charles Lyell - Geology - 1830</ref> provided an early description of the erratic which is consistent with the modern understanding.

In his accounts written during the voyage of {{HMS|Beagle}}, Darwin observed a number of large erratic boulders of notable size south of the [[Strait of Magellan]], [[Tierra del Fuego]] and attributed them to ice rafting from [[Antarctica]].

Their lithographic origin can be traced to the parent bedrock, allowing for confirmation of the ice flow route.\n*They can be transported by [[ice rafting]]. This allows quantification of the extent of glacial flooding resulting from ice dam failure which release the waters stored in [[proglacial lake]]s such as [[Lake Missoula]]. Erratics released by ice-rafts that were stranded and subsequently melt, dropping their load, allow characterization of the high-water marks for transient floods in areas like temporary [[Lake Lewis]].\n*Erratics dropped by [[iceberg]]s melting in the ocean can be used to track Antarctic and Arctic-region glacial movements for periods prior to record retention.  Also known as [[dropstone]]s, these can be correlated with ocean temperatures and levels to better understand and calibrate [[Global climate model|models of the global climate]].<ref name=Bard2004>{{Cite journal |last=Bard  |first=Edouard |language=French |title=Effet de serre et glaciations, une perspective historique |trans-title=Greenhouse effect and ice ages: historical perspective  |journal=Comptes Rendus Geoscience |volume=336 |issue=7\u20138 |pages=603\u2013638 |date=June 2004 |doi=10.1016/j.crte.2004.02.005 |bibcode=2004CRGeo.336..603B }}</ref>\n\n==Formation of erratics==\n[[Image:Erratics-Cascades-PB110028.JPG|thumb|Multiple erratics on the [[terminal moraine]] of the Okanagon Lobe.

[[Glacier]]s erode by multiple processes: abrasion/scouring, [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]], ice thrusting and [[ice lens|glacially-induced spalling]]. Glaciers crack pieces of bedrock off in the process of plucking, producing the larger erratics. In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood, producing smaller [[glacial till]].  In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. Glacially-induced spalling occurs when [[ice lens]] formation with the rocks below the glacier spall off layers of rock, providing smaller debris which is ground into the glacial basal material to become till.<ref name=Bell2008>{{Cite journal  | last =  Bell | first =  Robin E. | authorlink =   | title = The role of subglacial water in ice-sheet mass balance | journal =    [[Nature Geoscience]] | volume =  1  | issue =  5802 | pages =    297\u2013304| date =  27 April 2008 | url =   | doi= 10.1038/ngeo186| id =    | bibcode=2008NatGe...1..297B}}</ref><ref name=Rempel2008>{{Cite journal  | last =  Rempel | first =   A.

Ice-rafted debris is deposited when the iceberg strands on the shore and subsequently melts, or drops out of the ice floe as it melts. Hence all erratic deposits are deposited below the actual high water level of the lake; however the measured altitude of ice-rafted debris can be used to estimate the lake surface elevation.\n\n[[Image:Angular glacial erratic on Lambert Dome-750px.jpg|thumb|right|Angular glacial erratic on [[Lembert Dome]].]]\nThis is accomplished by recognizing that on a fresh-water lake, the [[iceberg]] floats until the volume of its ice-rafted debris exceeds  5% of the volume of the iceberg.

Erratics were once considered evidence of a vast flood approximately 10,000 years ago,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} similar to the legendary floods described in the texts of [[ancient civilizations]] throughout the world. Ancient [[legend]]s of an epic flood come from many cultures including [[Mesoamerican]], [[Sumer]]ian ([[Epic of Gilgamesh]]), [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] ([[Old Testament]]) and [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indian]] culture. Among others, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[politician]], jurist and theologian {{ill|Bernhard Friedrich Kuhn|de}} saw glaciers as a possible solution as early as 1788. However the idea of ice ages and glaciation as a geological force took a while to be accepted. [[Ignaz Venetz]] (1788 \u2014 1859), a Swiss engineer, naturalist, and glaciologist was one of the first scientists to recognize glaciers as a major force in shaping the earth.\n\nIn the 19th century, many scientists came to favor erratics as evidence for the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] ([[ice age]]) 10,000 years ago, rather than a flood. [[Geologist]]s have suggested that [[landslide]]s or rockfalls initially dropped the rocks on top of glacial ice. The glaciers continued to move, carrying the rocks with them. When the ice melted, the erratics were left in their present locations.\n\nCharles Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'' (v. 1, 1830)<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AOcJAAAAMAAJ <!-- quote=charles lyell principles of geology. --> ''Principles of Geology''], Volume 1; Sir Charles Lyell - Geology - 1830</ref> provided an early description of the erratic which is consistent with the modern understanding.

At the top of the [[Czech football league system]], it is the country's primary football competition. It is contested by 16 clubs, operating a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the [[Czech National Football League]]. Since 2018\u201319, seasons run from July to May, with teams playing 30 games each. Then teams are divided into three groups playing superstructure for final positions. The league is currently ranked 13th in Europe in the [[UEFA coefficient|UEFA league rankings]].\n\nThe history of the Czech football league began at the end of the 20th century. It was reorganised for the 1993\u20131994 season, after the [[Velvet divorce|dissolution of former Czechoslovakia]] and therefore of the [[Czechoslovak First League|Czechoslovak League]]. Having won 12 of league titles, [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] is the most successful team in Czech First League history. Other clubs who have won the title are [[SK Slavia Prague|Slavia Prague]], [[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]], [[FC Ban\u00edk Ostrava|Ban\u00edk Ostrava]] and [[FC Viktoria Plze\u0148|Viktoria Plze\u0148]].\n[[File:Poh\u00e1r pro v\u00edt\u011bze Gambrinus ligy 03.jpg|thumbnail|right|Gambrinus liga 2013 trophy]]\n\n==Competition format==\n===1993\u20132018===\nThere are 16 clubs in the league. During the course of a season, which lasts from August to May, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 30 games. In the inaugural season, two points were awarded for a win, before switching to [[three points for a win]] in 1994.<ref name=\"threepoints\">{{cite news|url=http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/15686-a-recap-red-cards-tv-woes-goodbye-dukla.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404055127/http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/15686-a-recap-red-cards-tv-woes-goodbye-dukla.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 April 2017 |title=A Recap: Red Cards, TV Woes, Goodbye Dukla |work=Prague Post |date=3 August 1994 |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}</ref> Teams receive one point for a draw and no points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, in the case of two or more teams finishing with equal points, the head-to-head record between the teams is used for ranking, counting points in relevant games, then goal difference and then goals scored. The two lowest placed teams are relegated to the second tier ([[Czech National Football League]]).\n\n===Changes from 2018===\nThe [[2018\u201319 Czech First League|2018\u201319 season]] was the first season played with the new competition format. After a regular season, which lasts from July to April and which is played by the same key as previous season, the teams are divided into three groups. The top 6 teams from the regular season enter the championship group, with the first-placed team winning the championship of Czech Republic. The teams play against each other only once, having total of 5 matches. Earned points are added to the points from the regular season.\n\nThe teams from 7th\u201310th position in regular season take part in the Europa League play-offs. The best of them play against the fourth-placed or fifth-placed (it depends on the result of the Czech Cup and on the Czech coefficient rankings between European football leagues) of the championship group to determine who will participate in the [[Europa League]].\n\nThe teams from 11th\u201316th position in regular season play by the same key as championship group. The team placed on 16th position is relegated straightly into the [[Czech National Football League]], while teams on 15th and 14th places play relegation play-off against 2nd and 3rd team from the [[Czech National Football League]].\n\n==Participating teams in 2019\u201320==\n===Map===\n{{location map+ |Czech Republic |width=480 |float=right |caption=Locations of the '''2019\u201320 Czech First League''' teams |places=\n{{Location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=50.083333 |long=14.416667 |marksize=12 |label='''Prague''' |position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=48.974722 |long=14.474722 |label=<small>[[SK Dynamo \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice|\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice]]</small> |position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=50.724444 |long=15.168056 |label=<small>[[FK Jablonec|Jablonec]]</small>}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.854167 |long=18.542778 |label=<small>[[MFK Karvin\u00e1|Karvin\u00e1]]</small> |position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=50.716667 |long=15.066667 |label=<small>[[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]]</small> |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=50.4125   |long=14.904444 |label=<small>[[FK Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav|Mlad\u00e1&nbsp;Boleslav]]</small>}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.6      |long=17.248333 |label=<small>{{nowrap|[[SK Sigma Olomouc|Sigma&nbsp;Olomouc]]}}</small> |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.949725 |long=17.890092 |label=<small>[[SFC Opava|Opava]]</small> |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.804314 |long=18.255961 |label=<small>[[FC Ban\u00edk Ostrava|Ban\u00edk&nbsp;Ostrava]]</small> |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.7475   |long=13.3775   |label=<small>[[FC Viktoria Plze\u0148|Viktoria Plze\u0148]]</small> |position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.676944 |long=13.976389 |label=<small>[[1.

At the top of the [[Czech football league system]], it is the country's primary football competition. It is contested by 16 clubs, operating a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the [[Czech National Football League]]. Since 2018\u201319, seasons run from July to May, with teams playing 30 games each. Then teams are divided into three groups playing superstructure for final positions. The league is currently ranked 13th in Europe in the [[UEFA coefficient|UEFA league rankings]].\n\nThe history of the Czech football league began at the end of the 20th century. It was reorganised for the 1993\u20131994 season, after the [[Velvet divorce|dissolution of former Czechoslovakia]] and therefore of the [[Czechoslovak First League|Czechoslovak League]]. Having won 12 of league titles, [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] is the most successful team in Czech First League history. Other clubs who have won the title are [[SK Slavia Prague|Slavia Prague]], [[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]], [[FC Ban\u00edk Ostrava|Ban\u00edk Ostrava]] and [[FC Viktoria Plze\u0148|Viktoria Plze\u0148]].\n[[File:Poh\u00e1r pro v\u00edt\u011bze Gambrinus ligy 03.jpg|thumbnail|right|Gambrinus liga trophy]]\n\n==Competition format==\n===1993\u20132018===\nThere are 16 clubs in the league. During the course of a season, which lasts from August to May, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 30 games. In the inaugural season, two points were awarded for a win, before switching to [[three points for a win]] in 1994.<ref name=\"threepoints\">{{cite news|url=http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/15686-a-recap-red-cards-tv-woes-goodbye-dukla.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404055127/http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/15686-a-recap-red-cards-tv-woes-goodbye-dukla.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 April 2017 |title=A Recap: Red Cards, TV Woes, Goodbye Dukla |work=Prague Post |date=3 August 1994 |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}</ref> Teams receive one point for a draw and no points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, in the case of two or more teams finishing with equal points, the head-to-head record between the teams is used for ranking, counting points in relevant games, then goal difference and then goals scored. The two lowest placed teams are relegated to the second tier ([[Czech National Football League]]).\n\n===Changes from 2018===\nThe [[2018\u201319 Czech First League|2018\u201319 season]] was the first season played with the new competition format. After a regular season, which lasts from July to April and which is played by the same key as previous season, the teams are divided into three groups. The top 6 teams from the regular season enter the championship group, with the first-placed team winning the championship of Czech Republic. The teams play against each other only once, having total of 5 matches. Earned points are added to the points from the regular season.\n\nThe teams from 7th\u201310th position in regular season take part in the Europa League play-offs. The best of them play against the fourth-placed or fifth-placed (it depends on the result of the Czech Cup and on the Czech coefficient rankings between European football leagues) of the championship group to determine who will participate in the [[Europa League]].\n\nThe teams from 11th\u201316th position in regular season play by the same key as championship group. The team placed on 16th position is relegated straightly into the [[Czech National Football League]], while teams on 15th and 14th places play relegation play-off against 2nd and 3rd team from the [[Czech National Football League]].\n\n==Participating teams in 2019\u201320==\n===Map===\n{{location map+ |Czech Republic |width=480 |float=right |caption=Locations of the '''2019\u201320 Czech First League''' teams |places=\n{{Location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=50.083333 |long=14.416667 |marksize=12 |label='''Prague''' |position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=48.974722 |long=14.474722 |label=<small>[[SK Dynamo \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice|\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice]]</small> |position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=50.724444 |long=15.168056 |label=<small>[[FK Jablonec|Jablonec]]</small>}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.854167 |long=18.542778 |label=<small>[[MFK Karvin\u00e1|Karvin\u00e1]]</small> |position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=50.716667 |long=15.066667 |label=<small>[[FC Slovan Liberec|Slovan Liberec]]</small> |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=50.4125   |long=14.904444 |label=<small>[[FK Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav|Mlad\u00e1&nbsp;Boleslav]]</small>}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.6      |long=17.248333 |label=<small>{{nowrap|[[SK Sigma Olomouc|Sigma&nbsp;Olomouc]]}}</small> |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.949725 |long=17.890092 |label=<small>[[SFC Opava|Opava]]</small> |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.804314 |long=18.255961 |label=<small>[[FC Ban\u00edk Ostrava|Ban\u00edk&nbsp;Ostrava]]</small> |position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.7475   |long=13.3775   |label=<small>[[FC Viktoria Plze\u0148|Viktoria Plze\u0148]]</small> |position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Czech Republic |lat=49.676944 |long=13.976389 |label=<small>[[1.

This likely occurred before the time of [[Y\u0101ska]] (c. 500 BCE), since he includes these terms in his [[nirukta]] studies, one of the six [[Vedanga]] of ancient Indian tradition.

The swaras have about 12 different forms and different combinations of these swaras are made to sit under the names of different ragas. The specific code of a song clearly tells us what combination of swaras are present in a specific song. The lyrical part of the song is called \"sahityam\" and sahityam is just like singing the swaras altogether but using the lyrics of the song. The code in the form of swaras have even the notation of which note to be sung high and which one low.

Examples of this are the logical classification of [[raga]]s into [[melakarta]]s, and the use of fixed compositions similar to Western classical music. Carnatic raga elaborations are generally much faster in tempo and shorter than their equivalents in Hindustani music. In addition, accompanists have a much larger role in Carnatic concerts than in Hindustani concerts. Today's typical concert structure was put in place by the vocalist [[Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar]]. The opening piece is called a [[varnam]], and is a warm-up for the musicians. A devotion and a request for a blessing follows, then a series of interchanges between [[ragam]]s (unmetered melody) and [[thaalam]]s (the ornamentation, equivalent to the ''[[Jor (music)|jor]]''). This is intermixed with [[hymn]]s called [[krithi]]s. The [[pallavi]] or theme from the raga then follows. Carnatic pieces also have notated lyrical poems that are reproduced as such, possibly with embellishments and treatments according to the performer's ideology, referred to as Manodharmam.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nPrimary themes include worship, descriptions of temples, philosophy, and nayaka-nayika (Sanskrit \"hero-heroine\") themes.

It exists in four major forms: [[Dhrupad]], [[Khyal]] (or Khayal), [[Tarana]], and the semi-classical [[Thumri]].{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|p=152}} Dhrupad is ancient, Khyal evolved from it, Thumri evolved from Khyal.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}} There are three major schools of Thumri: Lucknow gharana, Banaras gharana and Punjabi gharana. These weave in folk music innovations.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|p=152}} Tappa is the most folksy, one which likely existed in Rajasthan and Punjab region before it was systematized and integrated into classical music structure. It became popular, with the Bengali musicians developing their own Tappa.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|p=146}}\n\nKhyal is the modern form of Hindustani music, and the term literally means \"imagination\". It is significant because it was the template for [[Sufi music]]ians among the [[Islam in India|Islamic community of India]], and ''[[Qawwal]]s'' sang their folk songs in the Khyal format.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nDhrupad (or Dhruvapad), the ancient form described in the Hindu text ''Natyashastra'',{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=81\u201382}} is one of the core forms of classical music found all over the Indian subcontinent. The word comes from ''Dhruva'' which means immovable and permanent.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|pp=33\u201334}}{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nA Dhrupad has at least four stanzas, called Sthayi (or Asthayi), Antara, Sanchari and Abhoga. The Sthayi part is a melody that uses the middle octave's first tetrachord and the lower octave notes.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}} The Antara part uses the middle octave's second tetrachord and the higher octave notes.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}} The Sanchari part is the development phase, which builds using parts of Sthayi and Antara already played, and it uses melodic material built with all the three octave notes.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}} The Abhoga is the concluding section, that brings the listener back to the familiar starting point of Sthayi, albeit with rhythmic variations, with diminished notes like a gentle goodbye, that are ideally mathematical fractions such as ''dagun'' (half), ''tigun'' (third) or ''chaugun'' (fourth).{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201382}} Sometimes a fifth stanza called Bhoga is included. Though usually related to philosophical or [[Bhakti]] (emotional devotion to a god or goddess) themes, some Dhrupads were composed to praise kings.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|pp=33\u201334}}{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201382}}\n\nImprovisation is of central importance to Hindustani music, and each ''gharana'' (school tradition) has developed its own techniques. At its core, it starts with a standard composition (bandish), then expands it in a process called ''vistar''. The improvisation methods have ancient roots, and one of the more common techniques is called ''[[Alap]]'', which is followed by the ''[[Jor (music)|Jor]]'' and ''[[Jhala]]''. The ''Alap'' explores possible tonal combinations among other things, ''Jor'' explores speed or tempo (faster), while ''Jhala'' explores complex combinations like a fishnet of strokes while keeping the beat patterns.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=198\u2013199}} As with [[Carnatic music]], Hindustani music has assimilated various folk tunes. For example, ragas such as Kafi and Jaijaiwanti are based on folk tunes.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n====Persian and Arab influences====\nHindustani music has had Arab and Persian music influences, including the creation of new ragas and the development of instruments such as the sitar and sarod.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=80}} The nature of these influences are unclear. Scholars have attempted to study Arabic ''[[Arabic maqam|maqam]]'' (also spelled ''makam'') of Arabian peninsula, Turkey and northern Africa, and ''[[dastgah]]'' of Iran, to discern the nature and extent.<ref name=\"Lewis2016p176\"/><ref name=\"Hast1999p124\">{{cite book|author1=Dorothea E.

He states that Persian ''maqams'' in use in his times had been derived from older Indian ''ragas'' (or ''mela''), and he specifically maps over a dozen ''maqam''. For example, Vittala states that the ''Hijaz maqam'' was derived from the ''Asaveri raga'', and ''Jangula'' was derived from the ''Bangal''.{{Sfn|Gautam|1993|pp=8\u20139}}{{Sfn|Jairazbhoy|1995|pages=94\u201395}} In 1941, Haidar Rizvi questioned this and stated that influence was in the other direction, Middle Eastern ''maqams'' were turned into Indian ''ragas'', such as ''Zangulah maqam'' becoming ''Jangla raga''.<ref>S.N.

According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of ''raga'' cannot be offered in one or two sentences.{{Sfn|Kaufmann|1968|p=v}} ''Raga'' may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, in a manner similar to how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}} In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in others optional. The ''raga'' allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nA ''raga'' has a given set of notes, on a scale, ordered in melodies with musical motifs.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} A musician playing a ''raga'', states [[Bruno Nettl]], may traditionally use just these notes, but is free to emphasize or improvise certain degrees of the scale.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} The Indian tradition suggests a certain sequencing of how the musician moves from note to note for each ''raga'', in order for the performance to create a ''rasa'' (mood, atmosphere, essence, inner feeling) that is unique to each ''raga''. A ''raga'' can be written on a scale. Theoretically, thousands of ''raga'' are possible given 5 or more notes, but in practical use, the classical Indian tradition has refined and typically relies on several hundred.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} For most artists, their basic perfected repertoire has some forty to fifty ''ragas''.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|p=5}} ''Raga'' in Indian classical music is intimately related to ''tala'' or guidance about \"division of time\", with each unit called a ''matra'' (beat, and duration between beats).{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=6\u20138}}\n\n[[file:Sikh_Gurbani_Shabad_Kirtan_with_Tanti_Saaz.ogg|left|thumb|.]]\nA ''raga'' is not a tune, because the same ''raga'' can yield a very large number of tunes.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} A ''raga'' is not a scale, because many ''ragas'' can be based on the same scale.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}}{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}} A ''raga'', states Bruno Nettl and other music scholars, is a concept similar to mode, something between the domains of tune and scale, and it is best conceptualized as a \"unique array of melodic features, mapped to and organized for a unique aesthetic sentiment in the listener\".{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} The goal of a ''raga'' and its artist is to create ''rasa'' (essence, feeling, atmosphere) with music, as [[classical Indian dance]] does with performance arts. In the Indian tradition, classical dances are performed with music set to various ''ragas''.{{Sfn|Mehta|1995|pp=xxix, 248}}\n\n===Tala===\n{{main|Tala (music)}}\nAccording to David Nelson \u2013 an Ethnomusicology scholar specializing in Carnatic music, a ''tala'' in Indian music covers \"the whole subject of musical meter\".{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=138\u2013139}} Indian music is composed and performed in a metrical framework, a structure of beats that is a ''tala''. A ''tala'' measures musical time in Indian music. However, it does not imply a regular repeating accent pattern, instead its hierarchical arrangement depends on how the musical piece is supposed to be performed.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nThe ''tala'' forms the metrical structure that repeats, in a cyclical harmony, from the start to end of any particular song or dance segment, making it conceptually analogous to meters in Western music.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=138\u2013139}} However, ''talas'' have certain qualitative features that classical European musical meters do not. For example, some ''talas'' are much longer than any classical Western meter, such as a framework based on 29 beats whose cycle takes about 45 seconds to complete when performed. Another sophistication in ''talas'' is the lack of \"strong, weak\" beat composition typical of the traditional European meter. In classical Indian traditions, the ''tala'' is not restricted to permutations of strong and weak beats, but its flexibility permits the accent of a beat to be decided by the shape of musical phrase.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nThe most widely used ''tala'' in the South Indian system is ''[[adi tala]]''.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|pp=816\u2013817}} In the North Indian system, the most common ''tala'' is ''[[teental]]''.<ref name=koskoff938/> In the two major systems of classical Indian music, the first count of any ''tala'' is called ''sam''.<ref name=koskoff938>{{cite book|author=Ellen Koskoff|title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzIt6ZL5lY0C |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-09602-0|pages=938\u2013939}}</ref>\n\n===Instruments===\n{{Main|Indian musical instruments|Vadya}}\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=240|align=right\n| image1 = Veena.png | alt1=Veena |width1=600|height1=400\n| image2 = Banshri.jpg | alt2= Flute |width2=165|height2=215\n| image3 = Wiki-mridangam.jpg | alt3= Tabla (drums) |width3=460|height3=434 \n| image4 = Khartal1.jpg | alt4= Cymbals |width4=900 |height4= 598\n| footer = Musical instrument types mentioned in the ''Natyashastra''.<ref name=\"BaumerBrandon1993p117\">{{cite book|author1=Rachel Van M.

Another common instrument is the [[string instrument|stringed]] [[tanpura]], which is played at a steady tone (a drone) throughout the performance of the [[raga]], and which provides both a point of reference for the musician and a background against which the music stands out. The tuning of the tanpura depends on the raga being performed. The task of playing the tanpura traditionally falls to a student of the soloist. Other instruments for accompaniment include the [[sarangi]] and the [[harmonium]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Notation system===\nIndian classical music is both elaborate and expressive. Like [[Western classical music]], it divides the octave into 12 [[semitone]]s of which the 7 basic notes are, in ascending tonal order, ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni '' for [[Hindustani music]] and ''Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni '' for [[Carnatic music]], similar to Western music's ''Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti ''. However, Indian music uses [[just intonation|just-intonation]] tuning, unlike some modern Western classical music, which uses the [[equal temperament|equal-temperament]] tuning system. Also, unlike modern Western classical music, Indian classical music places great emphasis on improvisation.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe underlying scale may have [[tetratonic scale|four]], [[pentatonic|five]], [[hexatonic|six]] or [[heptatonic|seven tones]], called ''[[swara]]s'' (sometimes spelled as ''svaras''). The ''swara'' concept is found in the ancient ''Natya Shastra'' in Chapter 28.

The earliest Indian thought combined three arts, syllabic recital (''vadya''), melos (''gita'') and dance (''nrtta'').{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|p=9}} As these fields developed, ''sangeeta'' became a distinct genre of art, in a form equivalent to contemporary music. This likely occurred before the time of [[Y\u0101ska]] (c. 500 BCE), since he includes these terms in his [[nirukta]] studies, one of the six [[Vedanga]] of ancient Indian tradition. Some of the ancient texts of Hinduism such as the ''[[Samaveda]]'' (c. 1000 BCE) are structured entirely to melodic themes,<ref name=\"Thompson1694\">{{cite book|author=William Forde Thompson|title =Music in the Social and Behavioral Sciences: An Encyclopedia|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=kpmlBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT1694| year=2014 |publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-6558-9|pages=1693\u20131694}}</ref>{{Sfn|Beck|1993|pages=107\u2013109, Quote: \"it is generally agreed that Indian music indeed owes its beginnings to the chanting of the ''Sama\u2013Veda'', the vast collection of verses (Sama), many from the Rig\u2013veda itself, set to melody and sung by singer\u2013priests known as udgata\".}} it is sections of ''[[Rigveda]]'' set to music.<ref>Frits Staal (2009), Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0-14-309986-4}}, pp. 4\u20135</ref>\n\nThe ''Samaveda'' is organized into two formats. One part is based on the musical meter, another by the aim of the rituals.{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=59\u201361}} The text is written with embedded coding, where ''swaras'' (octave notes) are either shown above or within the text, or the verse is written into ''parvans'' (knot or member) in simple words this embedded code of swaras is like the skeleton of the song. The swaras have about 12 different forms and different combinations of these swaras are made to sit under the names of different ragas. The specific code of a song clearly tells us what combination of swaras are present in a specific song. The lyrical part of the song is called \"sahityam\" and sahityam is just like singing the swaras altogether but using the lyrics of the song. The code in the form of swaras have even the notation of which note to be sung high and which one low. The hymns of ''Samaveda'' contain melodic content, form, rhythm and metric organization.{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=59\u201361}} This structure is, however, not unique or limited to ''Samaveda''. The ''Rigveda'' embeds the musical meter too, without the kind of elaboration found in the ''Samaveda''. For example, the [[Gayatri mantra]] contains three metric lines of exactly eight syllables, with an embedded ternary rhythm.{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=62\u201363}}\n\n[[File:Five Celestial Musicians LACMA AC1992.254.1-.5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Five Gandharvas (celestial musicians) from 4th\u20135th century CE, northwest South Asia, carrying the four types of musical instruments. Gandharvas are discussed in Vedic era literature.{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=11\u201314}}]]\nIn the ancient traditions of Hinduism, two musical genre appeared, namely ''Gandharva'' (formal, composed, ceremonial music) and ''Gana'' (informal, improvised, entertainment music).{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=11\u201312}} The ''Gandharva'' music also implied celestial, divine associations, while the ''Gana'' also implied singing.{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=11\u201312}} The Vedic Sanskrit musical tradition had spread widely in the Indian subcontinent, and according to Rowell, the ancient Tamil classics make it \"abundantly clear that a cultivated musical tradition existed in South India as early as the last few pre-Christian centuries\".{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nThe classic Sanskrit text ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' is at the foundation of the numerous classical music and dance traditions of India. Before ''Natyashastra'' was finalized, the ancient Indian traditions had classified musical instruments into four groups based on their acoustic principle (how they work, rather than the material they are made of) for example flute which works with gracious in and out flow of air.{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=13\u201314}} These four categories are accepted as given and are four separate chapters in the ''Natyashastra'', one each on stringed instruments (chordophones), hollow instruments (aerophones), solid instruments (idiophones), and covered instruments (membranophones).{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=13\u201314}} Of these, states Rowell, the idiophone in the form of \"small bronze cymbals\" were used for ''tala''.

The music traditions of the North and South India were not considered distinct until about the 16th century, but after that the traditions acquired distinct forms.{{Sfn|Sorrell|Narayan|1980|pp=3\u20134}} North Indian classical music is called ''Hindustani'', while the South Indian expression is called ''Carnatic'' (sometimes spelled as ''Karnatic'').

This openness to ideas led to assimilation of regional folk innovations, as well as influences that arrived from outside the subcontinent. For example, Hindustani music assimilated Arabian and Persian influences.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=80}} This assimilation of ideas was upon the ancient classical foundations such as ''raga'', ''tala'', ''matras'' as well as the musical instruments.

Examples of this are the logical classification of [[raga]]s into [[melakarta]]s, and the use of fixed compositions similar to Western classical music. Carnatic raga elaborations are generally much faster in tempo and shorter than their equivalents in Hindustani music. In addition, accompanists have a much larger role in Carnatic concerts than in Hindustani concerts. Today's typical concert structure was put in place by the vocalist [[Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar]]. The opening piece is called a [[varnam]], and is a warm-up for the musicians. A devotion and a request for a blessing follows, then a series of interchanges between [[ragam]]s (unmetered melody) and [[thaalam]]s (the ornamentation, equivalent to the ''[[Jor (music)|jor]]''). This is intermixed with [[hymn]]s called [[krithi]]s. The [[pallavi]] or theme from the raga then follows. Carnatic pieces also have notated lyrical poems that are reproduced as such, possibly with embellishments and treatments according to the performer's ideology, referred to as Manodharmam.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nPrimary themes include worship, descriptions of temples, philosophy, and nayaka-nayika (Sanskrit \"hero-heroine\") themes.

It exists in four major forms: [[Dhrupad]], [[Khyal]] (or Khayal), [[Tarana]], and the semi-classical [[Thumri]].{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|p=152}} Dhrupad is ancient, Khyal evolved from it, Thumri evolved from Khyal.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}} There are three major schools of Thumri: Lucknow gharana, Banaras gharana and Punjabi gharana. These weave in folk music innovations.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|p=152}} Tappa is the most folksy, one which likely existed in Rajasthan and Punjab region before it was systematized and integrated into classical music structure. It became popular, with the Bengali musicians developing their own Tappa.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|p=146}}\n\nKhyal is the modern form of Hindustani music, and the term literally means \"imagination\". It is significant because it was the template for [[Sufi music]]ians among the [[Islam in India|Islamic community of India]], and ''[[Qawwal]]s'' sang their folk songs in the Khyal format.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nDhrupad (or Dhruvapad), the ancient form described in the Hindu text ''Natyashastra'',{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=81\u201382}} is one of the core forms of classical music found all over the Indian subcontinent. The word comes from ''Dhruva'' which means immovable and permanent.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|pp=33\u201334}}{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nA Dhrupad has at least four stanzas, called Sthayi (or Asthayi), Antara, Sanchari and Abhoga. The Sthayi part is a melody that uses the middle octave's first tetrachord and the lower octave notes.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}} The Antara part uses the middle octave's second tetrachord and the higher octave notes.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}} The Sanchari part is the development phase, which builds using parts of Sthayi and Antara already played, and it uses melodic material built with all the three octave notes.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201381}} The Abhoga is the concluding section, that brings the listener back to the familiar starting point of Sthayi, albeit with rhythmic variations, with diminished notes like a gentle goodbye, that are ideally mathematical fractions such as ''dagun'' (half), ''tigun'' (third) or ''chaugun'' (fourth).{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201382}} Sometimes a fifth stanza called Bhoga is included. Though usually related to philosophical or [[Bhakti]] (emotional devotion to a god or goddess) themes, some Dhrupads were composed to praise kings.{{Sfn|Caudhur\u012b|2000|pp=33\u201334}}{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=80\u201382}}\n\nImprovisation is of central importance to Hindustani music, and each ''gharana'' (school tradition) has developed its own techniques. At its core, it starts with a standard composition (bandish), then expands it in a process called ''vistar''. The improvisation methods have ancient roots, and one of the more common techniques is called ''[[Alap]]'', which is followed by the ''[[Jor (music)|Jor]]'' and ''[[Jhala]]''. The ''Alap'' explores possible tonal combinations among other things, ''Jor'' explores speed or tempo (faster), while ''Jhala'' explores complex combinations like a fishnet of strokes while keeping the beat patterns.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=198\u2013199}} As with [[Carnatic music]], Hindustani music has assimilated various folk tunes. For example, ragas such as Kafi and Jaijaiwanti are based on folk tunes.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n====Persian and Arab influences====\nHindustani music has had Arab and Persian music influences, including the creation of new ragas and the development of instruments such as the sitar and sarod.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=80}} The nature of these influences are unclear.

According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of ''raga'' cannot be offered in one or two sentences.{{Sfn|Kaufmann|1968|p=v}} ''Raga'' may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, in a manner similar to how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}} In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in others optional. The ''raga'' allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nA ''raga'' has a given set of notes, on a scale, ordered in melodies with musical motifs.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} A musician playing a ''raga'', states [[Bruno Nettl]], may traditionally use just these notes, but is free to emphasize or improvise certain degrees of the scale.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} The Indian tradition suggests a certain sequencing of how the musician moves from note to note for each ''raga'', in order for the performance to create a ''rasa'' (mood, atmosphere, essence, inner feeling) that is unique to each ''raga''. A ''raga'' can be written on a scale. Theoretically, thousands of ''raga'' are possible given 5 or more notes, but in practical use, the classical Indian tradition has refined and typically relies on several hundred.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} For most artists, their basic perfected repertoire has some forty to fifty ''ragas''.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|p=5}} ''Raga'' in Indian classical music is intimately related to ''tala'' or guidance about \"division of time\", with each unit called a ''matra'' (beat, and duration between beats).{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=6\u20138}}\n\n[[file:Sikh_Gurbani_Shabad_Kirtan_with_Tanti_Saaz.ogg|left|thumb|.]]\nA ''raga'' is not a tune, because the same ''raga'' can yield a very large number of tunes.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} A ''raga'' is not a scale, because many ''ragas'' can be based on the same scale.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}}{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}} A ''raga'', states Bruno Nettl and other music scholars, is a concept similar to mode, something between the domains of tune and scale, and it is best conceptualized as a \"unique array of melodic features, mapped to and organized for a unique aesthetic sentiment in the listener\".{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} The goal of a ''raga'' and its artist is to create ''rasa'' (essence, feeling, atmosphere) with music, as [[classical Indian dance]] does with performance arts. In the Indian tradition, classical dances are performed with music set to various ''ragas''.{{Sfn|Mehta|1995|pp=xxix, 248}}\n\n===Tala===\n{{main|Tala (music)}}\nAccording to David Nelson \u2013 an Ethnomusicology scholar specializing in Carnatic music, a ''tala'' in Indian music covers \"the whole subject of musical meter\".{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=138\u2013139}} Indian music is composed and performed in a metrical framework, a structure of beats that is a ''tala''. A ''tala'' measures musical time in Indian music. However, it does not imply a regular repeating accent pattern, instead its hierarchical arrangement depends on how the musical piece is supposed to be performed.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nThe ''tala'' forms the metrical structure that repeats, in a cyclical harmony, from the start to end of any particular song or dance segment, making it conceptually analogous to meters in Western music.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=138\u2013139}} However, ''talas'' have certain qualitative features that classical European musical meters do not. For example, some ''talas'' are much longer than any classical Western meter, such as a framework based on 29 beats whose cycle takes about 45 seconds to complete when performed. Another sophistication in ''talas'' is the lack of \"strong, weak\" beat composition typical of the traditional European meter. In classical Indian traditions, the ''tala'' is not restricted to permutations of strong and weak beats, but its flexibility permits the accent of a beat to be decided by the shape of musical phrase.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nThe most widely used ''tala'' in the South Indian system is ''[[adi tala]]''.{{Sfn|Randel|2003|pp=816\u2013817}} In the North Indian system, the most common ''tala'' is ''[[teental]]''.<ref name=koskoff938/> In the two major systems of classical Indian music, the first count of any ''tala'' is called ''sam''.<ref name=koskoff938>{{cite book|author=Ellen Koskoff|title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzIt6ZL5lY0C |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-09602-0|pages=938\u2013939}}</ref>\n\n===Instruments===\n{{Main|Indian musical instruments|Vadya}}\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=240|align=right\n| image1 = Veena.png | alt1=Veena |width1=600|height1=400\n| image2 = Banshri.jpg | alt2= Flute |width2=165|height2=215\n| image3 = Wiki-mridangam.jpg | alt3= Tabla (drums) |width3=460|height3=434 \n| image4 = Khartal1.jpg | alt4= Cymbals |width4=900 |height4= 598\n| footer = Musical instrument types mentioned in the ''Natyashastra''.<ref name=\"BaumerBrandon1993p117\">{{cite book|author1=Rachel Van M.

Another common instrument is the [[string instrument|stringed]] [[tanpura]], which is played at a steady tone (a drone) throughout the performance of the [[raga]], and which provides both a point of reference for the musician and a background against which the music stands out. The tuning of the tanpura depends on the raga being performed. The task of playing the tanpura traditionally falls to a student of the soloist. Other instruments for accompaniment include the [[sarangi]] and the [[harmonium]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Notation system===\nIndian classical music is both elaborate and expressive. Like [[Western classical music]], it divides the octave into 12 [[semitone]]s of which the 7 basic notes are, in ascending tonal order, ''Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni '' for [[Hindustani music]] and ''Sa Ri Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni '' for [[Carnatic music]], similar to Western music's ''Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti ''. However, Indian music uses [[just intonation|just-intonation]] tuning, unlike some modern Western classical music, which uses the [[equal temperament|equal-temperament]] tuning system. Also, unlike modern Western classical music, Indian classical music places great emphasis on improvisation.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe underlying scale may have [[tetratonic scale|four]], [[pentatonic|five]], [[hexatonic|six]] or [[heptatonic|seven tones]], called ''[[swara]]s'' (sometimes spelled as ''svaras''). The ''swara'' concept is found in the ancient ''Natya Shastra'' in Chapter 28. It calls the unit of tonal measurement or audible unit as ''\u015ahruti'',{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=14}} with verse 28.21 introducing the musical scale as follows,<ref>Nazir Ali Jairazbhoy (1985), [http://ethnomusicologyreview.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/prevol2.pdf Harmonic Implications of Consonance and Dissonance in Ancient Indian Music], ''Pacific Review of Ethnomusicology'' 2:28\u201351.

Autoregulation and the difficulty of politicians to understand software issues made [[competition law|governmental intervention against monopolies]] ineffective. Financial deregulation led to GAFA's big profit margins (all four except for Amazon had about 20\u201325 percent profit margins in 2014 according to Smyrnaios).\n\n===Globalization===\nAccording to Smyrnaios, globalization has allowed GAFAM to minimize its global taxation load and pay international workers much lower wages than would be required in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Smyrnaios_GAFAM\" />\n\n===Oligopoly maintenance===\nSmyrnaios argued in 2016 that GAFA combines six vertical levels of power, data centers, internet connectivity, computer hardware including [[smartphone]]s, operating systems, Web browsers and other user-level software, and online services. He also discussed horizontal concentration of power, in which diverse services such as email, instant messaging, [[search engine|online searching]], downloading and streaming are combined internally within any of the GAFA members.<ref name=\"Smyrnaios_GAFAM\" />\n\n== Antitrust investigations in 2019-2020 ==\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the Big Tech industry become center of antitrust attention from the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] that included requests to provide information about prior acquisitions and potentially uncompetitive practices. Some Democratic candidates running for president proposed plans to break up Big Tech companies and regulate them as [[utilities]]. \u201cThe role of technology in the economy and in our lives grows more important every day,\u201d said FTC Chairman [[Joe Simons]]. \u201cAs I\u2019ve noted in the past, it makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies|title=FTC to Examine Past Acquisitions by Large Technology Companies|date=2020-02-11|website=Federal Trade Commission}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftcs-bureau-competition-launches-task-force-monitor-technology|title= FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition Launches Task Force to Monitor Technology Markets|date=2019-02-26|website=Federal Trade Commission}}</ref>\n\nDiscussions of antitrust policy are clouded, however, by common myths about this widely misunderstood area of the law. The [[Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890]] criminalizes monopolistic business practices, specifically agreements that restraint of trade or commerce. At the same time, the Sherman Act allows organic creation of legitimately successful businesses that gain honest profits from [[consumers]]. The Act\u2019s main function is to preserve a competitive marketplace. The Big Tech companies are large and successful companies, but success alone is not reason enough for antitrust action. A legitimate breach of [[antitrust law]] must be the cause of any action against these giants, otherwise no startup would have an incentive to build the next one. One has to ask how Big Tech companies have gained their dominant market position, because a business is only guilty of monopolization if the monopoly is obtained by means other than providing a better product at a better price. Companies such as [[Google]] must be able to succeed by offering their users a superior experience.\n\nThe correlation between alleged anticompetitive behavior and questionable [[online privacy]] practices is also far from clear. Antitrust law is narrowly tailored to protect consumers from business conduct that harms the competitive process itself. Questionable practices that relate to privacy, however, may require their own regulatory framework of online privacy laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/myths-antitrust-law-amazon-google-monopoly/2020/03/20/ead2a072-6a1a-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html|title=Five myths about antitrust law|date=2020-03-20|website=Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n==Opposition==\n[[Scott Galloway (professor)|Scott Galloway]] has criticized the companies for \"avoid[ing] taxes, invad[ing] privacy, and destroy[ing] jobs\",<ref name=\"cnbc_avoid_taxes\" /> while Smyrnaios has described the group as an [[oligopoly]], coming to dominate the online market through [[anti-competitive practices]], ever-increasing financial power, and [[intellectual property law]].<ref name=\"Smyrnaios_GAFAM\" /> He has argued that the current situation is the result of [[deregulation|economic deregulation]], [[globalization]], and the failure of politicians to understand and respond to developments in technology.\n\nSmyrnaios recommended developing academic analysis of the [[political economy]] of the Internet in order to understand the methods of domination and to criticize these methods in order to encourage opposition to that domination.<ref name=\"Smyrnaios_GAFAM\" />\n\n===Use of externally-generated content===\nOn 9 May 2019, the [[Parliament of France]] passed a law intended to force GAFA to pay for [[related rights]] (the reuse of substantial amounts of text, photos or videos), to the publishers and news agencies of the original materials.

Autoregulation and the difficulty of politicians to understand software issues made [[competition law|governmental intervention against monopolies]] ineffective. Financial deregulation led to GAFA's big profit margins (all four except for Amazon had about 20\u201325 percent profit margins in 2014 according to Smyrnaios).\n\n===Globalization===\nAccording to Smyrnaios, globalization has allowed GAFAM to minimize its global taxation load and pay international workers much lower wages than would be required in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Smyrnaios_GAFAM\" />\n\n===Oligopoly maintenance===\nSmyrnaios argued in 2016 that GAFA combines six vertical levels of power, data centers, internet connectivity, computer hardware including [[smartphone]]s, operating systems, Web browsers and other user-level software, and online services. He also discussed horizontal concentration of power, in which diverse services such as email, instant messaging, [[search engine|online searching]], downloading and streaming are combined internally within any of the GAFA members.<ref name=\"Smyrnaios_GAFAM\" />\n\n== Antitrust investigations in 2019-2020 ==\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the Big Tech industry become center of antitrust attention from the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the United States [[Federal Trade Commission]] that included requests to provide information about prior acquisitions and potentially uncompetitive practices. Some Democratic candidates running for president proposed plans to break up Big Tech companies and regulate them as [[utilities]]. \u201cThe role of technology in the economy and in our lives grows more important every day,\u201d said FTC Chairman [[Joe Simons]]. \u201cAs I\u2019ve noted in the past, it makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies|title=FTC to Examine Past Acquisitions by Large Technology Companies|date=2020-02-11|website=Federal Trade Commission}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftcs-bureau-competition-launches-task-force-monitor-technology|title= FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition Launches Task Force to Monitor Technology Markets|date=2019-02-26|website=Federal Trade Commission}}</ref>\n\nDiscussions of antitrust policy are clouded, however, by common myths about this widely misunderstood area of the law. The [[Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890]] criminalizes monopolistic business practices, specifically agreements that restraint of trade or commerce. At the same time, the Sherman Act allows organic creation of legitimately successful businesses that gain honest profits from [[consumers]]. The Act\u2019s main function is to preserve a competitive marketplace. The Big Tech companies are large and successful companies, but success alone is not reason enough for antitrust action. A legitimate breach of [[antitrust law]] must be the cause of any action against these giants, otherwise no startup would have an incentive to build the next one. One has to ask how Big Tech companies have gained their dominant market position, because a business is only guilty of monopolization if the monopoly is obtained by means other than providing a better product at a better price. Companies such as [[Google]] must be able to succeed by offering their users a superior experience.\n\nThe correlation between alleged anticompetitive behavior and questionable [[online privacy]] practices is also far from clear. Antitrust law is narrowly tailored to protect consumers from business conduct that harms the competitive process itself.
