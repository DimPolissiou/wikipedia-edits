The [[Avon River (Canterbury)|Avon River]] flows through the centre of the city, with an urban park located along its banks.\n\nArchaeological evidence has indicated that people first settled in the Christchurch area in about 1250. Christchurch became a city by [[Royal Charter]] on 31 July 1856, making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand. The [[Canterbury Association]], which settled the [[Canterbury Plains]], named the city after [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. The new settlement was laid out in a [[grid pattern]] centred on [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]]; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area, except for the Pacific to the east and the [[Port Hills]] to the south.\n\n[[Agriculture in New Zealand|Agriculture]] is the historic mainstay of Christchurch's economy. The early presence of the [[University of Canterbury]] and the heritage of the city's academic institutions in association with local businesses has fostered a number of technology-based industries. Christchurch is one of five 'gateway cities' for [[History of Antarctica|Antarctic exploration]], hosting Antarctic support bases for several nations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Christchurch \u2013 Gateway to Antarctica |url=http://www.antarcticanz.govt.nz/about-us/christchurch-gateway-to-antarctica/ |publisher=Antarctica New Zealand |access-date=23 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323210404/http://www.antarcticanz.govt.nz/about-us/christchurch-gateway-to-antarctica/ |archive-date=23 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe city suffered [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|a series of earthquakes]] between September 2010 and January 2012, with the most destructive of them occurring at 12.51 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 February 2011, in which 185 people were killed and thousands of buildings across the city collapsed or suffered severe damage. By late 2013, 1,500 buildings in the city had been demolished, leading to an ongoing recovery and rebuilding project.\n\n==Names==\nThe name of \"Christchurch\" was agreed on at the first meeting of the [[Canterbury Association]] on 27 March 1848.

With its higher labour use this has helped stop declines in rural population. Many cropping and sheep farms have been converted to dairying. Conversions have been by agribusiness companies as well as by farmers, many of whom have moved south from North Island dairying strongholds such as [[Taranaki]] and the [[Waikato]].\n\nCropping has always been important in the surrounding countryside. Wheat and barley and various strains of clover and other grasses for seed exporting have been the main crops. These have all created processing businesses in Christchurch. In recent years, regional agriculture has diversified, with a thriving wine industry springing up at [[Waipara]], and beginnings of new horticulture industries such as olive production and processing. Deer farming has led to new processing using antlers for Asian medicine and aphrodisiacs.

With its higher labour use this has helped stop declines in rural population. Many cropping and sheep farms have been converted to dairying. Conversions have been by agribusiness companies as well as by farmers, many of whom have moved south from North Island dairying strongholds such as [[Taranaki]] and the [[Waikato]].\n\nCropping has always been important in the surrounding countryside. Wheat and barley and various strains of clover and other grasses for seed exporting have been the main crops. These have all created processing businesses in Christchurch. In recent years, regional agriculture has diversified, with a thriving wine industry springing up at [[Waipara]], and beginnings of new horticulture industries such as olive production and processing. Deer farming has led to new processing using antlers for Asian medicine and aphrodisiacs.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=''Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16).

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=''Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun.

Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.<ref>According to The ''Congressional Record'' (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted \"doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval\".\n</ref>\n\nA version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the [[Interest bearing note#Denominational set of interest bearing notes|twenty dollar interest bearing note]] issued in 1864 along with the motto \"God and our Right\".\n\nAs Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837, prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress. Such legislation was introduced and passed as the [[Coinage Act of 1864]] on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAn Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865, allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that \"shall admit the inscription thereon\".<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=CR1956p13917>[http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf ''Congressional Record'', 1956, p. 13917] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106115209/http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }}, via NonBeliever.org</ref> In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act, granting that the Secretary of the Treasury \"may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto\".\n\nA similar phrase, 'In God is our Trust', appears in \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the song adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931.

Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] added the words and made minor modifications to the design.

Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.<ref>According to The ''Congressional Record'' (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted \"doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval\".\n</ref>\n\nA version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the [[Interest bearing note#Denominational set of interest bearing notes|twenty dollar interest bearing note]] issued in 1864 along with the motto \"God and our Right\".\n\nAs Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837, prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress. Such legislation was introduced and passed as the [[Coinage Act of 1864]] on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAn Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865, allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that \"shall admit the inscription thereon\".<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=CR1956p13917>[http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf ''Congressional Record'', 1956, p. 13917] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106115209/http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }}, via NonBeliever.org</ref> In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act, granting that the Secretary of the Treasury \"may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto\".\n\nA similar phrase, 'In God is our Trust', appears in \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the song adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931.

Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] added the words and made minor modifications to the design.
