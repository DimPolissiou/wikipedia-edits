In physics, energy is a quantity that provides the capacity to perform work (e.g. lifting an object) or provides heat. In addition to being convertible, according to the law of conservation of energy, energy is transferable to a different location or object, but it cannot be created or destroyed.\n\nThe energy in many of its forms may be used in natural processes, or to provide some service to society such as heating, refrigeration, lighting or performing mechanical work to operate machines. For example, to heat a home, the furnace burns fuel, whose chemical potential energy is converted into thermal energy, which is then transferred to the home's air to raise its temperature.\n\n== Limitations in the conversion of thermal energy ==\nConversions to thermal energy from other forms of energy may occur with 100% efficiency.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pandey |first1=Er. Akanksha |title=Advantages and Limitations of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion |url=https://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/105281-Advantages-and-Limitations-of-Ocean-Thermal-Energy-Conversion.aspx |website=India Study Channel |date=9 February 2010}}{{self-published inline|date=January 2020}}</ref> Conversion among non-thermal forms of energy may occur with fairly high efficiency, though there is always some energy dissipated thermally due to [[friction]] and similar processes. Sometimes the efficiency is close to 100%, such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in a vacuum. This also applies to the opposite case; for example, an object in an [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]] around another body converts its kinetic energy (speed) into gravitational potential energy (distance from the other object) as it moves away from its parent body. When it reaches the furthest point, it will reverse the process, accelerating and converting potential energy into kinetic. Since space is a near-vacuum, this process has close to 100% efficiency.\n\nThermal energy is very unique because it can not be converted to other forms of energy. Only a difference in the density of thermal/heat energy (temperature) can be used to perform work, and the efficiency of this conversion will be (much) less than 100%. This is because thermal energy represents a particularly disordered form of energy; it is spread out randomly among many available states of a collection of microscopic particles constituting the system (these combinations of position and momentum for each of the particles are said to form a [[phase space]]). The measure of this disorder or randomness is [[entropy]], and its defining feature is that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases. One cannot take a high-entropy system (like a hot substance, with a certain amount of thermal energy) and convert it into a low entropy state (like a low-temperature substance, with correspondingly lower energy), without that entropy going somewhere else (like the surrounding air). In other words, there is no way to concentrate energy without spreading out energy somewhere else.\n\nThermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katinas |first1=Vladislovas |last2=Mar\u010diukaitis |first2=Mantas |last3=Perednis |first3=Eugenijus |last4=Dzenajavi\u010dien\u0117 |first4=Eugenija Farida |title=Analysis of biodegradable waste use for energy generation in Lithuania |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |date=1 March 2019 |volume=101 |pages=559\u2013567 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2018.11.022 }}</ref> because it is not entirely convertible to a \"useful\" form, i.e. one that can do more than just affect temperature. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of a closed system can never decrease. For this reason, thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100% only if the entropy of the universe is increased by other means, to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content. Otherwise, only a part of that thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy (and thus useful work). This is because the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature. The increase in entropy for this process is greater than the decrease in entropy associated with the transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy.\n\nIn order to make energy transformation more efficient, it is desirable to avoid thermal conversion. For example, the efficiency of nuclear reactors, where the kinetic energy of the nuclei is first converted to thermal energy and then to electrical energy, lies at around 35%.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dunbar |first1=William R. |last2=Moody |first2=Scott D. |last3=Lior |first3=Noam |title=Exergy analysis of an operating boiling-water-reactor nuclear power station |journal=Energy Conversion and Management |date=March 1995 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=149\u2013159 |doi=10.1016/0196-8904(94)00054-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=P.D.|title=The Nuclear Fuel Cycle: From Ore to Waste|date=1996|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York}}{{pn|date=January 2020}}</ref> By direct conversion of kinetic energy to electric energy, effected by eliminating the intermediate thermal energy transformation, the efficiency of the energy transformation process can be dramatically improved.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shinn |first1=Eric |last2=H\u00fcbler |first2=Alfred |last3=Lyon |first3=Dave |last4=Perdekamp |first4=Matthias Grosse |last5=Bezryadin |first5=Alexey |last6=Belkin |first6=Andrey |title=Nuclear energy conversion with stacks of graphene nanocapacitors |journal=Complexity |date=January 2013 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=24\u201327 |doi=10.1002/cplx.21427 |bibcode=2013Cmplx..18c..24S }}</ref>\n\n== History of energy transformation ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\nEnergy transformations in the universe over time are usually characterized by various kinds of energy, which have been available since the [[Big Bang]], later being \"released\" (that is, transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy) by a triggering mechanism.\n\n=== Release of energy from gravitational potential ===\nA direct transformation of energy occurs when hydrogen produced in the Big Bang collects into structures such as planets, in a process during which part of the gravitational potential is to be converted directly into heat. In [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and [[Neptune]], for example, such heat from the continued collapse of the planets' large gas atmospheres continue to drive most of the planets' weather systems. These systems, consisting of atmospheric bands, winds, and powerful storms, are only partly powered by sunlight. However, on [[Uranus]], little of this process occurs.{{Why|date=May 2019}}{{Citation needed|danot to day but in 20 years ago\n\nOn [[Earth]], a significant portion of the heat output from the interior of the planet, estimated at a third to half of the total, is caused by the slow collapse of planetary materials to a smaller size, generating heat.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Release of energy from radioactive potential ===\nfed and maerry had a liy to not die\n\n=== Release of energy from hydrogen fusion potential ===\nIn a similar chain of transformations beginning at the dawn of the universe, [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in the Sun releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to one theory{{Which|date=May 2019}}, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This resulted in hydrogen representing a store of potential energy which can be released by [[nuclear fusion]]. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from the gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into starlight. Considering the solar system, starlight, overwhelmingly from the Sun, may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth. This occurs in the case of [[avalanches]], or when water evaporates from oceans and is deposited as [[precipitation]] high above sea level (where, after being released at a [[hydroelectric dam]], it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity).\n\nSunlight also drives many weather phenomena on Earth. One example is a [[hurricane]], which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by plants as a chemical [[potential energy]] via [[photosynthesis]], when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen. The release of this energy as heat and light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire; or it may be available more slowly for animal or human [[metabolism]] when these molecules are ingested, and [[catabolism]] is triggered by enzyme action.\n\nThrough all of these transformation chains, the [[potential energy]] stored at the time of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being stored in several different ways for long periods between releases, as more active energy. All of these events involve the conversion of one kind of energy into others, including heat.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n===Examples of sets of energy conversions in machines===\nA [[coal]]-fired power plant involves these energy transformations:\n#[[Chemical energy]] in the coal is converted into [[thermal energy]] in the exhaust gases of combustion\n#[[Thermal energy]] of the exhaust gases converted into [[thermal energy]] of steam through heat exchange\n#Thermal energy of steam converted to mechanical energy in the turbine\n#Mechanical energy of the turbine converted to electrical energy by the generator, which is the ultimate output\n\nIn such a system, the first and fourth steps are highly efficient, but the second and third steps are less efficient.

Tee-Jays was a recognized company internationally until it closed in 2005. Chanin's business now lays on the grounds of Tee-Jays. From her expanding success, Chanin has now opened other businesses including The School of Making, Building 14, and The Factory Store reviving a community full of artisans and maunfacturers. <ref>[http://florencehistory.org/mills-and-textiles-1950-and-beyond/ Mills and Textiles 1950 and Beyond]</ref> She is part of the [[zero-waste fashion]] movement.

At the age of ten, her mom and her moved to Chattanooga. She has a degree in [[Environmental Design]] with a focus on industrial and craft-based textiles from [[North Carolina State University]].<ref name=\"NEARTS\">[http://arts.gov/NEARTS/2014v2-story-our-culture-arists-place-community/natalie-chanin Natalie Chanin] arts.gov</ref> After graduation, Chanin worked in the junior sportswear industry on New York's [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]], before moving abroad. For the next decade, she worked as a stylist,[[costume designer]], and filmmaker, all while traveling the globe. \n\n==Inspiration==\nChanin draws inspiration from her academic studies, including ideas about color as espoused by Josef and [[Anni Albers]],the Bauhaus artists who fled Nazi Germany for Asheville, North Carolina, in 1933 to teach at [[Black Mountain College]]. Southern literature and stories have always been a love of hers. Growing up, her grandmother sewed every garment her children wore as well as Chanin's, while also gardening and cooking fresh food. This led to her naturally to make a community of her own through Alabama Chanin. <ref>[https://bittersoutherner.com/alabama-chanin#.XpNz_i2ZPwd You Can Make It There]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Project Alabama===\nChanin came back to her hometown of Florence, Alabama in 2000 and developed an idea to create a small line of two-hundred unique t-shirts. Chanin decided her hometown was the only place able to envision her idea of reconstructing vintage shirts with detailed stitches, like that of a quilting stitch from the depression era. This started the development of ''Project Alabama'', which consisted of a twenty-two-minute documentary called ''Stitch'', the two-hundred limited hand-sewn and hand-mended t-shirts, and a hand-made catalogue. After taking the collection to [[New York City]] to showcase at the [[Hotel Chelsea]], it was immediately recognized by buyers from department stores including [[Barneys New York]]. <ref>[https://www.wmagazine.com/story/five-minutes-with-natalie-chan/ Five Minutes with Natalie Chanin]</ref> With its successful launch, ''Project Alabama'' became a full production facility. In 2006, Chanin separated from her original business partner, while production moved abroad to India. <ref>[https://doi.org/10.2752/175174108X346922 SLOW + FASHION\u2014an Oxymoron\u2014or a Promise for the Future \u2026?]</ref> \n\n===Alabama Chanin===\nThe making of the brand Alabama Chanin is the culmination of what ''Project Alabama'' symbolized. <ref>[https://www.wmagazine.com/story/five-minutes-with-natalie-chan/ Five Minutes with Natalie Chanin]</ref>  \nAlabama Chanin is rooted in the tenets of the [[Slow design]] movement. Known for its \"eco-chic\" influences, Natalie launched the Alabama Chanin line in 2006.<ref>[http://www.polishedpigmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Southern-Living-Mar-2014-A-Chanin_new.pdf Luxe for less, Style Spy, March 2014 Southern Living FL6]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122191109/http://www.polishedpigmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Southern-Living-Mar-2014-A-Chanin_new.pdf |date=2015-01-22 }} polishedpigmedia.com</ref> Tied with the [[slow design]] movement, Chanin is also known for being at the forefront of the [[zero-waste]] movement by trying to implement sustainable solutions through her brand.

At the age of ten, her mom and her moved to Chattanooga. She has a degree in [[Environmental Design]] with a focus on industrial and craft-based textiles from [[North Carolina State University]].<ref name=\"NEARTS\">[http://arts.gov/NEARTS/2014v2-story-our-culture-arists-place-community/natalie-chanin Natalie Chanin] arts.gov</ref> After graduation, Chanin worked in the junior sportswear industry on New York's [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]], before moving abroad. For the next decade, she worked as a stylist,[[costume designer]], and filmmaker, all while traveling the globe. \n\n==Inspiration==\nChanin draws inspiration from her academic studies, including ideas about color as espoused by Josef and [[Anni Albers]],the Bauhaus artists who fled Nazi Germany for Asheville, North Carolina, in 1933 to teach at [[Black Mountain College]]. Southern literature and stories have always been a love of hers. Growing up, her grandmother sewed every garment her children wore as well as Chanin's, while also gardening and cooking fresh food. This led to her naturally to make a community of her own through Alabama Chanin. <ref>[https://bittersoutherner.com/alabama-chanin#.XpNz_i2ZPwd You Can Make It There]</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Project Alabama===\nChanin came back to her hometown of Florence, Alabama in 2000 and developed an idea to create a small line of two-hundred unique t-shirts. Chanin decided her hometown was the only place able to envision her idea of reconstructing vintage shirts with detailed stitches, like that of a quilting stitch from the depression era. This started the development of ''Project Alabama'', which consisted of a twenty-two-minute documentary called ''Stitch'', the two-hundred limited hand-sewn and hand-mended t-shirts, and a hand-made catalogue. After taking the collection to [[New York City]] to showcase at the [[Hotel Chelsea]], it was immediately recognized by buyers from department stores including [[Barneys New York]]. <ref>[https://www.wmagazine.com/story/five-minutes-with-natalie-chan/ Five Minutes with Natalie Chanin]</ref> With its successful launch, ''Project Alabama'' became a full production facility. In 2006, Chanin separated from her original business partner, while production moved abroad to India. <ref>[https://doi.org/10.2752/175174108X346922 SLOW + FASHION\u2014an Oxymoron\u2014or a Promise for the Future \u2026?]</ref> \n\n===Alabama Chanin===\nThe making of the brand Alabama Chanin is the culmination of what ''Project Alabama'' symbolized. <ref>[https://www.wmagazine.com/story/five-minutes-with-natalie-chan/ Five Minutes with Natalie Chanin]</ref>  \nAlabama Chanin is rooted in the tenets of the [[Slow design]] movement.
