Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.<ref name=\"alaindustrial\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008\u20132018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.<ref name=\"Read\">{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}</ref> In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Alb\u00e0amo'' in different dialects; the plural form is ''Albaamaha'').<ref>{{Cite book |authors=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and [[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archivedate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> The suggestion that \"Alabama\" was borrowed from the [[Choctaw language]] is unlikely.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248152?redirectedFrom=alabama& \"Alabama, n. and adj.\"].

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\n\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.<ref name=\"alaindustrial\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008\u20132018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.<ref name=\"Read\">{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}</ref> In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Alb\u00e0amo'' in different dialects; the plural form is ''Albaamaha'').<ref>{{Cite book |authors=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and [[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archivedate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> The suggestion that \"Alabama\" was borrowed from the [[Choctaw language]] is unlikely.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248152?redirectedFrom=alabama& \"Alabama, n. and adj.\"].

In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.<ref name=\"vra\" />\n\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.<ref name=\"cum\">[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 \"Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)\"/\"Proportional Voting in Alabama\"], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{main|Geography of Alabama}}\n{{See also|List of Alabama counties|Geology of Alabama}}\n[[File:Map of Alabama terrain NA.jpg|thumb|right| ]]\n\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with {{convert|52419|sqmi|km2|abbr=out|sp=us}} of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=n&_lang=en&mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_GCTPH1R_US9S&format=US-9S&_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1-R&ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&geo_id=01000US |title= GCT-PH1-R.

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\n\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

Sookie's world is turned upside down when she falls in love with 173-year-old vampire [[Bill Compton (The Southern Vampire Mysteries)|Bill Compton]] ([[Stephen Moyer]]), and for the first time, she must navigate the trials and terrors of intimacy and relationships.<ref name=\"HBO roles with\" /><ref name=\"Ball bringing\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i0181f5a5ab18b1585b313d1d7524c51a |title=Ball bringing new 'Blood' to HBO |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=August 10, 2007 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080410175109/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i0181f5a5ab18b1585b313d1d7524c51a <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = April 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe show was broadcast on the premium cable network [[HBO]], in the United States, and was produced by HBO in association with Ball's production company, Your Face Goes Here Entertainment.<ref name=\"HBO roles with\">{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117969971.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |title=HBO rolls with Ball's 'True Blood' |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |last=Schneider |first=Michael |date=August 9, 2007 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]}}</ref> The series premiered on September 7, 2008 and concluded on August 24, 2014, comprising seven seasons and 80 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/07/true-blood-renewed-season-7-hbo/# |title=HBO Renews True Blood for Seventh Season |publisher=Daily Dead |date= |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.screenspy.com/industrynews/true-blood-to-end-its-run-in-2014/|title = True Blood to End its Run in 2014|last = The Screen Spy Team|date = September 3, 2013|publisher = Screen Spy}}</ref> The first five seasons received highly positive reviews, and both nominations and wins for several awards, including a [[Golden Globe]] and an [[Emmy]].\n\n==Series overview==\n{{Main|List of True Blood episodes}}\n{{:List of True Blood episodes}}\nThe [[fictional universe]] depicted in the series is premised on the notion that [[vampire]]s exist, unbeknownst to the majority of humans until two years before the series premiere, when the creation of synthetic blood (\"Tru Blood\") by Japanese scientists, which eliminated vampires' need for human blood to survive, allowed vampires to \"come out of the coffin\" and reveal their existence to the world.{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} This so-called \"Great Revelation\" has split vampires into two camps: those who wish to integrate into human society (i.e., \"mainstream\") by campaigning for citizenship and equal rights,{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} and those who think human-vampire co-existence is impossible, because it conflicts with the inherently predatory and violent nature of vampires. It has also caused similar divisions amongst non-vampires; some believe that vampires should be accepted and granted rights, while others view them as monsters to be destroyed. Throughout the series, other [[supernatural]] creatures are introduced, among them [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifters]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[Fairy|faeries]], [[Witchcraft|witches]], and a [[maenad]].\n\nThe series revolves around Sookie Stackhouse ([[Anna Paquin]]), a [[telepathy|telepathic]] human-faerie hybrid known as a halfling (not to be confused with similarly named, but unrelated [[halfling|creatures]] found in other fantasy works). Sookie is a waitress at Merlotte's Bar and Grill, owned by [[Sam Merlotte]] ([[Sam Trammell]]) in the small [[Louisiana]] town of Bon Temps. Sam is a shapeshifter, though this secret is kept hidden from most of the town. Other characters include [[Bill Compton (The Southern Vampire Mysteries)|Bill Compton]] ([[Stephen Moyer]]), a 173-year-old vampire who has returned to Bon Temps to take up residence in his former home following the death of his last remaining relative; [[Tara Thornton]] ([[Rutina Wesley]]), Sookie's tough-talking but insecure best friend; [[Jason Stackhouse|Jason]] ([[Ryan Kwanten]]), Sookie's womanizing brother; [[Eric Northman]] ([[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]]), a 1000-year-old vampire and Sheriff of Area 5; and [[Lafayette Reynolds]] ([[Nelsan Ellis]]), a [[short order cook]], drug dealer, road crew member, and [[medium (spirituality)|medium]].\n\nThe show explores several contemporary issues such as the struggle for equal rights, discrimination, and violence against minorities and homosexuals, the problems of drug addiction, the power of faith and religion, the control/influence of the media, the quest for identity, and the importance of family.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development history===\nSeries creator [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]] had previously worked with the cable channel HBO on ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', which ran for five seasons. In October 2005, after ''Six Feet Under'' wrapped, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and produce original programming for the network. ''True Blood'' became the first project under the deal after Ball became acquainted with [[Charlaine Harris]]'s Southern Vampire Mystery books.<ref name=\"press release\">{{cite press release |title= Concludes Exclusive Two-Year Television Deal with ''Six Feet Under'' Creator Alan Ball |publisher= [[Time Warner]], of which HBO is a subsidiary |date=October 31, 2005 |url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1124432,00.html |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> One day, while early for a dental appointment, Ball was browsing through a [[Barnes & Noble]] bookshop and came across ''[[Dead Until Dark]]'' (2001), the first installment in Harris' series.

Though the series is based in the fictional town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, a noticeable number of the actors comprising the cast are originally from outside the United States. In an interview, Ball explained that he didn't intentionally seek out \"non-American\" actors, but was willing to go anywhere he needed to in order \"to find the actor who makes the character breathe\". Ball went on to explain that, in casting, there was more of a focus on who would portray the character in a compelling way rather than who would physically resemble the characters from the book. Noting that there's a definite difference between the characters and storylines portrayed in ''True Blood'' and the ones depicted in ''The Southern Vampire Mysteries'', he described Harris as being very understanding in terms of how her work was being reinterpreted.<ref name=\"Futon1\">{{cite news| last=Halterman | first=Jim| title = True Blood's Alan Ball talks sex, violence & vampires|

for characters/actors who get main credits billing, please do not add minor characters -->\nThe major characters of the [[True Blood (season 1)|first season of ''True Blood'']] are introduced among various intertwining plot lines that surround the Bon Temps bar \"Merlotte's\". The show's main protagonist, [[Sookie Stackhouse]] ([[Anna Paquin]]), is a telepath and waitress at Merlotte's.{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} In the opening episode she saves Merlotte's first vampire customer, [[William \"Bill\" Comptom|Bill Compton]] ([[Stephen Moyer]]), when a local couple attempts to drain him of his blood (vampire blood is known on the show as a human narcotic: \"V\" or \"V Juice\").{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} Through the relationship that develops between Sookie and Bill, the viewer progressively learns more about vampire culture and the limitations of vampire physiology (e.g. susceptibility to silver and the sun).\n\nThe major plot of the first season revolves around the murder of several women connected to Sookie's older brother, [[Jason Stackhouse|Jason]] ([[Ryan Kwanten]]).{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} The women murdered include sexual partner Maudette Pickens (Danielle Sapia),{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} on-and-off romantic interest and Merlotte's waitress Dawn Green ([[Lynn Collins]]),{{ref|Mine|E-3}} grandmother [[Adele Stackhouse|Adele]] ([[Lois Smith]]) or simply \"Gran\",{{ref|Sparks|E-5}} and girlfriend [[Characters of True Blood#Amy Burley|Amy Burley]] ([[Lizzy Caplan]]).{{ref|Love Bury|E-11}} Though the viewer is always aware of Jason's innocence in their deaths, Detective [[Characters of True Blood#Andy Bellefleur|Andy Bellefleur]] ([[Chris Bauer]]) targets him as the prime suspect in the investigation he conducts with [[Characters of True Blood#Sheriff Bud Dearborne|Sheriff Bud Dearborne]] ([[William Sanderson]]) to identify their killer.{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} Jason's best friends and co-workers, [[Characters of True Blood#Hoyt Fortenberry|Hoyt Fortenberry]] ([[Jim Parrack]]) and [[Characters of True Blood#Rene Lenier|Rene Lenier]] ([[Michael Raymond-James]]) provide him with support despite the turmoil he encounters.{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} Rene, who becomes engaged to Merlotte's waitress [[Arlene Fowler]] ([[Carrie Preston]]),{{ref|Fourth|E-8}} is eventually exposed as the Bon Temps murderer and is killed in a final confrontation with Sookie.{{ref|You'll Be|E-12}}\n\nA secondary plot in the first season (that later develops as the primary storyline in the second) revolves around Sookie's best friend [[Tara Thornton]] ([[Rutina Wesley]]).{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} In the first episode, Tara is hired as a bartender at Merlotte's by bar owner, shapeshifter,{{ref|Don't Wanna|E-11}} and admirer of Sookie, [[Sam Merlotte]] ([[Sam Trammell]]),{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} with whom Tara later has a brief relationship.{{ref|Mine|E-3}} Tara's cousin [[Characters of True Blood#Lafayette Reynolds|Lafayette Reynolds]] ([[Nelsan Ellis]]) already works as a cook at Merlotte's{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} (in addition to several other jobs that include road crew, prostitute, and drug dealer){{ref|Mine|E-3}} with Andy's cousin and [[Iraq War]] [[veteran]], [[List of True Blood characters#Terry Bellefleur|Terry]] ([[Todd Lowe]]).{{ref|First Taste|E-2}} Tara's story is characterized by her relationship with her [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] and abusive mother [[List of True Blood characters#Lettie Mae Thornton|Lettie Mae]] ([[Adina Porter]]){{ref|First Taste|E-2}} and her own inner \"demons\".{{ref|Wanna Know|E-10}} During the season, Lettie Mae achieves sobriety{{ref|Fourth|E-8}} but Tara's life begins to spin out of control. Kicked out of her home and totaling her car in a drunk driving accident,{{ref|Wanna Know|E-10}} she's taken in by \"social worker\" [[Characters of True Blood#Maryann Forrester|Maryann Forrester]] ([[Michelle Forbes]]).{{ref|Love Bury|E-11}} While staying with Maryann, Tara is introduced to [[List of True Blood characters#Benedict Talley|\"Eggs\" Benedict Talley]] ([[Mehcad Brooks]]), to whom she becomes attracted.{{ref|Love Bury|E-11}}\n\nThe final major plotline of the first season revolves around the elements of vampire society that Sookie and Bill's relationship introduce. While trying to prove her brother's innocence in relation to Maudette and Dawn's murders, Bill takes Sookie to the vampire bar \"Fangtasia\" to investigate. There, Sookie is introduced to Fangtasia's owner and the vampire sheriff of \"Area 5\" in Louisiana: [[Eric Northman]] ([[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]]).{{ref|Dragon House|E-4}} Eric is immediately interested in Sookie and her strange abilities, but his progeny and assistant [[Pamela Swynford De Beaufort|Pam]] ([[Kristin Bauer]]) is less impressed.{{ref|Dragon House|E-4}} Eric employs Sookie to find a thief in his bar, but the perpetrator (a vampire named Longshadow) attempts to kill Sookie when she reveals his identity. Bill stakes and kills the thief to save her, but has committed a serious crime in killing another vampire.{{ref|Fourth|E-8}} When Bill is tried for his crime, his punishment is to transform seventeen-year-old [[Jessica Hamby]] ([[Deborah Ann Woll]]) into a vampire to replace the one he destroyed.{{ref|Wanna Know|E-10}}\n\nA secondary plotline introduced in the first season (which later becomes a main plotline in Season 2) is that although many humans are attracted to vampires (referred to as \"fang bangers\") and flock to establishments like Fangtasia, not all people are accepting of the idea that vampires should be given rights equal to those afforded the mortals of the ''True Blood'' universe. During the first season, one of the ways in which anti-vampire sentiment is expressed is through regular televised appearances by the \"Fellowship of the Sun\",{{ref|First Taste|E-2}} a Dallas-based church that in Season 2 becomes headed by the [[Characters of True Blood#Steve Newlin|Reverend Steve Newlin]] ([[Michael McMillian]]){{ref|Mine|E-3}} after his father and family are killed in a strange \"accident\".{{ref|First Taste|E-2}}\n\nDuring the [[True Blood (season 2)|second season of ''True Blood'']], the influence of Maryann Forrester and the conflict between vampires and humans is expanded. Most of the cast from the first season returns and several new main characters are introduced. The same style of interconnected storytelling used in the first season is repeated, with the foremost plot focusing on Maryann Forrester being revealed as a [[maenad]]{{ref|Release|E-19}} with the power to influence humans.{{ref|Scratches|E-15}} She begins by manipulating Tara and Eggs to achieve her goal of summoning her god to earth,{{ref|Timebomb|E-20}} and eventually takes control of almost the entire population of Bon Temps.{{ref|New World|E-22}}\n\nWhile Maryann begins establishing her hold on Bon Temps, Sookie is recruited by Eric{{ref|Scratches|E-15}} to investigate the disappearance of his two-thousand-year-old maker and the Sheriff of Area 9 in Texas: [[List of True Blood Characters#Godric|Godric]] ([[Allan Hyde]]).{{ref|Never Let|E-17}} While Sookie is absent from Bon Temps, Sam hires [[Characters of True Blood#Daphne Landry|Daphne Landry]] ([[Ashley Jones]]) to join Merlotte's staff.{{ref|Nothing but|E-13}} Daphne (who is revealed to also be a shapeshifter{{ref|Never Let|E-17}}) begins a romance with Sam,{{ref|Fingerpop|E-16}} but is later exposed as working for Maryann.{{ref|Hannah|E-18}} Jason also leaves Bon Temps for Dallas to join the Fellowship of the Sun,{{ref|Party Going|E-14}} which Reverend Newlin has steered in a new militant direction despite the protestations of his wife [[Characters of True Blood#Sarah Newlin|Sarah]] ([[Anna Camp]]).{{ref|Nothing but|E-13}} Godric is discovered in the custody of the Fellowship,{{ref|Never Let|E-17}} and one of Godric's lieutenants, [[List of True Blood characters#Isabel Beaumont|Isabel Beaumont]] ([[Valerie Cruz]]),{{ref|Never Let|E-17}} sends her human boyfriend Hugo ([[Christopher Gartin]]){{ref|Hannah|E-18}} to assist Sookie in infiltrating the church. Though Eric's primary interest in Dallas is finding Godric, he also attempts to place himself between Sookie and Bill. To accomplish this, he enlists the aid of Bill's maker [[Characters of True Blood#Lorena|Lorena]] ([[Mariana Klaveno]]);{{ref|Never Let|E-17}}, who thus becomes a more prominent contribution to the cast after a brief introduction in the first season.{{ref|Sparks|E-5}} In the penultimate episode of the second season, once the conflict in Texas is concluded, the vampire queen of Louisiana [[Sophie-Anne Leclerq]] ([[Evan Rachel Wood]]) is introduced.{{ref|Frenzy|E-23}} Both Bill and Eric visit her in an attempt to find out how to defeat Maryann.{{ref|Frenzy|E-23}} Bill uses the information provided by Sophie-Anne to devise a plan involving Sam and Sookie, and the three manage to kill Maryann in the season two finale. Subsequently, Bill takes Sookie out to an exclusive French restaurant to propose to her. However, before she can give her answer, Bill is kidnapped.\n\nSeason three picks up straight after the events of season two with Sookie on the hunt to track down Bill and his kidnappers.

Maudette Pickens and Dawn Green are both strangled shortly after having been alone with him.. Though Detective Bellefleur has little doubt that Jason is the killer, the town sheriff does not suspect him. Sookie's grandmother is murdered shortly afterward. After the murders, Jason becomes addicted to vampire blood and has a short relationship with another addict, Amy Burley, which ends when she is murdered as well. The season also focuses on Sookie's relationship with Bill and Sam's relationship with Sookie's friend Tara. Bill explains the rules of being a vampire to Sookie and, after killing a vampire to defend her, is forced to \"turn\" a young girl named Jessica into a vampire as punishment. The immature Jessica is left under Bill's care and starts to grow up both as a vampire and as a person. In the end, it is revealed that Arlene Fowler's fianc\u00e9, Rene Lenier, has been killing women who associate with vampires. Further, he is actually a man named Drew Marshall who created a false identity, complete with a fake Cajun accent. The season ends with the discovery of a body in Detective Andy Bellefleur's car in Merlotte's parking lot.\n\n===Season 2 (2009)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 2)}}\nThe second season loosely follows the plot of the second novel of ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries]]'', ''[[Living Dead in Dallas]]''. In addition, the character of [[Sophie-Anne Leclerq]], initially introduced in the sixth novel ''[[Definitely Dead]]'', was introduced as a major supporting character. The main theme of the season involves the disappearance of [[Godric(True Blood Tv Series)|Godric]], the 2,000-year-old vampire Sheriff of Area 9. [[Eric Northman|Eric]] enlists Sookie and Bill's aid in finding the ancient vampire in Dallas. Their paths cross Jason's as he seeks to discover meaning in his life with the Fellowship of the Sun, a church dedicated to anti-vampire activities. A second theme concerns a [[maenad]] named [[Characters of True Blood#Maryann Forrester|Maryann]] who visits Bon Temps after [[Characters of True Blood#Tara Thornton|Tara]] attracts her attention at the end of the first season. Maryann is a figure from [[Characters of True Blood#Sam Merlotte|Sam]]'s past and knows his true identity as a shapeshifter. Her influence on the town and its residents results in mayhem that grows more destructive as the season progresses. At the end of the season, Bill proposes to Sookie but is kidnapped by unknown assailants when Sookie retreats to the bathroom to consider his proposal.\n\n===Season 3 (2010)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 3)}}\nSeason three loosely follows the plot of the third novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, ''[[Club Dead]]'', and introduces [[werewolves]] to the show's mythology through Alcide, a werewolf hired by Eric to help Sookie find Bill. It also introduces the characters of [[List of True Blood characters#Russell Edgington|Russell Edgington]], the Vampire King of Mississippi, who wishes to overturn the Vampire Authority. In addition, some characters from the fourth novel ''[[Dead to the World (novel)|Dead to the World]]'' are introduced: [[List of The Southern Vampire Mysteries characters#Stackhouse|Crystal Norris]] as Jason's love interest, her family of [[werecat|werepanthers]] from Hotshot, and Sookie's \"faerie godmother\", Claudine. Sookie's heritage as part [[faerie]] is also revealed later in the season, a major plot element from the eighth and ninth novels ''[[From Dead to Worse]]'' and ''[[Dead and Gone (novel)|Dead and Gone]]''. This season ends with Jason left to take care of the werepanthers of Hotshot, Tara leaving Bon Temps after a traumatic experience with a vampire, Sookie discovering that Bill was first sent to Bon Temps by the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, Sam shooting his brother, Tommy, and Hoyt and Jessica moving in together. The final cliffhanger involves Claudine taking Sookie away to the land of Faerie.\n\n===Season 4 (2011)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 4)}}\nA coven of witches, led by Marnie, poses a threat to vampires when they discover the witches are working on necromancy. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a year (even though for her she was away for only a few minutes in Faerie) to find Bill as the new King of Louisiana and that her brother and friends had given up hope of finding her. As the series progresses, a powerful necromancer from the 16th century, Antonia, possesses the body of Marnie in order to exact revenge on all vampires. Sookie starts a romance with Eric who has amnesia due to a spell cast by Antonia/Marnie. The witch Antonia eventually realizes the wrongdoing she's caused to innocent people and decides to stop. Yet Marnie, addicted to Antonia's power, binds her against her will to acquire her powers. Subplots include Lafayette's introduction to the world of magic and his abilities as a medium, Sam's family troubles, Alcide and Debbie's troubled relationship, and Jason, Hoyt and Jessica's love triangle. The finale is a series of cliffhangers, including a warning from the ghost of Rene that Terry will cause Arlene trouble, the escape of Russell Edgington, the reappearance of Steve Newlin as a vampire, and the shooting of Tara.\n\n===Season 5 (2012)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 5)}}\nThe season starts with Sookie and Lafayette asking for Pam to turn Tara into a vampire. Bill and Eric are captured by the Vampire Authority for killing Nan Flanagan. The two are almost sentenced to death by the Guardian, Roman, before revealing that Russell Edgington is alive and free after being released by a mysterious vampire. With the help of Sookie, the team discovers his hiding place and brings him in. Russell and his new vampire-companion, Steve Newlin, along with Salome, and Eric's vampire sister, Nora, redefine the values of the Authority and view humans as nothing more than food: just as Lilith of the Vampire bible wanted. Meanwhile, Alcide deals with his troubled rise to pack-master, Terry learns he is death-cursed after committing a terrible crime during the war in [[Iraq]], while Tara learns how to deal with her newly given life as Pam's progeny. Jason and Sookie discover that their parents were murdered by a vampire named Warlow. Hoyt gets involved with a hate group, then decides to leave for Alaska, just as Andy heads towards life as a family man, and Lafayette tries to deal with the powers given to him by Jesus. The season ends with the Authority leadership being wiped out during the True Blood crisis, and Bill drinking the entirety of the sacred vial of Lilith in front of Sookie and Eric. He soon meets the \"true death\", but shortly after, he \"rises from the blood\", as an even more powerful vampire reincarnation of Lilith (\"Billith\").\n\n===Season 6 (2013)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 6)}}\nThe sixth season of ''True Blood'' premiered on June 16, 2013. After Alan Ball's departure from the series at the end of season 5, [[Brian Buckner]] replaced Ball as the show's showrunner. Season six focuses on Bill's abilities after he had drunk Lilith's blood. Sookie and Jason try to find Warlow, the vampire who killed their parents, with a fairy grandfather named Niall who arrives in Bon Temps while a new Louisiana governor leads a platform to eradicate the entire vampire race with Sarah Newlin. Sam and Alcide fight for Emma's safety; Terry struggles to live with himself after having killed Patrick; Andy raises his fairy daughters. Eric decides to turn the governor's daughter into a vampire to convince him to stop his campaign, but she is put into a vampire camp along with Eric, Pam, Jessica, and Tara, where they are all supposed to meet the sun. Bill asks Sookie for help, who is considering becoming Warlow's vampire-fairy bride after discovering her parents tried to kill her when she was young. Both of them go to the vampire camp, where Eric has discovered that Sarah Newlin created a virus that kills vampires, later witnessing Sarah infect Nora in front of him. When the vampires are about to meet the sun, Bill offers his blood to them, allowing them to walk in the daylight. The season finishes six months later where Sookie is dating Alcide, Bill has released a book about the effects of drinking Lilith's blood, and Sam being the mayor of Bon Temps and gibing his bar to Arlene, and a group of infected vampires heading toward the bar.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Sarene Leeds |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/q-a-true-blood-showrunner-brian-buckner-spills-on-season-six-20130610 |title=QA: 'True Blood' Showrunner on Season Six &#124; Movies News |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Season 7 (2014)===\n{{main|True Blood (season 7)}}\nThe seventh and final season premiered on June 22, 2014, with the last episode was airing on August 24, 2014. In this season, Bon Temps is terrorized by a group of vampires infected with the virus created in the previous season. They kill Tara and kidnap Arlene, Holly, and Nicole. Pam travels the world in search of Eric, who is found in France infected by the virus. They meet Sookie, Bill, Jessica, and Alcide in Bon Temps and rescue the people who were kidnapped, which results in Alcide's death and Sookie being infected by the virus and transmitting it to Bill. Eric and Pam search for Sarah Newlin, who supposedly has an antidote for the virus. Several characters encounter closure like Lettie Mae making peace with Tara through visions caused by vampire blood, Jessica and Hoyt getting married after reuniting during the season, Lafayette entering a relationship with Jessica's ex-boyfriend, James, and Sam leaving Bon Temps with Nicole. At the end of the series, Bill refuses to take the antidote to heal himself from the virus and asks Sookie to give him the \"ultimate kindness\". Sookie then strikes Bill's heart with a wooden stick. Pam and Eric successfully sell the new Tru Blood with the antidote. The last scene of the series shows a pregnant Sookie sitting outside on a table full of people beside a mysterious man. They kiss and drink, and everyone around them appears to be happy.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; text-align:center; margin:10px\"\n|+ [[Metacritic]] ratings per season\n|-\n|{{Graph:Chart\n| width = 230\n| height = 150\n| xType = string\n| xAxisTitle = Season\n| x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n| yAxisMax = 100 | yAxisMin = 0 | showSymbols = | yGrid = \n| yAxisTitle = Rating\n| y = 63, 74, 79, 74, 74, 58, 54\n}}\n|-\n|<!-- begin inner table -->\n{| style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=row | Season\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 1)|1]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 2)|2]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 3)|3]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 4)|4]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 5)|5]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 6)|6]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 7)|7]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Rating\n| {{formatnum:63}}<ref name=MetacriticS1>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 1 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/ }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:74}}<ref name=MetacriticS2>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 2 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-2 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:79}}<ref name=MetacriticS3>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 3 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-3 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:74}}<ref name=MetacriticS4>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 4 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-4 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:74}}<ref name=MetacriticS5>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 5 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-5 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:58}}<ref name=MetacriticS6>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 6 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-6 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:54}}<ref name=MetacriticS7>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 7 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-7 }}</ref>\n|}\n<!-- end inner table -->\n|}\n\nThe series has an approval rating of 70 percent on the [[review aggregator]] website Rotten Tomatoes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/true_blood|title=True Blood|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe first season of ''True Blood'' received positive reviews, despite initial impressions being mixed. Linda Stasi of the ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote of the opening episodes: \n\n<blockquote>If HBO's new vampire show is any indication, there would still be countless deaths \u2013 especially among vampire hunters and the viewers who love them \u2013 because everyone would be dying of boredom. And so it is with HBO's new series from death-obsessed Alan Ball, creator of the legendary ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', whose new show ''True Blood'', won't so much make your blood run cold as it will leave you cold.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/09052008/tv/bloody_murder_127515.htm| title = Bloody Murder: It's the normal people who really suck| author = Stasi, Linda| date = September 5, 2008| accessdate=June 13, 2009\n| newspaper = [[New York Post]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' concluded: \n\n<blockquote>Sexy, witty and unabashedly peculiar, ''True Blood'' is a blood-drenched [[Southern Gothic]] romantic parable set in a world where vampires are out and about and campaigning for equal rights. Part mystery, part fantasy, part comedy, and all wildly imaginative exaggeration, ''[True] Blood'' proves that there's still vibrant life \u2014 or death \u2014 left in the '[[star-crossed]] cute lovers' paradigm.

The critical consensus of the season reads, \"''True Blood'' seems to fully understand its appeal, and its third season provides plenty of graphic thrills, steamy romance, and biting satire for its fans.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/true_blood/s03|title=True Blood: Season 3|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], another aggregator of critical responses, found \"generally favorable reviews\" for the first five seasons, with ratings of 63, 74, 79, 74 and 74, respectively.<ref name=MetacriticS1/><ref name=MetacriticS2/><ref name=MetacriticS3/><ref name=MetacriticS4/><ref name=MetacriticS5/>\n\nThe sixth season, notable for being the first of the series not to have [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]] as showrunner, was met with mixed reviews in contrast to the acclaim of the previous five seasons. Many critics noted the decreasing quality of the scripts and production values. In his review, Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' remarked:\n<blockquote>People can debate when \u201c''True Blood''\u2019s\u201d creative rigor mortis officially set in \u2014 somewhere during that stretch when the show began piling one supernatural creature upon another (werewolves and witches and faeries, oh my!) \u2014 but suffice it to say this once-significant and hugely lucrative HBO series limps into its seventh and final season looking pretty anemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/reviews/tv-review-true-blood-1201218816/|title=TV Review: 'True Blood'|first=Brian|last=Lowry|website=Variety|date=June 18, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe sixth and seven seasons each received an approval rating of 44% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the critical consensus of season six reading: \"A major letdown coming off the end of season five, ''True Blood'' seems to be running out of steam and isn't aging as elegantly as its eternal vampires.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/true_blood/s06|title=True Blood: Season 6|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/true_blood/s07|title=True Blood: Season 7|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> On Metacritic, the sixth season rated 58, while the seventh 54, both indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"<ref name=MetacriticS6/><ref name=MetacriticS7/>\n\nThe cast received positive reviews for their performances, with praise going to the performances of [[Anna Paquin]] and [[Nelsan Ellis]]. For the first season, [[Anna Paquin]] won the Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series \u2013 Drama [[Golden Globe]] at the [[66th Golden Globe Awards]]; she was also nominated the next year and won the [[Saturn Award]] for Best Actress in a Series, Drama at the [[13th Satellite Awards]], a ceremony in which [[Nelsan Ellis]] also won Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film. [[Stephen Moyer]] won the award for Best Actor on Television at the 2010 ceremony.\n\n===Cultural influence===\n''True Blood'' was the subject of a ''Sesame Street'' sketch parody titled \"True Mud\" (2010), featuring puppet versions of Sookie, Bill, Lafayette, Sam, Tara, and Sheriff Dearborn.

It has also caused similar divisions amongst non-vampires; some believe that vampires should be accepted and granted rights, while others view them as monsters to be destroyed. Throughout the series, other [[supernatural]] creatures are introduced, among them [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifters]], [[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[Fairy|faeries]], [[Witchcraft|witches]], and a [[maenad]].\n\nThe series revolves around Sookie Stackhouse ([[Anna Paquin]]), a [[telepathy|telepathic]] human-faerie hybrid known as a halfling (not to be confused with similarly named, but unrelated [[halfling|creatures]] found in other fantasy works). Sookie is a waitress at Merlotte's Bar and Grill, owned by [[Sam Merlotte]] ([[Sam Trammell]]) in the small [[Louisiana]] town of Bon Temps. Sam is a shapeshifter, though this secret is kept hidden from most of the town. Other characters include [[Bill Compton (The Southern Vampire Mysteries)|Bill Compton]] ([[Stephen Moyer]]), a 173-year-old vampire who has returned to Bon Temps to take up residence in his former home following the death of his last remaining relative; [[Tara Thornton]] ([[Rutina Wesley]]), Sookie's tough-talking but insecure best friend; [[Jason Stackhouse|Jason]] ([[Ryan Kwanten]]), Sookie's womanizing brother; [[Eric Northman]] ([[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]]), a 1000-year-old vampire and Sheriff of Area 5; and [[Lafayette Reynolds]] ([[Nelsan Ellis]]), a [[short order cook]], drug dealer, road crew member, and [[medium (spirituality)|medium]].\n\nThe show explores several contemporary issues such as the struggle for equal rights, discrimination, and violence against minorities and homosexuals, the problems of drug addiction, the power of faith and religion, the control/influence of the media, the quest for identity, and the importance of family.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development history===\nSeries creator [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]] had previously worked with the cable channel HBO on ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', which ran for five seasons. In October 2005, after ''Six Feet Under'' wrapped, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and produce original programming for the network. ''True Blood'' became the first project under the deal after Ball became acquainted with [[Charlaine Harris]]'s Southern Vampire Mystery books.<ref name=\"press release\">{{cite press release |title= Concludes Exclusive Two-Year Television Deal with ''Six Feet Under'' Creator Alan Ball |publisher= [[Time Warner]], of which HBO is a subsidiary |date=October 31, 2005 |url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1124432,00.html |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> One day, while early for a dental appointment, Ball was browsing through a [[Barnes & Noble]] bookshop and came across ''[[Dead Until Dark]]'' (2001), the first installment in Harris' series.

Rebirth is represented by an image of a woman being \"washed clean\" from her sins in a lake, and a preacher blessing and possibly performing an exorcism on a member of his congregation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/2008/11/21/true-blood/ |title=True Blood opening title sequence |publisher=Art of the Title |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=November 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSome of the footage used in the sequence was filmed on location.

Though the series is based in the fictional town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, a noticeable number of the actors comprising the cast are originally from outside the United States. In an interview, Ball explained that he didn't intentionally seek out \"non-American\" actors, but was willing to go anywhere he needed to in order \"to find the actor who makes the character breathe\". Ball went on to explain that, in casting, there was more of a focus on who would portray the character in a compelling way rather than who would physically resemble the characters from the book. Noting that there's a definite difference between the characters and storylines portrayed in ''True Blood'' and the ones depicted in ''The Southern Vampire Mysteries'', he described Harris as being

The show's main protagonist, [[Sookie Stackhouse]] ([[Anna Paquin]]), is a telepath and waitress at Merlotte's.{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} In the opening episode she saves Merlotte's first vampire customer, [[William \"Bill\" Comptom|Bill Compton]] ([[Stephen Moyer]]), when a local couple attempts to drain him of his blood (vampire blood is known on the show as a human narcotic: \"V\" or \"V Juice\").{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} Through the relationship that develops between Sookie and Bill, the viewer progressively learns more about vampire culture and the limitations of vampire physiology (e.g. susceptibility to silver and the sun).\n\nThe major plot of the first season revolves around the murder of several women connected to Sookie's older brother, [[Jason Stackhouse|Jason]] ([[Ryan Kwanten]]).{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} The women murdered include sexual partner Maudette Pickens (Danielle Sapia),{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} on-and-off romantic interest and Merlotte's waitress Dawn Green ([[Lynn Collins]]),{{ref|Mine|E-3}} grandmother [[Adele Stackhouse|Adele]] ([[Lois Smith]]) or simply \"Gran\",{{ref|Sparks|E-5}} and girlfriend [[Characters of True Blood#Amy Burley|Amy Burley]] ([[Lizzy Caplan]]).{{ref|Love Bury|E-11}} Though the viewer is always aware of Jason's innocence in their deaths, Detective [[Characters of True Blood#Andy Bellefleur|Andy Bellefleur]] ([[Chris Bauer]]) targets him as the prime suspect in the investigation he conducts with [[Characters of True Blood#Sheriff Bud Dearborne|Sheriff Bud Dearborne]] ([[William Sanderson]]) to identify their killer.{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} Jason's best friends and co-workers, [[Characters of True Blood#Hoyt Fortenberry|Hoyt Fortenberry]] ([[Jim Parrack]]) and [[Characters of True Blood#Rene Lenier|Rene Lenier]] ([[Michael Raymond-James]]) provide him with support despite the turmoil he encounters.{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} Rene, who becomes engaged to Merlotte's waitress [[Arlene Fowler]] ([[Carrie Preston]]),{{ref|Fourth|E-8}} is eventually exposed as the Bon Temps murderer and is killed in a final confrontation with Sookie.{{ref|You'll Be|E-12}}\n\nA secondary plot in the first season (that later develops as the primary storyline in the second) revolves around Sookie's best friend [[Tara Thornton]] ([[Rutina Wesley]]).{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} In the first episode, Tara is hired as a bartender at Merlotte's by bar owner, shapeshifter,{{ref|Don't Wanna|E-11}} and admirer of Sookie, [[Sam Merlotte]] ([[Sam Trammell]]),{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} with whom Tara later has a brief relationship.{{ref|Mine|E-3}} Tara's cousin [[Characters of True Blood#Lafayette Reynolds|Lafayette Reynolds]] ([[Nelsan Ellis]]) already works as a cook at Merlotte's{{ref|Strange Love|E-1}} (in addition to several other jobs that include road crew, prostitute, and drug dealer){{ref|Mine|E-3}} with Andy's cousin and [[Iraq War]] [[veteran]], [[List of True Blood characters#Terry Bellefleur|Terry]] ([[Todd Lowe]]).{{ref|First Taste|E-2}} Tara's story is characterized by her relationship with her [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] and abusive mother [[List of True Blood characters#Lettie Mae Thornton|Lettie Mae]] ([[Adina Porter]]){{ref|First Taste|E-2}} and her own inner \"demons\".{{ref|Wanna Know|E-10}} During the season, Lettie Mae achieves sobriety{{ref|Fourth|E-8}} but Tara's life begins to spin out of control.

While trying to prove her brother's innocence in relation to Maudette and Dawn's murders, Bill takes Sookie to the vampire bar \"Fangtasia\" to investigate. There, Sookie is introduced to Fangtasia's owner and the vampire sheriff of \"Area 5\" in Louisiana: [[Eric Northman]] ([[Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd]]).{{ref|Dragon House|E-4}} Eric is immediately interested in Sookie and her strange abilities, but his progeny and assistant [[Pamela Swynford De Beaufort|Pam]] ([[Kristin Bauer]]) is less impressed.{{ref|Dragon House|E-4}} Eric employs Sookie to find a thief in his bar, but the perpetrator (a vampire named Longshadow) attempts to kill Sookie when she reveals his identity. Bill stakes and kills the thief to save her, but has committed a serious crime in killing another vampire.{{ref|Fourth|E-8}} When Bill is tried for his crime, his punishment is to transform seventeen-year-old [[Jessica Hamby]] ([[Deborah Ann Woll]]) into a vampire to replace the one he destroyed.{{ref|Wanna Know|E-10}}\n\nA secondary plotline introduced in the first season (which later becomes a main plotline in Season 2) is that although many humans are attracted to vampires (referred to as \"fang bangers\") and flock to establishments like Fangtasia, not all people are accepting of the idea that vampires should be given rights equal to those afforded the mortals of the ''True Blood'' universe. During the first season, one of the ways in which anti-vampire sentiment is expressed is through regular televised appearances by the \"Fellowship of the Sun\",{{ref|First Taste|E-2}} a Dallas-based church that in Season 2 becomes headed by the [[Characters of True Blood#Steve Newlin|Reverend Steve Newlin]] ([[Michael McMillian]]){{ref|Mine|E-3}} after his father and family are killed in a strange \"accident\".{{ref|First Taste|E-2}}\n\nDuring the [[True Blood (season 2)|second season of ''True Blood'']], the influence of Maryann Forrester and the conflict between vampires and humans is expanded. Most of the cast from the first season returns and several new main characters are introduced. The same style of interconnected storytelling used in the first season is repeated, with the foremost plot focusing on Maryann Forrester being revealed as a [[maenad]]{{ref|Release|E-19}} with the power to influence humans.{{ref|Scratches|E-15}} She begins by manipulating Tara and Eggs to achieve her goal of summoning her god to earth,{{ref|Timebomb|E-20}} and eventually takes control of almost the entire population of Bon Temps.{{ref|New World|E-22}}\n\nWhile Maryann begins establishing her hold on Bon Temps, Sookie is recruited by Eric{{ref|Scratches|E-15}} to investigate the disappearance of his two-thousand-year-old maker and the Sheriff of Area 9 in Texas: [[List of True Blood Characters#Godric|Godric]] ([[Allan Hyde]]).{{ref|Never Let|E-17}} While Sookie is absent from Bon Temps, Sam hires [[Characters of True Blood#Daphne Landry|Daphne Landry]] ([[Ashley Jones]]) to join Merlotte's staff.{{ref|Nothing but|E-13}} Daphne (who is revealed to also be a shapeshifter{{ref|Never Let|E-17}}) begins a romance with Sam,{{ref|Fingerpop|E-16}} but is later exposed as working for Maryann.{{ref|Hannah|E-18}} Jason also leaves Bon Temps for Dallas to join the Fellowship of the Sun,{{ref|Party Going|E-14}} which Reverend Newlin has steered in a new militant direction despite the protestations of his wife [[Characters of True Blood#Sarah Newlin|Sarah]] ([[Anna Camp]]).{{ref|Nothing but|E-13}} Godric is discovered in the custody of the Fellowship,{{ref|Never Let|E-17}} and one of Godric's lieutenants, [[List of True Blood characters#Isabel Beaumont|Isabel Beaumont]] ([[Valerie Cruz]]),{{ref|Never Let|E-17}} sends her human boyfriend Hugo ([[Christopher Gartin]]){{ref|Hannah|E-18}} to assist Sookie in infiltrating the church. Though Eric's primary interest in Dallas is finding Godric, he also attempts to place himself between Sookie and Bill. To accomplish this, he enlists the aid of Bill's maker [[Characters of True Blood#Lorena|Lorena]] ([[Mariana Klaveno]]);{{ref|Never Let|E-17}}, who thus becomes a more prominent contribution to the cast after a brief introduction in the first season.{{ref|Sparks|E-5}} In the penultimate episode of the second season, once the conflict in Texas is concluded, the vampire queen of Louisiana [[Sophie-Anne Leclerq]] ([[Evan Rachel Wood]]) is introduced.{{ref|Frenzy|E-23}} Both Bill and Eric visit her in an attempt to find out how to defeat Maryann.{{ref|Frenzy|E-23}} Bill uses the information provided by Sophie-Anne to devise a plan involving Sam and Sookie, and the three manage to kill Maryann in the season two finale. Subsequently, Bill takes Sookie out to an exclusive French restaurant to propose to her. However, before she can give her answer, Bill is kidnapped.\n\nSeason three picks up straight after the events of season two with Sookie on the hunt to track down Bill and his kidnappers. She turns to Eric for help, who is not interested (seeing this turn of events as a chance to get Sookie for himself), but he ends up sending werewolf [[Alcide Herveaux]] ([[Joe Manganiello]]) for assistance after it is revealed that Bill was taken by V-addicted werewolves in the employ of the 3000-year-old vampire king of Mississippi, [[List of True Blood characters#Seasonal antagonists|Russell Edgington]] ([[Denis O'Hare]]). Meanwhile, back in Bon Temps, Lafayette embarks on a relationship with his mother's care nurse and [[Brujer\u00eda|brujo]] [[List of True Blood characters|Jes\u00fas Velasquez]] ([[Kevin Alejandro]]) and learns about his own special powers as a medium, while Sam hires a new waitress at Merlotte's, Wiccan Holly Cleary ([[Lauren Bowles]]).\n\nIn season 4, [[Jessica Tuck]] ([[List of True Blood characters#Nan Flanagan|Nan Flanagan]]) and [[Janina Gavankar]] (Luna) became season regulars. [[Alexandra Breckenridge]] (Kate) and Vedette Lim (Naomi) became recurring actresses.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tvguide.com/News/True-Blood-Tuck-1026065.aspx|title= True Blood Promotes Jessica Tuck; Adds Three New Actresses|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nJoining the cast for season five was [[Christopher Meloni]], who previously starred on another of [[HBO]]'s own original series ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'' as well as ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' for 12 years.

Maudette Pickens and Dawn Green are both strangled shortly after having been alone with him.. Though Detective Bellefleur has little doubt that Jason is the killer, the town sheriff does not suspect him. Sookie's grandmother is murdered shortly afterward. After the murders, Jason becomes addicted to vampire blood and has a short relationship with another addict, Amy Burley, which ends when she is murdered as well. The season also focuses on Sookie's relationship with Bill and Sam's relationship with Sookie's friend Tara. Bill explains the rules of being a vampire to Sookie and, after killing a vampire to defend her, is forced to \"turn\" a young girl named Jessica into a vampire as punishment. The immature Jessica is left under Bill's care and starts to grow up both as a vampire and as a person. In the end, it is revealed that Arlene Fowler's fianc\u00e9, Rene Lenier, has been killing women who associate with vampires. Further, he is actually a man named Drew Marshall who created a false identity, complete with a fake Cajun accent. The season ends with the discovery of a body in Detective Andy Bellefleur's car in Merlotte's parking lot.\n\n===Season 2 (2009)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 2)}}\nThe second season loosely follows the plot of the second novel of ''[[The Southern Vampire Mysteries]]'', ''[[Living Dead in Dallas]]''. In addition, the character of [[Sophie-Anne Leclerq]], initially introduced in the sixth novel ''[[Definitely Dead]]'', was introduced as a major supporting character. The main theme of the season involves the disappearance of [[Godric(True Blood Tv Series)|Godric]], the 2,000-year-old vampire Sheriff of Area 9. [[Eric Northman|Eric]] enlists Sookie and Bill's aid in finding the ancient vampire in Dallas. Their paths cross Jason's as he seeks to discover meaning in his life with the Fellowship of the Sun, a church dedicated to anti-vampire activities. A second theme concerns a [[maenad]] named [[Characters of True Blood#Maryann Forrester|Maryann]] who visits Bon Temps after [[Characters of True Blood#Tara Thornton|Tara]] attracts her attention at the end of the first season. Maryann is a figure from [[Characters of True Blood#Sam Merlotte|Sam]]'s past and knows his true identity as a shapeshifter. Her influence on the town and its residents results in mayhem that grows more destructive as the season progresses. At the end of the season, Bill proposes to Sookie but is kidnapped by unknown assailants when Sookie retreats to the bathroom to consider his proposal.\n\n===Season 3 (2010)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 3)}}\nSeason three loosely follows the plot of the third novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, ''[[Club Dead]]'', and introduces [[werewolves]] to the show's mythology through Alcide, a werewolf hired by Eric to help Sookie find Bill. It also introduces the characters of [[List of True Blood characters#Russell Edgington|Russell Edgington]], the Vampire King of Mississippi, who wishes to overturn the Vampire Authority. In addition, some characters from the fourth novel ''[[Dead to the World (novel)|Dead to the World]]'' are introduced: [[List of The Southern Vampire Mysteries characters#Stackhouse|Crystal Norris]] as Jason's love interest, her family of [[werecat|werepanthers]] from Hotshot, and Sookie's \"faerie godmother\", Claudine. Sookie's heritage as part [[faerie]] is also revealed later in the season, a major plot element from the eighth and ninth novels ''[[From Dead to Worse]]'' and ''[[Dead and Gone (novel)|Dead and Gone]]''. This season ends with Jason left to take care of the werepanthers of Hotshot, Tara leaving Bon Temps after a traumatic experience with a vampire, Sookie discovering that Bill was first sent to Bon Temps by the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, Sam shooting his brother, Tommy, and Hoyt and Jessica moving in together. The final cliffhanger involves Claudine taking Sookie away to the land of Faerie.\n\n===Season 4 (2011)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 4)}}\nA coven of witches, led by Marnie, poses a threat to vampires when they discover the witches are working on necromancy. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a year (even though for her she was away for only a few minutes in Faerie) to find Bill as the new King of Louisiana and that her brother and friends had given up hope of finding her. As the series progresses, a powerful necromancer from the 16th century, Antonia, possesses the body of Marnie in order to exact revenge on all vampires. Sookie starts a romance with Eric who has amnesia due to a spell cast by Antonia/Marnie. The witch Antonia eventually realizes the wrongdoing she's caused to innocent people and decides to stop. Yet Marnie, addicted to Antonia's power, binds her against her will to acquire her powers. Subplots include Lafayette's introduction to the world of magic and his abilities as a medium, Sam's family troubles, Alcide and Debbie's troubled relationship, and Jason, Hoyt and Jessica's love triangle. The finale is a series of cliffhangers, including a warning from the ghost of Rene that Terry will cause Arlene trouble, the escape of Russell Edgington, the reappearance of Steve Newlin as a vampire, and the shooting of Tara.\n\n===Season 5 (2012)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 5)}}\nThe season starts with Sookie and Lafayette asking for Pam to turn Tara into a vampire. Bill and Eric are captured by the Vampire Authority for killing Nan Flanagan. The two are almost sentenced to death by the Guardian, Roman, before revealing that Russell Edgington is alive and free after being released by a mysterious vampire. With the help of Sookie, the team discovers his hiding place and brings him in. Russell and his new vampire-companion, Steve Newlin, along with Salome, and Eric's vampire sister, Nora, redefine the values of the Authority and view humans as nothing more than food: just as Lilith of the Vampire bible wanted. Meanwhile, Alcide deals with his troubled rise to pack-master, Terry learns he is death-cursed after committing a terrible crime during the war in [[Iraq]], while Tara learns how to deal with her newly given life as Pam's progeny. Jason and Sookie discover that their parents were murdered by a vampire named Warlow. Hoyt gets involved with a hate group, then decides to leave for Alaska, just as Andy heads towards life as a family man, and Lafayette tries to deal with the powers given to him by Jesus. The season ends with the Authority leadership being wiped out during the True Blood crisis, and Bill drinking the entirety of the sacred vial of Lilith in front of Sookie and Eric. He soon meets the \"true death\", but shortly after, he \"rises from the blood\", as an even more powerful vampire reincarnation of Lilith (\"Billith\").\n\n===Season 6 (2013)===\n{{Main|True Blood (season 6)}}\nThe sixth season of ''True Blood'' premiered on June 16, 2013. After Alan Ball's departure from the series at the end of season 5, [[Brian Buckner]] replaced Ball as the show's showrunner. Season six focuses on Bill\u2019s abilities after he had drunk Lilith's blood. Sookie and Jason try to find Warlow, the vampire who killed their parents, with a fairy grandfather named Niall who arrives in Bon Temps while a new Louisiana governor leads a platform to eradicate the entire vampire race with Sarah Newlin. Sam and Alcide fight for Emma\u2019s safety; Terry struggles to live with himself after having killed Patrick; Andy raises his fairy daughters. Eric decides to turn the governor\u2019s daughter into a vampire to convince him to stop his campaign, but she is put into a vampire camp along with Eric, Pam, Jessica, and Tara, where they are all supposed to meet the sun. Bill asks Sookie for help, who is considering becoming Warlow\u2019s vampire-fairy bride after discovering her parents tried to kill her when she was young. Both of them go to the vampire camp, where Eric has discovered that Sarah Newlin created a virus that kills vampires, later witnessing Sarah infect Nora in front of him. When the vampires are about to meet the sun, Bill offers his blood to them, allowing them to walk in the daylight. The season finishes six months later where Sookie is dating Alcide, Bill has released a book about the effects of drinking Lilith's blood, and Sam being the mayor of Bon Temps and gibing his bar to Arlene, and a group of infected vampires heading toward the bar.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Sarene Leeds |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/q-a-true-blood-showrunner-brian-buckner-spills-on-season-six-20130610 |title=QA: 'True Blood' Showrunner on Season Six &#124; Movies News |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Season 7 (2014)===\n{{main|True Blood (season 7)}}\nThe seventh and final season premiered on June 22, 2014, with the last episode was airing on August 24, 2014. In this season, Bon Temps is terrorized by a group of vampires infected with the virus created in the previous season. They kill Tara and kidnap Arlene, Holly, and Nicole. Pam travels the world in search of Eric, who is found in France infected by the virus. They meet Sookie, Bill, Jessica, and Alcide in Bon Temps and rescue the people who were kidnapped, which results in Alcide's death and Sookie being infected by the virus and transmitting it to Bill. Eric and Pam search for Sarah Newlin, who supposedly has an antidote for the virus. Several characters encounter closure like Lettie Mae making peace with Tara through visions caused by vampire blood, Jessica and Hoyt getting married after reuniting during the season, Lafayette entering a relationship with Jessica's ex-boyfriend, James, and Sam leaving Bon Temps with Nicole. At the end of the series, Bill refuses to take the antidote to heal himself from the virus and asks Sookie to give him the \"ultimate kindness\". Sookie then strikes Bill's heart with a wooden stick. Pam and Eric successfully sell the new Tru Blood with the antidote. The last scene of the series shows a pregnant Sookie sitting outside on a table full of people beside a mysterious man. They kiss and drink, and everyone around them appears to be happy.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; text-align:center; margin:10px\"\n|+ [[Metacritic]] ratings per season\n|-\n|{{Graph:Chart\n| width = 230\n| height = 150\n| xType = string\n| xAxisTitle = Season\n| x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n| yAxisMax = 100 | yAxisMin = 0 | showSymbols = | yGrid = \n| yAxisTitle = Rating\n| y = 63, 74, 79, 74, 74, 58, 54\n}}\n|-\n|<!-- begin inner table -->\n{| style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=row | Season\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 1)|1]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 2)|2]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 3)|3]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 4)|4]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 5)|5]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 6)|6]]\n| scope=col | [[True Blood (season 7)|7]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Rating\n| {{formatnum:63}}<ref name=MetacriticS1>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 1 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/ }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:74}}<ref name=MetacriticS2>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 2 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-2 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:79}}<ref name=MetacriticS3>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 3 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-3 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:74}}<ref name=MetacriticS4>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 4 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-4 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:74}}<ref name=MetacriticS5>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 5 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-5 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:58}}<ref name=MetacriticS6>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 6 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-6 }}</ref>\n| {{formatnum:54}}<ref name=MetacriticS7>{{cite web |title=True Blood: Season 7 |website=Metacritic |accessdate=November 27, 2015 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-7 }}</ref>\n|}\n<!-- end inner table -->\n|}\n\nThe series has an approval rating of 70 percent on the [[review aggregator]] website Rotten Tomatoes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/true_blood|title=True Blood|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe first season of ''True Blood'' received positive reviews, despite initial impressions being mixed. Linda Stasi of the ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote of the opening episodes: \n\n<blockquote>If HBO's new vampire show is any indication, there would still be countless deaths \u2013 especially among vampire hunters and the viewers who love them \u2013 because everyone would be dying of boredom. And so it is with HBO's new series from death-obsessed Alan Ball, creator of the legendary ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', whose new show ''True Blood'', won't so much make your blood run cold as it will leave you cold.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.nypost.com/seven/09052008/tv/bloody_murder_127515.htm| title = Bloody Murder: It's the normal people who really suck| author = Stasi, Linda| date = September 5, 2008| accessdate=June 13, 2009\n| newspaper = [[New York Post]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobert Bianco of ''[[USA Today]]'' concluded: \n\n<blockquote>Sexy, witty and unabashedly peculiar, ''True Blood'' is a blood-drenched [[Southern Gothic]] romantic parable set in a world where vampires are out and about and campaigning for equal rights. Part mystery, part fantasy, part comedy, and all wildly imaginative exaggeration, ''[True] Blood'' proves that there's still vibrant life \u2014 or death \u2014 left in the '[[star-crossed]] cute lovers' paradigm.

The critical consensus of the season reads, \"''True Blood'' seems to fully understand its appeal, and its third season provides plenty of graphic thrills, steamy romance, and biting satire for its fans.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/true_blood/s03|title=True Blood: Season 3|via=www.rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], another aggregator of critical responses, found \"generally favorable reviews\" for the first five seasons, with ratings of 63, 74, 79, 74 and 74, respectively.<ref name=MetacriticS1/><ref name=MetacriticS2/><ref name=MetacriticS3/><ref name=MetacriticS4/><ref name=MetacriticS5/>\n\nThe sixth season, notable for being the first of the series not to have [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]] as showrunner, was met with mixed reviews in contrast to the acclaim of the previous five seasons. Many critics noted the decreasing quality of the scripts and production values.

Though this speed is most commonly associated with [[light]], it is also the speed at which all [[massless particle]]s and [[field (physics)|field]] perturbations travel in vacuum, including [[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[gravitational wave]]s. Such particles and waves travel at {{math|''c''}} regardless of the motion of the source or the [[inertial frame of reference|inertial reference frame]] of the observer. Particles with nonzero [[rest mass]] can approach {{mvar|c}}, but can never actually reach it. In the [[theory of relativity|special and general theories of relativity]], {{math|''c''}} interrelates [[spacetime|space and time]], and also appears in the famous equation of [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] {{math|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref name=LeClerq>{{Cite book| last=Uzan |first=J-P |last2=Leclercq |first2=B | year=2008 | title=The Natural Laws of the Universe: Understanding Fundamental Constants | url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSAWX8TNpScC&pg=PA43 | pages=43\u201344 | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-0-387-73454-5 }}</ref>\n\nThe speed at which light propagates through [[Transparency and translucency|transparent materials]], such as glass or air, is less than {{math|''c''}}; similarly, the speed of [[electromagnetic waves]] in wire cables is slower than {{math|''c''}}. The ratio between {{math|''c''}} and the speed {{math|''v''}} at which light travels in a material is called the [[refractive index]] {{math|''n''}} of the material ({{math|1=''n'' = ''c'' / ''v''}}). For example, for [[visible light]] the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at {{nowrap|{{math|''c''}} / 1.5 \u2248 {{cvt|200000|km/s|mi/s|comma=gaps|sigfig=3}}}}; the [[refractive index of air]] for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about {{cvt|{{#expr:299792.458/1.0003 round -1}}|km/s|mi/s|comma=gaps|sigfig=5}}, which is about {{cvt|90|km/s|mi/s|sigfig=2}} slower than {{math|''c''}}.\n\nFor many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant [[space probes]], it can take minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing the study of the history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the data transfer between the CPU and memory chips in [[computer]]s. The speed of light can be used with [[time of flight]] measurements to measure large distances to high precision.\n\n[[Ole R\u00f8mer]] first [[R\u00f8mer's determination of the speed of light|demonstrated in 1676]] that light travels at a finite speed (as opposed to instantaneously) by studying the apparent motion of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]]. In 1865, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave, and therefore travelled at the speed {{math|''c''}} appearing in his theory of electromagnetism.<ref>{{cite web |title=How is the speed of light measured? |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html |url-status=dead |website=The Physics and Relativity FAQ |first=Philip |last=Gibbs |date=1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821181850/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html |archivedate=2015-08-21 |df= }}</ref> In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] postulated that the speed of light {{math|''c''}} with respect to any inertial frame is a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source.<ref name=\"stachel\">{{cite book |title=Einstein from \"B\" to \"Z\" \u2013 Volume 9 of Einstein studies |first1=JJ |last1=Stachel |publisher=Springer |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8176-4143-6 |page=226 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA226}}</ref> He explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving the theory of relativity and in doing so showed that the parameter {{math|''c''}} had relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism.\n\nAfter centuries of increasingly precise measurements, in 1975 the speed of light was known to be {{cvt|299792458|m/s|ft/s mi/s|sigfig=9|comma=gaps}} with a [[measurement uncertainty]] of 4{{nbsp}}parts per billion.

In 1856, [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] and [[Rudolf Kohlrausch]] had used {{math|''c''}} for a different constant later shown to equal {{radic|2}} times the speed of light in vacuum. Historically, the symbol ''V'' was used as an alternative symbol for the speed of light, introduced by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1865. In 1894, [[Paul Drude]] redefined {{math|''c''}} with its modern meaning. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] used ''V'' in his [[Annus Mirabilis papers|original German-language papers]] on special relativity in 1905<!--, the 1923 English translation of them by Perrett and Jeffery using {{math|''c''}}-->, but in 1907 he switched to {{math|''c''}}, which by then had become the standard symbol for the speed of light.<ref name=Yc>\n{{cite web\n |last=Gibbs\n |first=P\n |year=2004\n |origyear=1997\n |title=Why is ''c'' the symbol for the speed of light?\n |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/c.html\n |work=Usenet Physics FAQ\n |publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]]\n |accessdate=2009-11-16\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325220247/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/c.html\n |archivedate=2010-03-25\n |url-status=dead\n |df=\n}}\n\"The origins of the letter c being used for the speed of light can be traced back to a paper of 1856 by Weber and Kohlrausch [...] Weber apparently meant c to stand for 'constant' in his force law, but there is evidence that physicists such as Lorentz and Einstein were accustomed to a common convention that c could be used as a variable for velocity.

An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the [[group velocity]]&nbsp;''v''<sub>g</sub>, and its earliest part travels at the [[front velocity]]&nbsp;''v''<sub>f</sub>.\n\n[[File:frontgroupphase.gif|thumb|left|The blue dot moves at the speed of the ripples, the phase velocity; the green dot moves with the speed of the envelope, the group velocity; and the red dot moves with the speed of the foremost part of the pulse, the front velocity.|alt=A modulated wave moves from left to right. There are three points marked with a dot: A blue dot at a node of the carrier wave, a green dot at the maximum of the envelope, and a red dot at the front of the envelope.]]\nThe phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of a ''refractive index''. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of ''c'' to the phase velocity&nbsp;''v''<sub>p</sub> in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The [[refractive index of air]] is approximately 1.0003.<ref name=Podesta>{{Cite book\n |last=de Podesta |first=M\n |year=2002\n |title=Understanding the Properties of Matter\n |url=https://books.google.com/?id=h8BNvnR050cC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131\n |page=131\n |publisher=CRC Press\n |isbn=978-0-415-25788-6\n}}</ref> Denser media, such as [[Optical properties of water and ice|water]],<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Optical constants of H2O, D2O (Water, heavy water, ice)\n |url=https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=H2O&page=Hale\n |publisher=Mikhail Polyanskiy\n |work=refractiveindex.info\n |accessdate =2017-11-07\n}}</ref> [[glass]],<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Optical constants of Soda lime glass\n |url=https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=glass&book=soda-lime&page=Rubin-clear\n |publisher=Mikhail Polyanskiy\n |work=refractiveindex.info\n |accessdate =2017-11-07\n}}</ref> and [[Material properties of diamond#Optical properties|diamond]],<!--there must be a way to make it clearer where these links go--><ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Optical constants of C (Carbon, diamond, graphite)\n |url=https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=C&page=Phillip\n |publisher=Mikhail Polyanskiy\n |work=refractiveindex.info\n |accessdate =2017-11-07\n}}</ref> have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light.

However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-''c'' speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light \"slowing\" in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate of the element [[rubidium]], one team at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Rowland Institute for Science]] in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], also in Cambridge.

This slowing applies to any medium such as air, water, or glass, and is responsible for phenomena such as [[refraction]]. When light leaves the medium and returns to a vacuum, and ignoring any effects of [[gravity]], its speed returns to the usual speed of light in a vacuum,  ''c''.\n\nCommon explanations for this slowing, based upon the idea of light scattering from, or being absorbed and re-emitted by atoms, are both incorrect.<ref name=Fermilab/> Explanations like these would cause a \"blurring\" effect in the resulting light, as it would no longer be travelling in just one direction. But this effect is not seen in nature.\n\nA more correct explanation rests on light's nature as an [[electromagnetic wave]].<ref name=Fermilab>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjt36SD3h8 Why does light slow down in water?] - [[Fermilab]]</ref> Because light is an oscillating electrical/magnetic wave, light traveling in a medium causes the electrically charged [[electron]]s of the material to also oscillate. (The material's [[proton]]s also oscillate but as they are around 2000 times more massive, their movement and therefore their effect, is far smaller). A moving [[electrical charge]] emits electromagnetic waves of its own. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the oscillating electrons, interact with the electromagnetic waves that make up the original light, similar to water waves on a pond, a process known as [[constructive interference]]. When two waves interfere in this way, the resulting \"combined\" wave may have wave packets that pass an observer at a slower rate. The light has effectively been slowed down. When the light leaves the material, this interaction with electrons no longer happens, and therefore the wave packet rate (and therefore its speed) return to normal.\n\n==Practical effects of finiteness==\nThe speed of light is of relevance to [[telecommunication|communications]]: the one-way and  [[round-trip delay time]] are greater than zero. This applies from small to astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.\n\n===Small scales===\nIn [[supercomputer]]s, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between [[central processing unit|processors]]. If a processor operates at 1{{nbsp}}[[gigahertz]], a signal can travel only a maximum of about {{convert|30|cm|ft|0}} in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single [[integrated circuit|chips]].<ref name=\"processorlimit\">{{Cite book\n |last=Parhami |first=B\n |year=1999\n |title=Introduction to parallel processing: algorithms and architectures\n |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ekBsZkIYfUgC&printsec=frontcover&q=\n |page=5\n |publisher=[[Plenum Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-306-45970-2\n}}</ref><ref name=\"processorlimit2\">{{cite conference\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sona_r6dPyQC&lpg=PA26&dq=%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q=%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit&f=false\n |title=Software Transactional Memories: An Approach for Multicore Programming\n|first1=D |last1=Imbs\n|first2=Michel |last2=Raynal\n|year=2009\n|conference=10th International Conference, PaCT 2009, Novosibirsk, Russia, 31 August \u2013 4 September 2009\n|editor=Malyshkin, V\n|publisher=Springer\n|isbn=978-3-642-03274-5\n|page=26\n}}</ref>\n\n===Large distances on Earth===\nGiven that the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about {{val|40075|u=km}} and that ''c'' is about {{val|300000|u=km/s}}, the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds.

One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine ''c'' from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants [[relative permittivity|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>]] and [[permeability (electromagnetism)|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>]] and using their relation to ''c''. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling ''c''.\n\nIn 1983 the metre was defined as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of {{frac|1|{{val|299792458}}}} of a second\",<ref name=Resolution_1/> fixing the value of the speed of light at {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} by definition, as [[#Increased accuracy of c and redefinition of the metre and second|described below]].

Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the [[solar system]], such as the [[radius]] of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in [[astronomical unit]]s (AU) per day.\n\n[[Ole Christensen R\u00f8mer]] used an astronomical measurement to make [[R\u00f8mer's determination of the speed of light|the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light]].<ref name=cohen>{{cite journal\n |last=Cohen |first=IB\n |year=1940\n |title=Roemer and the first determination of the velocity of light (1676)\n |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]\n |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=327\u201379\n |doi=10.1086/347594\n |ref=cohen-1940\n|hdl=2027/uc1.b4375710\n |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=uc1.b4375710;orient=0;size=100;seq=5;attachment=0\n }}</ref><ref name=roemer>\n{{cite journal\n |year=1676\n |title=Demonstration tovchant le mouvement de la lumiere trouv\u00e9 par M.

The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the [[diameter]] of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. R\u00f8mer observed this effect for [[Jupiter]]'s innermost moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.\n\n[[File:SoL Aberration.svg|thumb|right|upright|Aberration of light: light from a distant source appears to be from a different location for a moving telescope due to the finite speed of light.|alt=A star emits a light ray which hits the objective of a telescope.

This is the working principle behind the [[Fizeau\u2013Foucault apparatus]] developed by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[L\u00e9on Foucault]].\n\nThe setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.<ref name=How>{{cite web\n |last=Gibbs\n |first=P\n |year=1997\n |title=How is the speed of light measured?\n |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html\n |work=Usenet Physics FAQ\n |publisher=University of California, Riverside\n |accessdate=2010-01-13\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821181850/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html\n |archivedate=2015-08-21\n |df=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back.

The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal.

Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment|the experiment]] performed by [[Albert A.

Based on [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentz's aether theory]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed.

Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the [[special theory of relativity]], in which the speed of light in vacuum ''c'' featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9 still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Miller\n|first=AI\n|year=1981\n|title=Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity.

These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, [[Louis Essen]] determined the speed as {{val|299792.5|1|u=km/s}}, using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the [[history of the metre#Krypton standard|metre was redefined]] in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the [[second]] was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of [[caesium-133]].\n\nIn 1972, using the laser interferometer method and the new definitions, a group at the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]] determined the speed of light in vacuum to be ''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{val|299792456.2|1.1|u=m/s}}. This was 100 times less [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertain]] than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the metre.{{#tag:ref|Between 1960 and 1983 the metre was defined as: \"The metre is the length equal to {{val|1650763.73}} wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels 2p<sup>10</sup> and 5d<sup>5</sup> of the krypton 86 atom.\"<ref name=\"11thCGPM\">\n{{cite web\n |year=1967\n |title=Resolution 6 of the 15th CGPM\n |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/6/\n |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]]\n |accessdate=2010-10-13\n}}</ref> It was discovered in the 1970s that this spectral line was not symmetric, which put a limit on the precision with which the definition could be realized in interferometry experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 22 | pages = 196 | year = 1973 | doi = 10.1063/1.1654608 | last1 = Barger | journal = Applied Physics Letters | first1 = R.| title = Wavelength of the 3.39-\u03bcm laser-saturated absorption line of methane| last2 = Hall | first2=J. | issue = 4|bibcode = 1973ApPhL..22..196B | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0a5dbb6954fdffaf703e1e4c5b250724e65d5d91 }}\n</ref>|group=\"Note\"}}<ref name=\"NIST heterodyne\"/> As similar experiments found comparable results for ''c'', the 15th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1975 recommended using the value {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} for the speed of light.<ref name=\"15thCGPM\">\n{{cite web\n |year=1975\n |title=Resolution 2 of the 15th CGPM\n |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/15/2/\n |publisher=BIPM\n |accessdate=2009-09-09\n}}</ref>\n\n===Defining the speed of light as an explicit constant===\nIn 1983 the 17th&nbsp;CGPM found that wavelengths from frequency measurements and a given value for the speed of light are more [[reproducibility|reproducible]] than the previous standard.

For example, for [[visible light]] the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at {{nowrap|{{math|''c''}} / 1.5 \u2248 {{cvt|200000|km/s|mi/s|comma=gaps|sigfig=3}}}}; the [[refractive index of air]] for visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about {{cvt|{{#expr:299792.458/1.0003 round -1}}|km/s|mi/s|comma=gaps|sigfig=5}}, which is about {{cvt|90|km/s|mi/s|sigfig=2}} slower than {{math|''c''}}.\n\nFor many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant [[space probes]], it can take minutes to hours for a message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing the study of the history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the data transfer between the CPU and memory chips in [[computer]]s. The speed of light can be used with [[time of flight]] measurements to measure large distances to high precision.\n\n[[Ole R\u00f8mer]] first [[R\u00f8mer's determination of the speed of light|demonstrated in 1676]] that light travels at a finite speed (as opposed to instantaneously) by studying the apparent motion of [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].

The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of ''c'' to the phase velocity&nbsp;''v''<sub>p</sub> in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The [[refractive index of air]] is approximately 1.0003.<ref name=Podesta>{{Cite book\n |last=de Podesta |first=M\n |year=2002\n |title=Understanding the Properties of Matter\n |url=https://books.google.com/?id=h8BNvnR050cC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131\n |page=131\n |publisher=CRC Press\n |isbn=978-0-415-25788-6\n}}</ref> Denser media, such as [[Optical properties of water and ice|water]],<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Optical constants of H2O, D2O (Water, heavy water, ice)\n |url=https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=H2O&page=Hale\n |publisher=Mikhail Polyanskiy\n |work=refractiveindex.info\n |accessdate =2017-11-07\n}}</ref> [[glass]],<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Optical constants of Soda lime glass\n |url=https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=glass&book=soda-lime&page=Rubin-clear\n |publisher=Mikhail Polyanskiy\n |work=refractiveindex.info\n |accessdate =2017-11-07\n}}</ref> and [[Material properties of diamond#Optical properties|diamond]],<!--there must be a way to make it clearer where these links go--><ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Optical constants of C (Carbon, diamond, graphite)\n |url=https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=C&page=Phillip\n |publisher=Mikhail Polyanskiy\n |work=refractiveindex.info\n |accessdate =2017-11-07\n}}</ref> have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light.

However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-''c'' speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light \"slowing\" in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate of the element [[rubidium]], one team at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Rowland Institute for Science]] in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped,\" it had ceased to be light.

This slowing applies to any medium such as air, water, or glass, and is responsible for phenomena such as [[refraction]]. When light leaves the medium and returns to a vacuum, and ignoring any effects of [[gravity]], its speed returns to the usual speed of light in a vacuum,  ''c''.\n\nCommon explanations for this slowing, based upon the idea of light scattering from, or being absorbed and re-emitted by atoms, are both incorrect.<ref name=Fermilab/> Explanations like these would cause a \"blurring\" effect in the resulting light, as it would no longer be travelling in just one direction. But this effect is not seen in nature.\n\nA more correct explanation rests on light's nature as an [[electromagnetic wave]].<ref name=Fermilab>[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CUjt36SD3h8 Why does light slow down in water?] - [[Fermilab]]</ref> Because light is an oscillating electrical/magnetic wave, light traveling in a medium causes the electrically charged [[electron]]s of the material to also oscillate. (The material's [[proton]]s also oscillate but as they are around 2000 times more massive, their movement and therefore their effect, is far smaller). A moving [[electrical charge]] emits electromagnetic waves of its own. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the oscillating electrons, interact with the electromagnetic waves that make up the original light, similar to water waves on a pond, a process known as [[constructive interference]]. When two waves interfere in this way, the resulting \"combined\" wave may have wave packets that pass an observer at a slower rate. The light has effectively been slowed down. When the light leaves the material, this interaction with electrons no longer happens, and therefore the wave packet rate (and therefore its speed) return to normal.\n\n==Practical effects of finiteness==\nThe speed of light is of relevance to [[telecommunication|communications]]: the one-way and  [[round-trip delay time]] are greater than zero. This applies from small to astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.\n\n===Small scales===\nIn [[supercomputer]]s, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between [[central processing unit|processors]]. If a processor operates at 1{{nbsp}}[[gigahertz]], a signal can travel only a maximum of about {{convert|30|cm|ft|0}} in a single cycle. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies; this can cause difficulty with cooling. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single [[integrated circuit|chips]].<ref name=\"processorlimit\">{{Cite book\n |last=Parhami |first=B\n |year=1999\n |title=Introduction to parallel processing: algorithms and architectures\n |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ekBsZkIYfUgC&printsec=frontcover&q=\n |page=5\n |publisher=[[Plenum Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-306-45970-2\n}}</ref><ref name=\"processorlimit2\">{{cite conference\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sona_r6dPyQC&lpg=PA26&dq=%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q=%22speed%20of%20light%22%20processor%20limit&f=false\n |title=Software Transactional Memories: An Approach for Multicore Programming\n|first1=D |last1=Imbs\n|first2=Michel |last2=Raynal\n|year=2009\n|conference=10th International Conference, PaCT 2009, Novosibirsk, Russia, 31 August \u2013 4 September 2009\n|editor=Malyshkin, V\n|publisher=Springer\n|isbn=978-3-642-03274-5\n|page=26\n}}</ref>\n\n===Large distances on Earth===\nGiven that the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about {{val|40075|u=km}} and that ''c'' is about {{val|300000|u=km/s}}, the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds.

Please do not change the title of the section without amending the articles which link to it. --->\nThere are different ways to determine the value of ''c''. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine ''c'' from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants [[relative permittivity|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>]] and [[permeability (electromagnetism)|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>]] and using their relation to ''c''. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling ''c''.\n\nIn 1983 the metre was defined as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of {{frac|1|{{val|299792458}}}} of a second\",<ref name=Resolution_1/> fixing the value of the speed of light at {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} by definition, as [[#Increased accuracy of c and redefinition of the metre and second|described below]]. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value of ''c''.\n\n===Astronomical measurements===\n[[File:Io eclipse speed of light measurement.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Measurement of the speed of light using the eclipse of Io by Jupiter]]\n[[Outer space]] is a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect [[vacuum]]. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the [[solar system]], such as the [[radius]] of the Earth's orbit.

The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the [[diameter]] of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. R\u00f8mer observed this effect for [[Jupiter]]'s innermost moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.\n\n[[File:SoL Aberration.svg|thumb|right|upright|Aberration of light: light from a distant source appears to be from a different location for a moving telescope due to the finite speed of light.|alt=A star emits a light ray which hits the objective of a telescope.

This is the working principle behind the [[Fizeau\u2013Foucault apparatus]] developed by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[L\u00e9on Foucault]].\n\nThe setup as used by Fizeau consists of a beam of light directed at a mirror {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.<ref name=How>{{cite web\n |last=Gibbs\n |first=P\n |year=1997\n |title=How is the speed of light measured?\n |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html\n |work=Usenet Physics FAQ\n |publisher=University of California, Riverside\n |accessdate=2010-01-13\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821181850/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/measure_c.html\n |archivedate=2015-08-21\n |df=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe method of Foucault replaces the cogwheel by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back.

The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal.

Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment|the experiment]] performed by [[Albert A.

Based on [[Lorentz ether theory|Lorentz's aether theory]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1900) showed that this local time (to first order in v/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed.

Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the [[special theory of relativity]], in which the speed of light in vacuum ''c'' featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincar\u00e9 still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Miller\n|first=AI\n|year=1981\n|title=Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity.

These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950, [[Louis Essen]] determined the speed as {{val|299792.5|1|u=km/s}}, using cavity resonance. This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, the [[history of the metre#Krypton standard|metre was redefined]] in terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line of krypton-86, and, in 1967, the [[second]] was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state of [[caesium-133]].\n\nIn 1972, using the laser interferometer method and the new definitions, a group at the US [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]] determined the speed of light in vacuum to be ''c''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{val|299792456.2|1.1|u=m/s}}. This was 100 times less [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertain]] than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the metre.{{#tag:ref|Between 1960 and 1983 the metre was defined as: \"The metre is the length equal to {{val|1650763.73}} wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels 2p<sup>10</sup> and 5d<sup>5</sup> of the krypton 86 atom.\"<ref name=\"11thCGPM\">\n{{cite web\n |year=1967\n |title=Resolution 6 of the 15th CGPM\n |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/6/\n |publisher=[[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]]\n |accessdate=2010-10-13\n}}</ref> It was discovered in the 1970s that this spectral line was not symmetric, which put a limit on the precision with which the definition could be realized in interferometry experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 22 | pages = 196 | year = 1973 | doi = 10.1063/1.1654608 | last1 = Barger | journal = Applied Physics Letters | first1 = R.| title = Wavelength of the 3.39-\u03bcm laser-saturated absorption line of methane| last2 = Hall | first2=J. | issue = 4|bibcode = 1973ApPhL..22..196B | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0a5dbb6954fdffaf703e1e4c5b250724e65d5d91 }}\n</ref>|group=\"Note\"}}<ref name=\"NIST heterodyne\"/> As similar experiments found comparable results for ''c'', the 15th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1975 recommended using the value {{val|299792458|u=m/s}} for the speed of light.<ref name=\"15thCGPM\">\n{{cite web\n |year=1975\n |title=Resolution 2 of the 15th CGPM\n |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/15/2/\n |publisher=BIPM\n |accessdate=2009-09-09\n}}</ref>\n\n===Defining the speed of light as an explicit constant===\nIn 1983 the 17th&nbsp;CGPM found that wavelengths from frequency measurements and a given value for the speed of light are more [[reproducibility|reproducible]] than the previous standard.

Abrams compared the texture of the costume to that worn by [[Henry Cavill]] as Superman in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', as well as the positioning of the cape on the suit, and the decision to do away with the bright blue and red color scheme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/06/supergirl-debuts-new-costume-whats-different |first=Natalie |last=Abrams |title=Supergirl debuts new costume \u2013 what's different? |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 6, 2015 |accessdate=March 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308055252/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/06/supergirl-debuts-new-costume-whats-different |archive-date=March 8, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Andrew Dyce, from Screen Rant, found the new costume to perfectly balance itself between classic nostalgia and modernism.<ref>{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Dyce |url=http://screenrant.com/supergirl-tv-show-suit-images/ |title='Supergirl's Full Costume Revealed in First Official Images |work=ScreenRant |date=March 6, 2015 |accessdate=March 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308121442/http://screenrant.com/supergirl-tv-show-suit-images/ |archive-date=March 8, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''The Washington Post'' noted that Atwood's design was successful, praising her ability to take \"cartoon-y tints\" and moving them to darker tones.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Cavna |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/03/06/first-look-melissa-benoists-supergirl-costume-revealed-by-cbs/ |title=First look: Melissa Benoist's Supergirl costume revealed by CBS |work=The Washington Post |date=March 6, 2015 |accessdate=March 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310144147/http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/03/06/first-look-melissa-benoists-supergirl-costume-revealed-by-cbs/ |archive-date=March 10, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''[[E!|E!

By the time the spacecraft crash landed on Earth, Kal-El had grown up and become [[Superman]].

The Poor Clares were the second [[Franciscan]] branch of the order to be established. Founded by saints [[Clare of Assisi]] and [[Francis of Assisi]] on [[Palm Sunday]] in the year 1212, they were organized after the [[Order of Friars Minor]] (the ''first Order''), and before the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] for the laity. As of 2011 there were over 20,000 Poor Clare nuns in over 75 countries throughout the world. They follow several different observances and are organized into federations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poorclare.org/|title=Poor Clare Sisters|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Poor Clares follow the ''[[Rule of St. Clare]]'', which was approved by Pope [[Innocent IV]] the day before Clare's death in 1253. The main branch of the Order (O.S.C.) follows the observance of Pope Urban. Other branches established since that time, who operate under their own unique [[Constitutions]], are the [[Colettine Poor Clares]] (P.C.C.) (founded 1410), the [[Capuchin Poor Clares]] (O.S.C. Cap) (founded 1538) and the [[Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration]] (P.C.P.A.) (founded 1854).\n<!--Note, the lead section was copied to [[Franciscans]] version 761246405-->\n\n==Foundation and rule==\nThe Poor Clares were founded by [[Clare of Assisi]] in the year 1212. Little is known of Clare's early life, although popular tradition hints that she came from a fairly well-to-do family in [[Assisi]]. At the age of eighteen, inspired by the preaching of [[Francis of Assisi|Francis]] in the [[Assisi Cathedral|cathedral]], Clare ran away from home to join his community of friars at the [[Porziuncola|Portiuncula]], some way outside the town.<ref>Michael Walsh (ed.). ''Butler's lives of the Saints'', Burns and Oates (1991) p. 246.</ref> Although, according to tradition, her family wanted to take her back by force, Clare's dedication to holiness and poverty inspired the friars to accept her resolution. She was given the [[religious habit|habit]] of a nun and transferred to [[Benedictine]] monasteries, first at Bastia and then at Sant' Angelo di Panzo, for her monastic formation.\n\nBy 1216 Francis was able to offer Clare and her companions a monastery adjoining the chapel of [[San Damiano, Assisi|San Damiano]] where she became [[abbess]]. Clare's mother, two of her sisters and some other wealthy women from [[Florence]] soon joined her new Order. Clare dedicated her order to the strict principles of Francis, setting a rule of extreme poverty far more severe than that of any female order of the time.<ref name=\"Farmer, David 1997 p. 103\">Farmer, David (ed.) ''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', Oxford University Press (1997), p. 103</ref> Clare's determination that her order not be wealthy or own property, and that the nuns live entirely from alms given by local people, was initially protected by the papal bull ''Privilegium paupertatis'', issued by [[Pope Innocent III]].<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12251b.htm| title = Poor Clares |publisher = The Catholic Encyclopedia, New Advent|accessdate = 10 November 2009}}</ref> By this time the order had grown to number three monasteries.\n\n==Spread of the order==\nThe movement quickly spread, though in a somewhat disorganized fashion, with several monasteries of women devoted to the Franciscan ideal springing up elsewhere in Northern Italy. At this point Ugolino, Cardinal Bishop of [[Ostia Antica (district)|Ostia]] (the future [[Pope Gregory IX]]), was given the task of overseeing all such monasteries and preparing a formal [[monastic Rule|rule]]. Although monasteries at [[Monticello]], [[Perugia]], [[Siena]], Gattajola and elsewhere adopted the new Rule - which allowed for property to be held in trust by the papacy for the various communities - it was not adopted by Clare herself or her monastery at San Damiano.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/> Ugolino's Rule, originally based on the [[Rule of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] one, was amended in 1263 by Pope Urban IV to allow for the communal ownership of property, and was adopted by a growing number of monasteries across [[Europe]]. Communities adopting this less rigorous rule came to be known as the Order of Saint Clare (O.S.C.) or the Urbanist Poor Clares.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2007, p. 603\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2007, Vol.9. p. 603</ref>\n\nClare herself resisted the Ugolino Rule, since it did not closely enough follow the ideal of complete poverty advocated by Francis. On 9 August 1253, she managed to obtain a [[papal bull]], ''Solet annuere'', establishing a rule of her own, more closely following that of the friars, which forbade the possession of property either individually or as a community. Originally applying only to Clare's community at San Damiano, this rule was also adopted by many monasteries.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/> Communities that followed this stricter rule were fewer in number than the followers of the rule formulated by Cardinal Ugolino, and became known simply as \"Poor Clares\" (P.C.) or Primitives.\n\nThe situation was further complicated a century later when [[Saint Colette]] of [[Corbie]] restored the primitive rule of strict poverty to 17 French monasteries. Her followers came to be called the [[Colettine Poor Clares]] (P.C.C.). Two further branches, the [[Capuchin Poor Clares]] (O.S.C. Cap.) and the [[Peter of Alcantara|Alcantarines]], also followed the strict observance.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2007, p. 603\"/> The later group disappeared as a distinct group when their observance among the friars was ended, with the friars being merged by the [[Holy See]] into the wider observant branch of the First Order.\n\nThe spread of the order began in 1218 when a monastery was founded in [[Perugia]]; new foundations quickly followed in [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], and [[Padua]]. Saint [[Agnes of Assisi]], a sister of Clare, introduced the order to [[Spain]], where [[Barcelona]] and [[Burgos]] hosted major communities. The order further expanded to [[Belgium]] and [[France]] where a monastery was founded at [[Reims]] in 1229, followed by [[Montpellier]], [[Cahors]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Metz]], and [[Besan\u00e7on]]. A monastery at [[Marseilles]] was founded directly from Assisi in 1254.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/> The Poor Clares monastery founded by [[Margaret of Provence|Queen Margaret]] in Paris, St. Marcel, was where she died in 1295.<ref name=\"Robson328\">'' Queen Isabella (c.1295/1358) and the Greyfriars: An example of royal patronage based on her accounts for 1357/1358'', Michael Robson, ''Franciscan Studies'', Vol. 65 (2007), 328.</ref> [[Philip IV of France|King Philip IV]] and [[Joan I of Navarre|Queen Joan]] founded a monastery at Moncel in the Beauvais diocese.<ref name=\"Robson328\" /> By A.D. 1300 there were 47 Poor Clare monasteries in Spain alone.<ref name=\"Farmer, David 1997 p. 103\"/>\n\n===Europe===\n====United Kingdom====\nThe first Poor Clare monastery in England was founded in 1286 in Newcastle upon Tyne.<ref name=Hereford>{{cite web|url=http://www.poorclares-hereford.org.uk/our-roots/history-of-the-poor-clare-order-in-britain/|title=History of the Poor Clare Order in Britain - The Poor Clare Monastery, Hereford|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> \nIn Medieval England, where the nuns were known as \"Minoresses\", their principal monastery was located near [[Aldgate]], known as the [[Abbey of the Order of St Clare]]. The order gave its name to the still-extant street known as [[Minories]] on the eastern boundary of the [[City of London]].\n\nAfter the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] under King [[Henry VIII]], several religious communities formed in [[Continental Europe]] for [[English people|English]] Catholics.

The one that used to be based in Neath has moved to Glasgow.\n\n====Ireland====\nIn [[Ireland]] there are seven monasteries of the Colettine Observance. The community with the oldest historical roots is the monastery on Nuns' Island in [[Galway]], which traces its history back to the monastery in Gravelines. Originally a separate community of [[Irish people|Irish women]] under a common [[:wikt:mother superior|mother superior]] with the English nuns, they moved to [[Dublin]] in 1629, the first monastic community in Ireland for a century. The first Abbess was [[Cecily Dillon]], a daughter of [[Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon]]. War forced the community to move back to Galway in 1642. From that point on, persecution under the [[Penal Laws]] and war led to repeated destruction of their monastery and scattering of the community over two centuries, until 1825, when fifteen nuns were able to re-establish monastic life permanently on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://poorclares.ie/history.html|title=Poor Clares Galway - Ireland|first=Marek Mazur &|last=Team|accessdate=9 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102044547/http://poorclares.ie/history.html|archive-date=2 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLater monasteries were founded in 1906 in both [[Carlow]] and [[Dublin]].

The Poor Clares were the second [[Franciscan]] branch of the order to be established. Founded by saints [[Clare of Assisi]] and [[Francis of Assisi]] on [[Palm Sunday]] in the year 1212, they were organized after the [[Order of Friars Minor]] (the ''first Order''), and before the [[Third Order of Saint Francis]] for the laity. As of 2011 there were over 20,000 Poor Clare nuns in over 75 countries throughout the world. They follow several different observances and are organized into federations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poorclare.org/|title=Poor Clare Sisters|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Poor Clares follow the ''[[Rule of St. Clare]]'', which was approved by Pope [[Innocent IV]] the day before Clare's death in 1253. The main branch of the Order (O.S.C.) follows the observance of Pope Urban. Other branches established since that time, who operate under their own unique [[Constitutions]], are the [[Colettine Poor Clares]] (P.C.C.) (founded 1410), the [[Capuchin Poor Clares]] (O.S.C. Cap) (founded 1538) and the [[Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration]] (P.C.P.A.) (founded 1854).\n<!--Note, the lead section was copied to [[Franciscans]] version 761246405-->\n\n==Foundation and rule==\nThe Poor Clares were founded by [[Clare of Assisi]] in the year 1212. Little is known of Clare's early life, although popular tradition hints that she came from a fairly well-to-do family in [[Assisi]]. At the age of eighteen, inspired by the preaching of [[Francis of Assisi|Francis]] in the [[Assisi Cathedral|cathedral]], Clare ran away from home to join his community of friars at the [[Porziuncola|Portiuncula]], some way outside the town.<ref>Michael Walsh (ed.). ''Butler's lives of the Saints'', Burns and Oates (1991) p. 246.</ref> Although, according to tradition, her family wanted to take her back by force, Clare's dedication to holiness and poverty inspired the friars to accept her resolution. She was given the [[religious habit|habit]] of a nun and transferred to [[Benedictine]] monasteries, first at Bastia and then at Sant' Angelo di Panzo, for her monastic formation.\n\nBy 1216 Francis was able to offer Clare and her companions a monastery adjoining the chapel of [[San Damiano, Assisi|San Damiano]] where she became [[abbess]]. Clare's mother, two of her sisters and some other wealthy women from [[Florence]] soon joined her new Order. Clare dedicated her order to the strict principles of Francis, setting a rule of extreme poverty far more severe than that of any female order of the time.<ref name=\"Farmer, David 1997 p. 103\">Farmer, David (ed.) ''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', Oxford University Press (1997), p. 103</ref> Clare's determination that her order not be wealthy or own property, and that the nuns live entirely from alms given by local people, was initially protected by the papal bull ''Privilegium paupertatis'', issued by [[Pope Innocent III]].<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12251b.htm| title = Poor Clares |publisher = The Catholic Encyclopedia, New Advent|accessdate = 10 November 2009}}</ref> By this time the order had grown to number three monasteries.\n\n==Spread of the order==\nThe movement quickly spread, though in a somewhat disorganized fashion, with several monasteries of women devoted to the Franciscan ideal springing up elsewhere in Northern Italy. At this point Ugolino, Cardinal Bishop of [[Ostia Antica (district)|Ostia]] (the future [[Pope Gregory IX]]), was given the task of overseeing all such monasteries and preparing a formal [[monastic Rule|rule]]. Although monasteries at [[Monticello]], [[Perugia]], [[Siena]], Gattajola and elsewhere adopted the new Rule - which allowed for property to be held in trust by the papacy for the various communities - it was not adopted by Clare herself or her monastery at San Damiano.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/> Ugolino's Rule, originally based on the [[Rule of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] one, was amended in 1263 by Pope Urban IV to allow for the communal ownership of property, and was adopted by a growing number of monasteries across [[Europe]]. Communities adopting this less rigorous rule came to be known as the Order of Saint Clare (O.S.C.) or the Urbanist Poor Clares.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2007, p. 603\">Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2007, Vol.9. p. 603</ref>\n\nClare herself resisted the Ugolino Rule, since it did not closely enough follow the ideal of complete poverty advocated by Francis. On 9 August 1253, she managed to obtain a [[papal bull]], ''Solet annuere'', establishing a rule of her own, more closely following that of the friars, which forbade the possession of property either individually or as a community. Originally applying only to Clare's community at San Damiano, this rule was also adopted by many monasteries.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/> Communities that followed this stricter rule were fewer in number than the followers of the rule formulated by Cardinal Ugolino, and became known simply as \"Poor Clares\" (P.C.) or Primitives.\n\nThe situation was further complicated a century later when [[Saint Colette]] of [[Corbie]] restored the primitive rule of strict poverty to 17 French monasteries. Her followers came to be called the [[Colettine Poor Clares]] (P.C.C.). Two further branches, the [[Capuchin Poor Clares]] (O.S.C. Cap.) and the [[Peter of Alcantara|Alcantarines]], also followed the strict observance.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2007, p. 603\"/> The later group disappeared as a distinct group when their observance among the friars was ended, with the friars being merged by the [[Holy See]] into the wider observant branch of the First Order.\n\nThe spread of the order began in 1218 when a monastery was founded in [[Perugia]]; new foundations quickly followed in [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], and [[Padua]]. Saint [[Agnes of Assisi]], a sister of Clare, introduced the order to [[Spain]], where [[Barcelona]] and [[Burgos]] hosted major communities. The order further expanded to [[Belgium]] and [[France]] where a monastery was founded at [[Reims]] in 1229, followed by [[Montpellier]], [[Cahors]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Metz]], and [[Besan\u00e7on]]. A monastery at [[Marseilles]] was founded directly from Assisi in 1254.<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"/> The Poor Clares monastery founded by [[Margaret of Provence|Queen Margaret]] in Paris, St. Marcel, was where she died in 1295.<ref name=\"Robson328\">'' Queen Isabella (c.1295/1358) and the Greyfriars: An example of royal patronage based on her accounts for 1357/1358'', Michael Robson, ''Franciscan Studies'', Vol. 65 (2007), 328.</ref> [[Philip IV of France|King Philip IV]] and [[Joan I of Navarre|Queen Joan]] founded a monastery at Moncel in the Beauvais diocese.<ref name=\"Robson328\" /> By A.D. 1300 there were 47 Poor Clare monasteries in Spain alone.<ref name=\"Farmer, David 1997 p. 103\"/>\n\n===Europe===\n====United Kingdom====\nThe first Poor Clare monastery in England was founded in 1286 in Newcastle upon Tyne.<ref name=Hereford>{{cite web|url=http://www.poorclares-hereford.org.uk/our-roots/history-of-the-poor-clare-order-in-britain/|title=History of the Poor Clare Order in Britain - The Poor Clare Monastery, Hereford|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> \nIn Medieval England, where the nuns were known as \"Minoresses\", their principal monastery was located near [[Aldgate]], known as the [[Abbey of the Order of St Clare]].

The first Abbess was Cicely Dillon, a daughter of [[Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon]]. War forced the community to move back to Galway in 1642.
