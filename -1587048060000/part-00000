It spent two weeks on top of the ''[[New York Times]]'' Bestseller List and reached number 3 on the ''[[USA Today]]'' bestseller list, marking the first time one of Roberts' books had become a bestseller in [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] format. A downloadable casual-play computer game based on the book was introduced by [[Oberon Media|I-Play]] in 2010.\n\nIn her thirty-year career, Roberts had published almost 200 novels. ''Vision in White'' was one of ten Roberts novels published in 2009, including five new releases and five reprints. When it was released on April 28, 2009, its cover premiered the use of a special logo to differentiate her new releases from reprints of her past works.\n\nThe novel marked Roberts' return to [[contemporary romance]]. The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie \"Mac\" Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. Like several other Roberts novels, ''Vision in White'' explored how a protagonist balanced a successful career with a dysfunctional family environment. Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take a chance on love.\n\n==Background==\n[[Nora Roberts]] is a prolific author of [[romance novel|romance]] and futuristic suspense novels.<ref name=kopun>{{citation|last=Kopun|first=Francine|title=Nora Roberts, a bestselling author rarely reviewed|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=October 19, 2009|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2009/10/19/nora_roberts_a_bestselling_author_rarely_reviewed.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> From 1979 through 2008, almost 200 of her novels were published.

Mac and her childhood friends Parker, Emma, and Laurel are the founders of Vows, a fictional wedding planning company in Connecticut. While accompanying his sister to a planning session at Vows, Carter renews his acquaintance with Mac and confesses that he had been infatuated with her since high school. She is intrigued by his honesty and earnestness and decides to embark on a casual fling with him.\n\nAfter seeing her parents' numerous failed marriages, Mac does not trust the idea of commitment. Her determination to avoid emotional intimacy is reinforced as she struggles against her mother's continued tactics of [[emotional manipulation]].\n\nTheir relationship progresses slowly through the book. Each protagonist receives much advice from a large circle of friends and family. With the support of her friends and Carter, Mac develops the courage to stand up to her mother. By the end of the novel, she realizes that she does not have to relive her parents' mistakes, and chooses to embrace her love for Carter.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:NoraRoberts.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Author [[Nora Roberts]]]]\nThe four novels of the Bride Quartet share a strong emphasis on sisterhood. The heroines of the books bonded as children and have become sisters by choice. Throughout the series, they provide mutual support and acceptance of each other's quirks. Focused on their careers, the heroines have little time for outside relationships, and they rely heavily on each other for comfort, help, and distractions.<ref name=snodgrass85>Snodgrass (2010), p. 85.</ref> A similar theme is seen in several of Roberts' other works; her [[In Death]] series, written as J.

Many were delighted to see Roberts return to traditional contemporary romances, minus the elements of fantasy and magic that had woven through her more recent novels. Some praised the tight bonds of sisterhood that Roberts created for the four founders of Vows, but other readers complained that the character voices were too similar.

He is the brother of fellow drug trafficker [[Miguel Caro Quintero]], the founder and former leader of the defunct [[Sonora Cartel]].\n\nHaving formed the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1970s, Caro Quintero worked with Gallardo, [[Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo]], and [[Pedro Avil\u00e9s P\u00e9rez]] by shipping large quantities of marijuana to the United States from Mexico. He was responsible for the kidnapping and murder of the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) agent [[Kiki Camarena|Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena]], Camarena's pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar, the American writer [[John Clay Walker]], and dentistry student Alberto Radelat in 1985. After the murders, Caro Quintero fled to [[Costa Rica]] but was later arrested and extradited back to Mexico, where he was sentenced to 40-years in prison for murder.<ref name=sentence/> Following his arrest, the Guadalajara Cartel disintegrated, and its leaders were incorporated into the [[Tijuana Cartel]], [[Sinaloa Cartel]], and [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]].\n\nCaro Quintero was freed from jail on August 9, 2013, after a state court concluded that he had been tried improperly. However, amid pressure from the federal government of the United States to re-arrest him, a Mexican federal court issued an arrest warrant against Caro Quintero on August 14. He remains at large, as a wanted fugitive in Mexico, the United States, and several other countries. The United States is offering a $20 million bounty for his arrest.\n\n==Early life==\nRafael Caro Quintero was born in the community of La Noria, [[Badiraguato, Sinaloa]], on October 3, 1952.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u00bfQui\u00e9n es Rafael Caro Quintero?|url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/61be756a3a6921a73719f2385d81bd8b|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Milenio]]|date=August 9, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ItZAKk03?url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/61be756a3a6921a73719f2385d81bd8b|archivedate=2013-08-15|url-status=dead|language=Spanish}}</ref> His parents, Emilio Caro Pay\u00e1n and Hermelinda Quintero, had twelve children; he was the oldest son.

He was released from prison on August 9, 2013 on a controversial technicality.\n}}\n'''Rafael Caro Quintero''' (born October 3, 1952) is a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[Illegal drug trade in Latin America|drug trafficker]] who co-founded the now-disintegrated [[Guadalajara Cartel]] with [[Miguel \u00c1ngel F\u00e9lix Gallardo]] and other drug traffickers in the 1970s. He is the brother of fellow drug trafficker [[Miguel Caro Quintero]], the founder and former leader of the defunct [[Sonora Cartel]].\n\nHaving formed the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1970s, Caro Quintero worked with Gallardo, [[Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo]], and [[Pedro Avil\u00e9s P\u00e9rez]] by shipping large quantities of marijuana to the United States from Mexico. He was responsible for the kidnapping and murder of the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) agent [[Kiki Camarena|Enrique \"Kiki\" Camarena]], Camarena's pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar, the American writer [[John Clay Walker]], and dentistry student Alberto Radelat in 1985. After the murders, Caro Quintero fled to [[Costa Rica]] but was later arrested and extradited back to Mexico, where he was sentenced to 40-years in prison for murder.<ref name=sentence/> Following his arrest, the Guadalajara Cartel disintegrated, and its leaders were incorporated into the [[Tijuana Cartel]], [[Sinaloa Cartel]], and [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]].\n\nCaro Quintero was freed from jail on August 9, 2013, after a state court concluded that he had been tried improperly. However, amid pressure from the federal government of the United States to re-arrest him, a Mexican federal court issued an arrest warrant against Caro Quintero on August 14. He remains at large, as a wanted fugitive in Mexico, the United States, and several other countries. The United States is offering a $20 million bounty for his arrest.\n\n==Early life==\nRafael Caro Quintero was born in the community of La Noria, [[Badiraguato, Sinaloa]], on October 3, 1952.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u00bfQui\u00e9n es Rafael Caro Quintero?|url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/61be756a3a6921a73719f2385d81bd8b|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Milenio]]|date=August 9, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ItZAKk03?url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/61be756a3a6921a73719f2385d81bd8b|archivedate=2013-08-15|url-status=dead|language=Spanish}}</ref> His parents, Emilio Caro Pay\u00e1n and Hermelinda Quintero, had twelve children; he was the oldest son.

He then worked analyzing the reliability of ICBM missiles and the effectiveness of bombing in the [[Vietnam War]]. After seven years in the Air Force he \"went from analyzing bombs to analyzing welfare\", and \"automation\" in government, before leaving for a private firm focused on winning government contracts. After eight months he left and started Maximus by himself in 1975.

With a resident population of 7417, it is the second biggest village in the state and is part of the contiguous built-up of the Kohima metropolitan area that extends into the neighboring areas of [[Jakhama]], [[Kigwema]], Phesama and [[Khuzama]] in the Southern Angami region, forming the second largest urban agglomerations in Nagaland. Its vast territory also lies across the inter-state boundary in [[Manipur]] where notable features including [[Mount Temp\u00fc]](Iso) at 9822 feet (2994m) also the highest peak in Manipur, the thick forest of [[Kezol\u2013tsa forest|Kezol\u2013tsa]] and a major portion of the [[Dz\u00fcko Valley]] is located.\n\nAs of 2017, there were an estimated 20,000 ''Viswe\u2013miko'' residing both in and outside Viswema.\n\nIt is considered to be one of the oldest [[Tenyimi]] village with most [[Chakhesang]] villages and also many other Angami villages pointing their origin towards Viswema.\n\n==Etymology==\nTraditionally referred to as ''Viswe\u2013ra'', a name given by its historical ancestor ''Keyho'' which loosely translates to as ''\u2018A place of people with Virtue and Integrity\u2019'' \n\nViswema is also known as ''Ve-sr-w\u00fc\u2013ra'' by the [[Chokri language|Chokri Chakhesangs]] and ''Sh\u00fcna\u2013mai'' by the [[Sopvoma language|Ememei Maos]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early period===\nThe history of Viswema, according to oral history begins with the founding of ''Kipizw\u00fc'', some two km west of the village by ''Viswe''. ''Viswe'' was a descendant of ''[[Keyho]]''.\n\nThe ancestors lived there for several generations till the invasion of the Burmese-[[Karens]], who were known to ''Viswe\u2013miko'' as ''Kheren\u00fcmi''. The defeat inflicted on the Burmese invaders gave a sense of confidence and ''Viswe\u2013mi'' became more assertive and grew in great numbers. They began to move out in search of suitable environment for permanent settlement. They therefore came down to the present site of the village.\n\nIn the past Viswema was known for making fine pottery ware.

The armies could only defeat the village on its third attempt.\n\nBefore the invasion began a Manipuri messenger was sent to Viswema with something tied in a piece of cloth. When the parcel reached Viswema and the cloth was unwrapped, they found out it was ash. So the entire village intellectuals gathered around to figure out what it meant until someone stood up and said ''\u201cit means they will burn down our village to ashes.\u201d'' And so the Viswemis agreed to this and sent the messenger back to [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] with grinded [[Naga Morich|Naga King Chilly]] tied in the same piece of cloth meaning ''\u201cAttack us if you want to know what pain feels like.\u201d''\n| source = - Oral history.\n| align = left\n| width = 30%\n}}\n\nThe Manipuris invaded Viswema twice, but could not succeed in subduing it. However, after the end of the [[Anglo-Naga war]] in 1879 the British occupied Kohima and setup a military post and built strong barricade around the station with armed police. But the garrison was besieged by Naga warriors. Meantime the British sought help from the Manipuri Raja. The [[Chandrakirti Singh|Manipuri Raja Chandrakirti Singh]] led around a thousand of his army and rushed to Kohima and after a brief engagement with the Naga warriors lifted the sieged and saved the British.\n\nThe Manipuri Army went on a rampage and captured a Kohima boy and buried him alive in the heart of the town. They covered the grave with a huge stone on which the foot print of the Manipuri Raja was engraved. This stone was removed by the Naga Youth Movement leaders in 1956.\n\nAt the time of the Manipuri army withdrawal from Kohima, the ''Viswe\u2013miko'' left their village and hid their food grains in trenches and waited for their return from Kohima. When the Manipuris arrived and finding none set the village ablaze and proceeded homewards. Viswema warriors then attacked them from the rear, throwing them in confusion and disorder. Many were killed and their arms looted, while the rest fled to their country.\n\n===Modern era===\n'''World War II'''\n{{main|World War II}}\nWhen the [[Operation U-Go|Japanese]] and [[Indian National Army|INA]] soldiers entered Naga Hills in early April 1944, many of them stayed at the outskirt of the village. They dug trenches and built strong bunkers everywhere in the vicinity of the village. Since the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] operation against Japanese occupation of Kohima, Viswema was continuously hit by explosive missiles which were fired by cannons from Kohima and later on from [[Kigwema]] as launching pads. Many people were killed and injured. On 10 June 1944, a message from the Allies sources was conveyed to the village elders telling them to evacuate their village. The village was evacuated the next day. Bombings on 14 June continued till the village which had more than 600 houses at that time was completely razed to the ground. The same evening the Japanese forces at Viswema retreated to the route by which they had entered Naga Hills two months back. Viswema was then taken over by the Allies. <ref name=\"Towards a Better World\">Vizol Khamo, Akhale.: ''Towards a Better World'', 2016. Heritage Publishing House.

''Viswe'' was a descendant of ''[[Keyho]]''.\n\nThe ancestors lived there for several generations till the invasion of the Burmese-[[Karens]], who were known to ''Viswe\u2013miko'' as ''Kheren\u00fcmi''. The defeat inflicted on the Burmese invaders gave a sense of confidence and ''Viswe\u2013mi'' became more assertive and grew in great numbers. They began to move out in search of suitable environment for permanent settlement. They therefore came down to the present site of the village.\n\nIn the past Viswema was known for making fine pottery ware. For any function and rituals earthen pots were purchased from Viswema by neighboring communities.\n\n===Pre-Modern era===\n'''Invasion of the Manipuri armies'''\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"It was said that the Manipuris could not subdue Viswema given its large size. The armies could only defeat the village on its third attempt.\n\nBefore the invasion began a Manipuri messenger was sent to Viswema with something tied in a piece of cloth. When the parcel reached Viswema and the cloth was unwrapped, they found out it was ash. So the entire village intellectuals gathered around to figure out what it meant until someone stood up and said ''\u201cit means they will burn down our village to ashes.\u201d'' And so the Viswemis agreed to this and sent the messenger back to [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] with grinded [[Naga Morich|Naga King Chilly]] tied in the same piece of cloth meaning ''\u201cAttack us if you want to know what pain feels like.\u201d''\n| source = - Oral history.\n| align = left\n| width = 30%\n}}\n\nThe Manipuris invaded Viswema twice, but could not succeed in subduing it. However, after the end of the [[Anglo-Naga war]] in 1879 the British occupied Kohima and setup a military post and built strong barricade around the station with armed police. But the garrison was besieged by Naga warriors. Meantime the British sought help from the Manipuri Raja. The [[Chandrakirti Singh|Manipuri Raja Chandrakirti Singh]] led around a thousand of his army and rushed to Kohima and after a brief engagement with the Naga warriors lifted the sieged and saved the British.\n\nThe Manipuri Army went on a rampage and captured a Kohima boy and buried him alive in the heart of the town. They covered the grave with a huge stone on which the foot print of the Manipuri Raja was engraved. This stone was removed by the Naga Youth Movement leaders in 1956.\n\nAt the time of the Manipuri army withdrawal from Kohima, the ''Viswe\u2013miko'' left their village and hid their food grains in trenches and waited for their return from Kohima. When the Manipuris arrived and finding none set the village ablaze and proceeded homewards. Viswema warriors then attacked them from the rear, throwing them in confusion and disorder. Many were killed and their arms looted, while the rest fled to their country.\n\n===Modern era===\n'''World War II'''\n{{main|World War II}}\nWhen the [[Operation U-Go|Japanese]] and [[Indian National Army|INA]] soldiers entered Naga Hills in early April 1944, many of them stayed at the outskirt of the village. They dug trenches and built strong bunkers everywhere in the vicinity of the village. Since the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] operation against Japanese occupation of Kohima, Viswema was continuously hit by explosive missiles which were fired by cannons from Kohima and later on from [[Kigwema]] as launching pads. Many people were killed and injured. On 10 June 1944, a message from the Allies sources was conveyed to the village elders telling them to evacuate their village. The village was evacuated the next day. Bombings on 14 June continued till the village which had more than 600 houses at that time was completely razed to the ground. The same evening the Japanese forces at Viswema retreated to the route by which they had entered Naga Hills two months back. Viswema was then taken over by the Allies. <ref name=\"Towards a Better World\">Vizol Khamo, Akhale.: ''Towards a Better World'', 2016. Heritage Publishing House.

The rugged construction of this steel-hulled vessel, combined with her speed and endurance, make ''Salvor'' well-suited for rescue and salvage operations throughout the world. The hull below the waterline is ice-strengthened. Her propulsion plant can develop 4200 [[shaft horsepower]] with four [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]]&nbsp;399 [[diesel engine]]s coupled in pairs to two shafts. She is fitted with a [[Controllable pitch propeller|Controllable Reversible Pitch (CRP) propeller]] within a [[Kort nozzle]] on each shaft. The CRP propeller/Kort nozzle combination produces greater thrust and more maneuverability control than conventional propellers. ''Salvor'' is also configured with a [[bow thruster]] which provides athwartship thrust for additional control of the [[bow (ship)|bow]] when the ship's speed is less than five knots (9&nbsp;km/h).\n\nIn 1995 and again in 2000, ''Salvor'' was the [[United States Pacific Fleet]]'s winner of the [[Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award]] for most battle-ready ship of her type.\n\nUSS ''Salvor'' was decommissioned and transferred to the Military Sealift Command in January 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=27363 |title=USS Salvor Decommissions, Transfers to MSC |last=Jones |first=Keith |date=19 January 2007 |website=U.S. Navy Fleet Public Affairs Center Detachment Hawaii |access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> ''Salvor'' was redesignated as '''USNS ''Salvor'' (T-ARS 52)'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=182 |title=Ship Inventory: Rescue and Salvage Ships |website=[[Military Sealift Command]] |access-date=13 February 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044431/http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=182 |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url={{NVR url|id=ARS52}} |title=USNS Salvor (T-ARS 52) |website=[[Naval Vessel Register]] |access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> The ship has undergone modifications for civilian crewing as well as automation and control system upgrades at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]].\n\n==Mission and capabilities==\nLike all Safeguard class rescue and salvage ships, ''Salvor'' serves as an element of the United States Navy's Combat Logistics Support Force and provides rescue and salvage services to the fleet at sea. She also supported the protection of forces ashore through post-assault salvage operations in close proximity to the shore.

The rugged construction of this steel-hulled vessel, combined with her speed and endurance, make ''Salvor'' well-suited for rescue and salvage operations throughout the world. The hull below the waterline is ice-strengthened. Her propulsion plant can develop 4200 [[shaft horsepower]] with four [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]]&nbsp;399 [[diesel engine]]s coupled in pairs to two shafts. She is fitted with a [[Controllable pitch propeller|Controllable Reversible Pitch (CRP) propeller]] within a [[Kort nozzle]] on each shaft. The CRP propeller/Kort nozzle combination produces greater thrust and more maneuverability control than conventional propellers. ''Salvor'' is also configured with a [[bow thruster]] which provides athwartship thrust for additional control of the [[bow (ship)|bow]] when the ship's speed is less than five knots (9&nbsp;km/h).\n\nIn 1995 and again in 2000, ''Salvor'' was the [[United States Pacific Fleet]]'s winner of the [[Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award]] for most battle-ready ship of her type.\n\nUSS ''Salvor'' was decommissioned and transferred to the Military Sealift Command in January 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=27363 |title=USS Salvor Decommissions, Transfers to MSC |last=Jones |first=Keith |date=19 January 2007 |website=U.S. Navy Fleet Public Affairs Center Detachment Hawaii |access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> ''Salvor'' was redesignated as '''USNS ''Salvor'' (T-ARS 52)'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=182 |title=Ship Inventory: Rescue and Salvage Ships |website=[[Military Sealift Command]] |access-date=13 February 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044431/http://www.msc.navy.mil/inventory/ships.asp?ship=182 |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url={{NVR url|id=ARS52}} |title=USNS Salvor (T-ARS 52) |website=[[Naval Vessel Register]] |access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> The ship has undergone modifications for civilian crewing as well as automation and control system upgrades at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]].\n\n==Mission and capabilities==\nLike all Safeguard class rescue and salvage ships, ''Salvor'' serves as an element of the United States Navy's Combat Logistics Support Force and provides rescue and salvage services to the fleet at sea.

Johnson Series&nbsp;322 double-drum automatic towing machine. Each drum carries {{convert|3000|ft}} of {{convert|2+1/4|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} drawn galvanized, 6X37 right-hand lay, wire-rope towing hawsers, with closed zinc-poured sockets on the bitter end.

The winch has automatic payout but only manual recovery.<ref name=\"towman\"/><ref name=\"futuretowsalv\"/>\n\nThe ''Salvor''{{'s}} caprail is curved to fairlead and prevent chafing of the towing hawser. It includes two vertical stern rollers to tend the towing hawser directly aft and two Norman pin rollers to prevent the towing hawser from sweeping forward of the beam at the point of tow. The stern rollers and Norman pins are raised hydraulically and can withstand a lateral force of {{convert|50000|lb|kg}} at mid barrel.<ref name=\"towman\"/>\n\nTwo tow bows provide a safe working area on the fantail during towing operations.<ref name=\"towman\"/>\n\n===Manned diving operations===\n''Salvor'' has several diving systems to support different types of operations. Divers descend to diving depth on a diving stage that is lowered by one of two powered davits.\n\nThe diving locker is equipped with a double-lock [[hyperbaric chamber]] that can be used for recompression after deep dives or for the treatment of divers suffering from [[decompression sickness]].<ref name=\"salvor2003\"/>\n\nThe MK21 MOD1 diving system supports manned diving to depths of {{convert|190|ft}} on surfaced-supplied air.

The two bow rollers can be used together with linear hydraulic pullers to achieve a dynamic lift of 150&nbsp;tons. The stern rollers can be used with the automatic towing machine to provide a dynamic lift of 150&nbsp;tons.
