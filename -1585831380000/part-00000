ScanSoft was a [[Xerox]] spin-off that was bought in 1999 by [[Visioneer]], a hardware and software scanner company, which adopted ScanSoft as the new merged company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in [[Raymond Kurzweil#Mid-life|Kurzweil Computer Products]].\n\n==History==\nIn September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, and the resulting company adopted the Nuance name. For a decade prior to that, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== ScanSoft origins ===\nIn 1974, [[Raymond Kurzweil]] founded the '''Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.''' to develop the first omni-font optical character-recognition system{{snd}}a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font.<ref name=\"Kurzweil\">[http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/speechsynthesis/ss_kurz.htm \"Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.\"] ''Smithsonian Speech Synthesis History Project (SSSHP) 1986\u20132002''</ref> In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox.<ref name=\"Kurzweil\"/>  The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn March 1992, a new company called [[Visioneer|Visioneer, Inc.]] was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products, such as a sheetfed scanner called PaperMax<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/941128/archive_013727_3.htm |title= Neat Gadgets to Drool Over |date=November 20, 1994 |first1=Mary Kathleen |last1=Flynn |first2=Leonard |last2=Wiener |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013202908/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/941128/archive_013727_3.htm |archivedate=2012-10-13}}</ref> and the document management software [[PaperPort]]. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999.  Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the new company-wide name.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nPrior to 2001, ScanSoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as TextBridge,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100104201733/http://www.nuance.com/textbridge TextBridge Pro 11]</ref> PaperPort and [[OmniPage]]. Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of [[Lernout & Hauspie]], the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Nuance history prior to the 2005 merger with ScanSoft ===\nNuance was founded in 1994 as a spin-off of [[SRI International]]'s Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory to commercialize the speaker-independent speech recognition technology developed for the US government at SRI. Based in [[Menlo Park, California]], Nuance deployed their first commercial large-scale speech application in 1996. Their initial route to market was through call center automation. Call centers had just centralized the branch-office telephone handling function throughout many large companies. The highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff. Early projects were completely developed by Nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nEarly Nuance applications ran on Windows NT-based and Solaris operating systems, and commonly relied on [[Eicon|Dialogic]] boards for the telephony hardware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1994, Nuance was spun off from SRI's STAR Lab. Two years later, Nuance deployed its first commercial speech application. On 13 April 2000, Nuance filed an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUAN. On 15 November 2000, Nuance acquired SpeechFront voice instant messaging company for $10.5 million in cash and stock.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n<!--* ''(Description/chronology of Nuance's actual speech product offerings needed!)''-->\n\nIn simple terms, the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases. Its key advantage over technologies such as [[ViaVoice]] was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker. This permitted the use of the system, so-called speaker-independent natural-language [[speech recognition]] (abbreviated as SI-NLSR or just NLSR), for call automation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases. In complex systems this could be in the low millions. At the time, these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity [[Intel]] [[x86]] servers until the early 2000s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nDuring the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Nuance competed against other NLSR vendors including [[Dragon Systems|Dragon]], [[Philips]] SpeechPearl, [[SpeechWorks]] and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused, such as [[Vocalis plc|Vocalis]] in the UK which used proprietary PCI cards with DSPs on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nEach speech-recognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds. Determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself. Languages are \"modeled\", samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model. The higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user, especially in complex interactions. Different language models were required for different dialects such as Flemish, which is a variant of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or [[Swiss Germa]]n, a dialect of [[High German]]. Different models were also created for different qualities of the telephone connection. Europe's [[Philips]] had by far the largest language coverage, which included [[Flemish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nLater, Nuance sold licenses (training and consulting) to their technology to third parties, including independent software vendors and [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) vendors who would build applications on top of an IVR platform. SpeechWorks, on the other hand, would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners. The technology was integrated into most of the leading IVR products from Avaya, Nortel Periphonics, Envox, Syntellect and many others. The requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of UNIX.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 7 was launched in the late 1990s and was an efficient network-distributed NLSR speech recognition solution; it ran on Unix and Windows.  Nuance 8 added [[Language model|Statistical Language Modeling]], an adaption of technologies used in technologies, such as ViaVoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity. Nuance 8.x series also introduced the W3C vocabulary definition language GrXML in addition to and eventual replacement of Nuance's proprietary and very concise Grammar Specification Language, GSL.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 8.5 was the last point release before the takeover by ScanSoft. These systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as [[ViaVoice]], which is now also a Nuance product.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nWhile Nuance marketed their technology at call-center exhibitions, they rarely delivered solutions directly. Instead, Nuance relied on telecommunications partners, such as Nortel Periphonics, Avaya and Syntellect. Nuance realized that designing and developing speech-based solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional [[DTMF]] solutions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor a couple of years prior to the takeover by ScanSoft, Nuance started selling products directly, including their call-routing product (\"Call Steering\"), which determined the \"skill group\" required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 9.0 is the first release (excluding service packs) of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including Philips Speech Pearl, Speechworks, Nuance Recognizer and others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==== Partnership with the Siri and Apple Inc. ====\n[[Siri]] is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced natural-language processing. The artificial intelligence, which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload, allows software to understand words and their intentions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wildstrom|first=Steve|title=Nuance Exec on iPhone 4s, Siri, and the Future of Speech|url=http://techpinions.com/nuance-exec-on-iphone-4s-siri-and-the-future-of-speech/3307|publisher=TechPinions|accessdate=10 October 2011 |quote=[Vladimir Sejnoha] declined to discuss Nuance's role in the iPhone 4S}}</ref>\n\n==== Telephony application process ====\n* User invokes the telephony application for call automation\n* Application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question, opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software.\n* User speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer.\n* Recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct.\n\n==== Recognizer process ====\n* Determines the start of speech input\n* uses audio techniques to remove background noise\n* slices the audio into small sections (10 to 100 ms in length)\n* determines the sound in each slice\n* matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrases{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Topology ===\nA typical Nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started, often monitored by a sixth application.\n*NLM: Nuance License Manager: kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use.\n*Nrecclient: recognition client: it is the interface between the IVR speech path and the speech recognizing software, the recserver.

The resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Acquisitions===\nPrior to the 2005 merger, ScanSoft acquired other companies to expand its business.  Unlike ScanSoft, Nuance did not actively acquire companies prior to their merger other than the notable acquisition of Rhetorical Systems in November 2004 for $6.7m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/nuance-acquires-rhetorical-systems--785480f1|title=Nuance Communications acquires Rhetorical Systems|website=Crunchbase}}</ref> After the merger, the company continued to grow through acquisition.\n\n====ScanSoft acquisitions prior to the merger====\n* March 2000 \u2013 Caere Corp., of [[Los Gatos, California]] \u2013 $145 million.

ScanSoft was a [[Xerox]] spin-off that was bought in 1999 by [[Visioneer]], a hardware and software scanner company, which adopted ScanSoft as the new merged company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in [[Raymond Kurzweil#Mid-life|Kurzweil Computer Products]].\n\n==History==\nIn September 2005, ScanSoft Inc. acquired and merged with Nuance Communications, and the resulting company adopted the Nuance name. For a decade prior to that, the two companies competed in the commercial large-scale speech application business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== ScanSoft origins ===\nIn 1974, [[Raymond Kurzweil]] founded the '''Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.''' to develop the first omni-font optical character-recognition system{{snd}}a computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font.<ref name=\"Kurzweil\">[http://americanhistory.si.edu/archives/speechsynthesis/ss_kurz.htm \"Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc.\"] ''Smithsonian Speech Synthesis History Project (SSSHP) 1986\u20132002''</ref> In 1980, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox.<ref name=\"Kurzweil\"/>  The company became known as Xerox Imaging Systems (XIS), and later ScanSoft.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn March 1992, a new company called [[Visioneer|Visioneer, Inc.]] was founded to develop scanner hardware and software products, such as a sheetfed scanner called PaperMax<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/941128/archive_013727_3.htm |title= Neat Gadgets to Drool Over |date=November 20, 1994 |first1=Mary Kathleen |last1=Flynn |first2=Leonard |last2=Wiener |publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013202908/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/941128/archive_013727_3.htm |archivedate=2012-10-13}}</ref> and the document management software [[PaperPort]]. Visioneer eventually sold its hardware division to Primax Electronics, Ltd. in January 1999.  Two months later, in March, Visioneer acquired ScanSoft from Xerox to form a new public company with ScanSoft as the new company-wide name.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nPrior to 2001, ScanSoft focused primarily on desktop imaging software such as TextBridge,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100104201733/http://www.nuance.com/textbridge TextBridge Pro 11]</ref> PaperPort and [[OmniPage]]. Beginning with the December 2001 acquisition of [[Lernout & Hauspie]], the company moved into the speech recognition business and began to compete with Nuance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Nuance history prior to the 2005 merger with ScanSoft ===\nNuance was founded in 1994 as a spin-off of [[SRI International]]'s Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory to commercialize the speaker-independent speech recognition technology developed for the US government at SRI. Based in [[Menlo Park, California]], Nuance deployed their first commercial large-scale speech application in 1996. Their initial route to market was through call center automation. Call centers had just centralized the branch-office telephone handling function throughout many large companies. The highest cost of running call centers is the cost of staff. Early projects were completely developed by Nuance to prove the commercial practicality and benefits.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nEarly Nuance applications ran on Windows NT-based and Solaris operating systems, and commonly relied on [[Eicon|Dialogic]] boards for the telephony hardware.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 1994, Nuance was spun off from SRI's STAR Lab. Two years later, Nuance deployed its first commercial speech application. On 13 April 2000, Nuance filed an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUAN. On 15 November 2000, Nuance acquired SpeechFront voice instant messaging company for $10.5 million in cash and stock.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n<!--* ''(Description/chronology of Nuance's actual speech product offerings needed!)''-->\n\nIn simple terms, the technology produced allowed a computer to determine what a speaker was saying within a specific and limited vocabulary of phrases. Its key advantage over technologies such as [[ViaVoice]] was that the system did not need training for the specific speaker. This permitted the use of the system, so-called speaker-independent natural-language [[speech recognition]] (abbreviated as SI-NLSR or just NLSR), for call automation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe limited vocabulary was typically a few thousand different variations of phrases. In complex systems this could be in the low millions. At the time, these systems were pushing the limits of computer processing power in commodity [[Intel]] [[x86]] servers until the early 2000s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nDuring the late 1990s and into the 2000s, Nuance competed against other NLSR vendors including [[Dragon Systems|Dragon]], [[Philips]] SpeechPearl, [[SpeechWorks]] and other smaller players which were typically geographically focused, such as [[Vocalis plc|Vocalis]] in the UK which used proprietary PCI cards with DSPs on board to improve the efficiency and density of the system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nEach speech-recognition engine provider had to determine how to convert written text into sounds. Determining how written text is spoken is a hugely challenging task in itself. Languages are \"modeled\", samples of real spoken language is recorded and analyzed to create a language model. The higher the quality the language model the better the experience of the user, especially in complex interactions. Different language models were required for different dialects such as Flemish, which is a variant of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], or [[Swiss Germa]]n, a dialect of [[High German]]. Different models were also created for different qualities of the telephone connection. Europe's [[Philips]] had by far the largest language coverage, which included [[Flemish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nLater, Nuance sold licenses (training and consulting) to their technology to third parties, including independent software vendors and [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) vendors who would build applications on top of an IVR platform. SpeechWorks, on the other hand, would typically deliver the application with the technology or with a group of key delivery partners. The technology was integrated into most of the leading IVR products from Avaya, Nortel Periphonics, Envox, Syntellect and many others. The requirements of telephony reliability meant many of these solutions ran on various versions of UNIX.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 7 was launched in the late 1990s and was an efficient network-distributed NLSR speech recognition solution; it ran on Unix and Windows.  Nuance 8 added [[Language model|Statistical Language Modeling]], an adaption of technologies used in technologies, such as ViaVoice to improve the range of phrases that the system could recognize at the expense of greater implementation cost and complexity. Nuance 8.x series also introduced the W3C vocabulary definition language GrXML in addition to and eventual replacement of Nuance's proprietary and very concise Grammar Specification Language, GSL.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 8.5 was the last point release before the takeover by ScanSoft. These systems were significantly different from the technology used in consumer speech recognition products such as [[ViaVoice]], which is now also a Nuance product.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nWhile Nuance marketed their technology at call-center exhibitions, they rarely delivered solutions directly. Instead, Nuance relied on telecommunications partners, such as Nortel Periphonics, Avaya and Syntellect. Nuance realized that designing and developing speech-based solutions requires a different skill set and to that of traditional [[DTMF]] solutions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor a couple of years prior to the takeover by ScanSoft, Nuance started selling products directly, including their call-routing product (\"Call Steering\"), which determined the \"skill group\" required for the call based on responses to reasonably open questions asked of the caller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nNuance 9.0 is the first release (excluding service packs) of the recognizer product since the acquisition and is an amalgam of the technologies acquired from various companies including Philips Speech Pearl, Speechworks, Nuance Recognizer and others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==== Partnership with the Siri and Apple Inc. ====\n[[Siri]] is an application that combines speech recognition with advanced natural-language processing. The artificial intelligence, which required both advances in the underlying algorithms and leaps in processing power both on mobile devices and the servers that share the workload, allows software to understand words and their intentions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wildstrom|first=Steve|title=Nuance Exec on iPhone 4s, Siri, and the Future of Speech|url=http://techpinions.com/nuance-exec-on-iphone-4s-siri-and-the-future-of-speech/3307|publisher=TechPinions|accessdate=10 October 2011 |quote=[Vladimir Sejnoha] declined to discuss Nuance's role in the iPhone 4S}}</ref>\n\n==== Telephony application process ====\n* User invokes the telephony application for call automation\n* Application loads the phrases for the application and prompts the user to ask a question, opening a stream from the telephony input to the speech recognition software.\n* User speaks and this is streamed to the recognizer.\n* Recognizer returns a number of potential results with probability for each one that it is correct.\n\n==== Recognizer process ====\n* Determines the start of speech input\n* uses audio techniques to remove background noise\n* slices the audio into small sections (10 to 100 ms in length)\n* determines the sound in each slice\n* matches the combination of sounds for the spoken phrase with the possible sound combinations provided by the possible phrases{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Topology ===\nA typical Nuance recognizer configuration required four or five applications to be started, often monitored by a sixth application.\n*NLM: Nuance License Manager: kept a watch on the number of concurrent speech calls in use.\n*Nrecclient: recognition client: it is the interface between the IVR speech path and the speech recognizing software, the recserver.

The resource manager directs which resources it thinks are least utilized.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Acquisitions===\nPrior to the 2005 merger, ScanSoft acquired other companies to expand its business.  Unlike ScanSoft, Nuance did not actively acquire companies prior to their merger other than the notable acquisition of Rhetorical Systems in November 2004 for $6.7m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/nuance-acquires-rhetorical-systems--785480f1|title=Nuance Communications acquires Rhetorical Systems|website=Crunchbase}}</ref> After the merger, the company continued to grow through acquisition.\n\n====ScanSoft acquisitions prior to the merger====\n* March 2000 \u2013 Caere Corp., of [[Los Gatos, California]] \u2013 $145 million.

In the game, players control a [[goose]] who bothers the inhabitants of an English village. The player must use the goose's abilities to manipulate objects and [[non-player character]]s in order to complete specific objectives and progress through the game. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Untitled Goose Game'' originated from a [[stock photograph]] of a goose that a House House employee posted in the company's internal communications. This sparked a conversation about geese; the team put the idea aside for a few months until they realised that it had the potential to be a fun game. Inspired by ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the ''[[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]]'' series, House House worked on combining stealth mechanics with a lack of violence to create humorous in-game scenarios. The game's unusual name came from a last-minute decision in preparing the title as an entry for a games festival, and stuck.\n\n''Untitled Goose Game'' received positive reviews with critics praising its gameplay and humour, and was named the [[23rd Annual D.I.C.E. Awards|D.I.C.E. Game of the Year]] among other accolades. By 2019, the game sold more than a million copies, and became an [[Internet meme]], with video clips from the game being shared on social media.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSet in an idyllic English village, players control a [[goose]] that can honk, duck down, run, flap its wings, and grab objects with its beak to bother various human villagers. The village is split up into multiple areas, each of which has a list of objectives, such as stealing certain objects or tricking humans into doing certain things. When enough of these objectives are cleared (one fewer than the total), an additional objective is added which, once cleared, allows the goose to move on to the next area. After completing four areas, the goose enters a miniature model of the village. There, the goose steals a bell before going back through the previous areas while the villagers try to stop it. In the game's ending, it is revealed the goose had stolen many bells before the game's events. There are several hidden optional objectives, many of which require traversing multiple areas or completing an area within a time limit.<ref name=\"gamestm_206\" /><ref name=\"polygon_gdc\" />\n\n==Development and release==\n''Untitled Goose Game'' was developed by four-person indie studio [[House House]], based in [[Melbourne]], Australia.

The team put the idea aside for a few months until they realized that it had the potential to be a fun game. ''Untitled Goose Game'' was published by [[Panic (company)|Panic]] for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] on 20 September 2019.<ref name=\"polygon_switch\" /> The game is House House's second project, and like their debut, was supported by the government organisation [[Film Victoria]], who assisted the studio in getting set up properly.<ref name=\"gamestm_206\" /><ref name=\"guardian_pax\" />\n\nHouse House cited ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' as the initial inspiration for the type of game that they hoped to build. They wanted the player to control a character who could run around in a 3D environment. Their previous game, ''[[Push Me Pull You]]'', had 2D art with flat colours. They used a similar aesthetic in ''Untitled Goose Game'' by choosing to use [[low poly]] meshes, flat colours and untextured 3D models.<ref name=\"gamestm_206\" />\n\nThe game's playable character, the goose, was originally just a stock image and the idea was [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) would react to it. They implemented a system where the NPCs would tidy up after an item was moved. After restricting the field of view of the NPCs, the gameplay evolved into a unique stealth-like experience. Instead of remaining hidden like in most stealth games, the goal was to have the goose attract the attention of NPCs and not get caught.<ref name=\"gamestm_206\" /> House House created a structure to the game using missions with specific targets similar to the assassinations in the ''[[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]]'' series mostly as a joke. House House member Jake Strasser stated \"It has a set-up and a punchline. By removing the violence from it, we just let the situations exist as a joke.\"<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49852317 | title = How a horrible goose topped

\"the antithesis of what the goose was all about\", according to developer Nico Disseldorp.<ref name=\"bbc\"/> The name of ''Untitled Goose Game'' was a result of having to come up with a title quickly on learning that the game got accepted to be shown at the Fantastic Arcade part of the [[Fantastic Fest]] in Texas, and without any other ideas, used the title of the gameplay video they had

soundtrack, and to actually develop a \"reactive music\" system for the game.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra road to igf\"/> To accomplish this, Golding sliced two versions of the piano tracks \u2014 one performed normally, and the other performed quietly \u2014 up into roughly 400 sections. These sections were categorised based on intensity, and played based on what was happening in the game. For example, the game would play a section of the quieter version of ''Minstrels'' when the goose was stalking its prey, but switch to the regular version once the goose was being chased.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAn official soundtrack was released by [[Decca Records]] on 27 March 2020.<ref>https://twitter.com/dangolding/status/1243341610194104320</ref> It features both the regular and quiet versions of each track,<ref>https://twitter.com/dangolding/status/1243356089187364864</ref> as well as two original ones, called \"Waltz For House House\", which plays on the menu in the PlayStation 4 version of ''Untitled Goose Game'', and \"Untitled Goose Radio\", which includes every track played from the in-game radio.<ref>https://twitter.com/dangolding/status/1243356091368370177</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = NS: 81/100<ref name=\"mc_switch\" /><br />PC: 79/100<ref name=\"mc_pc\" /><br />PS4: 80/100<ref name=\"mc_ps4\" /><br />XONE: 81/100<ref name=\"mc_xone\" />\n| 4P = 77%<ref name=\"4p_review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.4players.de/4players.php/dispbericht/Switch/Test/41131/84040/0/Untitled_Goose_Game.html |title=Test: Untitled Goose Game |website=[[4Players]] |first=Matthias |last=Schmid |date=8 October 2019 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n| Destruct = 8.5/10<ref name=\"destruct_switch_review\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"gamerev_review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/597057-untitled-goose-game-review-pc-nintendo-switch |title=Untitled Goose Game Review {{!}} This beak was made for honkin' |website=[[Game Revolution]] |first=Paul |last=Tamburro |date=20 September 2019 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n| GI = 7.5/10<ref name=\"gi_ns_review\" />\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref name=\"gspot_review\" />\n| GStar = \n| IGN = 8/10<ref name=\"ign_review\" />\n| NLife = {{Rating|8|10}}<ref name=\"nlife_switch_review\" />\n| NWR = 8/10<ref name=\"nwr_ns_review\" />\n| PCG = 8/10<ref name=\"pcg_review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgames.de/Indie-Games-Thema-239276/Tests/Untitled-Goose-Game-Wertung-1333839/ |title=Test zu Untitled Goose Game: Kurz, aber innovativ und sehr charmant - ein Geheimtipp! |website=[[PC Games]] |first=Lukas |last=Schmid |date=5 October 2019 |accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n| USG = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"usg_switch_review\" />\n| VG = 8/10<ref name=\"vg_switch_review\" />\n}}\n\n''Untitled Goose Game'' received \"generally favourable\" reviews according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"mc_switch\" /><ref name=\"mc_pc\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/untitled-goose-game-the-kotaku-review-1838264644|title=Untitled Goose Game: The Kotaku Review|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n''[[IGN]]'' gave the game a 8/10 rating and praised its silliness stating, \"Untitled Goose Game is a brief but endlessly charming adventure that had me laughing, smiling, and eagerly honking the whole way through.\"<ref name=\"ign_review\" /> ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game for its silliness and creativity, but felt that the game was shallow and repetitive, stating, \"''Untitled Goose Game'' is a great concept, and ends in the same charming way it started.

There's little dialog, plenty of antics, and humans who keep getting outsmarted by birds. Unlike the titular Shaun from the show though, the goose in ''Untitled Goose Game'' is not a loveable little scamp who always comes to the aid of his friends.

title, but is simply referred to as ''Untitled Goose Game'' by the game's developers and most other sources.|name=|group=}} is a 2019 [[puzzle video game|puzzle]] [[stealth video game]] developed by [[House House]] and published by [[Panic (company)|Panic]]. In the game, players control a [[goose]] who bothers the inhabitants of an English village. The player must use the goose's abilities to manipulate objects and [[non-player character]]s in order to complete specific objectives and progress through the game. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Untitled Goose Game'' originated from a [[stock photograph]] of a goose that a House House employee posted in the company's internal communications. This sparked a conversation about geese; the team put the idea aside for a few months until they realised that it had the potential to be a fun game. Inspired by ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the ''[[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]]'' series, House House worked on combining stealth mechanics with a lack of violence to create humorous in-game scenarios. The game's unusual name came from a last-minute decision in preparing the title as an entry for a games festival, and stuck.\n\n''Untitled Goose Game'' received positive reviews with critics praising its gameplay and humour, and was named the [[23rd Annual D.I.C.E. Awards|D.I.C.E. Game of the Year]] among other accolades. By 2019, the game sold more than a million copies, and became an [[Internet meme]], with video clips from the game being shared on social media.\n\n==Gameplay==\nSet in an idyllic English village, players control a [[goose]] that can honk, duck down, run, flap its wings, and grab objects with its beak to bother various human villagers. The village is split up into multiple areas, each of which has a list of objectives, such as stealing certain objects or tricking humans into doing certain things. When enough of these objectives are cleared (one fewer than the total), an additional objective is added which, once cleared, allows the goose to move on to the next area. After completing four areas, the goose enters a miniature model of the village. There, the goose steals a bell before going back through the previous areas while the villagers try to stop it. In the game's ending, it is revealed the goose had stolen many bells before the game's events. There are several hidden optional objectives, many of which require traversing multiple areas or completing an area within a time limit.<ref name=\"gamestm_206\" /><ref name=\"polygon_gdc\" />\n\n==Development and release==\n''Untitled Goose Game'' was developed by four-person indie studio [[House House]], based in [[Melbourne]], Australia. The game originated from a [[stock photograph]] of a goose that an employee posted in the company's internal communications,<ref>{{cite tweet  |last= McMaster |first=Michael |author-link= |user=mjmcmaster |number=763596145452912640 |date=Aug 11, 2016 |title=People think game development means you get to play games all day, but they're wrong - it means you talk about geese |script-title= |trans-title= |language=en |retweet= |link= |access-date=2019-10-29 |archive-url= |archive-date= |url-status=}}</ref> which sparked a conversation about geese. The team put the idea aside for a few months until they realized that it had the potential to be a fun game. ''Untitled Goose Game'' was published by [[Panic (company)|Panic]] for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] on 20 September 2019.<ref name=\"polygon_switch\" /> The game is House House's second project, and like their debut, was supported by the government organisation [[Film Victoria]], who assisted the studio in getting set up properly.<ref name=\"gamestm_206\" /><ref name=\"guardian_pax\" />\n\nHouse House cited ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' as the initial inspiration for the type of game that they hoped to build. They wanted the player to control a character who could run around in a 3D environment. Their previous game, ''[[Push Me Pull You]]'', had 2D art with flat colours. They used a similar aesthetic in ''Untitled Goose Game'' by choosing to use [[low poly]] meshes, flat colours and untextured 3D models.<ref name=\"gamestm_206\" />\n\nThe game's playable character, the goose, was originally just a stock image and the idea was [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) would react to it. They implemented a system where the NPCs would tidy up after an item was moved. After restricting the field of view of the NPCs, the gameplay evolved into a unique stealth-like experience. Instead of remaining hidden like in most stealth games, the goal was to have the goose attract the attention of NPCs and not get caught.<ref name=\"gamestm_206\" /> House House created a structure to the game using missions with specific targets similar to the assassinations in the ''[[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]]'' series mostly as a joke. House House member Jake Strasser stated \"It has a set-up and a punchline. By removing the violence from it, we just let the situations exist as a joke.\"<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49852317 | title = How a horrible goose topped the gaming chart | date =2 October 2019 | accessdate = 2 October 2019 | publisher = [[BBC]] }}</ref> The team opted for the English village as the game's setting, as its \"properness\" was seen as \"the antithesis of what the goose was all about\", according to developer Nico Disseldorp.<ref name=\"bbc\"/> The name of ''Untitled Goose Game'' was a result of having to come up with a title quickly on learning that the game got accepted to be shown at the Fantastic Arcade part of the [[Fantastic Fest]] in Texas, and without any other ideas, used the title of the gameplay video they had applied with for the submission, which stuck since then.<ref name=\"CGoaT\" /> The ''Untitled Goose Game'' title stuck with fans when they started to promote the game on social media.<ref

team to recognise they had a popular concept on which to build.<ref name=\"bbc\"/>\n\nFollowing the initial trailer's release, ''Untitled Goose Game'' was present at the [[Game Developers

2019]], the game was announced to be released for [[Personal computer|PC]] on the [[Epic Games Store]].<ref name=\":0\" /> House House elaborated on their decision, stating that Epic's offer of an

Comments on the trailer praised the apparent \"reactive music\" system where the music stopped and started depending on the action in the game, though House House said later this was a misconception, as the stops and starts were actually part of Debussy's composition.<ref name=\"gamasutra road to igf\">{{cite web | url =

February 2020 | accessdate = 17 February 2020 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> The positive reception to the trailer's music led House House sought to include Debussy's work as part of the game's soundtrack, and to actually develop a \"reactive music\" system for the game.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"gamasutra road to igf\"/> To accomplish this, Golding sliced two versions of the piano tracks \u2014 one performed normally, and the other performed quietly \u2014 up into roughly 400 sections. These sections were categorised based on intensity, and played based on what was happening in the game. For example, the game would play a section of the quieter version of ''Minstrels'' when the goose was stalking its prey, but switch to the regular version once the goose was being chased.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAn official soundtrack was released by [[Decca Records]] on 27 March 2020.<ref>https://twitter.com/dangolding/status/1243341610194104320</ref> It features both the regular and quiet versions of each track,<ref>https://twitter.com/dangolding/status/1243356089187364864</ref> as well as two original ones, called \"Waltz For House House\", which plays on the menu in the PlayStation 4 version of ''Untitled Goose Game'', and \"Untitled Goose Radio\", which includes every track played from the in-game radio.<ref>https://twitter.com/dangolding/status/1243356091368370177</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = NS: 81/100<ref name=\"mc_switch\" /><br />PC: 79/100<ref name=\"mc_pc\" /><br />PS4: 80/100<ref name=\"mc_ps4\" /><br />XONE: 81/100<ref name=\"mc_xone\" />\n| 4P = 77%<ref name=\"4p_review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.4players.de/4players.php/dispbericht/Switch/Test/41131/84040/0/Untitled_Goose_Game.html |title=Test: Untitled Goose Game |website=[[4Players]] |first=Matthias |last=Schmid |date=8 October 2019 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n| Destruct = 8.5/10<ref name=\"destruct_switch_review\" />\n| GameRev = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"gamerev_review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/597057-untitled-goose-game-review-pc-nintendo-switch |title=Untitled Goose Game Review {{!}} This beak was made for honkin' |website=[[Game Revolution]] |first=Paul |last=Tamburro |date=20 September 2019 |accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n| GI = 7.5/10<ref name=\"gi_ns_review\" />\n| GSpot = 8/10<ref name=\"gspot_review\" />\n| GStar = \n| IGN = 8/10<ref name=\"ign_review\" />\n| NLife = {{Rating|8|10}}<ref name=\"nlife_switch_review\" />\n| NWR = 8/10<ref name=\"nwr_ns_review\" />\n| PCG = 8/10<ref name=\"pcg_review\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgames.de/Indie-Games-Thema-239276/Tests/Untitled-Goose-Game-Wertung-1333839/ |title=Test zu Untitled Goose Game: Kurz, aber innovativ und sehr charmant - ein Geheimtipp! |website=[[PC Games]] |first=Lukas |last=Schmid |date=5 October 2019 |accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n| USG = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"usg_switch_review\" />\n| VG = 8/10<ref name=\"vg_switch_review\" />\n}}\n\n''Untitled Goose Game'' received \"generally favourable\" reviews according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"mc_switch\" /><ref name=\"mc_pc\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/untitled-goose-game-the-kotaku-review-1838264644|title=Untitled Goose Game: The Kotaku Review|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|website=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n''[[IGN]]'' gave the game a 8/10 rating and praised its silliness stating, \"Untitled Goose Game is a brief but endlessly charming adventure that had me laughing, smiling, and eagerly honking the whole way through.\"<ref name=\"ign_review\" /> ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game for its silliness and creativity, but felt that the game was shallow and repetitive, stating, \"''Untitled Goose Game'' is a great concept, and ends in the same charming way it started. Pranking people is fun, and doing it as a goose just adds to the thrill. Most people will play it for the silly premise, complete it in a few hours, and go on their merry way without touching it again.

There's little dialog, plenty of antics, and humans who keep getting outsmarted by birds. Unlike the titular Shaun from the show though, the goose in ''Untitled Goose Game'' is not a loveable little scamp who always comes to the aid of his friends. No, this goose is a dick.\"<ref name=\"destruct_switch_review\" /> ''[[Kotaku]]'' gave the game a positive review, praising the gameplay and the understated humour of its \"brief, endlessly funny interactions\", and finding \"an insidious joy in drawing out increasingly infuriated reactions from the small town's people\".<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n''Untitled Goose Game'' drew similar attention as ''[[Goat Simulator]]'', both sharing the nature of being animal-based sandbox-style games to create chaos in.
