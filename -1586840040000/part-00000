Users create their products in the Teespring Launcher, where they can choose the color and type of item they would like to sell, and add a design.  Designs can be uploaded from outside of the platform, or be created using the text and image tools. No orders are processed, manufactured, or shipped, until the campaign has \"tipped,\" meaning that the sales goal was reached.\n\nTeespring handles the production and distribution of the products, as well as the customer service associated with any order placed on their site.\n\nAll products are printed or manufactured in different facilities internationally.<ref name=techcrunch2012 /> Teespring offers a variety of apparel including T-shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts, leggings and children's wear.  TeespringGo enables users to unlock and sell a wider range of products such as hats, phone cases, plushies and pins. \n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to founders Williams and Stites-Clayton, the inspiration for Teespring came in the spring of 2011 when the two wanted to sell T-shirts to commemorate the closing of a local bar. Rather than investing in a bulk order of shirts in various sizes, the Brown University seniors created their website in August 2011 where interested parties could submit pre-orders with their size and payment. The payment information would only be processed if they collected a minimum of 200 orders.\n\nOver 400 shirts were sold, and the two were able to process the buyers\u2019 payment information and successfully fulfill the orders.<ref name=techcrunch2012 /> After receiving numerous requests from other organizations asking for a custom campaign, Walker and Evan decided to pursue the concept of crowd-funded custom apparel full-time.\n\nRhode Island angel investors Bill Cesare and Mark Weiner invested the first $600,000 in seed funding. The company officially launched in October 2012 in Providence, Rhode Island.<ref name=techcrunch2012 />\n\nIn November 2014, the company announced closing its Series B funding round at $35 million from Khosla Ventures to continue to fuel its growth and expansion, which includes the addition of a new facility in Kentucky that's expected to create hundreds of jobs next year. Andreessen also participated in the round.<ref>https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/18/teespring-raises-35-million-series-b-from-khosla-ventures-as-it-prepares-to-expand-beyond-apparel/</ref>\n\n== Business model ==\n\nIndividuals create campaigns in order to sell custom products on Teespring.  Campaign creators are expected to design and market the product themselves. In exchange, Teespring will fulfill orders on campaigns that have reached their sales goal (called \u201ctipped\u201d campaigns), and will ship item(s) to buyers.<ref name=\"EOFteespring\">{{cite web|last=Dumas|first=John Lee|title=271: Walker Williams and Evan Stites-Clayton Talk T-shirts Via Teespring|url=http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/podcast/walker-williams-and-evan-stites-clayton-interview-of-teespring-com-and-john-lee-dumas-of-entrepreneur-on-fire/|publisher=Entrepreneur On Fire|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Products ==\nOnce a campaign has ended and successfully reached its sales goal, the shirts ordered by buyers are sourced to a screen-printing facility.

Users create their products in the Teespring Launcher, where they can choose the color and type of item they would like to sell, and add a design.  Designs can be uploaded from outside of the platform, or be created using the text and image tools. No orders are processed, manufactured, or shipped, until the campaign has \"tipped,\" meaning that the sales goal was reached.\n\nTeespring handles the production and distribution of the products, as well as the customer service associated with any order placed on their site.\n\nAll products are printed or manufactured in different facilities internationally.<ref name=techcrunch2012 /> Teespring offers a variety of apparel including T-shirts, hoodies, sweatshirts, leggings and children's wear.  TeespringGo enables users to unlock and sell a wider range of products such as hats, phone cases, plushies and pins. \n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to founders Williams and Stites-Clayton, the inspiration for Teespring came in the spring of 2011 when the two wanted to sell T-shirts to commemorate the closing of a local bar. Rather than investing in a bulk order of shirts in various sizes, the Brown University seniors created their website in August 2011 where interested parties could submit pre-orders with their size and payment. The payment information would only be processed if they collected a minimum of 200 orders.\n\nOver 400 shirts were sold, and the two were able to process the buyers\u2019 payment information and successfully fulfill the orders.<ref name=techcrunch2012 /> After receiving numerous requests from other organizations asking for a custom campaign, Walker and Evan decided to pursue the concept of crowd-funded custom apparel full-time.\n\nRhode Island angel investors Bill Cesare and Mark Weiner invested the first $600,000 in seed funding. The company officially launched in October 2012 in Providence, Rhode Island.<ref name=techcrunch2012 />\n\nIn November 2014, the company announced closing its Series B funding round at $35 million from Khosla Ventures to continue to fuel its growth and expansion, which includes the addition of a new facility in Kentucky that's expected to create hundreds of jobs next year.

Campaign creators are expected to design and market the product themselves. In exchange, Teespring will fulfill orders on campaigns that have reached their sales goal (called \u201ctipped\u201d campaigns), and will ship item(s) to buyers.<ref name=\"EOFteespring\">{{cite web|last=Dumas|first=John Lee|title=271: Walker Williams and Evan Stites-Clayton Talk T-shirts Via Teespring|url=http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/podcast/walker-williams-and-evan-stites-clayton-interview-of-teespring-com-and-john-lee-dumas-of-entrepreneur-on-fire/|publisher=Entrepreneur On Fire|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Products ==\nOnce a campaign has ended and successfully reached its sales goal, the shirts ordered by buyers are sourced to a screen-printing facility.

The unit's official symbol is '''bar'''; the earlier symbol '''b''' is now deprecated and conflicts with the use of '''b''' denoting the unit [[barn (unit)|barn]], but it is still encountered, especially as '''mb''' (rather than the proper '''mbar''') to denote the millibar.

Despite the millibar not being an [[SI]] unit, meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured air pressure in millibars as the values are convenient. After the advent of SI units, some meteorologists began using [[hectopascals]] (symbol hPa) which are numerically equivalent to millibars; for the same reason, the hectopascal is now the standard unit used to express barometric pressures in aviation in most countries. For example, the weather office of [[Environment Canada]] uses kilopascals and hectopascals on their weather maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/jet_stream/index_e.html|title=Canadian Weather at a Glance - Environment Canada|first=Environment|last=Canada|date=2013-04-16|website=www.weatheroffice.gc.ca|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102181014/http://weatheroffice.gc.ca/jet_stream/index_e.html|archivedate=2 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/canada_e.html|title=Canadian Weather - Environment Canada|first=Environment|last=Canada|date=2013-04-16|website=www.weatheroffice.gc.ca|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102180938/http://weatheroffice.gc.ca/canada_e.html|archivedate=2 January 2018}}</ref> In contrast, Americans are familiar with the use of the millibar in US reports of [[hurricane]]s and other cyclonic storms.<ref>[https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/90fwbg.gif US government atmospheric pressure map]</ref><ref>[https://s.w-x.co/util/image/map/WEB_Current_Weather_Map_1280x720.jpg?v=ap&w=1280&h=720&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0 The Weather Channel]</ref>\n\nIn fresh water, there is an approximate numerical equivalence between the change in pressure in decibars and the change in depth from the water surface in [[metre]]s.

In measurement of [[vacuum]] and in [[vacuum engineering]], residual pressures are typically given in millibar, although [[torr]] or [[millimeter of mercury]] (mmHg) were historically common.\n\nEngineers who specialize in technical safety for offshore petrochemical facilities never use \"pounds per square inch\" and must exclusively refer to explosion loads in units of bars. A bar is a convenient unit of measure for pressures generated by low frequency vapour cloud explosions that are commonly considered as part of accidental loading risk studies.\n\nIn the automotive field, [[turbocharger]] boost is described in bars except in the United States of America where \"pounds per square inch\" is often used.

The unit's official symbol is '''bar'''; the earlier symbol '''b''' is now deprecated and conflicts with the use of '''b''' denoting the unit [[barn (unit)|barn]], but it is still encountered, especially as '''mb''' (rather than the proper '''mbar''') to denote the millibar. Between 1793 and 1795, the word bar was used  for a unit of weight in an early version of the metric system.<ref>[[Grave (unit)]]</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\n[[File:Day5pressureforecast.png|thumb|Map showing atmospheric pressure in mbar or hPa]]\n[[File:ReifendruckPruefen.jpg|right|thumb|A [[tire pressure gauge]] displaying bar (outside) and [[pounds per square inch]] (inside)]]\n[[Atmospheric pressure|Atmospheric air pressure]] is often given in millibars, where [[standard atmospheric pressure]] is defined as 1013.25 mbar, 101.325&nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|kPa]], 1.01325&nbsp;bar, which is about {{convert|1.00|atm|psi|disp=out|abbr=off|lk=on}}.  Despite the millibar not being an [[SI]] unit, meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured air pressure in millibars as the values are convenient. After the advent of SI units, some meteorologists began using [[hectopascals]] (symbol hPa) which are numerically equivalent to millibars; for the same reason, the hectopascal is now the standard unit used to express barometric pressures in aviation in most countries. For example, the weather office of [[Environment Canada]] uses kilopascals and hectopascals on their weather maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/jet_stream/index_e.html|title=Canadian Weather at a Glance - Environment Canada|first=Environment|last=Canada|date=2013-04-16|website=www.weatheroffice.gc.ca|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102181014/http://weatheroffice.gc.ca/jet_stream/index_e.html|archivedate=2 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/canada_e.html|title=Canadian Weather - Environment Canada|first=Environment|last=Canada|date=2013-04-16|website=www.weatheroffice.gc.ca|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102180938/http://weatheroffice.gc.ca/canada_e.html|archivedate=2 January 2018}}</ref> In contrast, Americans are familiar with the use of the millibar in US reports of [[hurricane]]s and other cyclonic storms.<ref>[https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/sfc/90fwbg.gif US government atmospheric pressure map]</ref><ref>[https://s.w-x.co/util/image/map/WEB_Current_Weather_Map_1280x720.jpg?v=ap&w=1280&h=720&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0 The Weather Channel]</ref>\n\nIn fresh water, there is an approximate numerical equivalence between the change in pressure in decibars and the change in depth from the water surface in [[metre]]s. Specifically, an increase of 1 decibar occurs for every 1.019716&nbsp;m increase in depth. In sea water with respect to the gravity variation, the latitude and the geopotential anomaly the pressure can be converted into metres' depth according to an empirical formula (UNESCO Tech.

In measurement of [[vacuum]] and in [[vacuum engineering]], residual pressures are typically given in millibar, although [[torr]] or [[millimeter of mercury]] (mmHg) were historically common.\n\nEngineers that specialize in technical safety for offshore petrochemical facilities would be expected to exclusively refer to explosion loads in units of bar or bars. A bar is a convenient unit of measure for pressures generated by low frequency vapor cloud explosions that are commonly considered as part of accidental loading risk studies.\n\nIn the automotive field, [[turbocharger]] boost is often described in bars outside the United States. [[Tire pressure]] is often specified in bar.\n\n[[Unicode]] has characters for \"mb\" (\u33d4, U+33D4) and \"bar\" (\u3374, U+3374), but they exist only for compatibility with legacy Asian encodings and are not intended to be used in new documents.\n\nThe kilobar, equivalent to 100&nbsp;MPa, is commonly used in geological systems, particularly in experimental [[petrology]].\n\n\"Bar(a)\" and \"bara\" are sometimes used to indicate [[Pressure measurement#Absolute, gauge and differential|absolute pressures]] and \"bar(g)\" and \"barg\" for [[Pressure measurement#Absolute, gauge and differential|gauge pressures]].
