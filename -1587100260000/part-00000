It is the administrative and commercial centre for Moray. The town originated to the south of the [[River Lossie]] on the higher ground above the floodplain where the town of Birnie is. There, the church of Birnie Kirk was built in 1140 and serves the community to this day.  Elgin is first documented in the Cartulary of Moray in 1190 AD. It was created a [[royal burgh]] in the 12th century by King [[David I of Scotland]], and by that time had a castle on top of the present day Lady Hill to the west of the town. The people of Elgin are collectively known as Elginites. The origin of the name Elgin is likely to be Celtic, the oldest form of the name being Ailginn. 'Aille' literally signifying beauty, but in topography a beautiful spot or valley. The termination 'gin' or 'gan' are Celtic endings signifying little or diminutive forms, hence the little beautiful spot or valley. <ref>The Place names of Elginshire by Donald Matheson. Pg.139</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn August 1040, [[Macbeth of Scotland|MacBeth's]] army defeated and killed [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]] at Bothganowan (Pitgaveny), near Elgin. Elgin is first recorded in a charter of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1151 in which he granted an annuity to the Priory of Urquhart.<ref>Burgh Records of Scotland, Vol I, Preface, p.35</ref> David had made Elgin a royal burgh around 1130, after his defeat of [[\u00d3engus of Moray]]. During David's reign, the castle was established at the top of what is now Lady Hill. The town received a royal charter from [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] in 1224 when he granted the land for a new [[cathedral]] to Andrew, [[Bishop of Moray]]. This finally settled the episcopal see which had been at various times at Kinneddar, Birnie and [[Spynie Palace|Spynie]]. Elgin was a popular residence for the early [[Scotland|Scottish]] monarchs: [[David I of Scotland|David I]], [[William I of Scotland|William I]], [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] all held court there and hunted in the royal forests.\n\nOf these kings, Alexander II was Elgin's greatest benefactor and returned many times to his royal castle. He established the two religious houses of the town, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or Blackfriars on the west side and the [[Franciscans]] or Greyfriars in the east. Further to the east stood the Hospital of Maison Dieu, or House of God also founded during the reign of Alexander II for the reception of poor men and women.<ref>Mackintosh, Herbert B: Elgin Past and Present, Elgin, 1914 p. 44</ref>\n[[File:Scotland Elgin Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Elgin Cathedral]]\nOn 19 July 1224, the foundation stone of the new [[Elgin Cathedral]] was ceremoniously laid. The cathedral was completed sometime after 1242 but was completely destroyed by fire in 1270. The reasons for this are unrecorded. The buildings now remain as ruins date from the reconstruction following that fire. The Chartulary of Moray described the completed cathedral as \"Mirror of the country and the glory of the kingdom\".\n\n[[Edward I of England]] travelled twice to Elgin. During his first visit in 1296, he was impressed by what he saw. Preserved in the [[Cotton library]] now held in the [[British Library]] is the journal of his stay, describing the castle and the town of Elgin as \"bon chastell et bonne ville\" \u2014 good castle and good town. By his second visit in September 1303, the castle's wooden interior had been burned while held by the [[England|English]] governor, Henry de Rye. As a result, he only stayed in Elgin for two days and then camped at [[Kinloss Abbey]] from 13 September until 4 October. King Edward was furious when David de Moravia, Bishop of Moray, joined Scotland's cause with Bruce, and Edward appealed to the Pope who excommunicated the bishop, thus removing papal protection, causing him to flee to [[Orkney]], then to [[Norway]], only to return after Robert Bruce's victories against the English. After Edward's death in July 1307, [[Robert the Bruce]] retook Scotland in 1308, [[slighting]] castles to keep them out of English hands. David de Moravia, the Bishop of Moray at the head of his army, joined with Bruce and they slighted the castles of [[Inverness]], [[Nairn]] and [[Forres]] before seizing and slighting Kinneddar Castle, which also housed English soldiers. He attacked Elgin castle to be twice repulsed before finally succeeding.\n\nIn August 1370 [[Alexander Bur]], [[Bishop of Moray]] began payments to [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan|Alexander Stewart]], Wolf of Badenoch, [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III's]] brother, for the protection of his lands and men. In February 1390, the bishop then turned to Thomas Dunbar, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection. This action infuriated Stewart and in May he descended from his castle on an island in [[Lochindorb]] and burned the town of Forres in revenge. In June he burned much of Elgin, including two monasteries, St Giles Church, the Hospital of Maison Dieu and the cathedral. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' (a 15th-century history of Scotland) described this action by \"wyld, wykked Heland-men\". The rebuilding of the cathedral took many years; but much of it has since crumbled away due to the inferior quality of the stone made available to the 15th and 16th-century masons, while the 13th-century construction still remains. In 1506, the great central tower collapsed and although rebuilding work began the next year it was not completed till 1538.\n\n===From the Reformation to the eighteenth century===\n[[File:Elgin cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|275px|Elgin Cathedral]]\nThe citizens of Elgin and surrounding areas did not seem to object to the new religion following the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. In 1568 the lead was stripped from the roof of the cathedral, by order of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]]. The lead was to be sold and the proceeds to go to the maintenance of Regent Moray's soldiers, but the ship taking the lead cargo to [[Holland]] sank almost immediately on leaving Aberdeen harbour. Without this protection, the building began to deteriorate. In 1637, the rafters over the choir were blown down and in 1640 the minister of St Giles along with the Laird of Innes and [[Clan Brodie#17th century and Civil War|Alexander Brodie of Brodie]], all ardent [[Covenanters]], removed and destroyed the ornately carved screen and woodwork that had remained intact. The tracery of the West window was destroyed sometime between 1650 and 1660 by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s soldiers. On Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower collapsed for the second time in its history but caused much more damage. The rubble was quarried for various projects in the vicinity until 1807 when, through the efforts of Joseph King of Newmill, a wall was built around the cathedral and a keeper's house erected. Mountains of this rubble were cleared by one John Shanks, enabling visitors to view the ornate stonemasonry. John was presented with an ornate snuffbox by the authorities, it is now in Elgin Museum, he is also honoured with a large tombstone in the eastern Cathedral precincts.\n\nWhen [[Daniel Defoe]] toured Scotland in 1717, he visited Elgin and said:<blockquote>In this rich country is the city, or town rather, of Elgin; I say city, because in antient time the monks claim'd it for a city; and the cathedral shews, by its ruins, that it was a place of great magnificence. Nor must it be wonder'd at, if in so pleasant, so rich, and so agreeable a part of the country, all the rest being so differing from it, the clergy should seat themselves in a proportion'd number, seeing we must do them the justice to say, that if there is any place richer and more fruitful, and pleasant than another, they seldom fail to find it out. As the country is rich and pleasant, so here are a great many rich inhabitants, and in the town of Elgin in particular; for the gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh, or the court, for this part of the island, leave their Highland habitations in the winter and come and live here for the diversion of the place and plenty of provisions; and there is, on this account, a great variety of gentlemen for society, and that of all parties and of all opinions. This makes Elgin a very agreeable place to live in, notwithstanding its distance, being above 450 measur'd miles [725&nbsp;km] from London, and more, if we must go by Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Defoe1727\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Divided Into Circuits Or Journies.

Graves|pages=193\u2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe cathedral is known as the ''Lantern of the North.'' When Bishop Bur wrote to [[King Robert III]], complaining of the wanton destruction done to the building by the King's brother, the Wolf of Badenoch, he describes the cathedral as \"the ornament of this district, the glory of the kingdom and the admiration of foreigners.\" Chambers, in his ''Picture of Scotland'', says: <blockquote>It is an allowed fact, which the ruins seem still to attest, that this was by far the most splendid specimen of ecclesiastical architecture in Scotland, the abbey church of Melrose not excepted. It must be acknowledged that the edifice last mentioned is a wonderful instance of symmetry and elaborate decoration; yet in extent, in loftiness, in impressive magnificence, and even in minute decoration, Elgin has been manifestly superior. Enough still remains to impress the solitary traveller with a sense of admiration mixed with astonishment.</blockquote>Lachlan Shaw in his ''History of the Province of Moray'' was equally impressed when he wrote<blockquote>the church when entire was a building of Gothic architecture inferior to few in Europe.</blockquote>\n\n[[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] travelled to Elgin from Inverness in March 1746 and, falling ill with a feverish cold, stayed for 11 days before returning to await the arrival of the king's army. He stayed in Elgin with Mrs. Anderson, a passionate [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], at Thunderton House. She kept the sheets that the Prince slept on and was buried in them a quarter of a century later. The [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] passed through the town on 13 April, camping at Alves on the way to meet the Prince in battle on Drummossie Muir. After the battle, [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock]], one of the Prince's generals, was captured and taken to London and eventual execution, but he wrote to his friend from prison about his indebtedness to the shoemakers of Elgin: <blockquote>Beside my personal debts mentioned in general and particular in the State, there is one for which I am liable in justice, if it is not paid, owing to poor people who gave their work for it by my orders. It was at Elgin in Murray, the Regiment I commanded wanted shoes. I commissioned something about seventy pair of shoes and brogues, which might come to 3 shillngs or three shillings and sixpence each, one with the other. The magistrates divided them among the shoemakers of the town and country, and each shoemaker furnished his proportion. I drew on the town, for the price, out of the composition laid on them, but I was afterwards told at Inverness that, it was believed, the composition was otherwise applied, and the poor shoemakers not paid. As these poor people wrought by my orders, it will be a great ease to my heart to think they are not to lose by me, as too many have done in the course of that year, but had I lived I might have made some inquiry after but now it is impossible, as their hardships in loss of horses and such things, which happeened through my soldiers, are so interwoven with what was done by other people, that it would be very hard, if not impossible, to separate them. If you'll write to Mr. Innes of Dalkinty at Elgin (with whom I was quartered when I lay there), he will send you an account of the shoes, and if they were paid to the shoemakers or no; and if they are not, I beg you'll get my wife, or my successors to pay them when they can ...</blockquote>\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:Dr Grays Hospital.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dr Grays Hospital]]\nIn the 19th century, the old medieval town of Elgin was swept away. The first major addition to the town centre was the Assembly Rooms, built in 1821 by the Trinity Lodge of [[Freemasons]], at the corner of High Street and North Street. In 1819, Dr. Gray's Hospital was built on unused ground. The building has imposing columns and distinctive dome. Dr. Alexander Gray, a doctor who worked for and made his fortune with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], endowed \u00a326,000 for the hospital. In 1828 the new parish church of St Giles was built at a cost of \u00a310,000. Lt. General Andrew Anderson, born in Elgin, also of the East India Company, died in 1824 and bequeathed \u00a370,000 to the town to found an institution for the welfare of the elderly poor and for the education of orphans. The Anderson Institute was built in the east end of the town in 1832 with accommodation for 50 children and 10 elderly people. The Burgh Court House was built in 1841, the museum in 1842 and the County Buildings in 1866.\n\nThe [[Morayshire Railway]] was officially opened in ceremonies at Elgin and [[Lossiemouth]] on 10 August 1852, the steam engines having been delivered to Lossiemouth by sea. It was the first railway north of Aberdeen and initially ran only  {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} between Elgin and Lossiemouth. It was later extended south to Craigellachie. The Great North of Scotland Railway took over the working of the line in 1863 and bought the company in 1881 following the Morayshire Railway's return to solvency from crippling debt. The railway and Lossiemouth harbour became very important to Elgin's economy.\n\nThe town was becoming prosperous, and by 1882 it had a Head Post Office with a savings bank, insurance and telegraph departments, and branches of the Bank of Scotland and the British Linen Company, Caledonian, Commercial, North of Scotland, Royal and Union Banks, and the National Securities Savings Bank, offices or agencies of 48 insurance companies, five hotels, and a newspaper. It was not until the 20th century, however, that the separate villages of Bishopmill and New Elgin would be incorporated into the town.\n\nThe [[Cooper Park drill hall, Elgin|Cooper Park drill hall]] was completed in 1908.<ref name=canmore>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/331416/elgin-cooper-park-drill-hall|title=Elgin, Cooper Park, Drill Hall|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and geology==\nThe modern town straddles the River Lossie, with the suburbs of Bishopmill to the north and New Elgin to the south.\n[[Permian|Permo]]-[[Triassic]] rocks, rare in Scotland, are commonly found around Elgin. These are composed of [[aeolian sandstone]] formed when this area was subjected to desert conditions. Quarry Wood, on the town's edge, has a formation nicknamed Cuttie's Hillock which produced the internationally known fossils called the [[Elgin Reptiles]]. In the Elgin district, boulders belonging to the lowest group of Jurassic strata, Oxford clay and chalk are found both in glacial deposits and on the surface of the ground. The largest of these deposits is at Linksfield, where limestone and shale lie on boulder clay. There is a large hill in Elgin's town center, often viewed as the highlight of the Elgin tourist trail.\n\n{{clear}}\n{{wide image|Elgin Panorama 01.jpg|1200px|Panorama of Elgin from the northern spire of [[Elgin Cathedral]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\nElgin's climate is [[temperate]] [[Maritime climate|maritime]], with cool summers and relatively mild winters due to its proximity to the sea. Rainfall is quite low as it is in the [[rain shadow]] of mountains to the west and southwest.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Elgin, elevation: {{convert|18|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, 1981-2010

civilians. In 2005, [[RAF Lossiemouth]] along with its neighbour [[RAF Kinloss]] contributed \u00a3156.5 million (including civilian expenditure) to the Moray economy, of which \u00a376.6 million was retained and spent locally. The bases provide, directly or indirectly, 21% of all employment in the area, although in 2010 the closure of RAF Kinloss had a significant effect on these numbers. Aware of the impact that the Air Force has on the area's economy, the local population instigated a long campaign to save RAF Lossiemouth, the future of which was also in doubt. How much of an influence this had upon the government's and Ministry of Defence's final decision is uncertain, but the base was ultimately saved and RAF Leuchars instead faced the axe as part of the same Strategic Defence and Security Review. RAF Leuchars will now become, like RAF Kinloss, an army base. Other areas offering significant employment are local authority, construction and real estate, food and drink, tourism, transport, business services and wholesale/retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hie.co.uk/|title=Highlands and Islands Enterprise|work=hie.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a recent study, Elgin was shown to be one of the most expensive towns in which to buy property in Scotland.<ref>[http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc HBOS, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215136/http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===National governments===\nElgin is in the [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray (Westminster) constituency]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|The United Kingdom Parliament]] which returns a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]],<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm UK Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415085304/http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm |date=15 April 2006 }}</ref> at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]].\n{{Clear}}\n\nElgin is in the [[Moray (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Moray constituency]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]]<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm Scottish Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430124424/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm |date=30 April 2011 }}</ref> which has slightly different boundaries to the UK Parliament constituency of the same name.

Heavy traffic through the town causes serious congestion. Scottish transport minister [[Tavish Scott]] visited the town in August 2006 to look at the traffic management problems and to meet campaigners for a bypass. It is estimated that a bypass would remove about one-third of traffic from Elgin's streets. The A941 runs from Lossiemouth through Elgin to Rothes, Craigellachie, Dufftown and [[Rhynie, Aberdeenshire|Rhynie]]. [[Elgin railway station]] is operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]]. The railway also connects to Aberdeen and Inverness which have trains to other UK destinations. Elgin's bus station is operated mainly by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]], and provides services within Elgin and to other local towns as well as to Aberdeen and Inverness. There is a 'Jet' bus service which runs to the [[Inverness Airport]] at Dalcross, Inverness has flights to mainly UK destinations while [[Aberdeen Airport]] has UK and international flights.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Elgin, Gordon Street, Moray College Of Further Education.jpg|thumb|Moray School of Art]]\n\n===Nursery schools===\n* Ark Childcare, Mosstowie\n* Jack 'n' Jill Pre-School Centre, Kinder House, 22 Wardend Place, New Elgin\n* Moray Leisure Centre Pre-School Nursery, Borough Briggs Road, Elgin\n* Magic Roundabout Pre-School Nursery, Thornhill Drive, Elgin\n*St Sylvesters Nursery\n*Bishopmill Nursery\n*Seafield Nursery\n\n===Primary schools===\n* Bishopmill Primary School, Morriston Road, Bishopmill\n* East End Primary School, Institution Road\n* Greenwards Primary School, Edgar Road, New Elgin\n* New Elgin Primary School, Bezack Street, New Elgin\n* Seafield Primary School, Deanshaugh Terrace, Bishopmill\n* West End Primary School, Mayne Road\n* St Sylvester's RC Primary School, Abbey Street\n\n===Secondary schools===\n* [[Elgin Academy, Scotland|Elgin Academy]], Morriston Road, Bishopmill\n* [[Elgin High School (Scotland)|Elgin High School]], High School Drive, New Elgin\n\n===Further education===\n* [[Moray College]], Moray Street, Elgin, Moray\n\n==Community care==\n\n===Hospitals===\n* [[Dr Gray's Hospital]]\n\n===Health centres===\n* The Maryhill Health Centre.\n* Linkwood Medical at the Glassgreen Centre (Formerly the Victoria Crescet Medical Centre before its relocation in 2009)\n* Elgin Community Surgery, Highfield House.\n\n===Hospice===\n* [[The Oaks, Elgin|The Oaks Hospice]], Sherrifmill\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Elgin.jpg|thumb|St Giles church in Elgin's town centre]]\n\nThe following denominations have places of worship in Elgin:\n\n'''[[Church of Scotland]]'''\n* St Giles', High Street\n* St Columba's South, Moss Street\n* Birnie Kirk, A941, Elgin \n* Elgin High, North Guildry Street\n'''[[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]'''\n* Free Church, South Street\n'''[[Baptist Union of Scotland]]'''\n* Elgin Baptist Church, Reidhaven Street<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070125003856/http://www.elginbaptistchurch.co.uk/ Elgin Baptist Church]</ref>\n'''Roman Catholic Church'''\n* St Sylvester's, Institution Road\n* [[Greyfriars Sisters of Mercy Convent in Elgin]]\n'''[[Scottish Episcopal Church]]'''\n* Holy Trinity, Trinity Place<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090729093237/http://www.episcopalmoray.org.uk/elgin.htm Holy Trinity]</ref>\n'''Other denominations'''\n* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], Pansport Road\n* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], Linkwood\n* Calvary Christian Life Centre, Lesmurdie Road\n* [[True Jesus Church]], Lesmurdie Road\n* [[Pentecostal Church of God]], New Elgin Hall Annex\n* [[Plymouth Brethren|Brethren]], Riverside Gospel Hall, North Street\n* Oasis Church COTN, The Hub, Tyock Industrial Estate<ref>[http://www.oasischurchelgin.co.uk/ Oasis Church]</ref>\n\n== Culture and leisure==\n* Elgin Museum, 1 High Street\n* Elgin Library, Cooper Park\n* Elgin Golf Club, Hardhillock, Birnie Road\n* Glassgreen Golf Range, Birnie Road\n* Cooper Park: boating, pitch and putt, tennis\n* Biblical Gardens\n* Moray Leisure Centre, Borough Briggs Road, containing swimming pool, ice rink and a gymnasium\n*Moray Sports Centre, Linkwood\n* Town Hall with auditorium for production of shows\n* Community Centre, Trinity Road: badminton\n* The Lantern Gallery, 18 South Guildry Street\n* Red Shoes Theatre and music venue, High Street\n* Elgin Youth Caf\u00e9, Francis Place\n* Moray Jazz Club, ground floor of the Elgin City Football Club, Borough Briggs Road\n\n==Music==\nDuring the 1960s [[The Beatles]], [[The Who]], [[Pink Floyd]],<ref>[http://tworedshoes.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/pink-floyd-ttrs.jpg Image of Two Red Shoes Ballroom poster featuring Pink Floyd]</ref> [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Dusty Springfield]] all performed at the Two Red Shoes dancehall,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/1963/01/03/live-two-red-shoes-ballroom-elgin-scotland |title=Two Red Shoes Ballroom, Elgin, Scotland |publisher=The Beatles Bible |date=1963-01-03 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref><ref>[http://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9961/Red_Shoes_future_is_in_doubt.html \"Red Shoes future in doubt\"], Northern Scot  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727002629/http://www.northern-scot.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9961/Red_Shoes_future_is_in_doubt.html |date=27 July 2010 }}</ref> and [[The Kinks]] played Elgin Town Hall.

It is the administrative and commercial centre for Moray. The town originated to the south of the [[River Lossie]] on the higher ground above the floodplain where the town of Birnie is. There, the church of Birnie Kirk was built in 1140 and serves the community to this day.  Elgin is first documented in the Cartulary of Moray in 1190 AD. It was created a [[royal burgh]] in the 12th century by King [[David I of Scotland]], and by that time had a castle on top of the present day Lady Hill to the west of the town. The people of Elgin are collectively known as Elginites.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn August 1040, [[Macbeth of Scotland|MacBeth's]] army defeated and killed [[Duncan I of Scotland|Duncan I]] at Bothganowan (Pitgaveny), near Elgin. Elgin is first recorded in a charter of [[David I of Scotland|David I]] in 1151 in which he granted an annuity to the Priory of Urquhart.<ref>Burgh Records of Scotland, Vol I, Preface, p.35</ref> David had made Elgin a royal burgh around 1130, after his defeat of [[\u00d3engus of Moray]]. During David's reign, the castle was established at the top of what is now Lady Hill. The town received a royal charter from [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] in 1224 when he granted the land for a new [[cathedral]] to Andrew, [[Bishop of Moray]]. This finally settled the episcopal see which had been at various times at Kinneddar, Birnie and [[Spynie Palace|Spynie]]. Elgin was a popular residence for the early [[Scotland|Scottish]] monarchs: [[David I of Scotland|David I]], [[William I of Scotland|William I]], [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] all held court there and hunted in the royal forests.\n\nOf these kings, Alexander II was Elgin's greatest benefactor and returned many times to his royal castle. He established the two religious houses of the town, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] or Blackfriars on the west side and the [[Franciscans]] or Greyfriars in the east. Further to the east stood the Hospital of Maison Dieu, or House of God also founded during the reign of Alexander II for the reception of poor men and women.<ref>Mackintosh, Herbert B: Elgin Past and Present, Elgin, 1914 p. 44</ref>\n[[File:Scotland Elgin Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Elgin Cathedral]]\nOn 19 July 1224, the foundation stone of the new [[Elgin Cathedral]] was ceremoniously laid. The cathedral was completed sometime after 1242 but was completely destroyed by fire in 1270. The reasons for this are unrecorded. The buildings now remain as ruins date from the reconstruction following that fire. The Chartulary of Moray described the completed cathedral as \"Mirror of the country and the glory of the kingdom\".\n\n[[Edward I of England]] travelled twice to Elgin. During his first visit in 1296, he was impressed by what he saw. Preserved in the [[Cotton library]] now held in the [[British Library]] is the journal of his stay, describing the castle and the town of Elgin as \"bon chastell et bonne ville\" \u2014 good castle and good town. By his second visit in September 1303, the castle's wooden interior had been burned while held by the [[England|English]] governor, Henry de Rye. As a result, he only stayed in Elgin for two days and then camped at [[Kinloss Abbey]] from 13 September until 4 October. King Edward was furious when David de Moravia, Bishop of Moray, joined Scotland's cause with Bruce, and Edward appealed to the Pope who excommunicated the bishop, thus removing papal protection, causing him to flee to [[Orkney]], then to [[Norway]], only to return after Robert Bruce's victories against the English. After Edward's death in July 1307, [[Robert the Bruce]] retook Scotland in 1308, [[slighting]] castles to keep them out of English hands. David de Moravia, the Bishop of Moray at the head of his army, joined with Bruce and they slighted the castles of [[Inverness]], [[Nairn]] and [[Forres]] before seizing and slighting Kinneddar Castle, which also housed English soldiers. He attacked Elgin castle to be twice repulsed before finally succeeding.\n\nIn August 1370 [[Alexander Bur]], [[Bishop of Moray]] began payments to [[Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan|Alexander Stewart]], Wolf of Badenoch, [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III's]] brother, for the protection of his lands and men. In February 1390, the bishop then turned to Thomas Dunbar, son of the Earl of Moray, to provide the protection. This action infuriated Stewart and in May he descended from his castle on an island in [[Lochindorb]] and burned the town of Forres in revenge. In June he burned much of Elgin, including two monasteries, St Giles Church, the Hospital of Maison Dieu and the cathedral. [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' (a 15th-century history of Scotland) described this action by \"wyld, wykked Heland-men\". The rebuilding of the cathedral took many years; but much of it has since crumbled away due to the inferior quality of the stone made available to the 15th and 16th-century masons, while the 13th-century construction still remains. In 1506, the great central tower collapsed and although rebuilding work began the next year it was not completed till 1538.\n\n===From the Reformation to the eighteenth century===\n[[File:Elgin cathedral 2.jpg|thumb|275px|Elgin Cathedral]]\nThe citizens of Elgin and surrounding areas did not seem to object to the new religion following the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. In 1568 the lead was stripped from the roof of the cathedral, by order of the [[Privy Council of Scotland]]. The lead was to be sold and the proceeds to go to the maintenance of Regent Moray's soldiers, but the ship taking the lead cargo to [[Holland]] sank almost immediately on leaving Aberdeen harbour. Without this protection, the building began to deteriorate. In 1637, the rafters over the choir were blown down and in 1640 the minister of St Giles along with the Laird of Innes and [[Clan Brodie#17th century and Civil War|Alexander Brodie of Brodie]], all ardent [[Covenanters]], removed and destroyed the ornately carved screen and woodwork that had remained intact. The tracery of the West window was destroyed sometime between 1650 and 1660 by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]'s soldiers. On Easter Sunday 1711 the central tower collapsed for the second time in its history but caused much more damage. The rubble was quarried for various projects in the vicinity until 1807 when, through the efforts of Joseph King of Newmill, a wall was built around the cathedral and a keeper's house erected. Mountains of this rubble were cleared by one John Shanks, enabling visitors to view the ornate stonemasonry. John was presented with an ornate snuffbox by the authorities, it is now in Elgin Museum, he is also honoured with a large tombstone in the eastern Cathedral precincts.\n\nWhen [[Daniel Defoe]] toured Scotland in 1717, he visited Elgin and said:<blockquote>In this rich country is the city, or town rather, of Elgin; I say city, because in antient time the monks claim'd it for a city; and the cathedral shews, by its ruins, that it was a place of great magnificence. Nor must it be wonder'd at, if in so pleasant, so rich, and so agreeable a part of the country, all the rest being so differing from it, the clergy should seat themselves in a proportion'd number, seeing we must do them the justice to say, that if there is any place richer and more fruitful, and pleasant than another, they seldom fail to find it out. As the country is rich and pleasant, so here are a great many rich inhabitants, and in the town of Elgin in particular; for the gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh, or the court, for this part of the island, leave their Highland habitations in the winter and come and live here for the diversion of the place and plenty of provisions; and there is, on this account, a great variety of gentlemen for society, and that of all parties and of all opinions. This makes Elgin a very agreeable place to live in, notwithstanding its distance, being above 450 measur'd miles [725&nbsp;km] from London, and more, if we must go by Edinburgh.<ref name=\"Defoe1727\">{{cite book|author=Daniel Defoe|title=A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain: Divided Into Circuits Or Journies.

When Bishop Bur wrote to [[King Robert III]], complaining of the wanton destruction done to the building by the King's brother, the Wolf of Badenoch, he describes the cathedral as \"the ornament of this district, the glory of the kingdom and the admiration of foreigners.\" Chambers, in his ''Picture of Scotland'', says: <blockquote>It is an allowed fact, which the ruins seem still to attest, that this was by far the most splendid specimen of ecclesiastical architecture in Scotland, the abbey church of Melrose not excepted. It must be acknowledged that the edifice last mentioned is a wonderful instance of symmetry and elaborate decoration; yet in extent, in loftiness, in impressive magnificence, and even in minute decoration, Elgin has been manifestly superior. Enough still remains to impress the solitary traveller with a sense of admiration mixed with astonishment.</blockquote>Lachlan Shaw in his ''History of the Province of Moray'' was equally impressed when he wrote<blockquote>the church when entire was a building of Gothic architecture inferior to few in Europe.</blockquote>\n\n[[Prince Charles Edward Stuart]] travelled to Elgin from Inverness in March 1746 and, falling ill with a feverish cold, stayed for 11 days before returning to await the arrival of the king's army. He stayed in Elgin with Mrs. Anderson, a passionate [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], at Thunderton House. She kept the sheets that the Prince slept on and was buried in them a quarter of a century later. The [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] passed through the town on 13 April, camping at Alves on the way to meet the Prince in battle on Drummossie Muir. After the battle, [[William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock]], one of the Prince's generals, was captured and taken to London and eventual execution, but he wrote to his friend from prison about his indebtedness to the shoemakers of Elgin: <blockquote>Beside my personal debts mentioned in general and particular in the State, there is one for which I am liable in justice, if it is not paid, owing to poor people who gave their work for it by my orders. It was at Elgin in Murray, the Regiment I commanded wanted shoes. I commissioned something about seventy pair of shoes and brogues, which might come to 3 shillngs or three shillings and sixpence each, one with the other. The magistrates divided them among the shoemakers of the town and country, and each shoemaker furnished his proportion. I drew on the town, for the price, out of the composition laid on them, but I was afterwards told at Inverness that, it was believed, the composition was otherwise applied, and the poor shoemakers not paid. As these poor people wrought by my orders, it will be a great ease to my heart to think they are not to lose by me, as too many have done in the course of that year, but had I lived I might have made some inquiry after but now it is impossible, as their hardships in loss of horses and such things, which happeened through my soldiers, are so interwoven with what was done by other people, that it would be very hard, if not impossible, to separate them. If you'll write to Mr. Innes of Dalkinty at Elgin (with whom I was quartered when I lay there), he will send you an account of the shoes, and if they were paid to the shoemakers or no; and if they are not, I beg you'll get my wife, or my successors to pay them when they can ...</blockquote>\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:Dr Grays Hospital.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Dr Grays Hospital]]\nIn the 19th century, the old medieval town of Elgin was swept away. The first major addition to the town centre was the Assembly Rooms, built in 1821 by the Trinity Lodge of [[Freemasons]], at the corner of High Street and North Street. In 1819, Dr. Gray's Hospital was built on unused ground. The building has imposing columns and distinctive dome. Dr. Alexander Gray, a doctor who worked for and made his fortune with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], endowed \u00a326,000 for the hospital. In 1828 the new parish church of St Giles was built at a cost of \u00a310,000. Lt. General Andrew Anderson, born in Elgin, also of the East India Company, died in 1824 and bequeathed \u00a370,000 to the town to found an institution for the welfare of the elderly poor and for the education of orphans. The Anderson Institute was built in the east end of the town in 1832 with accommodation for 50 children and 10 elderly people. The Burgh Court House was built in 1841, the museum in 1842 and the County Buildings in 1866.\n\nThe [[Morayshire Railway]] was officially opened in ceremonies at Elgin and [[Lossiemouth]] on 10 August 1852, the steam engines having been delivered to Lossiemouth by sea. It was the first railway north of Aberdeen and initially ran only  {{convert|5+1/2|mi|km|0}} between Elgin and Lossiemouth. It was later extended south to Craigellachie. The Great North of Scotland Railway took over the working of the line in 1863 and bought the company in 1881 following the Morayshire Railway's return to solvency from crippling debt. The railway and Lossiemouth harbour became very important to Elgin's economy.\n\nThe town was becoming prosperous, and by 1882 it had a Head Post Office with a savings bank, insurance and telegraph departments, and branches of the Bank of Scotland and the British Linen Company, Caledonian, Commercial, North of Scotland, Royal and Union Banks, and the National Securities Savings Bank, offices or agencies of 48 insurance companies, five hotels, and a newspaper. It was not until the 20th century, however, that the separate villages of Bishopmill and New Elgin would be incorporated into the town.\n\nThe [[Cooper Park drill hall, Elgin|Cooper Park drill hall]] was completed in 1908.<ref name=canmore>{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/331416/elgin-cooper-park-drill-hall|title=Elgin, Cooper Park, Drill Hall|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=24 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and geology==\nThe modern town straddles the River Lossie, with the suburbs of Bishopmill to the north and New Elgin to the south.\n[[Permian|Permo]]-[[Triassic]] rocks, rare in Scotland, are commonly found around Elgin. These are composed of [[aeolian sandstone]] formed when this area was subjected to desert conditions. Quarry Wood, on the town's edge, has a formation nicknamed Cuttie's Hillock which produced the internationally known fossils called the [[Elgin Reptiles]]. In the Elgin district, boulders belonging to the lowest group of Jurassic strata, Oxford clay and chalk are found both in glacial deposits and on the surface of the ground. The largest of these deposits is at Linksfield, where limestone and shale lie on boulder clay. There is a large hill in Elgin's town center, often viewed as the highlight of the Elgin tourist trail.\n\n{{clear}}\n{{wide image|Elgin Panorama 01.jpg|1200px|Panorama of Elgin from the northern spire of [[Elgin Cathedral]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\nElgin's climate is [[temperate]] [[Maritime climate|maritime]], with cool summers and relatively mild winters due to its proximity to the sea. Rainfall is quite low as it is in the [[rain shadow]] of mountains to the west and southwest.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Elgin, elevation: {{convert|18|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, 1981-2010

civilians. In 2005, [[RAF Lossiemouth]] along with its neighbour [[RAF Kinloss]] contributed \u00a3156.5 million (including civilian expenditure) to the Moray economy, of which \u00a376.6 million was retained and spent locally. The bases provide, directly or indirectly, 21% of all employment in the area, although in 2010 the closure of RAF Kinloss had a significant effect on these numbers. Aware of the impact that the Air Force has on the area's economy, the local population instigated a long campaign to save RAF Lossiemouth, the future of which was also in doubt. How much of an influence this had upon the government's and Ministry of Defence's final decision is uncertain, but the base was ultimately saved and RAF Leuchars instead faced the axe as part of the same Strategic Defence and Security Review. RAF Leuchars will now become, like RAF Kinloss, an army base. Other areas offering significant employment are local authority, construction and real estate, food and drink, tourism, transport, business services and wholesale/retail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hie.co.uk/|title=Highlands and Islands Enterprise|work=hie.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a recent study, Elgin was shown to be one of the most expensive towns in which to buy property in Scotland.<ref>[http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc HBOS, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215136/http://www.hbosplc.com/economy/includes/Scotlandposttownwinners2006FINAL.doc |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===National governments===\nElgin is in the [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray (Westminster) constituency]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|The United Kingdom Parliament]] which returns a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]],<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm UK Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415085304/http://www.parliament.uk/about_commons/about_commons.cfm |date=15 April 2006 }}</ref> at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]].\n{{Clear}}\n\nElgin is in the [[Moray (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Moray constituency]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]]<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm Scottish Parliament website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430124424/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/home.htm |date=30 April 2011 }}</ref> which has slightly different boundaries to the UK Parliament constituency of the same name.

These wards are Elgin North and Elgin South.\n\n==Transport==\nElgin is situated on the A96 trunk route which connects the cities of [[Aberdeen]] and [[Inverness]]. Heavy traffic through the town causes serious congestion. Scottish transport minister [[Tavish Scott]] visited the town in August 2006 to look at the traffic management problems and to meet campaigners for a bypass. It is estimated that a bypass would remove about one-third of traffic from Elgin's streets. The A941 runs from Lossiemouth through Elgin to Rothes, Craigellachie, Dufftown and [[Rhynie, Aberdeenshire|Rhynie]]. [[Elgin railway station]] is operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]].

Exploring themes of [[racism]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]], it follows the story of an orphan boy looking for a home in the fictional town of Two Mills.  He becomes a local legend for feats of athleticism and helpfulness, and his ignorance of sharp racial boundaries in the town.  It is popular in elementary school curricula, and has been used in social studies on the premises of reaction to racial identity and reading.  A movie was released in 2003.\n\n==Major characters==\n* '''Jeffrey Lionel \"Maniac\" Magee''' is an orphan  and finds himself in Two Mills, where he becomes a local legend while trying to find a home. He has astonishing athletic abilities, runs everywhere he goes, can untie any knot, is allergic to pizza, and crosses the barrier between the East End and West End as if blind to racial distinction. He has done many heroic feats such as running for a long period of time, hitting many home runs in a row, and entering Finsterwald's backyard. He lived in many temporary homes, even once with [[American bison|buffaloes]].\n* '''Amanda Beale''' is the first person Jeffrey meets in Two Mills. She carries her books in a suitcase so they aren't ruined by her younger siblings, Hester and Lester. She defends Jeffrey from Mars Bar and eventually provides him with a home.\n* '''Mars Bar Thompson''' is the worst kid in the East End. He dislikes Jeffrey's presence in the East End, which is exacerbated when Jeffrey beats him in a race. However, he eventually rescues Russell McNab from the trolley truss, and offers Jeffrey a place for a while. As his nickname implies, he is known for eating [[Mars (chocolate bar)|Mars Bar]]s.  His real first name is never revealed.\n* '''John McNab''' is infuriated when he cannot strike out Jeffrey with his ball. After acting as a bully, he welcomes him into his home when he brings back John's younger brothers, Piper and Russell, after their attempt to run away to Mexico. He remains convinced that the black East Enders are planning a rebellion.\n* '''Piper and Russell McNab''' are John McNab's younger brothers who play [[hookey]], steal, and constantly try to run away from home. In their house, they use toy machine guns to shoot the \"rebels\" from the East End. Piper also had a party at the end of the book. They are eight years old. \n* '''Earl Grayson''' is the groundskeeper at the zoo and resident of the YMCA, though he was once a minor league baseball pitcher who struck out [[Willie Mays]]. He becomes friends with Jeffrey, who listens to his stories and Jeffrey teaches him to read. They end up living together in a house, which makes him responsible. He is very kind and cares about Jeffrey. Tragically, Grayson, as he is called in the book, passes away shortly after Christmas, leaving Jeffrey all alone and an orphan once again.\n* '''Mrs. Beale''' is the kind and caring mother of Amanda, Hester, and Lester. She is very sweet and thoughtful to Maniac as well.\n* '''Hester and Lester''' are the brother and sister of Amanda Beale, and the son and daughter of Mrs. Beale. They are very hyperactive, and will mess up anything that they can get their hands on by drawing on things.\n\n==Plot summary==\nJeffrey Lionel Magee's parents were killed in a trolley accident when a drunk driver crashed and sunk it into the river in [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania]], orphaning him at age three. After living with his Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan in [[Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania|Hollidaysburg]] and enduring their mutual hatred and silence for eight years, he runs away during a school musical performance. Over a year and 200 miles later, he finds himself across the river from Bridgeport in Two Mills, where Hector Street divides. He meets Amanda Beale, an East Ender who carries her suitcase full of books to keep them away from her younger siblings and borrows one before continuing his dash through town. Along the way, he intercepts a football pass made to local football star James \"Hands\" Down, infuriates gigantic little leaguer John McNab by hitting home runs off his fastball, and saves an unlucky child from Finsterwald's backyard, which is full of negative energy. Because of the\\OQJBWHWEHJNRGKOFJBHTJRHJHWOOOOLOLOLLMFAOOOLOL\n\nWhen \"Mars Bar\" Thompson corners Jeffrey and rips a page from Amanda's book, he is rescued by Amanda. He finds a home with her and her family, helping Mr. and Mrs. Beale with the chores and pacifying Hester and Lester. Soon though, a few East Enders make it clear to him that they don't want him in there anymore by writing racist graffiti on the Beales' front door, \"Fishbelly go home\" to be exact. His final effort to gain acceptance is by untying the famous [[Cobble's Knot]]. After finishing the task he is praised by everyone as confetti is thrown into the air. Amanda realizes, too late, that it was made from the pages of her favorite book, an Encyclopedia A. Jeffrey runs away, taking shelter at the buffalo pen at the zoo.\n\nAt the zoo, Jeffrey meets Earl Grayson, a minor-league baseball pitcher who is also a groundskeeper, has never learned to read, and insists he has no stories to tell. For a few months, Jeffrey has a home again with him, helping him at work, celebrating holidays with him, and teaching him to read. Grayson winds up passing away in his sleep 5 days after Christmas, and Jeffrey runs off again.\n\nOn the verge of death, he encounters Piper and Russell, child ruffians that turn out to be John McNab's brothers. He leads them back home, bribing them with free pizza, and stays at their cockroach-infested, waste-filled house. Here, he finds the worst that the West End has to offer, as he learns that the McNabs are making a bunker because they believe the East End is planning a rebellion. He endures the coarseness and squalor of their home in hopes of keeping Piper and Russell in school and under control, but he is kicked out when he crushes Piper and Russell's toy guns.\n\nAfter beating Mars Bar in a foot race and goading him into crashing Piper's birthday party at the McNabs' house, Jeffrey is homeless again. He moves back into the buffalo pen and runs for miles every morning before Two Mills wakes up. Before long, Mars Bar starts running with him as if by coincidence, and they never say a word to each other. One day they come across a hysterical Piper McNab, who frantically leads them to Russell, stuck on the trolley trestle where Jeffrey's parents died. He walks away silently, nearly unconscious and stunned by fear, while Mars Bar rescues Russell, becoming a hero in his eyes. Jeffrey retreats once again to the buffalo pen, where Mars Bar leads Amanda to it. She brings him to her house in a huff, with Jeffrey and Mars Bar following her.\n\n==Background==\nThe imaginary town of Two Mills is based on Jerry Spinelli's childhood town of [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown, Pennsylvania]]<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Long Bostrom\n  | first = Kathleen\n  | title = Winning Authors: Profiles of the Newbery Medalists\n  | publisher = Libraries Unlimited\n  | date = June 2003\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/winningauthorspr00bost/page/247 247\u2013251]\n  | isbn = 1-56308-877-0\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/winningauthorspr00bost/page/247\n  }}\n</ref>. Spinelli has said that the material from the story was inspired by his childhood experiences there,<ref>{{cite book|last=Spinelli|first=Jerry|title=Literature Circle Guides: Maniac Magee (Grades 4-8)|year=2001|page=9|isbn=0-439-16362-5}}</ref> and a number of geographical correspondences confirm this. Norristown, like Two Mills, is across the [[Schuylkill River]] from [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania|Bridgeport]], and neighboring towns include [[Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|Conshohocken]], Jeffersonville and [[Worcester Township, Pennsylvania|Worcester]], all of which are mentioned in the novel.<ref name=\"magee122\">{{cite book|last=Spinelli|first=Jerry|title= Maniac Magee|year=1990|page=122|isbn=1-55999-387-1}}</ref> The [[Elmwood Park Zoo]] is in Norristown, and [[Valley Forge]], where Maniac wanders,<ref name=\"magee122\"/> is nearby as well. There is also a street named Hector Street in Conshohocken.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reviews===\nThe book was well-received upon publication, variously lauded in reviews as \"always affecting,\" <ref name=kirkus1>{{Cite news|title= Maniac Magee| magazine=Kirkus |date= May 1, 1990}}</ref> having \"broad appeal,\" and being full of \"pathos and compassion.\" <ref name=shoemaker1>{{Cite journal|first=Joel|last=Shoemaker|title= Maniac Magee| journal=School Library Journal |date= June 1, 1990}}</ref> ''[[Booklist]]'' reviewer Deborah Abbot says, \"...this unusual novel magically weaves timely issues of homelessness, racial prejudice, and illiteracy into a complicated story rich in characters and details...an energetic piece of writing that bursts with creativity, enthusiasm, and hope.\" <ref>{{Cite news|first= Deborah|last=Abbot |title= Review of Maniac Magee|work= Booklist|date= April 21, 1991|page=33}}</ref>\n\nReviewers noted that the theme of racism was uncommon for \"middle readers\".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Maniac Magee| magazine=Publishers Weekly |date= May 11, 1990}}</ref>  Criticism concentrated on Spinelli's choice of framing it as a legend, which Shoemaker calls a \"cop-out,\" <ref name=shoemaker1/> which frees him from having to make it real or possible.

Exploring themes of [[racism]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]], it follows the story of an orphan boy looking for a home in the fictional town of Two Mills.  He becomes a local legend for feats of athleticism and helpfulness, and his ignorance of sharp racial boundaries in the town.  It is popular in elementary school curricula, and has been used in social studies on the premises of reaction to racial identity and reading.  A movie was released in 2003.\n\n==Major characters==\n* '''Jeffrey Lionel \"Maniac\" Magee''' is an orphan  and finds himself in Two Mills, where he becomes a local legend while trying to find a home. He has astonishing athletic abilities, runs everywhere he goes, can untie any knot, is allergic to pizza, and crosses the barrier between the East End and West End as if blind to racial distinction. He has done many heroic feats such as running for a long period of time, hitting many home runs in a row, and entering Finsterwald's backyard. He lived in many temporary homes, even once with [[American bison|buffaloes]].\n* '''Amanda Beale''' is the first person Jeffrey meets in Two Mills. She carries her books in a suitcase so they aren't ruined by her younger siblings, Hester and Lester. She defends Jeffrey from Mars Bar and eventually provides him with a home.\n* '''Mars Bar Thompson''' is the worst kid in the East End. He dislikes Jeffrey's presence in the East End, which is exacerbated when Jeffrey beats him in a race. However, he eventually rescues Russell McNab from the trolley truss, and offers Jeffrey a place for a while. As his nickname implies, he is known for eating [[Mars (chocolate bar)|Mars Bar]]s.  His real first name is never revealed.\n* '''John McNab''' is infuriated when he cannot strike out Jeffrey with his ball. After acting as a bully, he welcomes him into his home when he brings back John's younger brothers, Piper and Russell, after their attempt to run away to Mexico. He remains convinced that the black East Enders are planning a rebellion.\n* '''Piper and Russell McNab''' are John McNab's younger brothers who play [[hookey]], steal, and constantly try to run away from home. In their house, they use toy machine guns to shoot the \"rebels\" from the East End. Piper also had a party at the end of the book. They are eight years old. \n* '''Earl Grayson''' is the groundskeeper at the zoo and resident of the YMCA, though he was once a minor league baseball pitcher who struck out [[Willie Mays]]. He becomes friends with Jeffrey, who listens to his stories and Jeffrey teaches him to read. They end up living together in a house, which makes him responsible. He is very kind and cares about Jeffrey. Tragically, Grayson, as he is called in the book, passes away shortly after Christmas, leaving Jeffrey all alone and an orphan once again.\n* '''Mrs. Beale''' is the kind and caring mother of Amanda, Hester, and Lester. She is very sweet and thoughtful to Maniac as well.\n* '''Hester and Lester''' are the brother and sister of Amanda Beale, and the son and daughter of Mrs. Beale. They are very hyperactive, and will mess up anything that they can get their hands on by drawing on things.\n\n==Plot summary==\nJeffrey Lionel Magee's parents were killed in a trolley accident when a drunk driver crashed and sunk it into the river in [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania]], orphaning him at age three. After living with his Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan in [[Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania|Hollidaysburg]] and enduring their mutual hatred and silence for eight years, he runs away during a school musical performance. Over a year and 200 miles later, he finds himself across the river from Bridgeport in Two Mills, where Hector Street divides. He meets Amanda Beale, an East Ender who carries her suitcase full of books to keep them away from her younger siblings and borrows one before continuing his dash through town. Along the way, he intercepts a football pass made to local football star James \"Hands\" Down, infuriates gigantic little leaguer John McNab by hitting home runs off his fastball, and saves an unlucky child from Finsterwald's backyard, which is full of negative energy. Because of these acts, he earned the nickname \"Maniac\" and started a local legend.\n\nWhen \"Mars Bar\" Thompson corners Jeffrey and rips a page from Amanda's book, he is rescued by Amanda. He finds a home with her and her family, helping Mr. and Mrs. Beale with the chores and pacifying Hester and Lester. Soon though, a few East Enders make it clear to him that they don't want him in there anymore by writing racist graffiti on the Beales' front door, \"Fishbelly go home\" to be exact. His final effort to gain acceptance is by untying the famous [[Cobble's Knot]]. After finishing the task he is praised by everyone as confetti is thrown into the air. Amanda realizes, too late, that it was made from the pages of her favorite book, an Encyclopedia A. Jeffrey runs away, taking shelter at the buffalo pen at the zoo.\n\nAt the zoo, Jeffrey meets Earl Grayson, a minor-league baseball pitcher who is also a groundskeeper, has never learned to read, and insists he has no stories to tell. For a few months, Jeffrey has a home again with him, helping him at work, celebrating holidays with him, and teaching him to read. Grayson winds up passing away in his sleep 5 days after Christmas, and Jeffrey runs off again.\n\nOn the verge of death, he encounters Piper and Russell, child ruffians that turn out to be John McNab's brothers. He leads them back home, bribing them with free pizza, and stays at their cockroach-infested, waste-filled house. Here, he finds the worst that the West End has to offer, as he learns that the McNabs are making a bunker because they believe the East End is planning a rebellion. He endures the coarseness and squalor of their home in hopes of keeping Piper and Russell in school and under control, but he is kicked out when he crushes Piper and Russell's toy guns.\n\nAfter beating Mars Bar in a foot race and goading him into crashing Piper's birthday party at the McNabs' house, Jeffrey is homeless again. He moves back into the buffalo pen and runs for miles every morning before Two Mills wakes up. Before long, Mars Bar starts running with him as if by coincidence, and they never say a word to each other. One day they come across a hysterical Piper McNab, who frantically leads them to Russell, stuck on the trolley trestle where Jeffrey's parents died. He walks away silently, nearly unconscious and stunned by fear, while Mars Bar rescues Russell, becoming a hero in his eyes. Jeffrey retreats once again to the buffalo pen, where Mars Bar leads Amanda to it. She brings him to her house in a huff, with Jeffrey and Mars Bar following her.\n\n==Background==\nThe imaginary town of Two Mills is based on Jerry Spinelli's childhood town of [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown, Pennsylvania]]<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Long Bostrom\n  | first = Kathleen\n  | title = Winning Authors: Profiles of the Newbery Medalists\n  | publisher = Libraries Unlimited\n  | date = June 2003\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/winningauthorspr00bost/page/247 247\u2013251]\n  | isbn = 1-56308-877-0\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/winningauthorspr00bost/page/247\n  }}\n</ref>. Spinelli has said that the material from the story was inspired by his childhood experiences there,<ref>{{cite book|last=Spinelli|first=Jerry|title=Literature Circle Guides: Maniac Magee (Grades 4-8)|year=2001|page=9|isbn=0-439-16362-5}}</ref> and a number of geographical correspondences confirm this. Norristown, like Two Mills, is across the [[Schuylkill River]] from [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania|Bridgeport]], and neighboring towns include [[Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|Conshohocken]], Jeffersonville and [[Worcester Township, Pennsylvania|Worcester]], all of which are mentioned in the novel.<ref name=\"magee122\">{{cite book|last=Spinelli|first=Jerry|title= Maniac Magee|year=1990|page=122|isbn=1-55999-387-1}}</ref> The [[Elmwood Park Zoo]] is in Norristown, and [[Valley Forge]], where Maniac wanders,<ref name=\"magee122\"/> is nearby as well. There is also a street named Hector Street in Conshohocken.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reviews===\nThe book was well-received upon publication, variously lauded in reviews as \"always affecting,\" <ref name=kirkus1>{{Cite news|title= Maniac Magee| magazine=Kirkus |date= May 1, 1990}}</ref> having \"broad appeal,\" and being full of \"pathos and compassion.\" <ref name=shoemaker1>{{Cite journal|first=Joel|last=Shoemaker|title= Maniac Magee| journal=School Library Journal |date= June 1, 1990}}</ref> ''[[Booklist]]'' reviewer Deborah Abbot says, \"...this unusual novel magically weaves timely issues of homelessness, racial prejudice, and illiteracy into a complicated story rich in characters and details...an energetic piece of writing that bursts with creativity, enthusiasm, and hope.\" <ref>{{Cite news|first= Deborah|last=Abbot |title= Review of Maniac Magee|work= Booklist|date= April 21, 1991|page=33}}</ref>\n\nReviewers noted that the theme of racism was uncommon for \"middle readers\".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Maniac Magee| magazine=Publishers Weekly |date= May 11, 1990}}</ref>  Criticism concentrated on Spinelli's choice of framing it as a legend, which Shoemaker calls a \"cop-out,\" <ref name=shoemaker1/> which frees him from having to make it real or possible. It has also been called \"long-winded,\" and seeming like a \"chalkboard lesson.\"<ref name=kirkus1/>\n\n===Awards and honors===\nAwards and honors for the book include:\n* 1990: [[Boston

{"title_page": "Constituent (linguistics)", "text_new": "In [[syntax|syntactic]] analysis, a '''constituent''' is a word or a group of words that functions as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\nConstituency tests can be grouped in one of two ways, namely in terms of how widely used they are (i.e. their relative frequency) or in terms of which constituent they test for.\n\n==Tests grouped by how commonly they are used in English==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Coordination===\nThe [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] test assumes that only constituents can be coordinated, i.e., joined by means of a coordinator such as ''and'', ''or'', or ''but'':<ref>For examples of coordination used as a test for constituent structure, see Baker 1978:269\u201376; Radford 1981:59\u201360; Atkinson et al. 1982:172\u20133; Radford 1988:75\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:152\u20133; Borsley 1991:25\u201330; Cowper 1992:34\u20137; Napoli 1993:159\u201361; Ouhalla 1994:17; Radford 1997:104\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:66\u201370; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:27; Fromkin 2000:160\u20132; Lasnik 2000:11; Lobeck 2000:61\u20133; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27\u201331; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:1348\u20139; van Valin 2001:113\u20134; Poole 2002:31\u20132; Adger 2003:125\u20136; Sag et al. 2003:30; Radford 2004:70\u20131; Kroeger 2005:91, 218\u20139; Tallerman 2005:144\u20136; Haegeman 2006:89\u201392; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:115\u20136, 125; Quirk et al. 2010:46\u20137; Sobin 2011:31\u20132; Carnie 2013:99\u2013100; Sportiche et al. 2014:62\u20138; M\u00fcller 2016:10, 16\u20137</ref> The next examples demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [bums] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''bums'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'',  ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. However, additional data are problematic, since they suggest that certain strings are also constituents even though most theories of syntax do not acknowledge them as such, e.g.\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThese data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax reject the notion that these strings are constituents, though. Data such as (h-j) are sometimes addressed in terms of the [[right node raising]] (RNR) mechanism.\n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such, e.g.\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature. See for instance Baker 1989:425; McCawley 1998:63; Adger 2003:125; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:21; Carnie 2013:100; Sportiche et al. 2014:66; M\u00fcller 2016:16-7.</ref>\n\n===Proform substitution (replacement)===\n[[Proform]] substitution, or replacement, involves replacing the test string with the appropriate proform (e.g. pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adjective, etc.). Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Topicalization (fronting)===\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===''Do-so''-substitution===\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.   \n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n===''One''-substitution===\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n===Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)===\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Clefting===\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers. \n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===VP-ellipsis (verb phrase ellipsis)===\nThe VP-ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n===Pseudoclefting===\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n===Passivization===\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n===Omission (deletion)===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n===Intrusion===\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n===Wh-fronting===\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents.\n\n===General substitution===\nThe general substitution test replaces the test string with some other word or phrase.<ref>For examples of the general substitution test, see Allerton 1979: 113; Brown and Miller 1980: 38; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 11; Radford 1988: 89\u201391; Moravcsik 2006: 123\u20134; Culicover 2009: 37; Quirk et al. 2010: 41; M\u00fcller 2016: 7\u20138.</ref> It is similar to proform substitution, the only difference being that the replacement word or phrase is not a proform, e.g. \n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. There is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents, e.g. \n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. This is contrary to what the other tests reveal and to what most theories of sentence structure assume. The value of general substitution as test for constituents is therefore suspect. It is like the coordination test in that it suggests that too many strings are constituents.\n\n===Right node raising (RNR)===\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''. \n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be. \n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''. \n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n==Tests grouped in terms of how they test for the constituent ==\nConstituency tests can be organized into three broad categories to manipulate sentence structure, namely substitution, displacement, and deletion. Substitution tests include: general substitution, coordination, proform substitution, VP substitution (with do so), and NP substitution (with one). Displacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion. Deletion tests include: ellipsis and answer-fragments. Consider the following example:<blockquote>Dogs will always chase cats.</blockquote>In this sentence, dogs and cats are nouns, will is a modal verb, always is an adverb, and chase is a main verb. This sentence contains a transitive verb, which takes two arguments; the doer of the action, called the agent, and the recipient, called the theme.\n\n=== Substitution tests ===\nSubstitution tests evaluate constituency by replacing a relevant word, or string of words, with another constituent of the same category. The substitutions of interest replace a substring with a word, where that word plays the same kind of role in the sentence as the original sub-string did. \n\n==== Coordination ====\nCoordination is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency. Using and, or, and but are the simplest ways to tell that natural language is recursive. If a string S can be coordinated with a word, or phrase of the same type, then S is hypothesized to be a constituent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sportiche, Dominique.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861536792|title=An introduction to syntactic analysis and theory|others=Koopman, Hilda Judith., Stabler, Edward P.|isbn=978-1-118-47048-0|location=Hoboken|oclc=861536792}}</ref> Consider the following examples:\n\n# [<sub>DP</sub> '''Dogs and eagles'''] will always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> '''cats or birds'''].\n# Dogs will [<sub>AdvP</sub> '''always and only'''] chase cats.\n# Dogs [<sub>TP</sub> '''will and should'''] always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase and bite'''] cats.\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>PP</sub> '''down the hill and to the store'''].\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>CP</sub> '''if they are playful and if they are sociable'''].\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the sequences of words coordinated are not of the same syntactic category.\n\n# * Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase cats and down the hill'''].\n\nFrom the diagnostics, it can be determined that only constituents of the same syntactic category can be coordinated. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since down the hill is a PP, whereas cats is an NP, and therefore is not compliant with this test.\n\n=== Displacement tests ===\nDisplacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion.\n\n=== Deletion tests ===\nDeletion tests include ellipsis and answer-fragments.\n\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.

The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\nConstituency tests can be grouped in one of two ways, namely in terms of how widely used they are (i.e. their relative frequency) or in terms of which constituent they test for.\n\n==Tests grouped by how commonly they are used in English==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Coordination===\nThe [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] test assumes that only constituents can be coordinated, i.e., joined by means of a coordinator such as ''and'', ''or'', or ''but'':<ref>For examples of coordination used as a test for constituent structure, see Baker 1978:269\u201376; Radford 1981:59\u201360; Atkinson et al. 1982:172\u20133; Radford 1988:75\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:152\u20133; Borsley 1991:25\u201330; Cowper 1992:34\u20137; Napoli 1993:159\u201361; Ouhalla 1994:17; Radford 1997:104\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:66\u201370; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:27; Fromkin 2000:160\u20132; Lasnik 2000:11; Lobeck 2000:61\u20133; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27\u201331; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:1348\u20139; van Valin 2001:113\u20134; Poole 2002:31\u20132; Adger 2003:125\u20136; Sag et al. 2003:30; Radford 2004:70\u20131; Kroeger 2005:91, 218\u20139; Tallerman 2005:144\u20136; Haegeman 2006:89\u201392; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:115\u20136, 125; Quirk et al. 2010:46\u20137; Sobin 2011:31\u20132; Carnie 2013:99\u2013100; Sportiche et al. 2014:62\u20138; M\u00fcller 2016:10, 16\u20137</ref> The next examples demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [bums] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''bums'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'',  ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. However, additional data are problematic, since they suggest that certain strings are also constituents even though most theories of syntax do not acknowledge them as such, e.g.\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThese data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax reject the notion that these strings are constituents, though. Data such as (h-j) are sometimes addressed in terms of the [[right node raising]] (RNR) mechanism.\n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such, e.g.\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature. See for instance Baker 1989:425; McCawley 1998:63; Adger 2003:125; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:21; Carnie 2013:100; Sportiche et al. 2014:66; M\u00fcller 2016:16-7.</ref>\n\n===Proform substitution (replacement)===\n[[Proform]] substitution, or replacement, involves replacing the test string with the appropriate proform (e.g. pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adjective, etc.). Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Topicalization (fronting)===\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===''Do-so''-substitution===\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.   \n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n===''One''-substitution===\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n===Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)===\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Clefting===\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers. \n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===VP-ellipsis (verb phrase ellipsis)===\nThe VP-ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n===Pseudoclefting===\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n===Passivization===\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n===Omission (deletion)===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n===Intrusion===\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n===Wh-fronting===\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents.\n\n===General substitution===\nThe general substitution test replaces the test string with some other word or phrase.<ref>For examples of the general substitution test, see Allerton 1979: 113; Brown and Miller 1980: 38; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 11; Radford 1988: 89\u201391; Moravcsik 2006: 123\u20134; Culicover 2009: 37; Quirk et al. 2010: 41; M\u00fcller 2016: 7\u20138.</ref> It is similar to proform substitution, the only difference being that the replacement word or phrase is not a proform, e.g. \n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. There is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents, e.g. \n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. This is contrary to what the other tests reveal and to what most theories of sentence structure assume. The value of general substitution as test for constituents is therefore suspect. It is like the coordination test in that it suggests that too many strings are constituents.\n\n===Right node raising (RNR)===\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''. \n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be. \n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''. \n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n==Tests grouped in terms of how they test for the constituent ==\nConstituency tests can be organized into three broad categories to manipulate sentence structure, namely substitution, displacement, and deletion. Substitution tests include: general substitution, coordination, proform substitution, VP substitution (with do so), and NP substitution (with one). Displacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion. Deletion tests include: ellipsis and answer-fragments. Consider the following example:<blockquote>Dogs will always chase cats.</blockquote>In this sentence, dogs and cats are nouns, will is a modal verb, always is an adverb, and chase is a main verb. This sentence contains a transitive verb, which takes two arguments; the doer of the action, called the agent, and the recipient, called the theme.\n\n=== Substitution tests ===\nSubstitution tests evaluate constituency by replacing a relevant word, or string of words, with another constituent of the same category. The substitutions of interest replace a substring with a word, where that word plays the same kind of role in the sentence as the original sub-string did. \n\n==== Coordination ====\nCoordination is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency. Using and, or, and but are the simplest ways to tell that natural language is recursive. If a string S can be coordinated with a word, or phrase of the same type, then S is hypothesized to be a constituent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sportiche, Dominique.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861536792|title=An introduction to syntactic analysis and theory|others=Koopman, Hilda Judith., Stabler, Edward P.|isbn=978-1-118-47048-0|location=Hoboken|oclc=861536792}}</ref> Consider the following examples:\n\n# [<sub>DP</sub> Dogs and eagles] will always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> cats or birds].\n# Dogs will [<sub>AdvP</sub> always and only] chase cats.\n# Dogs [<sub>TP</sub> will and should] always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> chase and bite] cats.\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>PP</sub> down the hill and to the store].\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>CP</sub> if they are playful and if they are sociable]\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the sequences of words coordinated are not of the same syntactic category.\n\n# * Dogs will always [<sub>CP</sub> chase cats and down the hill]. \n\nFrom the diagnostics, it can be determined that only constituents of the same syntactic category can be coordinated. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since down the hill is a PP, whereas cats is an NP, and therefore is not compliant with this test.\n\n=== Displacement tests ===\nDisplacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion.\n\n=== Deletion tests ===\nDeletion tests include ellipsis and answer-fragments.\n\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.

This is in contrast to <math>A(h)</math> where the [[truncation error]] is <math>O(h^{k_0}) </math> for the same step size <math>h</math>\n\nBy this process, we have achieved a better approximation of ''A'' by subtracting the largest term in the error which was ''O''(''h''<sup>''k''<sub>0</sub></sup>).  This process can be repeated to remove more error terms to get even better approximations.\n\nA general [[recurrence relation]] beginning with <math>A_0=A(h)</math> can be defined for the approximations by\n:<math> A_{i+1}(h) = \\frac{t^{k_i}A_i\\left(\\frac{h}{t}\\right) - A_i(h)}{t^{k_i}-1} </math>\nwhere <math>k_{i+1}</math> satisfies\n:<math> A^* = A_{i+1}(h) + O(h^{k_{i+1}}) </math>.\n\nThe Richardson extrapolation can be considered as a linear [[sequence transformation]].\n\nAdditionally, the general formula can be used to estimate ''k''<sub>0</sub> (leading order step size behavior of [[Truncation error]]) when neither its value nor ''A''<sup>*</sup> (exact value) is known ''a priori''.  Such a technique can be useful for quantifying an unknown [[rate of convergence]].  Given approximations of ''A'' from three distinct step sizes ''h'', ''h / t'', and ''h / s'', the exact relationship\n:<math>A^*=\\frac{t^{k_0}A\\left(\\frac{h}{t}\\right) - A(h)}{t^{k_0}-1} + O(h^{k_1}) = \\frac{s^{k_0}A\\left(\\frac{h}{s}\\right) - A(h)}{s^{k_0}-1} + O(h^{k_1})</math>\nyields an approximate relationship (please note that the notation here may cause a bit of confusion, the two O appearing in the equation above only indicates the leading order step size behavior but their explicit forms are different and hence cancelling out of the two O terms is approximately valid)\n:<math>A\\left(\\frac{h}{t}\\right) + \\frac{A\\left(\\frac{h}{t}\\right) - A(h)}{t^{k_0}-1} \\approx A\\left(\\frac{h}{s}\\right) +\\frac{A\\left(\\frac{h}{s}\\right) - A(h)}{s^{k_0}-1}</math>\nwhich can be solved numerically to estimate ''k''<sub>0</sub>.\n\n==Example pseudocode code for Richardson extrapolation==\n\nThe following pseudocode in MATLAB style demonstrates Richardson extrapolation to help solve the ODE <math>y'(t) = -y^2</math>, <math>y(0) = 1</math> with the [[Trapezoidal method]]. In this example we halve the step size <math>h</math> each iteration and so in the discussion above we'd have that <math>t = 2</math>. The error of the Trapezoidal method can be expressed in terms of odd powers so that the error over multiple steps can be expressed in even powers; this leads us to raise <math>t</math> to the second power and to take powers of <math>4 = 2^2 = t^2</math> in the pseudocode. We want to find the value of <math>y(5)</math>, which has the exact solution of <math>\\frac{1}{5 + 1} = \\frac{1}{6} = 0.1666...</math> since the exact solution of the ODE is <math>y(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + t}</math>. This pseudocode assumes that a function called <code>Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)</code> exists which attempts to computes <code>y(tEnd)</code> by performing the trapezoidal method on the function <code>f</code>, with starting point <code>y0</code> and <code>tStart</code> and step size <code>h</code>.\n\nNote that starting with too small an initial step size can potentially introduce error into the final solution. Although there are methods designed to help pick the best initial step size, one option is to start with a large step size and then to allow the Richardson extrapolation to reduce the step size each iteration until the error reaches the desired tolerance.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"matlab\">\ntStart = 0          % Starting time\ntEnd = 5            % Ending time\nf = -y^2            % The derivative of y, so y' = f(t, y(t)) = -y^2\n                    % The solution to this ODE is y = 1/(1 + t)\ny0 = 1              % The initial position (i.e. y0 = y(tStart) = y(0) = 1)\ntolerance = 10^-11  % 10 digit accuracy is desired\n\nmaxRows = 20                % Don't allow the iteration to continue indefinitely\ninitialH = tStart - tEnd    % Pick an initial step size\nhaveWeFoundSolution = false % Were we able to find the solution to within the desired tolerance? not yet.\n\nh = initialH\n\n% Create a 2D matrix of size maxRows by maxRows to hold the Richardson extrapolates\n% Note that this will be a lower triangular matrix and that at most two rows are actually\n% needed at any time in the computation.\nA = zeroMatrix(maxRows, maxRows)\n\n%Compute the top left element of the matrix\nA(1, 1) = Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)\n\n% Each row of the matrix requires one call to Trapezoidal\n% This loops starts by filling the second row of the matrix, since the first row was computed above\nfor i = 1 : maxRows - 1 % Starting at i = 1, iterate at most maxRows - 1 times\n    h = h/2             % Half the previous value of h since this is the start of a new row\n    \n    % Call the Trapezoidal function with this new smaller step size\n    A(i + 1, 1) = Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)\n    \n    for j = 1 : i         % Go across the row until the diagonal is reached\n        % Use the value just computed (i.e. A(i + 1, j)) and the element from the\n        % row above it (i.e. A(i, j)) to compute the next Richardson extrapolate\n     \n        A(i + 1, j + 1) = ((4^j).*A(i + 1, j) - A(i, j))/(4^j - 1);\n    end\n    \n    % After leaving the above inner loop, the diagonal element of row i + 1 has been computed\n    % This diagonal element is the latest Richardson extrapolate to be computed.\n    % The difference between this extrapolate and the last extrapolate of row i is a good\n    % indication of the error.\n    if (absoluteValue(A(i + 1, i + 1) - A(i, i)) < tolerance)  % If the result is within tolerance\n        print(\"y(5) = \", A(i + 1, i + 1))                      % Display the result of the Richardson extrapolation\n        haveWeFoundSolution = true\n        break                                                  % Done, so leave the loop\n    end\nend\n\nif (haveWeFoundSolution == false)   % If we weren't able to find a solution to within the desired tolerance\n    print(\"Warning: Not able to find solution to within the desired tolerance of \", tolerance);\n    print(\"The last computed extrapolate was \", A(maxRows, maxRows))\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aitken's delta-squared process]]\n* [[Takebe Kenko]]\n* [[Richardson iteration]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*''Extrapolation Methods.

This is in contrast to <math>A(h)</math> where the [[truncation error]] is <math>O(h^{k_0}) </math> for the same step size <math>h</math>\n\nBy this process, we have achieved a better approximation of ''A'' by subtracting the largest term in the error which was ''O''(''h''<sup>''k''<sub>0</sub></sup>).  This process can be repeated to remove more error terms to get even better approximations.\n\nA general [[recurrence relation]] beginning with <math>A_0=A(h)</math> can be defined for the approximations by\n:<math> A_{i+1}(h) = \\frac{t^{k_i}A_i\\left(\\frac{h}{t}\\right) - A_i(h)}{t^{k_i}-1} </math>\nwhere <math>k_{i+1}</math> satisfies\n:<math> A^* = A_{i+1}(h) + O(h^{k_{i+1}}) </math>.\n\nThe Richardson extrapolation can be considered as a linear [[sequence transformation]].\n\nAdditionally, the general formula can be used to estimate ''k''<sub>0</sub> (leading order step size behavior of [[Truncation error]]) when neither its value nor ''A''<sup>*</sup> (exact value) is known ''a priori''.  Such a technique can be useful for quantifying an unknown [[rate of convergence]].  Given approximations of ''A'' from three distinct step sizes ''h'', ''h / t'', and ''h / s'', the exact relationship\n:<math>A^*=\\frac{t^{k_0}A\\left(\\frac{h}{t}\\right) - A(h)}{t^{k_0}-1} + O(h^{k_1}) = \\frac{s^{k_0}A\\left(\\frac{h}{s}\\right) - A(h)}{s^{k_0}-1} + O(h^{k_1})</math>\nyields an approximate relationship (please note that the notation here may cause a bit of confusion, the two O appearing in the equation above only indicates the leading order step size behavior but their explicit forms are different and hence cancelling out of the two O terms is approximately valid)\n:<math>A\\left(\\frac{h}{t}\\right) + \\frac{A\\left(\\frac{h}{t}\\right) - A(h)}{t^{k_0}-1} \\approx A\\left(\\frac{h}{s}\\right) +\\frac{A\\left(\\frac{h}{s}\\right) - A(h)}{s^{k_0}-1}</math>\nwhich can be solved numerically to estimate ''k''<sub>0</sub>.\n\n==Example pseudocode code for Richardson extrapolation==\n\nThe following pseudocode in MATLAB style demonstrates Richardson extrapolation to help solve the ODE <math>y'(t) = -y^2</math>, <math>y(0) = 1</math> with the [[Trapezoidal method]]. In this example we halve the step size <math>h</math> each iteration and so in the discussion above we'd have that <math>t = 2</math>. The error of the Trapezoidal method can be expressed in terms of odd powers so that the error over multiple steps can be expressed in even powers; this leads us to raise <math>t</math> to the second power and to take powers of <math>4 = 2^2 = t^2</math> in the pseudocode. We want to find the value of <math>y(5)</math>, which has the exact solution of <math>\\frac{1}{5 + 1} = \\frac{1}{6} = 0.1666...</math> since the exact solution of the ODE is <math>y(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + t}</math>. This pseudocode assumes that a function called <code>Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)</code> exists which attempts to computes <code>y(tEnd)</code> by performing the trapezoidal method on the function <code>f</code>, with starting point <code>y0</code> and <code>tStart</code> and step size <code>h</code>.\n\nNote that starting with too small an initial step size can potentially introduce error into the final solution. Although there are methods designed to help pick the best initial step size, one option is to start with a large step size and then to allow the Richardson extrapolation to reduce the step size each iteration until the error reaches the desired tolerance.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"matlab\">\ntStart = 0          % Starting time\ntEnd = 5            % Ending time\nf = -y^2            % The derivative of y, so y' = f(t, y(t)) = -y^2\n                    % The solution to this ODE is y = 1/(1 + t)\ny0 = 1              % The initial position (i.e. y0 = y(tStart) = y(0) = 1)\ntolerance = 10^-11  % 10 digit accuracy is desired\n\nmaxRows = 20                % Don't allow the iteration to continue indefinitely\ninitialH = tStart - tEnd    % Pick an initial step size\nhaveWeFoundSolution = false % Were we able to find the solution to within the desired tolerance? not yet.\n\nh = initialH\n\n% Create a 2D matrix of size maxRows by maxRows to hold the Richardson extrapolates\n% Note that this will be a lower triangular matrix and that at most two rows are actually\n% needed at any time in the computation.\nA = zeroMatrix(maxRows, maxRows)\n\n%Compute the top left element of the matrix\nA(1, 1) = Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)\n\n% Each row of the matrix requires one call to Trapezoidal\n% This loops starts by filling the second row of the matrix, since the first row was computed above\nfor i = 1 : maxRows - 1 % Starting at i = 1, iterate at most maxRows - 1 times\n    h = h/2             % Half the previous value of h since this is the start of a new row\n    \n    % Call the Trapezoidal function with this new smaller step size\n    A(i + 1, 1) = Trapezoidal(f, tStart, tEnd, h, y0)\n    \n    for j = 1 : i         % Go across the row until the diagonal is reached\n        % Use the value just computed (i.e. A(i + 1, j)) and the element from the\n        % row above it (i.e. A(i, j)) to compute the next Richardson extrapolate\n     \n        A(i + 1, j + 1) = ((4^j).*A(i + 1, j) - A(i, j))/(4^j - 1);\n    end\n    \n    % After leaving the above inner loop, the diagonal element of row i + 1 has been computed\n    % This diagonal element is the latest Richardson extrapolate to be computed.\n    % The difference between this extrapolate and the last extrapolate of row i is a good\n    % indication of the error.\n    if (absoluteValue(A(i + 1, i + 1) - A(i, i)) < tolerance)  % If the result is within tolerance\n        print(\"y(5) = \", A(i + 1, i + 1))                      % Display the result of the Richardson extrapolation\n        haveWeFoundSolution = true\n        break                                                  % Done, so leave the loop\n    end\nend\n\nif (haveWeFoundSolution == false)   % If we weren't able to find a solution to within the desired tolerance\n    print(\"Warning: Not able to find solution to within the desired tolerance of \", tolerance);\n    print(\"The last computed extrapolate was \", A(maxRows, maxRows))\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aitken's delta-squared process]]\n* [[Takebe Kenko]]\n* [[Richardson iteration]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*''Extrapolation Methods.
