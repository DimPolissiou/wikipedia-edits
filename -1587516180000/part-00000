These people built small homes, and a small hamlet developed towards the end of the 15th century. More permanent residents began to dwell in the valley shortly after, although the area remained little developed.\n\nThe settlement was part of the dominion of [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]], who granted its use for cultivation around 1462 to Jo\u00e3o Ferreira and his wife Branca Dias.

The name was subsequently altered, when these lands became the property of the nuns of the Convent of Santa Clara (between 1492 and 1497). There is also some discrepancy; others credit the name change after 1566, when the nuns of the Convent took refuge on these properties, during the French privateer attacks on Funchal.\n\nThe lands of Curral das Freiras were part of the parish of [[Santo Ant\u00f3nio (Funchal)|Santo Ant\u00f3nio]], but, owing to its extreme isolation from this ecclesiastical seat, the religious parish of Curral das Freiras was instituted in 1780.
