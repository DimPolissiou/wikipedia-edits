The bulk of the album was recorded in March and April 1980, with the band having completed little writing before entering the studio. Opitz said, \"I booked Paradise as a lock-out, which meant Chisel had sole 24-hour access. The only people allowed in were friends of the band and roadies. I did that to make sure the roadies got their free feed.\"<ref name=\"opitz\" />\n\nThe songs \"Cheap Wine\" and \"[[My Baby (Cold Chisel song)|My Baby]]\" were also released as singles. ''East'' was the first Cold Chisel album to feature tracks written by all members of the band. Opitz said, \"One of the key aspects was breaking Don's songwriting monopoly. It gave variation to the record and confidence to the players. Don was comfortable with this changed dynamic, because it meant he no longer had to come up with all the songs.\"<ref name=\"opitz\">{{cite book |author1=Mark Opitz |author2=Luke Wallis |author3=Jeff Jensen |title=Sophisto-Punk|year=2012|page=81 |publisher=Ebury Press |location=North Sydney |isbn=9781742757933}}</ref> Barnes later said, \"They literally had to drag us out of the studio.

The bulk of the album was recorded in March and April 1980, with the band having completed little writing before entering the studio. Opitz said, \"I booked Paradise as a lock-out, which meant Chisel had sole 24-hour access. The only people allowed in were friends of the band and roadies.

''East'' was the first Cold Chisel album to feature tracks written by all members of the band. Opitz said, \"One of the key aspects was breaking Don's songwriting monopoly.
