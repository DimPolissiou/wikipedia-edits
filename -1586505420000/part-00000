Austin Moon, an aspiring singer, interrupts Ally while she is in her practice room, singing a rough cut of \"Double Take\". Unbeknownst to Ally, Austin and his best friend, Dez, accidentally use the song thinking Austin wrote it himself, create a video, and post it on the Internet, after which Austin becomes an Internet sensation. After performing the song on \"The Helen Show\", Helen suggests that Austin returns and performs another original song. Austin isn't good at song-writing, and the only solution he can think of is to plead with Ally to write another song for him. Ally initially denies in anger, but later agrees to help him. The two bond while working on their next song, \"Break Down the Walls\", and Austin asks Ally to be there when he performs it. However, when the pianist gets sick, Ally has to fill in. This was all part of Austin's plan to help Ally overcome her [[stage fright]], but it only ends in disaster. However, Austin and Ally become partners, along with Dez as video director, and Ally's best friend, Trish, as Austin's manager.\n\n''Guest stars'': [[Andy Milder]] as Lester, Mim Drew as Helen\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Kangaroos & Chaos\n| DirectedBy      = Shelley Jensen\n| WrittenBy       = Kevin Kopelow & Heath Seifert\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2011|12|4}}\n| ProdCode        = 102\n| Viewers         = 3.96<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/ratings/2011/12/06/sundays-cable-ratings-kourtney-and-kim-claims-demo-crown-for-e-688312/cable_20111204/|title=Sunday's Cable Ratings|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=December 6, 2011|access-date=December 20, 2017}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = It has been one month since Austin's latest song was released; he becomes worried that his career will end and people will forget who he is.

Dez apologizes to Trish and his assistants, explaining that his heart was in the right place, but that he overdid it.\n\n''Guest stars'': Mimi Kirkland as Lily, Mar Mar as Herman, Jim O'Heir as Santa\n| LineColor       = 1034A6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 86\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 19\n| Title           = Musicals & Moving On\n| DirectedBy      = Craig Wyrick-Solari\n| WrittenBy       = Aaron Ho & Steve Freeman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|1|10}}\n| ProdCode        = 420\n| Viewers         = 2.89<ref name=\"419\u2013420\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-update-1-10-2016.html|title=Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Update: 1.10.2016|work=[[Showbuzz Daily]]|author=[[Mitch Metcalf]]|date=January 12, 2015|access-date=December 20, 2017}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \"emperor\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' or ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''. Another title often used was ''[[imperator]]'', originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title ''[[Princeps]] Civitatis'' ('first citizen'). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably ''[[princeps senatus]]'', ''[[Roman consul|consul]]'' and ''[[pontifex maximus]]''.\n\nThe legitimacy of an emperor's rule depended on his control of the [[Roman army|army]] and recognition by the [[Roman senate|Senate]]; an emperor would normally be proclaimed by his troops, or invested with imperial titles by the Senate, or both. The first emperors reigned alone; later emperors would sometimes rule with co-emperors and divide administration of the empire between them.\n\nThe Romans considered the office of emperor to be distinct from that of a king. The first emperor, [[Augustus]], resolutely refused recognition as a monarch.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Galinsky|2005|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> Although Augustus could claim that his power was authentically republican, his successors, [[Tiberius]] and [[Nero]], could not convincingly make the same claim.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Alston|1998|p=39}}</ref> Nonetheless, for the first three hundred years of Roman emperors, from Augustus until [[Diocletian]], efforts were made to portray the emperors as leaders of a republic.\n\nFrom Diocletian, whose [[Tetrarchy|tetrarchic]] reforms also divided the position into one emperor in the [[Western Roman Empire|West]] and one in the [[Eastern Roman empire|East]], until the end of the Empire, emperors ruled in an openly monarchic style<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Williams|1997|p=147}}</ref> and did not preserve the nominal principle of a republic, but the contrast with \"kings\" was maintained: although the imperial succession was generally hereditary, it was only hereditary if there was a suitable candidate acceptable to the army and the bureaucracy,<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Heather|2005|p=28}}</ref> so the principle of automatic inheritance was not adopted. Elements of the republican institutional framework (senate, consuls, and magistrates) were preserved even after the end of the Western Empire.\n\nThe peaceful reign of [[Constantine the Great]], the first to openly convert to [[Christianity]] and allowing freedom of religion, witnessed the replacement of the [[Caput Mundi]] from [[Rome]] to [[Constantinople]].\nThe Western Roman Empire collapsed in the late 5th century after multiple invasions of imperial territory by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[barbarian]] [[tribe]]s. [[Romulus Augustulus]] is often considered to be the last emperor of the West after his forced abdication in 476, although [[Julius Nepos]] maintained a claim recognized by the Eastern Empire to the title until his death in 480. Following Nepos' death, the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] abolished the division of the position and proclaimed himself as the sole Emperor of a reunited Roman Empire. Emperor [[Heraclius]] made diplomatic relations with the [[Companions of the Prophet]] [[Muhammad]], but lost many territories after successful [[Spread of Islam|Islamic conquests]].\nThe Eastern imperial lineage continued to rule from [[Constantinople]] (\"New Rome\"); they continued to style themselves as Emperor of the Romans (later \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd in Greek), but are often referred to in modern scholarship as [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]]. [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] was the last Roman emperor in Constantinople, dying in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mehmed II]] in 1453. The [[Muslim]] rulers then claimed the title of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]].\n\nThe [[List of Byzantine emperors|\"Byzantine\" emperors]] from [[Heraclius]] in 629 and onwards adopted the title of ''[[basileus]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2}}), which had originally meant ''king'' in Greek but became a title reserved solely for the Roman emperor and the ruler of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. Other kings were then referred to as ''r\u0113gas''.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kazhdan|1991|p=264}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to their [[pontifex maximus|pontifical]] office, some emperors were given divine status after death. With the eventual hegemony of Christianity, the emperor came to be seen as [[divine right of kings|God's chosen ruler]], as well as a [[caesaropapism|special protector and leader]] of the Christian Church on Earth, although in practice an emperor's authority on Church matters was subject to challenge.\n\nDue to the cultural rupture of the Turkish conquest, most western historians treat Constantine XI as the last meaningful claimant to the title Roman Emperor. From 1453, one of the titles used by the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultans]] was \"Caesar of Rome\" (Turkish: ''Kayser-i Rum'')<ref>\u0130lber Ortayl\u0131, \"B\u00fcy\u00fck Constantin ve \u0130stanbul\", Milliyet, 28 May 2011.</ref>, part of their titles until the [[Ottoman Empire]] ended in 1922. A Byzantine group of claimant Roman emperors existed in the [[Empire of Trebizond]] until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1461, though they had used a modified title since 1282. \n\nEastern emperors in Constantinople had been recognized and accepted as Roman emperors both in the East, which they ruled, and by the [[Papacy]] and [[Barbarian kingdoms|Germanic kingdoms]] of the West until the deposition of [[Constantine VI]] and accession of [[Irene of Athens]] as [[Empress regnant]] in 797. Objecting to a woman ruling the Roman Empire in her own right and issues with the eastern clergy, the Papacy would then create a rival lineage of Roman emperors in western Europe, the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperors]], which ruled the [[Holy Roman Empire]] for most of the period between 800 and 1806. These Emperors were never recognized as Roman emperors by the court in Constantinople and their coronations resulted in the medieval [[problem of two emperors]].\n\n==Background and beginning==\n[[File:Caesar augustus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Statue of [[Augustus]], c. 30 BC\u201320 BC; this statue is located in the [[Louvre]] ]]\nModern historians conventionally regard [[Augustus]] as the first Emperor whereas [[Julius Caesar]] is considered the last [[Roman dictator|dictator]] of the [[Roman Republic]], a view having its origins in the Roman writers [[Plutarch]], [[Tacitus]] and [[Cassius Dio]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Barnes|2009|pp=278\u2013279}}</ref> However, the majority of Roman writers, including [[Josephus]], [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Appian]], as well as most of the ordinary people of the Empire, thought of Julius Caesar as the first Emperor.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Barnes|2009|pp=279\u2013282}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the Roman Republic no new, and certainly no single, title indicated the individual who held supreme power. Insofar as ''emperor'' could be seen as the English translation of [[imperator]], then Julius Caesar had been an emperor, like several Roman [[General officer|generals]] before him. Instead, by the end of the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]] in which Julius Caesar had led his armies, it became clear that there was certainly no consensus to return to the [[King of Rome|old-style monarchy]], but that the period when several officials, bestowed with equal power by the senate, would fight one another had come to an end.\n\nJulius Caesar, and then Augustus after him, accumulated offices and titles of the highest importance in the Republic, making the power attached to those offices permanent, and preventing anyone with similar aspirations from accumulating or maintaining power for themselves. However, Julius Caesar, unlike those after him, did so without the Senate's vote and approval.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nJulius Caesar held the Republican offices of [[Roman consul|consul]] four times and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] five times, was appointed dictator in perpetuity (''[[dictator perpetuo]]'') in 45 BC and had been \"pontifex maximus\" for a long period. He gained these positions by senatorial consent and just prior to his assassination, \nwas the most powerful man in the Roman world.\n\nIn his will, Caesar appointed his adopted son Octavian as his heir. On Caesar's death, Octavian inherited his adoptive father's property and lineage, the loyalty of most of his allies and \u2013 again through a formal process of senatorial consent \u2013 an increasing number of the titles and offices that had accrued to Caesar. A decade after Caesar's death, [[Battle of Actium|Octavian's victory]] over his erstwhile ally [[Mark Antony]] at [[Actium]] put an end to any effective opposition and confirmed Octavian's supremacy.\n\nIn 27 BC, Octavian appeared before the Senate and offered to retire from active politics and government; the Senate not only requested he remain, but increased his powers and made them lifelong, awarding him the title of [[Augustus]] (the elevated or divine one, somewhat less than a god but approaching divinity). Augustus stayed in office until his death; the sheer breadth of his superior powers as ''princeps'' and permanent ''imperator'' of Rome's armies guaranteed the peaceful continuation of what nominally remained a republic. His \"restoration\" of powers to the Senate and the people of Rome was a demonstration of his ''[[auctoritas]]'' and pious respect for tradition.\n\nSome later historians such as Tacitus would say that even at Augustus' death, the true restoration of the Republic might have been possible. Instead, Augustus actively prepared his adopted son [[Tiberius]] to be his successor and pleaded his case to the Senate for inheritance on merit. The Senate disputed the issue but eventually confirmed Tiberius as ''princeps''. Once in power, Tiberius took considerable pains to observe the forms and day-to-day substance of republican government.\n\n==Classical period==\n{{Politics of Ancient Rome}}\nRome had no single constitutional office, title or rank exactly equivalent to the English title \"Roman emperor\". Romans of the Imperial era used several titles to denote their emperors, and all were associated with the pre-Imperial, Republican era.\n\nThe legal authority of the emperor derived from an extraordinary concentration of individual powers and offices that were extant in the Republic rather than from a new political office; emperors were regularly elected to the offices of [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[Roman censor|censor]].<ref>{{cite dictionary |title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Censor.html |first=John |last=Murray |year=1875 |pages=260\u2013266 |publisher=[[University of Chicago]]}}</ref> Among their permanent privileges were the traditional Republican title of ''[[princeps senatus]]'' (leader of the Senate) and the religious office of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' (chief priest of the [[College of Pontiffs]]). Every emperor held the latter office and title until [[Gratian]] surrendered it in AD 382 to [[Pope Siricius]]; it eventually became an auxiliary honor of the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]].\n\nThese titles and offices conferred great personal prestige (''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'') but the basis of an emperor's powers derived from his ''[[auctoritas]]'': this assumed his greater powers of command (''[[imperium|imperium maius]]'') and tribunician power (''[[tribune|tribunicia potestas]]'') as personal qualities, separate from his public office. As a result, he formally outranked provincial governors and ordinary magistrates. He had the right to enact or revoke sentences of capital punishment, was owed the obedience of private citizens (''privati'') and by the terms of the ''ius auxiliandi'' could save any [[Plebs|plebeian]] from any [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] magistrate's decision. He could [[veto]] any act or proposal of any magistrate, including the [[tribune|tribunes of the people]] (''ius intercedendi'' or ''ius intercessionis''). His person was held to be sacrosanct.\n\nRoman magistrates on official business were expected to wear the form of [[toga]] associated with their office; different togas were worn by different ranks; senior magistrates had the right to togas bordered with purple. A triumphal ''imperator'' of the Republic had the right to wear the ''toga picta'' (of solid purple, richly embroidered) for the duration of the triumphal rite. During the Late Republic, the most powerful had this right extended. Pompey and Caesar are both thought to have worn the triumphal toga and other triumphal dress at public functions. Later emperors were distinguished by wearing ''[[toga]]e purpurae'', purple togas; hence the phrase \"to don the purple\" for the assumption of imperial dignity.\n\nThe titles customarily associated with the imperial dignity are ''[[imperator]]'' (\"commander\"), which emphasizes the emperor's military supremacy and is the source of the English word ''emperor''; ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', which was originally a name but came to be used for the designated heir (as ''Nobilissimus Caesar'', \"Most Noble Caesar\") and was retained upon accession. The ruling emperor's title was the descriptive ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' (\"majestic\" or \"venerable\", which had tinges of the divine), which was adopted upon accession. In Greek, these three titles were rendered as ''[[autokrator|autokrat\u014dr]]'' (\"{{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1}}\"), ''kaisar'' (\"{{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1}}\"), and ''augoustos'' (\"{{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f54\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}\") or ''sebastos'' (\"{{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}\") respectively. In [[Diocletian]]'s [[Tetrarchy]], the traditional seniorities were maintained: \"Augustus\" was reserved for the two senior emperors and \"Caesar\" for the two junior emperors&nbsp;\u2013 each delegated a share of power and responsibility but each an emperor-in-waiting, should anything befall his senior.\n\nAs ''[[princeps senatus]]'' (lit., \"first man of the senate\"), the emperor could receive foreign embassies to Rome; some emperors (such as Tiberius) are known to have delegated this task to the Senate. In modern terms these early emperors would tend to be identified as chiefs of state. The office of ''princeps senatus'', however, was not a magistracy and did not entail ''[[imperium]]''. At some points in the Empire's history, the emperor's power was nominal; powerful [[praetorian prefect]]s, [[magister militum|masters of the soldiers]] and on a few occasions, other members of the Imperial household including Imperial mothers and grandmothers were the [[power behind the throne|true source of power]].\n\n===''Imperator''===\n{{main article|Imperator}}\nThe title ''imperator'' dates back to the [[Roman Republic]], when a victorious commander could be hailed as ''imperator'' in the field by his troops. The Senate could then award or withhold the extraordinary honour of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]; the triumphal commander retained the title until the end of his [[Magistratus|magistracy]].<ref name=\"OCD\">''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', entry 'Imperator', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref> In Roman tradition, the first triumph was that of Romulus, but the first attested recipient of the title ''imperator'' in a triumphal context is [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] in 189 BC.<ref name=\"OCD\"/> It was a title held with great pride: [[Pompey]] was hailed ''imperator'' more than once, as was [[Sulla]], but it was [[Julius Caesar]] who first used it permanently \u2013 according to Dio, this was a singular and excessive form of flattery granted by the Senate, passed to Caesar's adopted heir along with his name and virtually synonymous with it.<ref>Cassius Dio, 43.44.2.</ref>\n\nIn 38 BC [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] refused a triumph for his victories under [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s command, and this precedent established the rule that the ''princeps'' should assume both the salutation and title of ''imperator''. It seems that from then on Octavian (later the first emperor Augustus) used ''imperator'' as a first name (''praenomen''): ''Imperator Caesar'' not ''Caesar imperator''. From this the title came to denote the supreme power and was commonly used in that sense. [[Otho]] was the first to imitate Augustus, but only with [[Vespasian]] did ''imperator'' (emperor) become the official title by which the ruler of the [[Roman Empire]] was known.\n\n===''Princeps''===\n{{main article|Principate|Roman Emperor (Principate)}}\nThe word ''princeps'' (plural ''principes''), meaning \"first\", was a republican term used to denote the leading citizen(s) of the state. It was a purely honorific title with no attached duties or powers. It was the title most preferred by [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] as its use implies only primacy, as opposed to another of his titles, ''[[imperator]]'', which implies dominance. ''Princeps'', because of its republican connotation, was most commonly used to refer to the emperor in [[Latin]] (although the emperor's actual constitutional position was essentially \"pontifex maximus with tribunician power and ''imperium'' superseding all others\") as it was in keeping with the fa\u00e7ade of the restored Republic; the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''basileus'' (\"king\") was modified to be synonymous with emperor (and primarily came into favour after the reign of [[Heraclius]]) as the Greeks had no republican sensibility and openly viewed the emperor as a monarch.\n\nIn the era of Diocletian and beyond, ''princeps'' fell into disuse and was replaced with ''dominus'' (\"lord\");<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Goldsworth|2010|p=443}}</ref> later emperors used the formula ''Imperator Caesar NN. Pius Felix (Invictus) Augustus'': NN representing the individual's personal name; Pius Felix meaning \"Pious and Blest\"; and Invictus meaning \"undefeated\". The use of ''princeps'' and ''dominus'' broadly symbolise the differences in the empire's government, giving rise to the era designations \"[[Principate]]\" and \"[[Dominate]]\".\n\n===Evolution in Late Antiquity===\nIn 293, following the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] which had severely damaged Imperial administration, Emperor [[Diocletian]] enacted sweeping reforms that washed away many of the vestiges and fa\u00e7ades of republicanism which had characterized the Augustan order in favor of a more frank autocracy. As a result, historians distinguish the Augustan period as the [[principate]] and the period from Diocletian to the 7th-century reforms of Emperor [[Heraclius]] as the [[dominate]] (from the Latin for \"lord\".)\n\nReaching back to the oldest traditions of job-sharing in the republic, however, Diocletian established at the top of this new structure the [[Tetrarchy]] (\"rule of four\") in an attempt to provide for smoother succession and greater continuity of government. Under the Tetrarchy, Diocletian set in place a system of co-emperors, styled \"Augustus\", and junior emperors, styled \"Caesar\". When a co-emperor retired (as Diocletian and his co-emperor [[Maximian]] did in 305) or died, a junior \"Caesar\" would succeed him and the co-emperors would appoint new Caesars as needed.\n\nThe four members of the Imperial college (as historians call the arrangement) shared military and administrative challenges by each being assigned specific geographic areas of the empire. From this innovation, often but not consistently repeated over the next 187 years, comes the notion of an east-west partition of the empire that became popular with historians long after the practice had stopped. The two halves of empire, while often run as ''de facto'' separate entities day-to-day, were always considered and seen, legally and politically, as separate administrative divisions of a single, insoluble ''imperium'' by the Romans of the time.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=400\n|image1=RomulusAugustus.jpg\n|image2=Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|footer=[[Roman coins]] (i.e. the ''[[Solidus (coin)|tremissis]]'') of the emperors [[Romulus Augustulus]] and [[Julius Nepos]], the last emperors of the [[Western Roman Empire]], although Nepos was a ''[[de jure]]'' ruler in ''[[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]'' after the [[deposition of Romulus Augustulus]]\n}}\nThe final period of co-emperorship began in 395, when Emperor [[Theodosius I]]'s sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] succeeded as co-emperors. Eighty-five years later, following Germanic migrations which had reduced the empire's effective control across [[Brittania]], [[Gaul]] and [[Hispania]] and a series of military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] which drove Emperor [[Julius Nepos|Nepos]] out of Italy, the idea of dividing the position of emperor was formally abolished by Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (480).\n\nThe Roman Empire survived in the east until 1453, but the marginalization of the former heartland of Italy to the empire{{clarify|date=May 2016}} had a profound cultural impact on the empire and the position of emperor. In 620, the official language was changed from Latin to Greek. The Greek-speaking inhabitants were ''Romaioi'' (\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9), and were still considered Romans by themselves and the populations of Eastern Europe, the Near East, India, and China. But many in Western Europe began to refer to the political entity as the \"Greek Empire\". The evolution of the church in the no-longer imperial city of Rome and the church in the now supreme Constantinople began to follow divergent paths, culminating in the [[schism]] between the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] faiths. The position of emperor was increasingly influenced by Near Eastern concepts of kingship. Starting with Emperor [[Heraclius]], Roman emperors styled themselves \"King of Kings\" (from the imperial Persian ''[[Shahanshah]]'') from 627 and \"Basileus\" (from the title used by [[Alexander the Great]]) from 629. The later period of the empire is today called the [[Byzantine Empire]] as a matter of scholarly convention.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==Titles and positions==\nAlthough these are the most common offices, titles, and positions, not all Roman emperors used them, nor were all of them used at the same time in history.

As holding ''[[princeps senatus]]'', the emperor declared the opening and closure of each Senate session, declared the Senate's agenda, imposed rules and regulation for the Senate to follow, and met with foreign ambassadors in the name of the Senate. Being ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' made the emperor the chief administrator of religious affairs, granting him the power to conduct all religious ceremonies, consecrate temples, control the Roman calendar (adding or removing days as needed), appoint the [[vestal virgin]]s and some [[flamen]]s, lead the [[College of Pontiffs|Collegium Pontificum]], and summarize the [[dogma]] of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].\n\nWhile these powers granted the emperor a great deal of personal pride and influence, they did not include legal authority. In 23 BC, Augustus gave the emperorship its legal power. The first was ''[[tribune|Tribunicia Potestas]]'', or the powers of the [[tribune of the plebs]] without actually holding the office (which would have been impossible, since a tribune was by definition a [[plebeian]], whereas Augustus, although born into a plebeian family, had become a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] when he was adopted into the [[Julia (gens)|''gens Julia'']]). This endowed the emperor with inviolability (sacrosanctity) of his person, and the ability to [[pardon]] any civilian for any act, criminal or otherwise. By holding the powers of the tribune, the emperor could prosecute anyone who interfered with the performance of his duties. The emperor's tribuneship granted him the right to convene the Senate at his will and lay proposals before it, as well as the ability to [[veto]] any act or proposal by any magistrate, including the actual [[tribune]] of the plebeians. Also, as holder of the tribune's power, the emperor would convoke the [[Roman assemblies|Council of the People]], lay legislation before it, and served as the council's president. But his tribuneship only granted him power within Rome itself. He would need another power to veto the act of governors and that of the consuls while in the provinces.\n\nTo solve this problem, Augustus managed to have the emperor be given the right to hold two types of [[imperium]]. The first being ''[[consul|consular imperium]]'' while he was in Rome, and ''[[imperium|imperium maius]]'' outside of Rome. While inside the walls of Rome, the reigning consuls and the emperor held equal authority, each being able to [[veto]] each other's proposals and acts, with the emperor holding all of the consul's powers. But outside of Rome, the emperor outranked the consuls and could veto them without the same effects on himself. Imperium Maius also granted the emperor authority over all the [[Roman province|provincial]] [[Roman Governor|governors]], making him the ultimate authority in provincial matters and gave him the supreme command of all of Rome's [[Roman legion|legions]]. With Imperium Maius, the emperor was also granted the power to appoint governors of [[imperial province]]s without the interference of the Senate. Also, Imperium Maius granted the emperor the right to veto the governors of the provinces and even the reigning consuls while in the provinces.\n\n==Lineages and epochs==\n\n===Principate===\n{{main article|Roman Emperor (Principate)}}\n\nThe nature of the imperial office and the [[Principate]] was established under [[Julius Caesar]]'s heir and posthumously adopted son, [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]], and his own heirs, the descendants of his wife [[Livia]] from her first marriage to a scion of the distinguished [[Claudius|Claudian]] clan. This [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] came to an end when the Emperor [[Nero]] \u2013 a great-great-grandson of Augustus through his daughter and of Livia through her son \u2013 was deposed in 68.\n\nNero was followed by a succession of [[usurper]]s throughout 69, commonly called the \"[[Year of the four emperors|Year of the Four Emperors]]\". The last of these, [[Vespasian]], established his own [[Flavian dynasty]].  [[Nerva]], who replaced the last Flavian emperor, Vespasian's son [[Domitian]], in 96, was elderly and childless, and chose therefore to [[adoption|adopt]] an heir, [[Trajan]], from outside his family. When Trajan acceded to the purple he chose to follow his predecessor's example, adopting [[Hadrian]] as his own heir, and the practice then became the customary manner of imperial succession for the next century, producing the \"[[Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]\" and the Empire's period of greatest stability.\n\nThe last of the Good Emperors, [[Marcus Aurelius]], chose his natural son [[Commodus]] as his successor rather than adopting an heir. Commodus's misrule led to his murder on 31 December 192, following which a brief period of instability quickly gave way to [[Septimius Severus]], who established the [[Severan dynasty]] which, except for an interruption in 217\u2013218 when [[Macrinus]] was emperor, held the purple until 235.\n\n===Crisis of the Third Century===\n{{main article|Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century)}}\n\nThe accession of [[Maximinus Thrax]] marks both the close and the opening of an era. It was one of the last attempts by the increasingly impotent [[Roman Senate]] to influence the succession. Yet it was the second time that a man had achieved the purple while owing his advancement purely to his [[military]] career; both [[Vespasian]] and [[Septimius Severus]] had come from noble or middle-class families, while Thrax was born a commoner. He never visited the city of [[Rome]] during his [[reign]], which marks the beginning of a series of \"[[barracks emperor]]s\" who came from the army. Between 235 and 285 over a dozen emperors achieved the purple, but only [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and [[Carus]] managed to secure their own sons' succession to the throne; both dynasties died out within two generations.\n\n===Dominate===\n{{main article|Roman Emperor (Dominate)}}\n\nThe accession on 20 November 284, of [[Diocletian]], the lower-class, Greek-speaking [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatian]] commander of Carus's and Numerian's household cavalry (''protectores [[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domestici]]''), marked major innovations in Rome's government and constitutional theory. Diocletian, a traditionalist and religious conservative, attempted to secure efficient, stable government and a peaceful succession with the establishment of the [[Tetrarchy]]. The empire was divided into East and West, each ruled by an [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] assisted by a [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] as emperor-in-waiting. These divisions were further subdivided into new or reformed provinces, administered by a complex, hierarchic bureaucracy of unprecedented size and scope. Diocletian's own court was based at [[Nicomedia]]. His co-Augustus, [[Maximian]], was based at [[Milan|Mediolanum]] (modern [[Milan]]). Their courts were peripatetic, and Imperial progressions through the provinces made much use of the impressive, theatrical [[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]], or \"Imperial arrival\" ceremony, which employed an elaborate choreography of etiquette to emphasise the emperor's elevation above other mortals. Hyperinflation of imperial honours and titles served to distinguish the ''Augusti'' from their ''Caesares'', and Diocletian, as senior ''Augustus'', from his colleague [[Maximian]]. The senior ''Augustus'' in particular was made a separate and unique being, accessible only through those closest to him. The overall unity of the Empire still required the highest investiture of power and status in one man.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Rees|2004|pp=46\u201356, 60}}</ref>\n\nThe Tetrarchy ultimately degenerated into civil war, but the eventual victor, [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]], restored Diocletian's division of Empire into East and West. He kept the East for himself and founded his city of [[Constantinople]] as its new capital. Constantine's own dynasty was also soon swallowed up in civil war and court intrigue until it was replaced, briefly, by [[Julian the Apostate]]'s general [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] and then, more permanently, by [[Valentinian I]] and the dynasty he founded in 364. Though a soldier from a low middle-class background, Valentinian was made emperor by a conclave of senior generals and civil officials.\n\n===Late empire===\n{{main article|Roman Emperor (Late Empire)}}\n\n[[Theodosius I]] acceded to the purple in the East in 379 and in the West in 394. He outlawed [[paganism]] and made [[Christianity]] the Empire's official religion. He was the last emperor to rule over a united Roman Empire; the distribution of the East to his son [[Arcadius]] and the West to his son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] after his death in 395 represented a permanent division.\n\nIn the West, the office of emperor soon degenerated into being little more than a puppet of a succession of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribal [[Monarch|kings]], until finally the [[Heruli]] [[Odoacer]] simply overthrew the child-emperor [[Romulus Augustulus]] in 476, shipped the imperial regalia to the Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] in Constantinople and became King of Italy. Though during his own lifetime Odoacer maintained the [[legal fiction]] that he was actually ruling Italy as the [[viceroy]] of Zeno, historians mark 476 as the traditional date of the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]] in the West. Large parts of Italy ([[Sicily]], the south part of the peninsula, [[Ravenna]], [[Venice]] etc.), however, remained under actual imperial rule from Constantinople for centuries, with imperial control slipping or becoming nominal only as late as the 11th century. In the East, the Empire continued until the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks in 1453. Although known as the [[Byzantine Empire]] by contemporary historians, the Empire was simply known as the [[Roman Empire]] to its citizens and neighboring countries.\n\n==Post-classical assertions to the title==\n\n===Survival of the Roman Empire in the East===\n[[File:Constantine Palaiologos.jpg|upright=0.7|right|thumb|Imaginary portrait of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine XI]], the last Roman emperor of the Eastern Roman empire (until [[Fall of Constantinople|1453]]).]]\n\nThe line of Roman emperors in the Eastern Roman Empire continued unbroken at [[Constantinople]] until the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|capture of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the [[Fourth Crusade]]. In the wake of this action, four lines of Emperors emerged, each claiming to be the legal successor: the [[Empire of Thessalonica]], evolving from the [[Despotate of Epirus]], which was reduced to impotence when its founder [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] was [[Battle of Klokotnitsa|defeated, captured and blinded]] by the Bulgarian Emperor [[Ivan Asen III]];<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=387}}</ref> the [[Latin Empire]], which came to an end when the Empire of Nicaea recovered Constantinople in 1261; the [[Empire of Trebizond]], whose importance declined over the 13th century, and whose claims were simply ignored;<ref>On the imperial claims of the Grand Komnenos and international response to them, see N. Oikonomides, \"The Chancery of the Grand Komnenoi; Imperial Tradition and Political Reality\", ''Archeion Pontou'', '''35''' (1979), pp. 299\u2013332</ref> and the [[Empire of Nicaea]], whose claims based on kinship with the previous emperors, control of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], and possession of Constantinople through military prowess, prevailed. The successors of the emperors of Nicaea continued until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 under [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]].\n\nThese emperors eventually normalized the imperial dignity into the modern conception of an emperor, incorporated it into the constitutions of the state, and adopted the aforementioned title ''Basileus kai [[autokrator|autokrat\u014dr]] Rhomai\u014dn'' (\"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\"). They had also ceased to use Latin as the language of state after Emperor [[Heraclius]] (d. 641 AD). Historians have customarily treated the state of these later Eastern emperors under the name  \"[[Byzantine Empire]]\". It is important to note, however, that the adjective ''Byzantine'', although historically used by Eastern Roman authors in a metonymic sense, was never an official term.\n\n===Last Roman emperor===\n{{Main article|Constantine XI Palaiologos}}\n{{further|Deposition of Romulus Augustulus}}\nConstantine XI Palaiologos was the last reigning Roman emperor. A member of the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologos dynasty]], he ruled the remnant of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] from 1449 until his death in 1453 defending its capital Constantinople.\n\nHe was born in [[Mystras|Mystra]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agiasofia.com/emperors/conpaleo.html|title=Constantine Palaeologus the last Hellene emperor Fall of Constantinople|website=www.agiasofia.com}}</ref> as the eighth of ten children of [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] and [[Helena Draga\u0161]], the daughter of the [[Serbs|Serbian]] prince [[Constantine Draga\u0161]] of [[Kumanovo]]. He spent most of his childhood in Constantinople under the supervision of his parents. During the absence of his [[John VIII Palaiologos|older brother]] in [[Italy]], Constantine was regent in Constantinople from 1437\u201340.\n\nBefore the beginning of the [[Fall of Constantinople|siege]], [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] made an offer to Constantine XI.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/constantinople.htm??noredirect=on |title=Constantinople: City of the World's Desire 1453\u20131924 |first=Philip |last=Mansel |author-link=Philip Mansel |year=1995 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=21 August 2018}} - Chapter 1 of ''[[Constantinople: City of the World's Desire 1453\u20131924]]''</ref> In exchange for the surrender of Constantinople, the emperor's life would be spared and he would continue to rule in Mystra. Constantine refused this offer. Instead he led the defense of the city and took an active part in the fighting along the [[Walls of Constantinople|land walls]]. At the same time, he used his diplomatic skills to maintain the necessary unity between the Genovese, Venetian, and Byzantine troops. As [[Fall of Constantinople|the city fell]] on May 29, 1453, Constantine is said to have remarked: \"The city is fallen but I am alive.\" Realizing that the end had come, he reportedly discarded his purple cloak and led his remaining soldiers into a [[Last stand|final charge]], in which he was killed. With his death, Roman imperial succession came to an end, almost 1500 years after [[Augustus]].\n\nAfter the fall of Constantinople, [[Thomas Palaiologos]], brother of Constantine XI, was elected emperor and tried to organize the remaining forces. His rule came to an end after the fall of the last major Byzantine city, [[Corinth]]. He then moved in Italy and continued to be recognized as Eastern emperor by the Christian powers.\n\nHis son [[Andreas Palaiologos]] continued claims on the Byzantine throne until he sold the title to Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, the grandparents of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===New Western lineage===\n[[File:Emperor Charles Conquers Furor (Leone Leoni).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was the last emperor of the Holy Roman Empire to receive a papal coronation (until abdication in [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor#Abdications and later life|1556]]).]]\nThe concept of the Roman Empire was renewed in the West with the coronation of the king of the Franks, [[Charlemagne]] (Charles the Great), as Roman emperor by the [[Pope]] on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], 800. This coronation had its roots in the decline of influence of the Pope in the affairs of the Byzantine Empire at the same time the Byzantine Empire declined in influence over politics in the West. The Pope saw no advantage to be derived from working with the Byzantine Empire, but as [[George Ostrogorsky]] points out, \"an alliance with the famous conqueror of the Lombards, on the other hand ... promised much\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=164}}</ref>\n\nThe immediate response of the Eastern Roman emperor was not welcoming. \"At that time it was axiomatic that there could be only one Empire as there could be only one church\", writes Ostrogorsky. \"The coronation of Charles the Great violated all traditional ideas and struck a hard blow at Byzantine interests, for hitherto Byzantium, the new Rome, had unquestionably been regarded as the sole Empire which had taken over the inheritance of the old Roman ''imperium''. Conscious of its imperial rights, Byzantium could only consider the elevation of Charles the Great to be an act of usurpation.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=164f}}</ref>\n\n[[Nikephoros I]] chose to ignore Charlemagne's claim to the imperial title, clearly recognizing the implications of this act.

Unable to counter this encroachment on Byzantine territory, Nikephoros' successor [[Michael I Rangabe]] capitulated; in return for the restoration of the captured territories, Michael sent Byzantine delegates to [[Aachen]] in 812 who recognized Charlemagne as ''Basileus''.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=176}}</ref> Michael did not recognize him as ''Basileus'' of the Romans, however, which was a title that he reserved for himself.<ref>Eichmann, Eduard (1942).

Echter-Verlag. p. 33.</ref>\n\nThis line of Roman emperors was actually generally [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] rather than Roman, but maintained their Roman-ness as a matter of principle. These emperors used a variety of titles (most frequently \"''Imperator Augustus''\") before finally settling on ''Imperator Romanus Electus'' (\"Elected Roman Emperor\"). Historians customarily assign them the title \"Holy Roman Emperor\", which has a basis in actual historical usage, and treat their \"[[Holy Roman Empire]]\" as a separate institution. To Latin Catholics of the time, the Pope was the temporal authority as well as spiritual authority, and as Bishop of Rome he was recognized as having the power to anoint or crown a new Roman emperor. The last man to be crowned by the [[Pope Clement VII|pope]] (although in [[Bologna]], not Rome) was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. All his successors bore only a title of \"Elected Roman Emperor\".\n\nThis line of Emperors lasted until 1806 when [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] dissolved the Empire during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite the existence of later potentates styling themselves \"emperor\", such as the Napoleons, the [[Habsburg]] [[Austrian Empire|Emperors of Austria]], and the [[Hohenzollern]] [[German Empire|heads of the German Reich]], this marked the end of the Western Empire. Although there is a living heir, [[Karl von Habsburg]], to the Habsburg dynasty, as well as a Pope and pretenders to the positions of the electors, and although all the medieval coronation regalia are still preserved in Austria, the legal abolition of all aristocratic prerogatives of the former electors and the imposition of republican constitutions in Germany and Austria render quite remote any potential for a revival of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n: ''For rulers of Italy after Romulus \"Augustulus\" and Julius Nepos, see list of [[King of Italy|barbarian kings]].''\n\n: ''For the Roman emperors who ruled in the East after The Fall in the West, see [[List of Byzantine emperors]].''\n\n: ''For emperors of the Holy Roman Empire in the West, see [[Holy Roman Emperor]].''\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]\n* [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]\n* [[Interregnum]]\n* [[Justitium]]\n* [[King of Rome]]\n* [[Roman Emperors family tree]]; also [[Julio-Claudian family tree]] and [[Severan dynasty family tree]]\n* [[Roman usurper]]\n\n===Lists===\n* [[List of Imperial Roman victory titles|List of Imperial Victory Titles]]\n* [[List of Roman emperors]]\n* [[List of Roman usurpers]]\n* [[List of condemned Roman emperors]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|title=Aspects of Roman history, AD 14\u2013117|last=Alston|first=Richard|year=1998|isbn= 978-0-415-13237-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwO_dzOVLw4C&pg=PA39|accessdate=2011-08-03|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|first=Timothy |last=Barnes|chapter= The first Emperor: the view of late antiquity|editor1-first=Miriam|editor1-last= Griffin|title=A Companion to Julius Caesar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzOXLGbIIYwC&pg=PA278|year=2009|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=978-1-4443-0845-7||ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Cambridge companion to the Age of Augustus|last=Galinsky|first=Karl|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-80796-8|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ftcx-5j7rjwC&pg=PA13|accessdate=2011-08-03|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower|last=Goldsworth|first=Adrian|year=2010|isbn=9780300164268|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/howromefelldeath0000gold}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Fall of the Roman Empire|last=Heather|first=Peter|year=2005|isbn=978-0-330-49136-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Jntu21N9K0C&pg=PA28|accessdate=2011-08-03|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book| first=George|last= Ostrogorsky| translator-first = Joan| translator-last = Hussey| title = History of the Byzantine State |location=New Brunswick| publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] | year = 1957|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Rees|first=Roger|title=Diocletian and the Tetrarchy|year=2004|location=Edinburgh, UK|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wV5oAAAAMAAJ}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9il6P3TPj-AC&pg=PA147|title=Diocletian and the Roman recovery|last=Williams|first=Stephen|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1997|isbn= 978-0-415-91827-5|location=New York, NY|pages=|ref=harv|orig-year=1985|accessdate=2011-08-03}}\n\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Scarre, Chris.

The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \"emperor\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]'' or ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''. Another title often used was ''[[imperator]]'', originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title ''[[Princeps]] Civitatis'' ('first citizen'). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably ''[[princeps senatus]]'', ''[[Roman consul|consul]]'' and ''[[pontifex maximus]]''.\n\nThe legitimacy of an emperor's rule depended on his control of the [[Roman army|army]] and recognition by the [[Roman senate|Senate]]; an emperor would normally be proclaimed by his troops, or invested with imperial titles by the Senate, or both. The first emperors reigned alone; later emperors would sometimes rule with co-emperors and divide administration of the empire between them.\n\nThe Romans considered the office of emperor to be distinct from that of a king. The first emperor, [[Augustus]], resolutely refused recognition as a monarch.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Galinsky|2005|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> Although Augustus could claim that his power was authentically republican, his successors, [[Tiberius]] and [[Nero]], could not convincingly make the same claim.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Alston|1998|p=39}}</ref> Nonetheless, for the first three hundred years of Roman emperors, from Augustus until [[Diocletian]], efforts were made to portray the emperors as leaders of a republic.\n\nFrom Diocletian, whose [[Tetrarchy|tetrarchic]] reforms also divided the position into one emperor in the [[Western Roman Empire|West]] and one in the [[Eastern Roman empire|East]], until the end of the Empire, emperors ruled in an openly monarchic style<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Williams|1997|p=147}}</ref> and did not preserve the nominal principle of a republic, but the contrast with \"kings\" was maintained: although the imperial succession was generally hereditary, it was only hereditary if there was a suitable candidate acceptable to the army and the bureaucracy,<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Heather|2005|p=28}}</ref> so the principle of automatic inheritance was not adopted. Elements of the republican institutional framework (senate, consuls, and magistrates) were preserved even after the end of the Western Empire.\n\nThe peaceful reign of [[Constantine the Great]], the first to openly convert to [[Christianity]] and allowing freedom of religion, witnessed the replacement of the [[Caput Mundi]] from [[Rome]] to [[Constantinople]].\nThe Western Roman Empire collapsed in the late 5th century after multiple invasions of imperial territory by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[barbarian]] [[tribe]]s. [[Romulus Augustulus]] is often considered to be the last emperor of the West after his forced abdication in 476, although [[Julius Nepos]] maintained a claim recognized by the Eastern Empire to the title until his death in 480. Following Nepos' death, the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] abolished the division of the position and proclaimed himself as the sole Emperor of a reunited Roman Empire. Emperor [[Heraclius]] made diplomatic relations with the [[Companions of the Prophet]] [[Muhammad]], but lost many territories after successful [[Spread of Islam|Islamic conquests]].\nThe Eastern imperial lineage continued to rule from [[Constantinople]] (\"New Rome\"); they continued to style themselves as Emperor of the Romans (later \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd in Greek), but are often referred to in modern scholarship as [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]]. [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] was the last Roman emperor in Constantinople, dying in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mehmed II]] in 1453. The [[Muslim]] rulers then claimed the title of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]].\n\nThe [[List of Byzantine emperors|\"Byzantine\" emperors]] from [[Heraclius]] in 629 and onwards adopted the title of ''[[basileus]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2}}), which had originally meant ''king'' in Greek but became a title reserved solely for the Roman emperor and the ruler of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. Other kings were then referred to as ''r\u0113gas''.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kazhdan|1991|p=264}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to their [[pontifex maximus|pontifical]] office, some emperors were given divine status after death. With the eventual hegemony of Christianity, the emperor came to be seen as [[divine right of kings|God's chosen ruler]], as well as a [[caesaropapism|special protector and leader]] of the Christian Church on Earth, although in practice an emperor's authority on Church matters was subject to challenge.\n\nDue to the cultural rupture of the Turkish conquest, most western historians treat Constantine XI as the last meaningful claimant to the title Roman Emperor. From 1453, one of the titles used by the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultans]] was \"Caesar of Rome\" (Turkish: ''Kayser-i Rum'')<ref>\u0130lber Ortayl\u0131, \"B\u00fcy\u00fck Constantin ve \u0130stanbul\", Milliyet, 28 May 2011.</ref>, part of their titles until the [[Ottoman Empire]] ended in 1922. A Byzantine group of claimant Roman emperors existed in the [[Empire of Trebizond]] until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1461, though they had used a modified title since 1282. \n\nEastern emperors in Constantinople had been recognized and accepted as Roman emperors both in the East, which they ruled, and by the [[Papacy]] and [[Barbarian kingdoms|Germanic kingdoms]] of the West until the deposition of [[Constantine VI]] and accession of [[Irene of Athens]] as [[Empress regnant]] in 797. Objecting to a woman ruling the Roman Empire in her own right and issues with the eastern clergy, the Papacy would then create a rival lineage of Roman emperors in western Europe, the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperors]], which ruled the [[Holy Roman Empire]] for most of the period between 800 and 1806. These Emperors were never recognized as Roman emperors by the court in Constantinople and their coronations resulted in the medieval [[problem of two emperors]].\n\n==Background and beginning==\n[[File:Caesar augustus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Statue of [[Augustus]], c. 30 BC\u201320 BC; this statue is located in the [[Louvre]] ]]\nModern historians conventionally regard [[Augustus]] as the first Emperor whereas [[Julius Caesar]] is considered the last [[Roman dictator|dictator]] of the [[Roman Republic]], a view having its origins in the Roman writers [[Plutarch]], [[Tacitus]] and [[Cassius Dio]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Barnes|2009|pp=278\u2013279}}</ref> However, the majority of Roman writers, including [[Josephus]], [[Pliny the Younger]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Appian]], as well as most of the ordinary people of the Empire, thought of Julius Caesar as the first Emperor.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Barnes|2009|pp=279\u2013282}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the Roman Republic no new, and certainly no single, title indicated the individual who held supreme power. Insofar as ''emperor'' could be seen as the English translation of [[imperator]], then Julius Caesar had been an emperor, like several Roman [[General officer|generals]] before him. Instead, by the end of the [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]] in which Julius Caesar had led his armies, it became clear that there was certainly no consensus to return to the [[King of Rome|old-style monarchy]], but that the period when several officials, bestowed with equal power by the senate, would fight one another had come to an end.\n\nJulius Caesar, and then Augustus after him, accumulated offices and titles of the highest importance in the Republic, making the power attached to those offices permanent, and preventing anyone with similar aspirations from accumulating or maintaining power for themselves. However, Julius Caesar, unlike those after him, did so without the Senate's vote and approval.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nJulius Caesar held the Republican offices of [[Roman consul|consul]] four times and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] five times, was appointed dictator in perpetuity (''[[dictator perpetuo]]'') in 45 BC and had been \"pontifex maximus\" for a long period. He gained these positions by senatorial consent and just prior to his assassination, \nwas the most powerful man in the Roman world.\n\nIn his will, Caesar appointed his adopted son Octavian as his heir. On Caesar's death, Octavian inherited his adoptive father's property and lineage, the loyalty of most of his allies and \u2013 again through a formal process of senatorial consent \u2013 an increasing number of the titles and offices that had accrued to Caesar. A decade after Caesar's death, [[Battle of Actium|Octavian's victory]] over his erstwhile ally [[Mark Antony]] at [[Actium]] put an end to any effective opposition and confirmed Octavian's supremacy.\n\nIn 27 BC, Octavian appeared before the Senate and offered to retire from active politics and government; the Senate not only requested he remain, but increased his powers and made them lifelong, awarding him the title of [[Augustus]] (the elevated or divine one, somewhat less than a god but approaching divinity). Augustus stayed in office until his death; the sheer breadth of his superior powers as ''princeps'' and permanent ''imperator'' of Rome's armies guaranteed the peaceful continuation of what nominally remained a republic. His \"restoration\" of powers to the Senate and the people of Rome was a demonstration of his ''[[auctoritas]]'' and pious respect for tradition.\n\nSome later historians such as Tacitus would say that even at Augustus' death, the true restoration of the Republic might have been possible. Instead, Augustus actively prepared his adopted son [[Tiberius]] to be his successor and pleaded his case to the Senate for inheritance on merit. The Senate disputed the issue but eventually confirmed Tiberius as ''princeps''. Once in power, Tiberius took considerable pains to observe the forms and day-to-day substance of republican government.\n\n==Classical period==\n{{Politics of Ancient Rome}}\nRome had no single constitutional office, title or rank exactly equivalent to the English title \"Roman emperor\". Romans of the Imperial era used several titles to denote their emperors, and all were associated with the pre-Imperial, Republican era.\n\nThe legal authority of the emperor derived from an extraordinary concentration of individual powers and offices that were extant in the Republic rather than from a new political office; emperors were regularly elected to the offices of [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[Roman censor|censor]].<ref>{{cite dictionary |title=A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Censor.html |first=John |last=Murray |year=1875 |pages=260\u2013266 |publisher=[[University of Chicago]]}}</ref> Among their permanent privileges were the traditional Republican title of ''[[princeps senatus]]'' (leader of the Senate) and the religious office of ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' (chief priest of the [[College of Pontiffs]]). Every emperor held the latter office and title until [[Gratian]] surrendered it in AD 382 to [[Pope Siricius]]; it eventually became an auxiliary honor of the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]].\n\nThese titles and offices conferred great personal prestige (''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'') but the basis of an emperor's powers derived from his ''[[auctoritas]]'': this assumed his greater powers of command (''[[imperium|imperium maius]]'') and tribunician power (''[[tribune|tribunicia potestas]]'') as personal qualities, separate from his public office. As a result, he formally outranked provincial governors and ordinary magistrates. He had the right to enact or revoke sentences of capital punishment, was owed the obedience of private citizens (''privati'') and by the terms of the ''ius auxiliandi'' could save any [[Plebs|plebeian]] from any [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] magistrate's decision. He could [[veto]] any act or proposal of any magistrate, including the [[tribune|tribunes of the people]] (''ius intercedendi'' or ''ius intercessionis''). His person was held to be sacrosanct.\n\nRoman magistrates on official business were expected to wear the form of [[toga]] associated with their office; different togas were worn by different ranks; senior magistrates had the right to togas bordered with purple. A triumphal ''imperator'' of the Republic had the right to wear the ''toga picta'' (of solid purple, richly embroidered) for the duration of the triumphal rite. During the Late Republic, the most powerful had this right extended. Pompey and Caesar are both thought to have worn the triumphal toga and other triumphal dress at public functions. Later emperors were distinguished by wearing ''[[toga]]e purpurae'', purple togas; hence the phrase \"to don the purple\" for the assumption of imperial dignity.\n\nThe titles customarily associated with the imperial dignity are ''[[imperator]]'' (\"commander\"), which emphasizes the emperor's military supremacy and is the source of the English word ''emperor''; ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', which was originally a name but came to be used for the designated heir (as ''Nobilissimus Caesar'', \"Most Noble Caesar\") and was retained upon accession. The ruling emperor's title was the descriptive ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' (\"majestic\" or \"venerable\", which had tinges of the divine), which was adopted upon accession. In Greek, these three titles were rendered as ''[[autokrator|autokrat\u014dr]]'' (\"{{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1}}\"), ''kaisar'' (\"{{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1}}\"), and ''augoustos'' (\"{{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f54\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}\") or ''sebastos'' (\"{{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}\") respectively. In [[Diocletian]]'s [[Tetrarchy]], the traditional seniorities were maintained: \"Augustus\" was reserved for the two senior emperors and \"Caesar\" for the two junior emperors&nbsp;\u2013 each delegated a share of power and responsibility but each an emperor-in-waiting, should anything befall his senior.\n\nAs ''[[princeps senatus]]'' (lit., \"first man of the senate\"), the emperor could receive foreign embassies to Rome; some emperors (such as Tiberius) are known to have delegated this task to the Senate. In modern terms these early emperors would tend to be identified as chiefs of state. The office of ''princeps senatus'', however, was not a magistracy and did not entail ''[[imperium]]''. At some points in the Empire's history, the emperor's power was nominal; powerful [[praetorian prefect]]s, [[magister militum|masters of the soldiers]] and on a few occasions, other members of the Imperial household including Imperial mothers and grandmothers were the [[power behind the throne|true source of power]].\n\n===''Imperator''===\n{{main article|Imperator}}\nThe title ''imperator'' dates back to the [[Roman Republic]], when a victorious commander could be hailed as ''imperator'' in the field by his troops. The Senate could then award or withhold the extraordinary honour of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]]; the triumphal commander retained the title until the end of his [[Magistratus|magistracy]].<ref name=\"OCD\">''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', entry 'Imperator', Third Edition, Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref> In Roman tradition, the first triumph was that of Romulus, but the first attested recipient of the title ''imperator'' in a triumphal context is [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] in 189 BC.<ref name=\"OCD\"/> It was a title held with great pride: [[Pompey]] was hailed ''imperator'' more than once, as was [[Sulla]], but it was [[Julius Caesar]] who first used it permanently \u2013 according to Dio, this was a singular and excessive form of flattery granted by the Senate, passed to Caesar's adopted heir along with his name and virtually synonymous with it.<ref>Cassius Dio, 43.44.2.</ref>\n\nIn 38 BC [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] refused a triumph for his victories under [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s command, and this precedent established the rule that the ''princeps'' should assume both the salutation and title of ''imperator''. It seems that from then on Octavian (later the first emperor Augustus) used ''imperator'' as a first name (''praenomen''): ''Imperator Caesar'' not ''Caesar imperator''. From this the title came to denote the supreme power and was commonly used in that sense. [[Otho]] was the first to imitate Augustus, but only with [[Vespasian]] did ''imperator'' (emperor) become the official title by which the ruler of the [[Roman Empire]] was known.\n\n===''Princeps''===\n{{main article|Principate|Roman Emperor (Principate)}}\nThe word ''princeps'' (plural ''principes''), meaning \"first\", was a republican term used to denote the leading citizen(s) of the state. It was a purely honorific title with no attached duties or powers. It was the title most preferred by [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] as its use implies only primacy, as opposed to another of his titles, ''[[imperator]]'', which implies dominance. ''Princeps'', because of its republican connotation, was most commonly used to refer to the emperor in [[Latin]] (although the emperor's actual constitutional position was essentially \"pontifex maximus with tribunician power and ''imperium'' superseding all others\") as it was in keeping with the fa\u00e7ade of the restored Republic; the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''basileus'' (\"king\") was modified to be synonymous with emperor (and primarily came into favour after the reign of [[Heraclius]]) as the Greeks had no republican sensibility and openly viewed the emperor as a monarch.\n\nIn the era of Diocletian and beyond, ''princeps'' fell into disuse and was replaced with ''dominus'' (\"lord\");<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Goldsworth|2010|p=443}}</ref> later emperors used the formula ''Imperator Caesar NN. Pius Felix (Invictus) Augustus'': NN representing the individual's personal name; Pius Felix meaning \"Pious and Blest\"; and Invictus meaning \"undefeated\". The use of ''princeps'' and ''dominus'' broadly symbolise the differences in the empire's government, giving rise to the era designations \"[[Principate]]\" and \"[[Dominate]]\".\n\n===Evolution in Late Antiquity===\nIn 293, following the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] which had severely damaged Imperial administration, Emperor [[Diocletian]] enacted sweeping reforms that washed away many of the vestiges and fa\u00e7ades of republicanism which had characterized the Augustan order in favor of a more frank autocracy. As a result, historians distinguish the Augustan period as the [[principate]] and the period from Diocletian to the 7th-century reforms of Emperor [[Heraclius]] as the [[dominate]] (from the Latin for \"lord\".)\n\nReaching back to the oldest traditions of job-sharing in the republic, however, Diocletian established at the top of this new structure the [[Tetrarchy]] (\"rule of four\") in an attempt to provide for smoother succession and greater continuity of government. Under the Tetrarchy, Diocletian set in place a system of co-emperors, styled \"Augustus\", and junior emperors, styled \"Caesar\". When a co-emperor retired (as Diocletian and his co-emperor [[Maximian]] did in 305) or died, a junior \"Caesar\" would succeed him and the co-emperors would appoint new Caesars as needed.\n\nThe four members of the Imperial college (as historians call the arrangement) shared military and administrative challenges by each being assigned specific geographic areas of the empire. From this innovation, often but not consistently repeated over the next 187 years, comes the notion of an east-west partition of the empire that became popular with historians long after the practice had stopped. The two halves of empire, while often run as ''de facto'' separate entities day-to-day, were always considered and seen, legally and politically, as separate administrative divisions of a single, insoluble ''imperium'' by the Romans of the time.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|total_width=400\n|image1=RomulusAugustus.jpg\n|image2=Julius Nepos Tremissis.jpg\n|footer=[[Roman coins]] (i.e. the ''[[Solidus (coin)|tremissis]]'') of the emperors [[Romulus Augustulus]] and [[Julius Nepos]], the last emperors of the [[Western Roman Empire]], although Nepos was a ''[[de jure]]'' ruler in ''[[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]'' after the [[deposition of Romulus Augustulus]]\n}}\nThe final period of co-emperorship began in 395, when Emperor [[Theodosius I]]'s sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] succeeded as co-emperors. Eighty-five years later, following Germanic migrations which had reduced the empire's effective control across [[Brittania]], [[Gaul]] and [[Hispania]] and a series of military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] which drove Emperor [[Julius Nepos|Nepos]] out of Italy, the idea of dividing the position of emperor was formally abolished by Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (480).\n\nThe Roman Empire survived in the east until 1453, but the marginalization of the former heartland of Italy to the empire{{clarify|date=May 2016}} had a profound cultural impact on the empire and the position of emperor. In 620, the official language was changed from Latin to Greek. The Greek-speaking inhabitants were ''Romaioi'' (\u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9), and were still considered Romans by themselves and the populations of Eastern Europe, the Near East, India, and China. But many in Western Europe began to refer to the political entity as the \"Greek Empire\". The evolution of the church in the no-longer imperial city of Rome and the church in the now supreme Constantinople began to follow divergent paths, culminating in the [[schism]] between the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] faiths. The position of emperor was increasingly influenced by Near Eastern concepts of kingship. Starting with Emperor [[Heraclius]], Roman emperors styled themselves \"King of Kings\" (from the imperial Persian ''[[Shahanshah]]'') from 627 and \"Basileus\" (from the title used by [[Alexander the Great]]) from 629. The later period of the empire is today called the [[Byzantine Empire]] as a matter of scholarly convention.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==Titles and positions==\nAlthough these are the most common offices, titles, and positions, not all Roman emperors used them, nor were all of them used at the same time in history.

As holding ''[[princeps senatus]]'', the emperor declared the opening and closure of each Senate session, declared the Senate's agenda, imposed rules and regulation for the Senate to follow, and met with foreign ambassadors in the name of the Senate. Being ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' made the emperor the chief administrator of religious affairs, granting him the power to conduct all religious ceremonies, consecrate temples, control the Roman calendar (adding or removing days as needed), appoint the [[vestal virgin]]s and some [[flamen]]s, lead the [[College of Pontiffs|Collegium Pontificum]], and summarize the [[dogma]] of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].\n\nWhile these powers granted the emperor a great deal of personal pride and influence, they did not include legal authority. In 23 BC, Augustus gave the emperorship its legal power. The first was ''[[tribune|Tribunicia Potestas]]'', or the powers of the [[tribune of the plebs]] without actually holding the office (which would have been impossible, since a tribune was by definition a [[plebeian]], whereas Augustus, although born into a plebeian family, had become a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] when he was adopted into the [[Julia (gens)|''gens Julia'']]). This endowed the emperor with inviolability (sacrosanctity) of his person, and the ability to [[pardon]] any civilian for any act, criminal or otherwise. By holding the powers of the tribune, the emperor could prosecute anyone who interfered with the performance of his duties. The emperor's tribuneship granted him the right to convene the Senate at his will and lay proposals before it, as well as the ability to [[veto]] any act or proposal by any magistrate, including the actual [[tribune]] of the plebeians. Also, as holder of the tribune's power, the emperor would convoke the [[Roman assemblies|Council of the People]], lay legislation before it, and served as the council's president. But his tribuneship only granted him power within Rome itself. He would need another power to veto the act of governors and that of the consuls while in the provinces.\n\nTo solve this problem, Augustus managed to have the emperor be given the right to hold two types of [[imperium]]. The first being ''[[consul|consular imperium]]'' while he was in Rome, and ''[[imperium|imperium maius]]'' outside of Rome. While inside the walls of Rome, the reigning consuls and the emperor held equal authority, each being able to [[veto]] each other's proposals and acts, with the emperor holding all of the consul's powers. But outside of Rome, the emperor outranked the consuls and could veto them without the same effects on himself. Imperium Maius also granted the emperor authority over all the [[Roman province|provincial]] [[Roman Governor|governors]], making him the ultimate authority in provincial matters and gave him the supreme command of all of Rome's [[Roman legion|legions]]. With Imperium Maius, the emperor was also granted the power to appoint governors of [[imperial province]]s without the interference of the Senate. Also, Imperium Maius granted the emperor the right to veto the governors of the provinces and even the reigning consuls while in the provinces.\n\n==Lineages and epochs==\n\n===Principate===\n{{main article|Roman Emperor (Principate)}}\n\nThe nature of the imperial office and the [[Principate]] was established under [[Julius Caesar]]'s heir and posthumously adopted son, [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]], and his own heirs, the descendants of his wife [[Livia]] from her first marriage to a scion of the distinguished [[Claudius|Claudian]] clan. This [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] came to an end when the Emperor [[Nero]] \u2013 a great-great-grandson of Augustus through his daughter and of Livia through her son \u2013 was deposed in 68.\n\nNero was followed by a succession of [[usurper]]s throughout 69, commonly called the \"[[Year of the four emperors|Year of the Four Emperors]]\". The last of these, [[Vespasian]], established his own [[Flavian dynasty]].  [[Nerva]], who replaced the last Flavian emperor, Vespasian's son [[Domitian]], in 96, was elderly and childless, and chose therefore to [[adoption|adopt]] an heir, [[Trajan]], from outside his family. When Trajan acceded to the purple he chose to follow his predecessor's example, adopting [[Hadrian]] as his own heir, and the practice then became the customary manner of imperial succession for the next century, producing the \"[[Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]\" and the Empire's period of greatest stability.\n\nThe last of the Good Emperors, [[Marcus Aurelius]], chose his natural son [[Commodus]] as his successor rather than adopting an heir. Commodus's misrule led to his murder on 31 December 192, following which a brief period of instability quickly gave way to [[Septimius Severus]], who established the [[Severan dynasty]] which, except for an interruption in 217\u2013218 when [[Macrinus]] was emperor, held the purple until 235.\n\n===Crisis of the Third Century===\n{{main article|Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century)}}\n\nThe accession of [[Maximinus Thrax]] marks both the close and the opening of an era. It was one of the last attempts by the increasingly impotent [[Roman Senate]] to influence the succession. Yet it was the second time that a man had achieved the purple while owing his advancement purely to his [[military]] career; both [[Vespasian]] and [[Septimius Severus]] had come from noble or middle-class families, while Thrax was born a commoner. He never visited the city of [[Rome]] during his [[reign]], which marks the beginning of a series of \"[[barracks emperor]]s\" who came from the army. Between 235 and 285 over a dozen emperors achieved the purple, but only [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and [[Carus]] managed to secure their own sons' succession to the throne; both dynasties died out within two generations.\n\n===Dominate===\n{{main article|Roman Emperor (Dominate)}}\n\nThe accession on 20 November 284, of [[Diocletian]], the lower-class, Greek-speaking [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatian]] commander of Carus's and Numerian's household cavalry (''protectores [[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domestici]]''), marked major innovations in Rome's government and constitutional theory. Diocletian, a traditionalist and religious conservative, attempted to secure efficient, stable government and a peaceful succession with the establishment of the [[Tetrarchy]]. The empire was divided into East and West, each ruled by an [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] assisted by a [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] as emperor-in-waiting. These divisions were further subdivided into new or reformed provinces, administered by a complex, hierarchic bureaucracy of unprecedented size and scope. Diocletian's own court was based at [[Nicomedia]]. His co-Augustus, [[Maximian]], was based at [[Milan|Mediolanum]] (modern [[Milan]]). Their courts were peripatetic, and Imperial progressions through the provinces made much use of the impressive, theatrical [[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]], or \"Imperial arrival\" ceremony, which employed an elaborate choreography of etiquette to emphasise the emperor's elevation above other mortals. Hyperinflation of imperial honours and titles served to distinguish the ''Augusti'' from their ''Caesares'', and Diocletian, as senior ''Augustus'', from his colleague [[Maximian]]. The senior ''Augustus'' in particular was made a separate and unique being, accessible only through those closest to him. The overall unity of the Empire still required the highest investiture of power and status in one man.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Rees|2004|pp=46\u201356, 60}}</ref>\n\nThe Tetrarchy ultimately degenerated into civil war, but the eventual victor, [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]], restored Diocletian's division of Empire into East and West. He kept the East for himself and founded his city of [[Constantinople]] as its new capital. Constantine's own dynasty was also soon swallowed up in civil war and court intrigue until it was replaced, briefly, by [[Julian the Apostate]]'s general [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] and then, more permanently, by [[Valentinian I]] and the dynasty he founded in 364. Though a soldier from a low middle-class background, Valentinian was made emperor by a conclave of senior generals and civil officials.\n\n===Late empire===\n{{main article|Roman Emperor (Late Empire)}}\n\n[[Theodosius I]] acceded to the purple in the East in 379 and in the West in 394. He outlawed [[paganism]] and made [[Christianity]] the Empire's official religion. He was the last emperor to rule over a united Roman Empire; the distribution of the East to his son [[Arcadius]] and the West to his son [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] after his death in 395 represented a permanent division.\n\nIn the West, the office of emperor soon degenerated into being little more than a puppet of a succession of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribal [[Monarch|kings]], until finally the [[Heruli]] [[Odoacer]] simply overthrew the child-emperor [[Romulus Augustulus]] in 476, shipped the imperial regalia to the Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] in Constantinople and became King of Italy. Though during his own lifetime Odoacer maintained the [[legal fiction]] that he was actually ruling Italy as the [[viceroy]] of Zeno, historians mark 476 as the traditional date of the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]] in the West. Large parts of Italy ([[Sicily]], the south part of the peninsula, [[Ravenna]], [[Venice]] etc.), however, remained under actual imperial rule from Constantinople for centuries, with imperial control slipping or becoming nominal only as late as the 11th century. In the East, the Empire continued until the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks in 1453. Although known as the [[Byzantine Empire]] by contemporary historians, the Empire was simply known as the [[Roman Empire]] to its citizens and neighboring countries.\n\n==Post-classical assertions to the title==\n\n===Survival of the Roman Empire in the East===\n[[File:Constantine Palaiologos.jpg|upright=0.7|right|thumb|Imaginary portrait of [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine XI]], the last Roman emperor of the Eastern Roman empire (until [[Fall of Constantinople|1453]]).]]\n\nThe line of Roman emperors in the Eastern Roman Empire continued unbroken at [[Constantinople]] until the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|capture of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the [[Fourth Crusade]]. In the wake of this action, four lines of Emperors emerged, each claiming to be the legal successor: the [[Empire of Thessalonica]], evolving from the [[Despotate of Epirus]], which was reduced to impotence when its founder [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] was [[Battle of Klokotnitsa|defeated, captured and blinded]] by the Bulgarian Emperor [[Ivan Asen III]];<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=387}}</ref> the [[Latin Empire]], which came to an end when the Empire of Nicaea recovered Constantinople in 1261; the [[Empire of Trebizond]], whose importance declined over the 13th century, and whose claims were simply ignored;<ref>On the imperial claims of the Grand Komnenos and international response to them, see N. Oikonomides, \"The Chancery of the Grand Komnenoi; Imperial Tradition and Political Reality\", ''Archeion Pontou'', '''35''' (1979), pp. 299\u2013332</ref> and the [[Empire of Nicaea]], whose claims based on kinship with the previous emperors, control of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], and possession of Constantinople through military prowess, prevailed. The successors of the emperors of Nicaea continued until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 under [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]].\n\nThese emperors eventually normalized the imperial dignity into the modern conception of an emperor, incorporated it into the constitutions of the state, and adopted the aforementioned title ''Basileus kai [[autokrator|autokrat\u014dr]] Rhomai\u014dn'' (\"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\"). They had also ceased to use Latin as the language of state after Emperor [[Heraclius]] (d. 641 AD). Historians have customarily treated the state of these later Eastern emperors under the name  \"[[Byzantine Empire]]\". It is important to note, however, that the adjective ''Byzantine'', although historically used by Eastern Roman authors in a metonymic sense, was never an official term.\n\n===Last Roman emperor===\n{{Main article|Constantine XI Palaiologos}}\n{{further|Deposition of Romulus Augustulus}}\nConstantine XI Palaiologos was the last reigning Roman emperor. A member of the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologos dynasty]], he ruled the remnant of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] from 1449 until his death in 1453 defending its capital Constantinople.\n\nHe was born in [[Mystras|Mystra]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agiasofia.com/emperors/conpaleo.html|title=Constantine Palaeologus the last Hellene emperor Fall of Constantinople|website=www.agiasofia.com}}</ref> as the eighth of ten children of [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] and [[Helena Draga\u0161]], the daughter of the [[Serbs|Serbian]] prince [[Constantine Draga\u0161]] of [[Kumanovo]]. He spent most of his childhood in Constantinople under the supervision of his parents. During the absence of his [[John VIII Palaiologos|older brother]] in [[Italy]], Constantine was regent in Constantinople from 1437\u201340.\n\nBefore the beginning of the [[Fall of Constantinople|siege]], [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] made an offer to Constantine XI.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/constantinople.htm??noredirect=on |title=Constantinople: City of the World's Desire 1453\u20131924 |first=Philip |last=Mansel |author-link=Philip Mansel |year=1995 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=21 August 2018}} - Review of ''[[Constantinople: City of the World's Desire 1453\u20131924]]''</ref> In exchange for the surrender of Constantinople, the emperor's life would be spared and he would continue to rule in Mystra. Constantine refused this offer. Instead he led the defense of the city and took an active part in the fighting along the [[Walls of Constantinople|land walls]]. At the same time, he used his diplomatic skills to maintain the necessary unity between the Genovese, Venetian, and Byzantine troops. As [[Fall of Constantinople|the city fell]] on May 29, 1453, Constantine is said to have remarked: \"The city is fallen but I am alive.\" Realizing that the end had come, he reportedly discarded his purple cloak and led his remaining soldiers into a [[Last stand|final charge]], in which he was killed. With his death, Roman imperial succession came to an end, almost 1500 years after [[Augustus]].\n\nAfter the fall of Constantinople, [[Thomas Palaiologos]], brother of Constantine XI, was elected emperor and tried to organize the remaining forces. His rule came to an end after the fall of the last major Byzantine city, [[Corinth]]. He then moved in Italy and continued to be recognized as Eastern emperor by the Christian powers.\n\nHis son [[Andreas Palaiologos]] continued claims on the Byzantine throne until he sold the title to Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, the grandparents of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===New Western lineage===\n[[File:Emperor Charles Conquers Furor (Leone Leoni).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was the last emperor of the Holy Roman Empire to receive a papal coronation (until abdication in [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor#Abdications and later life|1556]]).]]\nThe concept of the Roman Empire was renewed in the West with the coronation of the king of the Franks, [[Charlemagne]] (Charles the Great), as Roman emperor by the [[Pope]] on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], 800. This coronation had its roots in the decline of influence of the Pope in the affairs of the Byzantine Empire at the same time the Byzantine Empire declined in influence over politics in the West. The Pope saw no advantage to be derived from working with the Byzantine Empire, but as [[George Ostrogorsky]] points out, \"an alliance with the famous conqueror of the Lombards, on the other hand ... promised much\".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=164}}</ref>\n\nThe immediate response of the Eastern Roman emperor was not welcoming. \"At that time it was axiomatic that there could be only one Empire as there could be only one church\", writes Ostrogorsky. \"The coronation of Charles the Great violated all traditional ideas and struck a hard blow at Byzantine interests, for hitherto Byzantium, the new Rome, had unquestionably been regarded as the sole Empire which had taken over the inheritance of the old Roman ''imperium''. Conscious of its imperial rights, Byzantium could only consider the elevation of Charles the Great to be an act of usurpation.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=164f}}</ref>\n\n[[Nikephoros I]] chose to ignore Charlemagne's claim to the imperial title, clearly recognizing the implications of this act. According to Ostrogorsky, \"he even went so far as to refuse the Patriarch Nicephorus permission to dispatch the customary ''synodica'' to the Pope.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=175}}</ref> Meanwhile, Charlemagne's power steadily increased: he subdued Istria and several Dalmatian cities during the reign of [[Irene of Athens|Irene]], and his son [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]] brought [[Venice]] under Western hegemony, despite a successful counter-attack by the Byzantine fleet. Unable to counter this encroachment on Byzantine territory, Nikephoros' successor [[Michael I Rangabe]] capitulated; in return for the restoration of the captured territories, Michael sent Byzantine delegates to [[Aachen]] in 812 who recognized Charlemagne as ''Basileus''.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=176}}</ref> Michael did not recognize him as ''Basileus'' of the Romans, however, which was a title that he reserved for himself.<ref>Eichmann, Eduard (1942).

Echter-Verlag. p. 33.</ref>\n\nThis line of Roman emperors was actually generally [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] rather than Roman, but maintained their Roman-ness as a matter of principle. These emperors used a variety of titles (most frequently \"''Imperator Augustus''\") before finally settling on ''Imperator Romanus Electus'' (\"Elected Roman Emperor\"). Historians customarily assign them the title \"Holy Roman Emperor\", which has a basis in actual historical usage, and treat their \"[[Holy Roman Empire]]\" as a separate institution. To Latin Catholics of the time, the Pope was the temporal authority as well as spiritual authority, and as Bishop of Rome he was recognized as having the power to anoint or crown a new Roman emperor. The last man to be crowned by the [[Pope Clement VII|pope]] (although in [[Bologna]], not Rome) was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. All his successors bore only a title of \"Elected Roman Emperor\".\n\nThis line of Emperors lasted until 1806 when [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] dissolved the Empire during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite the existence of later potentates styling themselves \"emperor\", such as the Napoleons, the [[Habsburg]] [[Austrian Empire|Emperors of Austria]], and the [[Hohenzollern]] [[German Empire|heads of the German Reich]], this marked the end of the Western Empire. Although there is a living heir, [[Karl von Habsburg]], to the Habsburg dynasty, as well as a Pope and pretenders to the positions of the electors, and although all the medieval coronation regalia are still preserved in Austria, the legal abolition of all aristocratic prerogatives of the former electors and the imposition of republican constitutions in Germany and Austria render quite remote any potential for a revival of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n: ''For rulers of Italy after Romulus \"Augustulus\" and Julius Nepos, see list of [[King of Italy|barbarian kings]].''\n\n: ''For the Roman emperors who ruled in the East after The Fall in the West, see [[List of Byzantine emperors]].''\n\n: ''For emperors of the Holy Roman Empire in the West, see [[Holy Roman Emperor]].''\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]\n* [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]\n* [[Interregnum]]\n* [[Justitium]]\n* [[King of Rome]]\n* [[Roman Emperors family tree]]; also [[Julio-Claudian family tree]] and [[Severan dynasty family tree]]\n* [[Roman usurper]]\n\n===Lists===\n* [[List of Imperial Roman victory titles|List of Imperial Victory Titles]]\n* [[List of Roman emperors]]\n* [[List of Roman usurpers]]\n* [[List of condemned Roman emperors]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|title=Aspects of Roman history, AD 14\u2013117|last=Alston|first=Richard|year=1998|isbn= 978-0-415-13237-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwO_dzOVLw4C&pg=PA39|accessdate=2011-08-03|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|first=Timothy |last=Barnes|chapter= The first Emperor: the view of late antiquity|editor1-first=Miriam|editor1-last= Griffin|title=A Companion to Julius Caesar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzOXLGbIIYwC&pg=PA278|year=2009|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=978-1-4443-0845-7||ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Cambridge companion to the Age of Augustus|last=Galinsky|first=Karl|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-80796-8|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ftcx-5j7rjwC&pg=PA13|accessdate=2011-08-03|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower|last=Goldsworth|first=Adrian|year=2010|isbn=9780300164268|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/howromefelldeath0000gold}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Fall of the Roman Empire|last=Heather|first=Peter|year=2005|isbn=978-0-330-49136-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Jntu21N9K0C&pg=PA28|accessdate=2011-08-03|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book| first=George|last= Ostrogorsky| translator-first = Joan| translator-last = Hussey| title = History of the Byzantine State |location=New Brunswick| publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] | year = 1957|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Rees|first=Roger|title=Diocletian and the Tetrarchy|year=2004|location=Edinburgh, UK|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wV5oAAAAMAAJ}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9il6P3TPj-AC&pg=PA147|title=Diocletian and the Roman recovery|last=Williams|first=Stephen|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1997|isbn= 978-0-415-91827-5|location=New York, NY|pages=|ref=harv|orig-year=1985|accessdate=2011-08-03}}\n\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Scarre, Chris.

Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China's rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38 percent of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77 percent higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry. The slowdown has been negatively affected by structural shifts, especially necessary cuts in overcapacity (Figure 28).}}</ref>\n| Gini_rank                = \n| HDI                = 0.758 <!--number only-->\n| HDI_year                = 2018<!-- Please use the year to which the data refers, not the publication year-->\n| HDI_change                = increase <!--increase/decrease/steady-->\n| HDI_ref                = <ref name=\"UNHDR\">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking|title=Human Development Report 2019|language=en|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|date=10 December 2019|accessdate=10 December 2019|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| HDI_rank                = 85th\n| currency                = [[Renminbi]] (yuan; \u00a5){{efn|The [[Hong Kong Dollar]] is used in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] while the [[Macanese pataca]] is used in Macau only.}}\n| currency_code                = CNY\n| time_zone                = [[China Standard Time]]\n| utc_offset                = [[UTC+08:00|+8]]\n| date_format                = {{vunblist |yyyy-mm-dd |''or'' yyyy{{lang|zh|\u5e74}}m{{lang|zh|\u6708}}d{{lang|zh|\u65e5}} |([[Common Era|CE]]; [[Chinese calendar|CE-1949]])}}\n| drives_on                = right{{efn|Motor vehicles and metros drive on the right in mainland China.

For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and [[Northern Song]] (960\u20131127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China, as a whole, was ravaged by [[Warlord Era|feudal warlordism]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on [[mainland China]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led nationalist government retreated to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed to this day.\n\nChina is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]] and is one of the few existing [[socialist state]]s. [[List of Chinese dissidents|Political dissidents]] and [[human rights]] groups have denounced and criticized the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] for [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], [[Ethnic issues in China|suppression of religious and ethnic minorities]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], and cracking down on protests [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|such as in 1989]]. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and [[economic development]] is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\n\nSince the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], [[Economy of China|China's economy]] has been one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and since 2014, the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy in the world by PPP]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods. China is a recognized [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]] and has the world's [[List of countries by number of active troops|largest standing army]], the [[People's Liberation Army]], and the [[Military budget of China|second-largest defense budget]]. The PRC is a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus mechanism]].

Heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard, which is mainly caused by lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure.

Higher income inequality is partly driven by unequal regional income distribution. The eastern coastal regions have been the driver of China's rapid growth, due to its geographic location and the early introduction of reforms. As a result, the eastern coastal region is now home to 38 percent of the population, and its per capita GDP was 77 percent higher than that of the central, western, and northeastern regions in 2018. This gap widened further in the first three quarters of 2019. This is in part due to a disproportionate slowdown in interior provinces, which are more dependent on commodities and heavy industry. The slowdown has been negatively affected by structural shifts, especially necessary cuts in overcapacity (Figure 28).}}</ref>\n| Gini_rank                = \n| HDI                = 0.758 <!--number only-->\n| HDI_year                = 2018<!-- Please use the year to which the data refers, not the publication year-->\n| HDI_change                = increase <!--increase/decrease/steady-->\n| HDI_ref                = <ref name=\"UNHDR\">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/2019-human-development-index-ranking|title=Human Development Report 2019|language=en|publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|date=10 December 2019|accessdate=10 December 2019|format=PDF}}</ref>\n| HDI_rank                = 85th\n| currency                = [[Renminbi]] (yuan; \u00a5){{efn|The [[Hong Kong Dollar]] is used in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] while the [[Macanese pataca]] is used in Macau only.}}\n| currency_code                = CNY\n| time_zone                = [[China Standard Time]]\n| utc_offset                = [[UTC+08:00|+8]]\n| date_format                = {{vunblist |yyyy-mm-dd |''or'' yyyy{{lang|zh|\u5e74}}m{{lang|zh|\u6708}}d{{lang|zh|\u65e5}} |([[Common Era|CE]]; [[Chinese calendar|CE-1949]])}}\n| drives_on                = right{{efn|Motor vehicles and metros drive on the right in mainland China.

For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythical [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]]. Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]], along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and [[Northern Song]] (960\u20131127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China (ROC)]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. China, as a whole, was ravaged by [[Warlord Era|feudal warlordism]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]]. The subsequent [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China]] led by [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|established]] the People's Republic of China on [[mainland China]] while the [[Kuomintang]]-led nationalist government retreated to the island of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed to this day.\n\nChina is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist republic]] and is one of the few existing [[socialist state]]s. [[List of Chinese dissidents|Political dissidents]] and [[human rights]] groups have denounced and criticized the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] for [[Human rights in China|human rights abuses]], [[Ethnic issues in China|suppression of religious and ethnic minorities]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], and cracking down on protests [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|such as in 1989]]. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and [[economic development]] is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\n\nSince the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], [[Economy of China|China's economy]] has been one of the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second-largest economy by nominal GDP]], and since 2014, the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|largest economy in the world by PPP]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods.

Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure.

Bathildis'',{{sfn|McNamara|p=264}} Balthild was born circa 626\u2013627. She was beautiful, intelligent, modest and attentive to the needs of others. Balthild was sold into [[slavery]] as a young girl and served in the household of [[Erchinoald]], the [[mayor of the palace]] of Neustria to Clovis. Erchinoald, whose wife had died, was attracted to Balthild and wanted to marry her, but she did not want to marry him. She hid herself away and waited until Erchinoald had remarried.  Later, possibly because of Erchinoald, Clovis noticed her and asked for her hand in marriage.<ref>Theuws, De Jong and van Rhijn, ''Topographies of Power'', p. 255.</ref><ref>Madigan, ''Mystics, Visionaries, and Prophets'', p. 60.</ref>\n\nEven as queen, Balthild remained humble and modest.  She is famous for her charitable service and generous donations.  From her donations, the [[abbey]]s of [[Corbie Abbey|Corbie]] and [[Chelles Abbey|Chelles]] were founded; it is likely that others such as [[Jumi\u00e8ges Abbey|Jumi\u00e8ges]], [[Jouarre Abbey|Jouarre]] and [[Luxeuil Abbey|Luxeuil]] were also founded by the queen.  She provided support for [[Saint Claudius of Besan\u00e7on]] and his abbey in the [[Jura Mountains]].\n\nBalthild bore Clovis three children, all of whom became kings: [[Clotaire III|Clotaire]], [[Childeric II|Childeric]] and [[Theuderic III|Theuderic]].\n\nWhen Clovis died (between 655 and 658), his eldest son Clotaire succeeded to the throne.  His mother Balthild acted as the queen regent.  As queen, she was a capable stateswoman.  She abolished the practice of trading Christian slaves and strove to free children who had been sold into slavery. This claim is corroborated by Jane Tibbetts Schulenburg, who mentions that Balthild and Saint Eloi (who was also known as Eligius, according to Dado)<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/eligius.asp ''The Life of St. Eligius'', (trans.

When she confessed her visions to the queen, she was immediately cured.  Because of these visions, Balthild was convinced to strip off her gold and jeweled ornaments, \"keeping nothing except gold bracelets.\" According to the rest of the text, the gold she removed was separated into alms for the poor.

The other side would have been used only for private papers. It is uncertain why the seal matrix came to East Anglia. It may have been a gift, or a representative of Balthild may have worn it as a form of identification.

Balthild was [[canonised]] by [[Pope Nicholas I]],<ref name=Fournet/> around 200 years after her death.\n\n== Other sources ==\n\n''Sainted Women of the Dark Ages'' states that Balthild \u201cwas not the first Merovingian queen to begin her career in servitude\u201d.{{sfn|McNamara, pp.264\u2013278}} Other Merovingian queens who arose from servile status include [[Fredegund]], the mother of [[Clothaire II]]; [[Bilichild]], the wife of Theudebert of Austrasia; and possibly [[Nanthild]], the mother of Clovis II.{{sfn|McNamara, p. 264}} During the minority of Clotaire III, she had to deal with the attempted coup of [[Grimoald the Elder|Grimoald]], the major domus of Austrasia, but she enjoyed the continued support of her former master Erchinoald, who became a sort of 'political mentor' to her throughout her marriage to Clovis II.{{sfn|McNamara, p. 265}}\n\nAccording to some historians, Balthild's creation of and involvement with monasteries was perhaps an act to \u201cbalance or even neutralize the efforts of the aristocratic opposition\u201d.{{sfn|McNamara, p. 26}} By installing her supporters as bishops of different sees, she gained even greater power as a ruler.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Vita Sancti Wilfrithi]]'' by [[Stephen of Ripon]], Bathild was a ruthless ruler, in conflict with the bishops and perhaps responsible for several assassinations.<ref>[[Bede]] reported that [[Aunemundus]], [[bishop of Lyon]], was assassinated at her instigation in 658.</ref> However, the bishop she so famously murdered, Dalfinus, is not listed as a bishop of Lyon. The story may have been written to embellish the life of Wilfrid.<ref>Sir William Smith, William George Smith, and Henry Wace, ''A Dictionary of Christian biography, literature, sects and doctrines'', (London: William Clowes and Sons, 1877)</ref>\n\nA fragment of an apron thought to have belonged to Balthild is taken by scholars as evidence for her piety and frugality. Her devotion to her faith and forsaking of luxury is evident from a cross embroiled on the apron in silk, rather than gold thread.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Queenship in Medieval Europe|last=Earenfight|first=Theresa|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2013|isbn=978-0-2302-7646-8|location=New York|pages=62}}</ref>\n<!-- The ''vita of Saint Eligius'' by his companion Dado reports in chapter 2 of book 32, \"Then his widowed queen with her boys obtained the reign for a few years.

When she confessed her visions to the queen, she was immediately cured.  Because of these visions, Balthild was convinced to strip off her gold and jeweled ornaments, \"keeping nothing except gold bracelets.\" According to the rest of the text, the gold she removed was separated into alms for the poor.

The other side would have been used only for private papers. It is uncertain why the seal matrix came to East Anglia. It may have been a gift, or a representative of Balthild may have worn it as a form of identification. It has also been suggested that the seal matrix was returned to Balthild's kin after she died.<ref name=BBC/> [[Paul Fouracre]] of the University of Manchester speculates that the seal may belong to a different Baldahildis entirely.<ref>[https://uomhistory.com/2016/11/02/unravelling-the-mystery-of-queen-balthild-professor-paul-fouracre-on-a-ring-that-sparked-a-lot-of-head-scratching/ Fouracre, Paul. \"Unravelling the mystery of Queen Balthild\", ''Manchester History'', November 2, 2016]</ref> The seal matrix is in the keeping of the [[Norwich Castle Museum]].\n\n== Chemise of Balthild ==\nBalthild\u2019s ornate [[chemise]] both expresses her dedication to the church, as well as her status as a queen to [[Clovis II]].

There is no evidence for any connection with [[Glastonbury]] and John Scott shows in ''An Early History of Glastonbury'' that the legend purporting that Joseph of Arimathea founded the Abbey there is of 12th or 13th-century origin and has no basis in fact. Rather, the early writings frequently centre on Aristobulus.<ref name=\"Lewis 1955\"/> There is no mention of Joseph prior to the [[Norman Conquest|Conquest]]. For this and other reasons, Smith also considers the account of Joseph of Arimathea a \"superstitious fable of comparatively modern invention\".{{sfn|Smith, p.119}}\n\nJohn Williams identifies Aristobulus with Arwystli Hen, a \"man of Italy\", and one of four missionaries believed to have brought Christianity to the British Isles.<ref name=Williams>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xdhUAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA57&dq=Saint+Aristobulus+of+Britannia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aayDVN3PJdHlsAT8k4HwCg&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Saint%20Aristobulus%20of%20Britannia&f=false Williams, John.

However, it is this man's father who was the husband of Salome, as mentioned by Alford (see previous section).\n\nIn 55, [[Nero]] appointed Aristobulus of Chalcis as King of [[Armenia Minor]]. He participated with his forces in the [[Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363]], where he received a small portion of Armenia in exchange,<ref>[[Tacitus]], ''Annals'', XIII.7; XIV.26</ref> an area he continued to rule until 72 when Vespasian reduced the regional autonomy of some of the provinces.<ref name=\"eedictaristo\">{{Cite DGRBM|author=EE|title=Aristobu'lus|volume=1|page=301|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aentry%3Daristobulus-bio-10|short=}}</ref>\n\nIt is probable that the \"Philip\" (mentioned above) are those mentioned in the New Testament are [[Philip the Tetrarch]]. The matter is disputed by scholars. There is no contemporary evidence for Philip the Tetrarch's use of the name \"Herod Philip\" as a dynastic title, as did occur with his brothers Herod Antipas and Herod Archelaus, yet he was of the same family and the scriptural reference may be emphasising this fact, as do later scriptural commentators. Today, [[Herod II]] is sometimes called \"Herod Philip I\" (because the gospels call the husband of Herodias \"Philip\"), and then Philip the Tetrarch is called \"Herod Philip II\", but this is an anachronistic convention.<ref>Note: It is an example of the great difficulty in establishing the relationships of various holders of the same name in the same area or family - especially in the Herodian dynasty.</ref><ref name=\"kok\">Kokkinos, Nikkos 'The Herodian Dynasty: Origins, Role in Society and Eclipse', ''Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha Supplement Series'', 1998, Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, 236\u2013240</ref> Kokkinos says, \"The stubborn existence of many theologians in referring to Herod III as 'Herod Philip' is without any value...No illusory Herod Philip ever existed.\"<ref name=\"kok\"/><sup>[p 223-233]; [266]</sup> Philip the Tetrarch, \"unlike his brothers, did not use Herod as a dynastic name.\"<ref>Bowman, Alan K., Champlin Edward, and [[Andrew Lintott|Lintott, Andrew]] (edd) (2001), ''Cambridge Ancient History'', Vol.10, ''The Augustan Empire, 43 B.C.-A.D. 69'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Refers to him throughout as Philip, or Philip the Tetrarch.</ref>  Philip's half-brothers, Archelaus and Antipas, had adopted the name of Herod, \"presumably\" for a dynastic claim from Herod the Great.<ref>''Cambridge Ancient History'', (latest reprint 1965), Gen. eds.: J.B.
