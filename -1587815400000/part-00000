The episode features [[Young Justice]] team members [[Dick Grayson|Robin]], [[Aqualad]], [[Superboy]], and [[Kid Flash]], while [[Miss Martian]] and [[Artemis Crock|Artemis]] joined later in the series. References to the cartoons ''[[Super Friends (1973 TV series)|Super Friends]]'', ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' appear in the episode. \"Independence Day\" won an [[Emmy Award]] for Individual Achievement in Animation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/07/community-young-justice-win-emmys-for-animation |title=''Community'', ''Young Justice'' Win Emmys for Animation |author=Eric Goldman |date=September 7, 2011 |work=[[IGN]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], [[Batman]], [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]], [[Aquaman]], and [[Green Arrow]], along with their respective proteges [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]], [[Aqualad (Kaldur'ahm)|Aqualad]] and [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]], each defeat a villain with ice powers, the latter in each duo telling the former how important the day is to them. Later, they all go to the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]] in Washington D.C. so that the proteges can be granted complete access to the Hall and officially inducted into the [[Justice League]] by [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Red Tornado]]. The mentors prepare to step out for a discussion of the day's events, but Speedy furiously decides he has had enough with the League and media disregarding the proteges as \"sidekicks\", revealing to the other young heroes that the Hall of Justice is a front for the league's real headquarters that is [[Justice League Watchtower|in space]] before leaving. The young heroes are put into disbelief about the mentors keeping such things from them, and [[Superman]] contacts the mentors about a fire at [[Project Cadmus]]. Batman mentions how he always had suspicions about Project Cadmus, but as he considers using the opportunity to investigate it, [[Zatara]] subsequently contacts the League for their full support to help him stop [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]] from blotting out the sun. The mentors decide to let the fire department handle the fire and focus on stopping Wotan. As the mentors leave, they order the young heroes to stay put, but Robin suggests they investigate Project Cadmus and solve the case before the League does. They all agree and the trio sets off.\n\nThe three arrive at Cadmus Labs, saving the scientists from the fire and subsequently discovering an army of genetically engineered creatures used as weapons by Cadmus. They encounter Cadmus head of security Guardian, who is being mind-controlled by Cadmus' \"genomorphs\". Following a narrow escape, the three discover Project Kr, a teenage clone of Superman engineered by Cadmus and fed info by genomorphs. They are captured by Dr. Mark Desmond.\n\nAfterwards, Desmond contacts the Cadmus board of directors to ask what to do with the young heroes. They order him to clone them and kill the originals. Meanwhile, the young heroes are awoken by a disembodied voice to find themselves strapped in pods and the clone in a trance. The clone suddenly regains consciousness from the G-Gnomes' mind control. He explains that he is [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], a clone of Superman, created to either replace him if he were killed, or to kill him if he went rogue. Upon hearing this, they offer him a chance of freedom from Cadmus and to meet Superman himself. Before he could make his decision, he is mind controlled again into going back into his pod while the young heroes are subjected to the painful cloning process. Superboy overhears Aqualad telling him that he has the right to make his own choices and asks him: \"What would Superman do?\". Superboy decides to rescue them. As they make their escape, [[Dubbilex]] reveals that he started the fire to attract the heroes and free him and the other genomorphs as well. After the G-gnomes free Guardian of their telepathy, Desmond arrives to stop the heroes, drinking a serum known as project: [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], turning him into a powerful beast. After he knocks out Guardian, the ensuring fight between blockbuster and the young heroes reaches the surface, where they finally defeat him by causing the entire building to collapse on top of him.\n\nThe Justice League then arrives and meet Superboy. Superman feels uneasy around his clone, much to Superboy's disappointment, but assures him that the League will help him as they leave to bring blockbuster to Belle Reve. Though they now have enough evidence to put Project Cadmus under full investigation, the mentors reprehend the young heroes for disobeying their orders, but they respond by asserting that what they have done was something important and convince the League to let them form a team. Three days later, with Project Cadmus as proof of how more organized villains are getting, Batman decides to have them work as a Covert Ops. team with Mount Justice as their headquarters. Batman will assign them on missions, Red Tornado will be their supervisor, and [[Black Canary]] will train them. [[Miss Martian]], Martian Manhunter's niece, also joins them. Meanwhile, as Guardian is appointed as the new head of Project Cadmus, the Cadmus board of directors, known as [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]], contemplates on the young heroes destroying Cadmus and freeing Superboy.\n\n==Development==\n''Young Justice'' is not based on the comic book series of the same name created by Todd Dezago and Todd Nauck,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and differs from it in some key ways.

Just as they finish the rescue, Woody watches as Bo is donated to a new owner, and considers going with her, but ultimately decides to remain with Andy. [[Toy Story 3|Years later]], a teenage Andy donates them to Bonnie, a younger child, before he goes off to college. While the toys are grateful to have a new child, Woody struggles to adapt to an environment where he is not the favorite as he was with Andy, apparent when Bonnie takes Woody's sheriff badge and puts it on [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]] instead, not even bothering to give him a role during her playtime.\n\nOn the day of Bonnie's kindergarten orientation, Woody worries over her and sneaks into her backpack. After a classmate takes away Bonnie's arts and crafts supplies, Woody covertly recovers the materials and various pieces of garbage from the trash, including a plastic [[spork]]. Bonnie uses these to create a bipedal spork with googly eyes, whom she dubs \"[[Forky]]\". Forky comes to life in Bonnie's backpack and begins to experience an [[existential crisis]], thinking he is garbage rather than a toy and wishing to remain in a trash can. As Forky becomes Bonnie's favorite toy, Woody takes it upon himself to prevent Forky from throwing himself away.\n\nWhen Bonnie's family goes on a [[road trip]], Forky jumps out of the RV window, and Woody pursues him. After Woody explains how important he is to Bonnie, Forky decides to accompany Woody and return to her. Near the RV park where Bonnie's family is staying, Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in an antique store window and goes in, hoping to find her. Inside, he and Forky encounter a [[Chatty Cathy|talking doll]] named Gabby Gabby, who desires Woody's voice box to replace her broken one. While Woody is able to escape, Gabby captures Forky. At a playground, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep Billy, Goat, and Gruff, who now live as \"lost\" toys that are not dedicated to one child. Bo agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] searches for Woody but gets lost at a fairground and becomes a [[carnival game]] prize. He escapes with plush toys Ducky and Bunny, and they meet up with Woody and Bo. With the help of [[Polly Pocket|pocket toy]] cop Giggle McDimples and stuntman toy Duke Caboom, they unsuccessfully try to rescue Forky from Gabby, her [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist puppet]] henchmen, and the store owner's cat. In the aftermath of the failed rescue, Bo and the other toys argue over whether to go back. Woody declares that rescuing Forky is his remaining purpose and tells Bo that being loyal is something a lost toy would not understand. Alone, Woody encounters Gabby again, who expresses her longing for a child's love. Woody sympathizes with her plight and willingly trades his voice box for Forky.\n\nThe toys part ways, but Woody watches Gabby as she is rejected by her ideal owner, Harmony. Woody comforts a heartbroken Gabby and invites her to become one of Bonnie's toys. Bo returns with the others to help and reconciles with Woody. They head for the carnival, while Forky fetches Buzz and Bonnie's toys; they interfere with the RV's controls, forcing Bonnie's father to drive back to the carnival. When Gabby sees a crying girl lost in the carnival, she decides instead to become that child's toy, emboldening the child to approach a security guard and be reunited with her parents.\n\nAt the carousel, Woody and Bo share a bittersweet goodbye, but Woody is hesitant to leave Bo again. After Buzz tells Woody that Bonnie will be okay even without him, Woody decides to stay with Bo instead of returning to Bonnie. Woody passes his sheriff badge over to Jessie and bids a heartfelt farewell to his friends.\n\nWoody and Bo begin a new life with Ducky, Bunny, Giggle, and Duke, dedicated to finding new owners for lost toys. On her first day of first grade, Bonnie creates a second impromptu toy out of a plastic knife, who suffers the same existential crisis Forky once did, and who is immediately smitten with her.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]<ref name=YahooHanksUpdate />\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]]<ref name=\"TheWrap\" />\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]]<ref name=\"bo peep\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|title='Toy Story 4': Bo Peep Officially Returns in New Teaser|first=Charles|last=Ridgley|date=January 28, 2019|accessdate=January 28, 2019|work=Comicbook.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128225301/https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|archive-date=January 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tony Hale]] as [[Forky]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|title=Toy Story 4 Teaser Trailer Introduces New Non-Toy Character|website=www.slashfilm.com|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210851/https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|archive-date=November 12, 2018|url-status=live|date=November 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\" TheHollywood Reporter\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |title='Toy Story 4' Teaser Trailer Introduces New Toy Forky |date=November 12, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US |access-date=November 12, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210905/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |archivedate=November 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Ducky|Ducky]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\" />\n* [[Jordan Peele]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Bunny|Bunny]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|title=Toy Story 4: New trailer introduces Ducky and Bunny, played by Key and Peele|website=IGN|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=November 13, 2018|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113155053/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/key-and-peele-reprise-one-of-their-best-bits-in-this-ne-1830410355|title=Key and Peele reprise one of their best bits in this new Toy Story 4 clip|first=Dan|last=Neilan|date=November 13, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|work=[[The A.V.

Just as they finish the rescue, Woody watches as Bo is donated to a new owner, and considers going with her, but ultimately decides to remain with Andy. [[Toy Story 3|Years later]], a teenage Andy donates them to Bonnie, a younger child, before he goes off to college. While the toys are grateful to have a new child, Woody struggles to adapt to an environment where he is not the favorite as he was with Andy, apparent when Bonnie takes Woody's sheriff badge and puts it on [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]] instead, not even bothering to give him a role during her playtime.\n\nOn the day of Bonnie's kindergarten orientation, Woody worries over her and sneaks into her backpack. After a classmate takes away Bonnie's arts and crafts supplies, Woody covertly recovers the materials and various pieces of garbage from the trash, including a plastic [[spork]]. Bonnie uses these to create a bipedal spork with googly eyes, whom she dubs \"[[Forky]]\". Forky comes to life in Bonnie's backpack and begins to experience an [[existential crisis]], thinking he is garbage rather than a toy and wishing to remain in a trash can. As Forky becomes Bonnie's favorite toy, Woody takes it upon himself to prevent Forky from throwing himself away.\n\nWhen Bonnie's family goes on a [[road trip]], Forky jumps out of the RV window, and Woody pursues him. After Woody explains how important he is to Bonnie, Forky decides to accompany Woody and return to her. Near the RV park where Bonnie's family is staying, Woody spots Bo Peep's lamp in an antique store window and goes in, hoping to find her. Inside, he and Forky encounter a [[Chatty Cathy|talking doll]] named Gabby Gabby, who desires Woody's voice box to replace her broken one. While Woody is able to escape, Gabby captures Forky. At a playground, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep and her sheep Billy, Goat, and Gruff, who now live as \"lost\" toys that are not dedicated to one child. Bo agrees to help Woody save Forky and get back to Bonnie.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Buzz Lightyear|Buzz]] searches for Woody but gets lost at a fairground and becomes a [[carnival game]] prize. He escapes with plush toys Ducky and Bunny, and they meet up with Woody and Bo. With the help of [[Polly Pocket|pocket toy]] cop Giggle McDimples and stuntman toy Duke Caboom, they unsuccessfully try to rescue Forky from Gabby, her [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist puppet]] henchmen, and the store owner's cat. In the aftermath of the failed rescue, Bo and the other toys argue over whether to go back. Woody declares that rescuing Forky is his remaining purpose and tells Bo that being loyal is something a lost toy would not understand. Alone, Woody encounters Gabby again, who expresses her longing for a child's love. Woody sympathizes with her plight and willingly trades his voice box for Forky.\n\nThe toys part ways, but Woody watches Gabby as she is rejected by her ideal owner, Harmony. Woody comforts a heartbroken Gabby and invites her to become one of Bonnie's toys. Bo returns with the others to help and reconciles with Woody. They head for the carnival, while Forky fetches Buzz and Bonnie's toys; they interfere with the RV's controls, forcing Bonnie's father to drive back to the carnival. When Gabby sees a crying girl lost in the carnival, she decides instead to become that child's toy, emboldening the child to approach a security guard and be reunited with her parents.\n\nAt the carousel, Woody and Bo share a bittersweet goodbye, but Woody is hesitant to leave Bo again. After Buzz tells Woody that Bonnie will be okay even without him, Woody decides to stay with Bo instead of returning to Bonnie. Woody passes his sheriff badge over to Jessie and bids a heartfelt farewell to his friends.\n\nWoody and Bo begin a life together with Ducky, Bunny, Giggle, and Duke, dedicated to finding new owners for lost toys. On her first day of first grade, Bonnie creates a second impromptu toy out of a plastic knife, who suffers the same existential crisis as Forky once did, who immediately becomes smitten with her.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]]<ref name=YahooHanksUpdate />\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]]<ref name=\"TheWrap\" />\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]]<ref name=\"bo peep\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|title='Toy Story 4': Bo Peep Officially Returns in New Teaser|first=Charles|last=Ridgley|date=January 28, 2019|accessdate=January 28, 2019|work=Comicbook.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128225301/https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/01/28/toy-story-4-teaser-bo-peep-return/|archive-date=January 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Tony Hale]] as [[Forky]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|title=Toy Story 4 Teaser Trailer Introduces New Non-Toy Character|website=www.slashfilm.com|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210851/https://www.slashfilm.com/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer/|archive-date=November 12, 2018|url-status=live|date=November 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\" TheHollywood Reporter\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |title='Toy Story 4' Teaser Trailer Introduces New Toy Forky |date=November 12, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US |access-date=November 12, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112210905/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/toy-story-4-teaser-trailer-new-character-forky-joins-toys-1160313 |archivedate=November 12, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* [[Keegan-Michael Key]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Ducky|Ducky]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\" />\n* [[Jordan Peele]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Bunny|Bunny]]<ref name=\"DuckyBunny\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|title=Toy Story 4: New trailer introduces Ducky and Bunny, played by Key and Peele|website=IGN|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=November 13, 2018|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113155053/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/toy-story-4-new-teaser-introduces-ducky-bunny-played-by-key-peele|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/key-and-peele-reprise-one-of-their-best-bits-in-this-ne-1830410355|title=Key and Peele reprise one of their best bits in this new Toy Story 4 clip|first=Dan|last=Neilan|date=November 13, 2018|accessdate=November 13, 2018|work=[[The A.V.

With the advances in micro- and nanofabrication techniques, continued miniaturization of the conventional optical lenses has always been requested for various applications such as communications, sensors, data storage and a wide range of other technology-driven and consumer-driven industries. Specifically, ever smaller sizes, as well as thinner thicknesses of micro lenses, are highly needed for subwavelength optics or nano-optics with extremely small structures, particularly for visible and near-IR applications. Also, as the distance scale for optical communications shrinks, the required feature sizes of micro lenses are rapidly pushed down.\n\nRecently, the excellent properties of newly discovered graphene oxide provide novel solutions to overcome the challenges of current planar focusing devices. Specifically, [[giant refractive index modification]] (as large as 10^-1), which is one order of magnitude larger than the current materials, between graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been demonstrated by dynamically manipulating its oxygen content using [[direct laser writing]] (DLW) method. As a result, the overall lens thickness can be potentially reduced by more than ten times. Also, the linear optical absorption of GO is found to increase as the reduction of GO deepens, which results in transmission contrast between GO and rGO and therefore provides amplitude modulation mechanism. Moreover, both the refractive index and the optical absorption are found to be dispersionless over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. Finally, GO film offers flexible patterning capability by using the maskless DLW method, which reduces the manufacturing complexity and requirement.\n\nAs a result, a novel ultrathin [[planar lens]] on a GO thin film has been realized recently using the DLW method.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150922/ncomms9433/full/ncomms9433.html|title = Highly efficient and ultra-broadband graphene oxide ultrathin lenses with three-dimensional subwavelength focusing|last = |first = |date = September 22, 2015|work = Xiaorui Zheng|accessdate = August 20, 2015}}</ref> The distinct advantage of the GO flat lens is that phase modulation and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously, which are attributed to the giant refractive index modulation and the variable linear optical absorption of GO during its reduction process, respectively. Due to the enhanced wavefront shaping capability, the lens thickness is pushed down to subwavelength scale (~200&nbsp;nm), which is thinner than all current [[dielectric lens]]es (~ \u00b5m scale). The focusing intensities and the focal length can be controlled effectively by varying the laser powers and the lens sizes, respectively. By using oil immersion high NA objective during DLW process, 300&nbsp;nm fabrication feature size on GO film has been realized, and therefore the minimum lens size has been shrink down to 4.6&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, which is the smallest planar micro lens and can only be realized with metasurface by FIB. Thereafter, the focal length can be reduced to as small as 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5m, which would potentially increase the numerical aperture (NA) and the focusing resolution.\n\nThe full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 320&nbsp;nm at the minimum focal spot using 650&nbsp;nm input beam has been demonstrated experimentally, which corresponding to the effective numerical aperture (NA) of 1.24 (n=1.5), the largest NA of current micro lenses. Furthermore, ultra-broadband focusing capability from 500&nbsp;nm to as far as 2&nbsp;\u00b5m have been realized with the same planar lens, which is still a major challenge of focusing in infrared range due to limited availability of suitable materials and fabrication technology. Most importantly, the synthesized high quality GO thin films can be flexibly integrated on various substrates and easily manufactured by using the one-step DLW method over a large area at a comparable low cost and power (~nJ/pulse), which eventually makes the GO flat lenses promising for various practical applications.\n\n=== Energy Conversion ===\nPhotocatalytic Water Splitting is an artificial photosynthesis process in which water is dissociated into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), using artificial or natural light. Methods such as photocatalytic water splitting are currently being investigated to produce hydrogen as a clean source of energy. The superior electron mobility and high surface area of graphene oxide sheets suggest it may be implemented as a catalyst that meets the requirements for this process. Specifically, graphene oxide\u2019s compositional functional groups of epoxide (-O-) and hydroxide (-OH) allow for more flexible control in the water splitting process. This flexibility can be used to tailor the band gap and band positions that are targeted in photocatalytic water splitting. Recent research experiments have demonstrated that photocatalytic activity of graphene oxide containing a band gap within the required limits has produced effective splitting results, particularly when used with 40-50% coverage at a 2:1 hydroxide:epoxide ratio. When used in composite materials with CdS (a typical catalyst used in photocatalytic water splitting), graphene oxide nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit increased hydrogen production and quantum efficiency.\n\n=== Hydrogen Storage ===\nGraphene oxide is also being explored for its applications in hydrogen storage. Hydrogen molecules can be stored among the oxygen-based functional groups found throughout the sheet. This hydrogen storage capability can be further manipulated by modulating the interlayer distance between sheets, as well as making changes to the pore sizes. Research in transition metal decoration on carbon sorbents to enhance hydrogen binding energy has led to experiments with titanium and magnesium anchored to hydroxyl groups, allowing for the binding of multiple hydrogen molecules.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oxocarbon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n{{Oxides of carbon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graphite Oxide}}\n[[Category:Oxocarbons]]\n[[Category:Graphene]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Graphite oxide.svg|thumb|Structure proposed in 1998<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = H. | last2 = Klinowski | first2 = J. | last3 = Forster | first3 = M. | last4 = Lerf | first4 = A. | title = A new structural model for graphite oxide | doi = 10.1016/S0009-2614(98)00144-4 | journal = Chemical Physics Letters | volume = 287 | issue = 1 | pages = 53 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1998CPL...287...53H }}</ref> with functional groups.

Bacteria were used to produce a material consisting of two [[nanocellulose]] layers. The lower layer contains pristine [[cellulose]], while the top layer contains cellulose and graphene oxide, which absorbs sunlight and produces heat. The system draws water from below into the material. The water diffuses into the higher layer, where it evaporates and leaves behind any contaminants. The evaporate condenses on  top, where it can be captured. The film is produced by repeatedly adding a fluid coating that hardens. Bacteria produce nanocellulose fibers with interspersed graphene oxide flakes. The film is light and easily manufactured at scale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/graphene-oxide-water-purification-wustl/44586|title=Graphene-based sheets make dirty water drinkable simply and cheaply|last=Jeffrey|first=Colin|date=July 27, 2016|website=newatlas.com|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Coating ===\nOptically transparent, multilayer films made from ''graphene oxide ''are impermeable under dry conditions.

Graphene oxide-based composites functionalized with metal oxides and sulfides have been shown in recent research to induce enhanced battery performance. This has similarly been adapted into applications in supercapacitors, since the electronic properties of graphene oxide allow it to bypass some of the more prevalent restrictions of typical transition metal oxide electrodes.

With the advances in micro- and nanofabrication techniques, continued miniaturization of the conventional optical lenses has always been requested for various applications such as communications, sensors, data storage and a wide range of other technology-driven and consumer-driven industries. Specifically, ever smaller sizes, as well as thinner thicknesses of micro lenses, are highly needed for subwavelength optics or nano-optics with extremely small structures, particularly for visible and near-IR applications. Also, as the distance scale for optical communications shrinks, the required feature sizes of micro lenses are rapidly pushed down.\n\nRecently, the excellent properties of newly discovered graphene oxide provide novel solutions to overcome the challenges of current planar focusing devices. Specifically, [[giant refractive index modification]] (as large as 10^-1), which is one order of magnitude larger than the current materials, between graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been demonstrated by dynamically manipulating its oxygen content using [[direct laser writing]] (DLW) method. As a result, the overall lens thickness can be potentially reduced by more than ten times. Also, the linear optical absorption of GO is found to increase as the reduction of GO deepens, which results in transmission contrast between GO and rGO and therefore provides amplitude modulation mechanism. Moreover, both the refractive index and the optical absorption are found to be dispersionless over a broad wavelength range from visible to near infrared. Finally, GO film offers flexible patterning capability by using the maskless DLW method, which reduces the manufacturing complexity and requirement.\n\nAs a result, a novel ultrathin [[planar lens]] on a GO thin film has been realized recently using the DLW method.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150922/ncomms9433/full/ncomms9433.html|title = Highly efficient and ultra-broadband graphene oxide ultrathin lenses with three-dimensional subwavelength focusing|last = |first = |date = September 22, 2015|work = Xiaorui Zheng|accessdate = August 20, 2015}}</ref> The distinct advantage of the GO flat lens is that phase modulation and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously, which are attributed to the giant refractive index modulation and the variable linear optical absorption of GO during its reduction process, respectively. Due to the enhanced wavefront shaping capability, the lens thickness is pushed down to subwavelength scale (~200&nbsp;nm), which is thinner than all current [[dielectric lens]]es (~ \u00b5m scale). The focusing intensities and the focal length can be controlled effectively by varying the laser powers and the lens sizes, respectively. By using oil immersion high NA objective during DLW process, 300&nbsp;nm fabrication feature size on GO film has been realized, and therefore the minimum lens size has been shrink down to 4.6&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, which is the smallest planar micro lens and can only be realized with metasurface by FIB. Thereafter, the focal length can be reduced to as small as 0.8&nbsp;\u00b5m, which would potentially increase the numerical aperture (NA) and the focusing resolution.\n\nThe full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 320&nbsp;nm at the minimum focal spot using 650&nbsp;nm input beam has been demonstrated experimentally, which corresponding to the effective numerical aperture (NA) of 1.24 (n=1.5), the largest NA of current micro lenses. Furthermore, ultra-broadband focusing capability from 500&nbsp;nm to as far as 2&nbsp;\u00b5m have been realized with the same planar lens, which is still a major challenge of focusing in infrared range due to limited availability of suitable materials and fabrication technology. Most importantly, the synthesized high quality GO thin films can be flexibly integrated on various substrates and easily manufactured by using the one-step DLW method over a large area at a comparable low cost and power (~nJ/pulse), which eventually makes the GO flat lenses promising for various practical applications.\n\n=== Energy Conversion ===\nPhotocatalytic Water Splitting is an artificial photosynthesis process in which water is dissociated into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), using artificial or natural light. Methods such as photocatalytic water splitting are currently being investigated to produce hydrogen as a clean source of energy. The superior electron mobility and high surface area of graphene oxide sheets suggest it may be implemented as a catalyst that meets the requirements for this process. Specifically, graphene oxide\u2019s compositional functional groups of epoxide (-O-) and hydroxide (-OH) allow for more flexible control in the water splitting process. This flexibility can be used to tailor the band gap and band positions that are targeted in photocatalytic water splitting. Recent research experiments have demonstrated that photocatalytic activity of graphene oxide containing a band gap within the required limits has produced effective splitting results, particularly when used with 40-50% coverage at a 2:1 hydroxide:epoxide ratio. When used in composite materials with CdS (a typical catalyst used in photocatalytic water splitting), graphene oxide nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit increased hydrogen production and quantum efficiency.\n\n=== Hydrogen Storage ===\nGraphene oxide is also being explored for its applications in hydrogen storage. Hydrogen molecules can be stored among the oxygen-based functional groups found throughout the sheet. This hydrogen storage capability can be further manipulated by modulating the interlayer distance between sheets, as well as making changes to the pore sizes. Research in transition metal decoration on carbon sorbents to enhance hydrogen binding energy has led to experiments with titanium and magnesium anchored to hydroxyl groups, allowing for the binding of multiple hydrogen molecules.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oxocarbon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n{{Oxides of carbon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Graphite Oxide}}\n[[Category:Oxocarbons]]\n[[Category:Graphene]]\n", "name_user": "Qx8314", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRelation to water:Add image in water, one sentence on reactivity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite_oxide"}

Jeremy ([[Steven R. McQueen]]) stays behind under the guardianship of Damon, who takes Jeremy back to school. No one knows yet that Bonnie ([[Kat Graham]]) is dead, except for Jeremy, who sees her and talks to her and also answers everyone's mails and texts that are sent to her. Also no one knows that Silas ([[Paul Wesley]]) is not gone and Stefan is at the bottom of the lake.\n\nAt college, Elena and Caroline expect Bonnie to join them soon, but they are shocked when an unknown girl named Megan ([[Hayley Kiyoko]]) joins their dorm instead of their friend. Caroline does not like the idea of having a stranger staying with them at all and when she discovers that Megan drinks water with vervain, she gets even more nervous because she believes that Megan knows about them and what they are. Elena calms her down and tells her they have to act normal, so they go to the party they were invited to earlier.\n\nAt the college party, Megan is killed by a vampire, something that makes Elena and Caroline concerned about their secret and that it may bust open. When the police tells them that Megan committed suicide they worry even more since the police is covering the murder. Elena and Caroline find a picture of Megan where she is with Elena's father.\n\nBack at the Salvatore house, Katherine makes her unwelcoming appearance asking for Damon's help and protection since now that she is human she is vulnerable and she is scared. Damon offers to turn her back into a vampire to get rid of her but she declines his offer since she does not know if that would work after she drank the cure.\n\nSilas makes his appearance at the town square restaurant, where he meets Sheriff Forbes ([[Marguerite MacIntyre]]). He tells her that he is not Stefan but Silas. When he realizes she cannot help him, he compels her and leaves. Silas later meets Damon and Jeremy at the bar and Jeremy \"feels\" that he is not Stefan but rather Silas and tries to convince Damon of it.\n\nSilas goes to the Salvatore house where he finds Katherine and tries to kill her.
