He is the youngest of five children who is frequently tormented by his older brothers and sisters. After events transpire between him and his family, he wishes he had no family when his mother is punishing him for what he feels are unjustified reasons. She warns him to be careful what he wishes for and he ignores it. He wakes up the next day to discover he is the only one left in the house. He thinks his wish came true and that he is finally alone without his obnoxious family. In reality, he was left home by mistake. His family is en route to France for a holiday trip. While his parents realize their mistake and scramble to get back to the United States, Harry and Marv, a pair of thieves known as the \"Wet Bandits\", attempt to burgle the house and Kevin must foil them with a collection of homemade booby traps. They get arrested at the end of the film. The film became the [[List of 1990 box office number-one films in the United States|highest-grossing film of 1990]],<ref>{{Citation | title = Home Alone \u2013 Movie Review | accessdate = February 11, 2011 | url = http://www.movie-gazette.com/1081 }}</ref> grossing $476,684,675 worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title = Home Alone (1990) |url = https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=homealone.htm |work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate = May 29, 2010 }}</ref> Despite a lukewarm reception from critics, it was popular with audiences. It was also nominated for two [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[John Williams]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"Somewhere in My Memory\", but lost to [[Dances with Wolves]] and [[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]] respectively. Macaulay Culkin's performance garnered him a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award|Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]], but lost to [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] for his performance in ''[[Green Card (film)|Green Card]]''.\n\n===''Home Alone 2: Lost in New York'' (1992)===\n{{main|Home Alone 2: Lost in New York}}\nSet one year after the events of the first film, Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) loses track of his family at the airport to which he mistakenly gets on a plane headed for [[New York City]] while the rest of the McCallisters fly to [[Florida]]. Now alone in one of the largest cities in the world, Kevin cons his way into a room at the [[Plaza Hotel]] and begins his usual antics, but when he discovers that the burglars he previously encountered are on the loose again he stops them from robbing an elderly man's toy store before Christmas.\n\n===''Home Alone 3'' (1997)===\n{{main|Home Alone 3}}\n''Home Alone 3'' does not center on Kevin, but instead on Alex Pruitt, a young boy who is left home alone with [[chickenpox]], but soon recovers. At the same time, four burglars working for a [[North Korea]]n terrorist group are sent by their boss to retrieve a top-secret microchip that can act as a cloaking device for a missile. They succeed in retrieving it and hide it in a remote controlled car, but due to a luggage mix-up at the airport with the Pruitts' neighbor Mrs. Hess, the car lands in the hands of Alex who is given the car for shoveling the snow in her driveway. The burglars begin systematically searching every house on his street. Once they realize he has the chip, they prepare to invade his house. He devises elaborate traps and bamboozles the four crooks with the help of his pet rat, his brother's pet parrot and some intricate tripwires, all the while monitoring them with a video camera on the race car. The film was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for Worst Remake or Sequel, eventually losing the award to ''[[Speed 2: Cruise Control]]''.\n\n===''Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House'' (2002)===\n{{main|Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House}}\nThe fourth installment was directed by [[Rod Daniel]] and premiered as a [[television film]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on November 3, 2002.

Kevin's parents have separated, and he lives with his mother. He decides to go spend Christmas with his father and his rich girlfriend, Natalie, but finds himself having to deal with his old nemesis Marv, and his new sidekick wife, Vera (played by [[Missi Pyle]]), who replaces Harry since he and Marv put their partnership to an end.

The NES port uses sound effects from the early 1990s ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' games; ''[[Bart vs. the Space Mutants]]'' for example. The Super NES version, while boasting a soundtrack with the Super NES traditionally realistic sounding instrument synth, suffered due to slightly post-8-bit graphics and sound effects, as well as a disjointed feel of incontinuity between stages.

The plot centers around a weed-growing 'loser' who misses his plane for a holiday skiing trip. He decides to get high, and as the paranoia side-effects set in, he believes he hears a break-in. As he discovers thieves have broken into his home, fully stoned and fueled by the weed, he tries to 'defend his castle'.\n\nBy August 2018, Frizzell stated that the script was being tweaked in order to enhance the emotional Christmas-side of the story, with the goal being to have ''Stoned Alone'' feel as much like the original ''Home Alone'' films as possible, noting how important it was as a fan of the films and [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] it was to get the story right.

He is the youngest of five children who is frequently tormented by his older brothers and sisters. After events transpire between him and his family, he wishes he had no family when his mother is punishing him for what he feels are unjustified reasons. She warns him to be careful what he wishes for and he ignores it. He wakes up the next day to discover he is the only one left in the house. He thinks his wish came true and that he is finally alone without his obnoxious family. In reality, he was left home by mistake. His family is en route to France for a holiday trip. While his parents realize their mistake and scramble to get back to the United States, Harry and Marv, a pair of thieves known as the \"Wet Bandits\", attempt to burgle the house and Kevin must foil them with a collection of homemade booby traps.

Now alone in one of the largest cities in the world, Kevin cons his way into a room at the [[Plaza Hotel]] and begins his usual antics, but when he discovers that the burglars he previously encountered are on the loose again he stops them from robbing an elderly man's toy store before Christmas.\n\n===''Home Alone 3'' (1997)===\n{{main|Home Alone 3}}\n''Home Alone 3'' does not center on Kevin, but instead on Alex Pruitt, a young boy who is left home alone with [[chickenpox]], but soon recovers.

They succeed in retrieving it and hide it in a remote controlled car, but due to a luggage mix-up at the airport with the Pruitts' neighbor Mrs. Hess, the car lands in the hands of Alex who is given the car for shoveling the snow in her driveway. The burglars begin systematically searching every house on his street. Once they realize he has the chip, they prepare to invade his house. He devises elaborate traps and bamboozles the four crooks with the help of his pet rat, his brother's pet parrot and some intricate tripwires, all the while monitoring them with a video camera on the race car.

The purpose of the game is to escape the Wet Bandits while bringing all the McCallister's fortunes from the house down to the safe room in the basement. Once all items have been sent down the chute to the basement Kevin must make it past rats, bats, and ghosts he encounters in the basement, then fight the spider king so he can make it to the safe room to lock away all his families riches.\n\n; '''''Home Alone 2'' (1992)'''\n{{Main|Home Alone 2 (video game)}}\n''Home Alone 2'' was released on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], and [[Game Boy]] in 1992, and the [[Personal Computer|PC]], [[Sega Genesis]], and NES in 1993. Though it is based on the [[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York|film]] in terms of plot and additional dialogue, the game was different from the film. The NES port uses sound effects from the early 1990s ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' games; ''[[Bart vs. the Space Mutants]]'' for example. The Super NES version, while boasting a soundtrack with the Super NES traditionally realistic sounding instrument synth, suffered due to slightly post-8-bit graphics and sound effects, as well as a disjointed feel of incontinuity between stages.
