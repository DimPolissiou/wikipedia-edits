Because if I were purely symptomatic with Parkinson's symptoms, a lot of times speaking is difficult. There's a kind of a [[cluttering]] of speech and it's very difficult to sit still, to sit in one place. You know, the symptoms are different, so I'd rather kind of suffer the symptoms of dyskinesia ... this kind of weaving and this kind of continuous thing is much preferable, actually, than pure Parkinson's symptoms. So that's what I generally do ... I haven't had any, you know, problems with pure Parkinson's symptoms in any of these interviews, because I'll tend to just make sure that I have enough [[Sinemet]] in my system and, in some cases, too much. But to me, it's preferable. It's not representative of what I'm like in my everyday life. I get a lot of people with Parkinson's coming up to me saying, 'You take too much medication.'

Because if I were purely symptomatic with Parkinson's symptoms, a lot of times speaking is difficult. There's a kind of a [[cluttering]] of speech and it's very difficult to sit still, to sit in one place. You know, the symptoms are different, so I'd rather kind of suffer the symptoms of dyskinesia ... this kind of weaving and this kind of continuous thing is much preferable, actually, than pure Parkinson's symptoms. So that's what I generally do ... I haven't had any, you know, problems with pure Parkinson's symptoms in any of these interviews, because I'll tend to just make sure that I have enough [[Sinemet]] in my system and, in some cases, too much. But to me, it's preferable. It's not representative of what I'm like in my everyday life. I get a lot of people with Parkinson's coming up to me saying, 'You take too much medication.'

Tim is envious of the attention the day-old baby receives, not to mention suspicion when the infant acts odd around him, but his parents are oblivious.\n\nSoon, Tim learns that the baby can talk like an adult, and he introduces himself as \"The Boss\". Seeing an opportunity to get rid of him, Tim decides to record a conversation between the Boss Baby and other toddlers who are at Tim's house for a meeting. A chase ensues, and the [[Compact cassette|cassette tape]] is terminated by passing automobile after the Boss Baby threatens to tear up Tim's favorite stuffed animal, Lam-Lam. With no evidence to support him, Tim's parents ground him for three weeks.\n\nThe Boss Baby apologizes to Tim and has him suck on a pacifier that transports them to Baby Corp., a place where infants with adult-like minds work to preserve infant love everywhere. The Boss Baby explains that he was sent to see why puppies are being loved more than infants. He has infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co., which will unleash a new puppy on a pet convention in Las Vegas. The Boss Baby stays intelligent by drinking a \"Secret Baby Formula\" that enables a baby to act like an adult. However, should a baby not drink it after a period of time, he or she becomes a regular baby. When they overhear Boss Baby's boss threatening to fire him for not bringing in information, which would strip him of his formula and strand him at the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to prevent that.\n\nTim's parents \"un-ground\" him and take them to Puppy Co. for take your child to work day. While there, they slip away and find what they think is the plans for a \"Forever Puppy\", but they are captured by the company's founder and CEO, Francis E. Francis. They discover that Francis used to be the head of Baby Corp. and whom Boss Baby idolizes, but was ousted when it was discovered that his [[lactose intolerance]] kept the secret formula from working properly. Francis intends to have the Forever Puppies overshadow babies by stealing Boss Baby's serum bottle and infecting the puppies with it as revenge. Tim's parents go with Francis to Las Vegas, and Francis has his brother Eugene pose as Tim and Boss Baby's babysitter to keep them from interfering.\n\nWithout a steady flow of formula to maintain his intelligence, Boss Baby starts becoming a normal baby. Despite this, he and Tim evade the \"babysitter\" long enough to reach the airport but are too late to intercept Tim's parents. They sneak on to another plane bound for Las Vegas. There, they stall Francis' presentation when Eugene unwittingly gives away their plan. Furious at their interference, Francis locks Tim's parents up so he can burn them with exhaust from a rocket used to launch the Forever Puppies. Tim and Boss Baby defeat Eugene and move on to save their parents but are intercepted by Francis. Tim and Boss Baby push him off a ledge, making Francis tumble into the formula. Boss Baby opens the rocket to let the puppies out so they can save Tim's parents. His return to baby state is complete while on the rocket, and begins to cry, but Tim sings to him with [[Blackbird (Beatles song)|the family song]] to show his appreciation, causing him to jump off the rocket before it launches. After the rocket does launch, Tim takes Boss Baby to the formula vat and he returns to his original self. Francis then emerges from the vat, having been reverted to an obese baby and tries to attack Boss Baby, but is picked up by a redeemed Eugene and tells Tim and Boss Baby that \"This time we'll raise him right\".\n\nBoss Baby is promoted and leaves. Tim goes back to being an only child, but he and Boss Baby miss each other. After Tim writes a letter convincing him to live with him as his brother, Boss Baby returns to the Templeton family as a regular baby named Theodore Lindsey \"Ted\" Templeton. Back in the present, Tim finished with his brother Ted the story to his daughter, which she just had recently a baby sister, who acts like Ted did when he was Boss Baby.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Alec Baldwin (28246306070).jpg|thumb|right|Alec Baldwin at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* Miles Bakshi as Tim Templeton, Boss Baby's 7-year-old brother.<ref name=\"SFLikeGlenRoss\">{{cite web|last1=Amderton|first1=Ethan|title=DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u2018The Boss Baby\u2019 Is Like an Animated \u2018Glengarry Glen Ross\u2019 for Kids (Comic-Con 2016)|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/boss-baby-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=October 28, 2016|date=July 21, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" /><ref name=\"VarietyAnnecyBossBaby\">{{cite news|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|last2=Mayorga|first2=Emilio|title=Annecy: Tom McGrath Unveils Alec Baldwin-Starrer \u2018Boss Baby\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/annecy-tom-mcgrath-alec-baldwin-boss-baby-1201797075/|accessdate=June 18, 2016|work=Variety|date=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n** [[Tobey Maguire]] as Adult Tim, the narrator.<ref name=\"USATSneakPeek\">{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|title=Sneak peek: Alec Baldwin is 'The Boss Baby'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/10/16/alec-baldwin-boss-baby-sneak-peek-exclusive/92058380/|accessdate=October 17, 2016|work=USA Today|date=October 17, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Theodore Templeton / Boss Baby, a baby with the mind of an adult, who works at Baby Corp.<ref name=THRBaldwinSpacey />\n* [[Jimmy Kimmel]] as Ted Templeton, Janice's husband and Tim's father.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Janice Templeton, Ted's wife and Tim's mother.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Francis E.

One day, Tim is surprised when an infant wearing a business suit arrives at his house in a taxi, and Ted and Janice call him Tim's little brother. Tim is envious of the attention the day-old baby receives, not to mention suspicion when the infant acts odd around him, but his parents are oblivious.\n\nSoon, Tim learns that the baby can talk like an adult, and he introduces himself as \"The Boss\". Seeing an opportunity to get rid of him, Tim decides to record a conversation between the Boss Baby and other toddlers who are at Tim's house for a meeting. A chase ensues, and the [[Compact cassette|cassette tape]] is terminated by passing automobile after the Boss Baby threatens to tear up Tim's favorite stuffed animal, Lam-Lam. With no evidence to support him, Tim's parents ground him for three weeks.\n\nThe Boss Baby apologizes to Tim and has him suck on a pacifier that transports them to Baby Corp., a place where infants with adult-like minds work to preserve infant love everywhere. The Boss Baby explains that he was sent to see why puppies are being loved more than infants. He has infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co., which will unleash a new puppy on a pet convention in Las Vegas. The Boss Baby stays intelligent by drinking a \"Secret Baby Formula\" that enables a baby to act like an adult. However, should a baby not drink it after a period of time, he or she becomes a regular baby. When they overhear Boss Baby's boss threatening to fire him for not bringing in information, which would strip him of his formula and strand him at the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to prevent that.\n\nTim's parents \"un-ground\" him and take them to Puppy Co. for take your child to work day. While there, they slip away and find what they think is the plans for a \"Forever Puppy\", but they are captured by the company's founder and CEO, Francis E. Francis. They discover that Francis used to be the head of Baby Corp. and whom Boss Baby idolizes, but was ousted when it was discovered that his [[lactose intolerance]] kept the secret formula from working properly. Francis intends to have the Forever Puppies overshadow babies by stealing Boss Baby's serum bottle and infecting the puppies with it as revenge. Tim's parents go with Francis to Las Vegas, and Francis has his brother Eugene pose as Tim and Boss Baby's babysitter to keep them from interfering.\n\nWithout a steady flow of formula to maintain his intelligence, Boss Baby starts becoming a normal baby. Despite this, he and Tim evade the \"babysitter\" long enough to reach the airport but are too late to intercept Tim's parents. They sneak on to another plane bound for Las Vegas. There, they stall Francis' presentation when Eugene unwittingly gives away their plan. Furious at their interference, Francis locks Tim's parents up so he can burn them with exhaust from a rocket used to launch the Forever Puppies. Tim and Boss Baby defeat Eugene and move on to save their parents but are intercepted by Francis. Tim and Boss Baby push him off a ledge, making Francis tumble into the formula. Boss Baby opens the rocket to let the puppies out so they can save Tim's parents. His return to baby state is complete while on the rocket, and begins to cry, but Tim sings to him with [[Blackbird (Beatles song)|the family song]] to show his appreciation, causing him to jump off the rocket before it launches. After the rocket does launch, Tim takes Boss Baby to the formula vat and he returns to his original self. Francis then emerges from the vat, having been reverted to an obese baby and tries to attack Boss Baby, but is picked up by a redeemed Eugene and tells Tim and Boss Baby that \"This time we'll raise him right\".\n\nBoss Baby is promoted and leaves. Tim goes back to being an only child, but he and Boss Baby miss each other. After Tim writes a letter convincing him to live with him as his brother, Boss Baby returns to the Templeton family as a regular baby named Theodore Lindsey \"Ted\" Templeton. Back in the present, Tim finished with his brother Ted the story to his daughter, which she just had recently a baby sister, who acts like Ted did when he was Boss Baby.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Alec Baldwin (28246306070).jpg|thumb|right|Alec Baldwin at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n* Miles Bakshi as Tim Templeton, Boss Baby's 7-year-old brother.<ref name=\"SFLikeGlenRoss\">{{cite web|last1=Amderton|first1=Ethan|title=DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u2018The Boss Baby\u2019 Is Like an Animated \u2018Glengarry Glen Ross\u2019 for Kids (Comic-Con 2016)|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/boss-baby-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=October 28, 2016|date=July 21, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" /><ref name=\"VarietyAnnecyBossBaby\">{{cite news|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|last2=Mayorga|first2=Emilio|title=Annecy: Tom McGrath Unveils Alec Baldwin-Starrer \u2018Boss Baby\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/annecy-tom-mcgrath-alec-baldwin-boss-baby-1201797075/|accessdate=June 18, 2016|work=Variety|date=June 16, 2016}}</ref>\n** [[Tobey Maguire]] as Adult Tim, the narrator.<ref name=\"USATSneakPeek\">{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Bryan|title=Sneak peek: Alec Baldwin is 'The Boss Baby'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/10/16/alec-baldwin-boss-baby-sneak-peek-exclusive/92058380/|accessdate=October 17, 2016|work=USA Today|date=October 17, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Theodore Templeton / Boss Baby, a baby with the mind of an adult, who works at Baby Corp.<ref name=THRBaldwinSpacey />\n* [[Jimmy Kimmel]] as Ted Templeton, Janice's husband and Tim's father.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as Janice Templeton, Ted's wife and Tim's mother.<ref name=\"THRKimmelKudrowOswalt\" />\n* [[Steve Buscemi]] as Francis E.

Having been often present at DreamWorks, McGrath initially asked Bakshi only to provide a temporary voice for Tim to see if the character \"worked\".

During its term, the government must retain the confidence of the House of Commons, and certain important [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]], such as the passing of the government's budget, are considered as [[Motion of no confidence#Canada|confidence motions]].

Per democratic tradition, the House of Commons is the dominant branch of parliament; the Senate and Crown rarely oppose its will. The Senate, thus, reviews legislation from a less partisan standpoint.\n\nThe ''Constitution Act, 1867'', outlines that the governor general is responsible for summoning parliament in the Queen's name. A parliamentary session lasts until a prorogation, after which, without ceremony, both chambers of the legislature cease all legislative business until the governor general issues another royal proclamation calling for a new session to begin. A session begins with a \"[[Speech from the throne]]\" when the governor general or the monarch delivers the governing party's prepared speech of their intentions for the session. After a number of such sessions, each parliament comes to an end via dissolution. As a general election typically follows, the timing of a dissolution is usually politically motivated, with the prime minister selecting a moment most advantageous to his or her political party. The end of a parliament may also be necessary, however, if the majority of Members of Parliament revoke their confidence in the Prime Minister's ability to govern, such as when the [[Money bill|government's budget]] is voted down (a [[loss of supply]]) or through a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no-confidence]]. The ''[[Canada Elections Act]]'' mandates that members of Parliament must stand for election a minimum of every four-years, however, no parliament has been allowed to expire in such a fashion.\n\n===Judicial branch===\n{{Main|Court system of Canada}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Canada, Ottawa.jpg|right|thumb|Supreme Court Building in [[Ottawa]]]]\nThe sovereign is responsible for rendering justice for all her subjects, and is thus traditionally deemed the ''fount of justice''.<ref name=Cools>{{cite hansard| title=Debates of the Senate (Hansard), 2nd Session, 36th Parliament, Volume 138, Issue 29| url=https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/chamber/362/debates/029db_2000-02-17-e#0.2.W54BJ2.MERRJT.A7B6PH.2F| house=Senate| date=17 February 2000| column_start=1500| column_end=1510| accessdate=21 November 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904143557/http://www.parl.gc.ca/36/2/parlbus/chambus/senate/deb-e/029db_2000-02-17-e.htm?Language=E&Parl=36&Ses=2#0.2.W54BJ2.MERRJT.A7B6PH.2F| archivedate=4 September 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref> However, she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead the judicial functions of the royal prerogative are performed in trust and in the queen's name by officers of Her Majesty's courts.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Canada]]\u2014the country's [[court of last resort]]\u2014has nine justices appointed by the governor general on recommendation by the prime minister and led by the [[Chief Justice of Canada]], and hears appeals from decisions rendered by the various appellate courts (provincial, territorial and federal).\n\nThe [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] hears cases arising under certain areas of federal law.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Jurisdiction| last=Federal Court| authorlink=Federal Court (Canada)| title=About the Court > Jurisdiction| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=20 November 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929234011/http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Jurisdiction| archive-date=29 September 2011| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> It works in conjunction with the [[Tax Court of Canada]].<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| date=27 March 2002| title=Courts Administration Service Act| series=2.a| location=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2002-c-8/latest/sc-2002-c-8.html| accessdate=18 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Federalism==\n{{Main|Canadian federalism}}\nThe powers of the parliaments in Canada are limited by the constitution, which divides legislative abilities between the federal and provincial governments; in general, the [[Legislative Assembly|legislatures]] of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] may only pass laws relating to topics explicitly reserved for them by the constitution, such as education, provincial officers, municipal government, charitable institutions, and \"matters of a merely local or private nature\",<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=VI.92}}</ref> while any matter not under the exclusive authority of the provincial legislatures is within the scope of the federal parliament's power.

Per democratic tradition, the House of Commons is the dominant branch of parliament; the Senate and Crown rarely oppose its will. The Senate, thus, reviews legislation from a less partisan standpoint.\n\nThe ''Constitution Act, 1867'', outlines that the governor general is responsible for summoning parliament in the Queen's name. A parliamentary session lasts until a prorogation, after which, without ceremony, both chambers of the legislature cease all legislative business until the governor general issues another royal proclamation calling for a new session to begin. A session begins with a \"[[Speech from the throne]]\" when the governor general or the monarch delivers the governing party's prepared speech of their intentions for the session. After a number of such sessions, each parliament comes to an end via dissolution. As a general election typically follows, the timing of a dissolution is usually politically motivated, with the prime minister selecting a moment most advantageous to his or her political party. The end of a parliament may also be necessary, however, if the majority of Members of Parliament revoke their confidence in the Prime Minister's ability to govern, such as when the [[Money bill|government's budget]] is voted down (a [[loss of supply]]) or through a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no-confidence]]. The ''[[Canada Elections Act]]'' mandates that members of Parliament must stand for election a minimum of every four-years, however, no parliament has been allowed to expire in such a fashion.\n\n===Judicial branch===\n{{Main|Court system of Canada}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Canada, Ottawa.jpg|right|thumb|Supreme Court Building in [[Ottawa]]]]\nThe sovereign is responsible for rendering justice for all her subjects, and is thus traditionally deemed the ''fount of justice''.<ref name=Cools>{{cite hansard| title=Debates of the Senate (Hansard), 2nd Session, 36th Parliament, Volume 138, Issue 29| url=https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/chamber/362/debates/029db_2000-02-17-e#0.2.W54BJ2.MERRJT.A7B6PH.2F| house=Senate| date=17 February 2000| column_start=1500| column_end=1510| accessdate=21 November 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904143557/http://www.parl.gc.ca/36/2/parlbus/chambus/senate/deb-e/029db_2000-02-17-e.htm?Language=E&Parl=36&Ses=2#0.2.W54BJ2.MERRJT.A7B6PH.2F| archivedate=4 September 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref> However, she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead the judicial functions of the royal prerogative are performed in trust and in the queen's name by officers of Her Majesty's courts.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Canada]]\u2014the country's [[court of last resort]]\u2014has nine justices appointed by the governor general on recommendation by the prime minister and led by the [[Chief Justice of Canada]], and hears appeals from decisions rendered by the various appellate courts (provincial, territorial and federal).\n\nThe [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] hears cases arising under certain areas of federal law.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Jurisdiction| last=Federal Court| authorlink=Federal Court (Canada)| title=About the Court > Jurisdiction| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=20 November 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929234011/http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Jurisdiction| archive-date=29 September 2011| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> It works in conjunction with the [[Tax Court of Canada]].<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| date=27 March 2002| title=Courts Administration Service Act| series=2.a| location=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2002-c-8/latest/sc-2002-c-8.html| accessdate=18 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Federalism==\n{{Main|Canadian federalism}}\nThe powers of the parliaments in Canada are limited by the constitution, which divides legislative abilities between the federal and provincial governments; in general, the [[Legislative Assembly|legislatures]] of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] may only pass laws relating to topics explicitly reserved for them by the constitution, such as education, provincial officers, municipal government, charitable institutions, and \"matters of a merely local or private nature\",<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=VI.92}}</ref> while any matter not under the exclusive authority of the provincial legislatures is within the scope of the federal parliament's power. Thus, the parliament at Ottawa alone can pass laws relating to, amongst other things, the [[mail|postal service]], the [[census]], [[Canadian Forces|the military]], [[criminal law]], navigation and shipping, [[fishing]], [[currency]], [[bank]]ing, [[weights and measures]], [[bankruptcy]], [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, [[Aboriginal people in Canada|First Nations]], and [[naturalization]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=VI.91}}</ref> In some cases, however, the jurisdictions of the federal and provincial parliaments may be more vague. For instance, the federal parliament regulates [[marriage]] and [[divorce]] in general, but the solemnization of marriage is regulated only by the provincial legislatures. Other examples include the powers of both the federal and provincial parliaments to impose taxes, borrow money, punish crimes, and regulate [[agriculture]].\n\n== Political culture ==\n{{Main|Politics of Canada}}\n\n[[File:Canadiancharterofrightsandfreedoms.jpg|thumb|upright =1.5|A copy of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'']]\n\nAn emphasis on [[liberalism]]<ref name=\"WesthuesWharf2014\">{{cite book|author1=Anne Westhues|author2=Brian Wharf|title=Canadian Social Policy: Issues and Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chTaAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|year=2014|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.
