After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

Seed to withdraw from the Central League and return the focus of the club to local football.  \n\nThere was talk in the air and media around this time of a merger between Woodleigh Cosmos and Moturoa, with the clubs already co-operating in the prior two seasons with composite ladies and youth teams.

Moturoa City had the best defence in the entire three divisions of the Central League in 1989 with only 16 goals conceded in 22 matches while scoring 42.\n\nIn 1990 executive distractions off the pitch, travelling pressures, including an away match in the South Island, along with significant changes in the squad and the failure of the two clubs to agree on the conditions of a proposed amalgamation saw the team relegated back to the second division.\n\nMoturoa independently retained the position in Division Two of the Central League from 1991.  \n\nIn 1992 the creation of the Central Premier League restructured the divisions.

Seed to withdraw from the Central League and return the focus of the club to local football.  \n\nThere was talk in the air and media around this time of a merger between Woodleigh Cosmos and Moturoa, with the clubs already co-operating in the prior two seasons with composite ladies and youth teams. Both clubs remained independent with the reports amounting to nothing.  \n\nAfter this season the club did not play in the Central League again until 2000 when it once again competed for the Central Federation Premier League, having its final season to date at this level in 2003.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Taranaki Premier League Squad 2019==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|pos=GK|nat=New Zealand         |name=Zane Coleman|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= |pos=  |nat=|name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3|pos=  |nat=New Zealand         |name= Ethan Webber|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|pos=  |nat=New Zealand         |name= Corbin Richardson|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Liam Scott|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Nathan Morath|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Jaden Taylor|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Troy Jury|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Hayden Murray|other=Captain}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|pos=     |nat=New Zealand|name= |other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=11 |pos=     |nat=New Zealand|name= Tyler Paterson|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|pos=  |nat=New Zealand        |name= Ash Reader-Nokes|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Scott Manson|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Jacob Crawford|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Zayed Rabbaney|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Sam Sutton|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Sam Westlake|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Nicholas Parthemore|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|pos=|nat=New Zealand|name= Dean Wilson|other=Squad Player}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|pos=|nat=New Zealand|name= Kayi Erol-Watt|other=Squad Player}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|pos=|nat=New Zealand|name= Kobi Hislop|other=Squad Player}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Moturoa AFC players|Moturoa AFC players]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Association football clubs in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Sport in New Plymouth]]\n", "name_user": "BG Onuku", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moturoa_AFC"}
