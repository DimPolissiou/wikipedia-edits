She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nWith regard to global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in New York City. The effort resulted in the announcement (on 5 October 2005) that the group had successfully determined the virus's [[genetic sequence]], using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist [[Johan Hultin]] from an Inuit female flu victim buried in the Alaskan [[permafrost]] and samples preserved from American soldiers<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/r051005.htm |publisher=Center for Disease Control |title=Researchers reconstruct 1918 pandemic influenza virus; effort designed to advance preparedness |access-date=2 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019045108/http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/r051005.htm |archive-date=19 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Roscoe Vaughan and James Downs.<ref>{{cite web |title=CLOSING IN ON A KILLER: SCIENTISTS UNLOCK CLUES TO THE SPANISH INFLUENZA VIRUS |url=https://www.medicalmuseum.mil/index.cfm?p=exhibits.virtual.1918killerflu.page_01 |website=National Museum of Health and Medicine |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Kolata |first1=Gina |title=Scientists Uncover Clues To Flu Epidemic of 1918 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/16/us/scientists-uncover-clues-to-flu-epidemic-of-1918.html |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=16 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nOn 18&nbsp;January 2007, Kobasa et al.

She based this on the reported symptoms in those dying from the flu, as reported in the [[post mortem]] reports still available, and also the timing of the big \"death spike\" in October 1918. This occurred shortly after the [[Surgeon General of the United States Army|Surgeon General of the U.S. Army]] and the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' both recommended very large doses of 8 to 31&nbsp;grams of [[aspirin]] per day as part of treatment. These levels will produce [[hyperventilation]] in 33% of patients, as well as [[lung edema]] in 3% of patients.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\nStarko also notes that many early deaths showed \"wet\", sometimes hemorrhagic lungs, whereas late deaths showed bacterial pneumonia. She suggests that the wave of aspirin poisonings was due to a \"[[perfect storm]]\" of events: [[Bayer]]'s patent on aspirin expired, so many companies rushed in to make a profit and greatly increased the supply; this coincided with the Spanish flu; and the symptoms of aspirin poisoning were not known at the time.{{sfn|Starko|2009}}\n\n[[File:165-WW-269B-11-trolley-l.jpg|thumb|upright|A street car conductor in [[Seattle]] in 1918 refusing to allow passengers aboard who are not wearing masks]]\nAs an explanation for the universally high mortality rate, this hypothesis was questioned in a letter to the journal published in April 2010 by Andrew Noymer and Daisy Carreon of the [[University of California, Irvine]], and Niall Johnson of the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. They questioned the universal applicability of the aspirin theory, given the high mortality rate in countries such as India, where there was little or no access to aspirin at the time, compared to the death rate in places where aspirin was plentiful.{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}}\n\nThey concluded that \"the [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] [aspirin] poisoning hypothesis [was] difficult to sustain as the primary explanation for the unusual virulence of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic\".{{sfn|Noymer|Carreon|Johnson|2010}} In response, Starko said there was [[anecdotal evidence]] of aspirin use in India and argued that even if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.{{sfn|Starko|2010}}\n\n=== End of the pandemic ===\nAfter the lethal second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly&nbsp;\u2013 almost to nothing after the peak in the second wave.{{sfn|Barry| 2004 }} In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597&nbsp;people died in the week ending 16&nbsp;October, but by 11&nbsp;November, influenza had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline in the lethality of the disease is that doctors became more effective in prevention and treatment of the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus. However, John Barry stated in his 2004 book ''[[The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague In History]]'' that researchers have found no evidence to support this position.{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} Some fatal cases did continue into March 1919, killing one player in the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]].\n\nAnother theory holds that the 1918 virus mutated extremely rapidly to a less lethal strain. This is a common occurrence with influenza viruses: there is a tendency for pathogenic viruses to become less lethal with time, as the hosts of more dangerous strains tend to die out{{sfn|Barry|2004b}} (see also [[Spanish flu#Deadly second wave|\"Deadly Second Wave\"]], above).\n\n=== Long-term effects ===\nA 2006 study in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' found that \"cohorts ''in utero'' during the pandemic displayed reduced educational attainment, increased rates of physical disability, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, and higher [[transfer payments]] received compared with other birth cohorts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Almond |first=Douglas |date=1 August 2006 |title=Is the 1918 Influenza Pandemic Over?

The rapid pace of the pandemic, which, for example, killed most of its victims in the United States within less than nine months, resulted in limited media coverage. The general population was familiar with patterns of pandemic disease in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: typhoid, [[yellow fever]], [[diphtheria]] and cholera all occurred near the same time. These outbreaks probably lessened the significance of the influenza pandemic for the public.{{sfn|Morrisey|1986|p=}} In some areas, the flu was not reported on, the only mention being that of advertisements for medicines claiming to cure it.{{sfn|Benedict|Braithwaite|2000|p=38}}\n\nAdditionally, the outbreak coincided with the deaths and media focus on the First World War.{{sfn|Crosby| 2003| pp=320\u2013322}} Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both the war and the epidemic, were among young adults.  The number of war-related deaths of young adults may have overshadowed the deaths caused by flu.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}}\n\nWhen people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was high, the flu may not have had a tremendous psychological impact or may have seemed an extension of the war's tragedies.{{sfn|Simonsen|Clarke|Schonberger|Arden|1998}} The duration of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a particular area for a month before leaving{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. The war, however,  had initially been expected to end quickly but lasted for four years by the time the pandemic struck.\n \n[[File:1918 Influenza epidemic burial site.jpg|thumb|1918 influenza epidemic burial site in [[Auckland]], New Zealand]]\nWith regard to global economic effects, many businesses in the entertainment and service industries suffered losses in revenue, while the healthcare industry reported profit gains.{{sfn|Garret|2007|p=}}\nHistorian Nancy Bristow has argued that the pandemic, when combined with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

The nickname for the flu, the \"Naples Soldier\", was adopted from Federico Romero and [[Guillermo Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw]]'s 1916 operetta, ''The Song of Forgetting'' (''La canci\u00f3n del olvido''). The protagonist of the operetta was a stock Don Juan type. [[Federico Romero]], one of the librettists, quipped that the play's most popular musical number, ''Naples Soldier'', was as catchy as the flu. Davis argued the Spanish flu\u2013Don Juan connection allowed Spaniards to make sense of their epidemic experience by interpreting it through their familiar Don Juan story.{{sfn|Davis| 2013| pp=103\u2013136}}\n\n== Research ==\n{{Main|Spanish flu research}}\n\n[[File:Reconstructed Spanish Flu Virus.jpg|thumb|An electron micrograph showing recreated 1918 influenza virions]]\n[[File:Influenza virus research.jpg|thumb|upright|At the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], Terrence Tumpey examines a reconstructed version of the 1918 flu.]]\n\nThe origin of the Spanish flu pandemic, and the relationship between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial.

The last common ancestor of human strains dates to between February 1917 and April 1918. Because pigs are more readily infected with avian influenza viruses than are humans, they were suggested as the original recipients of the virus, passing the virus to humans sometime between 1913 and 1918.\n\nAn effort to recreate the 1918 flu strain (a subtype of avian strain H1N1) was a collaboration among the [[Armed Forces Institute of Pathology]], the [[USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service|ARS]] Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory, and [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] in New York City. The effort resulted in the announcement (on 5 October 2005) that the group had successfully determined the virus's [[genetic sequence]], using historic tissue samples recovered by pathologist [[Johan Hultin]] from an Inuit female flu victim buried in the Alaskan [[permafrost]] and samples preserved from American soldiers<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/r051005.htm |publisher=Center for Disease Control |title=Researchers reconstruct 1918 pandemic influenza virus; effort designed to advance preparedness |access-date=2 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019045108/http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/r051005.htm |archive-date=19 October 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Roscoe Vaughan and James Downs.<ref>{{cite web |title=CLOSING IN ON A KILLER: SCIENTISTS UNLOCK CLUES TO THE SPANISH INFLUENZA VIRUS |url=https://www.medicalmuseum.mil/index.cfm?p=exhibits.virtual.1918killerflu.page_01 |website=National Museum of Health and Medicine |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Kolata |first1=Gina |title=Scientists Uncover Clues To Flu Epidemic of 1918 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/16/us/scientists-uncover-clues-to-flu-epidemic-of-1918.html |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=16 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nOn 18&nbsp;January 2007, Kobasa et al.
