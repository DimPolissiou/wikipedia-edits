Avant signed Withers to a record deal and assigned former Stax Records stalwart [[Booker T.

''[[Just as I Am (Bill Withers album)|Just as I Am]]'' was released in 1971 with the tracks, \"[[Ain't No Sunshine]]\" and \"[[Grandma's Hands]]\" as singles.

His first album release with the label, ''[[Making Music (Bill Withers album)|Making Music]]'', included the single \"She's Lonely\", which was featured in the film ''[[Looking for Mr. Goodbar (film)|Looking for Mr. Goodbar]]'' along with \"She Wants to (Get on Down)\".

Withers stated in interviews that a lot of the songs approved for the album, in particular, two of the first three singles released, were the same songs which were rejected in 1982, hence contributing significantly to the eight-year hiatus between albums.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/> Withers also stated it was frustrating seeing his record label release an album for [[Mr. T]], an actor, when they were preventing him, an actual singer, from releasing his own. He toured with [[Jennifer Holliday]] in 1985 to promote what would be his final studio album.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/>\n\nHis disdain for Columbia's A&R executives or \"blaxperts\", as he termed them, trying to exert control over how he should sound if he wanted to sell more albums, played a part in his decision to not record or re-sign to a record label after 1985, effectively ending his performing career, even though remixes of his previously recorded music were released well after his 'retirement'.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\">{{cite magazine|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/bill-withers-the-soul-man-who-walked-away-20150414 |title=Bill Withers: The Soul Man Who Walked Away |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph1\">{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/7928784/Bill-Withers-interview.html |title=Bill Withers interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/still_bill_the_story_of_bill_withers/ |title=Still Bill: The Story of Bill Withers |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7236327 |title=Songwriter Bill Withers And A Career Cut Short |publisher=NPR |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/08/as-is-2 |title=As Is |magazine=The New Yorker |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Finding musical success later in life than most, at 32, he has said he was socialized as a 'regular guy' who had a life before the music, so he did not feel an inherent need to keep recording once he fell out of love with the industry.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/> He has also stated that he does not miss touring and performing live and does not regret leaving music behind.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/><ref name=\"telegraph1\"/> He seemingly no longer suffers from the [[speech impediment]] of [[stuttering]] that affected him during his recording career.<ref name=\"telegraph1\"/>\n\n===Post-Columbia career===\nIn 1988, a new version of \"Lovely Day\" from the 1977 ''Menagerie'' album, entitled \"Lovely Day (Sunshine Mix)\" and [[remix]]ed by [[Ben Liebrand]], reached the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in the United Kingdom, leading to Withers'  performance on the long-running ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' that year. The original release had reached #7 in the UK in early 1978, and the re-release climbed higher to #4.\n\nIn 1987, he received his ninth Grammy Award nomination and on March 2, 1988, his third Grammy for Best Rhythm and Blues Song as songwriter for the re-recording of \"Lean on Me\" by [[Club Nouveau]] on their debut album ''Life, Love and Pain'', released in 1986 on [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\nIn 1996, a portion of his song \"Grandma's Hands\" was sampled in the song \"[[No Diggity]]\" by [[BLACKstreet]], featuring [[Dr. Dre]]. The single went to Number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and sold 1.6&nbsp;million copies and won a Grammy in 1998 for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nWithers contributed two songs to [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s 2004 release ''[[License to Chill]]''. Following the reissues of ''Still Bill'' on January 28, 2003, and ''Just As I Am'' on March 8, 2005, there was speculation of previously unreleased material being issued as a new album.<ref>Mitchell, Gail (October 14, 2005). \"[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61070/withers-in-no-hurry-to-make-new-album Withers In No Hurry To Make New Album]\".

Palmaccio and Tom Ruff.\n\nOn April 18, 2015, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by [[Stevie Wonder]]. Withers was stunned when he learned he had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \"I see it as an award of attrition,\" he says. \"What few songs I wrote during my brief career, there ain't a genre that somebody didn't record them in.

Withers stated in interviews that a lot of the songs approved for the album, in particular, two of the first three singles released, were the same songs which were rejected in 1982, hence contributing significantly to the eight-year hiatus between albums.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/> Withers also stated it was frustrating seeing his record label release an album for [[Mr. T]], an actor, when they were preventing him, an actual singer, from releasing his own. He toured with [[Jennifer Holliday]] in 1985 to promote what would be his final studio album.<ref name=\"sun-sentinel1985\"/>\n\nHis disdain for Columbia's A&R executives or \"blaxperts\", as he termed them, trying to exert control over how he should sound if he wanted to sell more albums, played a part in his decision to not record or re-sign to a record label after 1985, effectively ending his performing career, even though remixes of his previously recorded music were released well after his 'retirement'.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\">{{cite magazine|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/bill-withers-the-soul-man-who-walked-away-20150414 |title=Bill Withers: The Soul Man Who Walked Away |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=April 14, 2015 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph1\">{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/7928784/Bill-Withers-interview.html |title=Bill Withers interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/still_bill_the_story_of_bill_withers/ |title=Still Bill: The Story of Bill Withers |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7236327 |title=Songwriter Bill Withers And A Career Cut Short |publisher=NPR |date=February 7, 2007 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/03/08/as-is-2 |title=As Is |magazine=The New Yorker |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Finding musical success later in life than most, at 32, he has said he was socialized as a 'regular guy' who had a life before the music, so he did not feel an inherent need to keep recording once he fell out of love with the industry.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/> He has also stated that he does not miss touring and performing live and does not regret leaving music behind.<ref name=\"rollingstone1\"/><ref name=\"telegraph1\"/> He seemingly no longer suffers from the [[speech impediment]] of [[stuttering]] that affected him during his recording career.<ref name=\"telegraph1\"/>\n\n===Post-Columbia career===\nIn 1988, a new version of \"Lovely Day\" from the 1977 ''Menagerie'' album, entitled \"Lovely Day (Sunshine Mix)\" and [[remix]]ed by [[Ben Liebrand]], reached the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in the United Kingdom, leading to Withers'  performance on the long-running ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' that year. The original release had reached #7 in the UK in early 1978, and the re-release climbed higher to #4.\n\nIn 1987, he received his ninth Grammy Award nomination and on March 2, 1988, his third Grammy for Best Rhythm and Blues Song as songwriter for the re-recording of \"Lean on Me\" by [[Club Nouveau]] on their debut album ''Life, Love and Pain'', released in 1986 on [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\nIn 1996, a portion of his song \"Grandma's Hands\" was sampled in the song \"[[No Diggity]]\" by [[BLACKstreet]], featuring [[Dr. Dre]]. The single went to Number 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and sold 1.6&nbsp;million copies and won a Grammy in 1998 for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nWithers contributed two songs to [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s 2004 release ''[[License to Chill]]''. Following the reissues of ''Still Bill'' on January 28, 2003, and ''Just As I Am'' on March 8, 2005, there was speculation of previously unreleased material being issued as a new album.<ref>Mitchell, Gail (October 14, 2005). \"[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61070/withers-in-no-hurry-to-make-new-album Withers In No Hurry To Make New Album]\".

Palmaccio and Tom Ruff.\n\nOn April 18, 2015, he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] by [[Stevie Wonder]]. Withers was stunned when he learned he had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \"I see it as an award of attrition,\" he says. \"What few songs I wrote during my brief career, there ain't a genre that somebody didn't record them in.

Following the success of ''Ziggy Stardust'', sales of ''Hunky Dory'' improved and it eventually peaked at number three in the UK. [[RCA Records|RCA]] re-released the 1969'' David Bowie''  under the title Space Oddity (with an updated Ziggy Stardust-era photo) and ''The Man Who Sold the World'', which reached numbers 17 and 26 in the UK respectively (but the last one reached number 21 after the Bowie'death in 2016).\nBowie released nine more studio albums with RCA, all of which reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, of which ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' (1973), ''[[Pin Ups]]'' (1973), ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974) and ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'' (1980) reached the number one position. His 1975 RCA album \"[[Young Americans]]\" included his first #1 US single \"[[Fame]]\" <https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6700699/david-bowie-fame-no-1-hot-100-1975-rewinding-charts>which was co-written by [[John Lennon]], who also performed on the album, and Carlos Alomar. He then released three solo studio albums with [[EMI]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983), whose [[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|title track]] became his first single to reach number one in both the United Kingdom and the United States, ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' (1984) and ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'' (1987). ''Let's Dance'' and ''Tonight'' reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, while ''Never Let Me Down'' reached number six. The success of ''Let's Dance'' revitalized Bowie's back catalogue: throughout the summer of 1983, he had multiple albums on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. This peaked on 16 July that year, with ten entries \u2013 a figure bettered only by [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>*Roberts, David.

These dates must be incorrect because Bowie played The Tower Theater for six nights, from 8 July to 13 July. D\u00f6pke goes on to say: \"On later pressings, this error has been corrected (although the new dates given, 12-13/07/1974, are still not entirely correct).\" D\u00f6pke notes the corrected pressings begin from October 1974, which given the first pressing was released on 21 October 1974, the mistake must have been realised and corrected during the run up to release. The correct dates of the recording, according to D\u00f6pke, are 10-13/07/1974.<ref name=\"bowie-collection.de\">http://www.bowie-collection.de/</ref>\n* '''b'''{{Note|note_live_b}} There were some overdubs recorded in post-production (before mixing) for ''David Live''. Nic Pegg writes 'The backing vocals and some of the saxophone parts were re-recorded at Record Plant because, according to [Tony] Visconti [who supervised the post-production and mixed the album], \"the backing singers and horn players were often sporadically off microphone due to excitement, I guess.\" Similarly, Mike Garson re-recorded his piano solo for \"Aladdin Sane\" because \"the original was wiped. It was only 16-track so I guess that was the only way it could be done then\".' <ref name=\"Pegg, p. 373\"/>\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_live_c}} According to Nic Pegg, Tony Visconti, who was recording and mixing the album, thought 'many of the numbers too fast after the first night's recording in Philadelphia, and the band re-rehearsed on the afternoon of 29 April to re-establish the original studio tempi. So consistent were the band's performances thereafter, explained Victonti, \"that we were able to use the intro and outro of 'Station to Station' from Boston and the bulk from Rhode Island\".' It is thus unlikely any of the recordings from the 28th April were used on the final album.<ref>Pegg, p. 393</ref>\n* '''d'''{{Note|note_live_d}} An early mix of the sound was created by Ken Scott in 1973, and it was this that was used for the [[Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (film)|film]] soundtrack in early broadcasts and screenings. In 1981, Bowie and producer Tony Visconti prepared a new mix for both the release of the film and the release of an accompanying album. Nic Pegg writes: 'Visconti, who described the process as \"more of a salvage job than an artistic endeavour\", explained that \"the sound quality was poor and I was called in to beef it up, which also required David and me to resing many of the backing vocals. They were simply not recorded well on tape \u2013 partly because Trevor Bolder and Mick Ronson didn't sing into the microphones!\"'. In addition, two songs featured Jeff Beck on guitar: \"The Jean Genie / Love Me Do\" medley and \"Round and Round\". Beck redid his solos in December 1981 at CTS Studios, London. However, in the end Beck refused to allow the two songs to be included in the soundtrack (and, of course, in the film).<ref>Pegg, p. 404-5</ref>\n* '''e'''{{Note|note_live_e1}}{{Note|note_live_e2}} The songs on the ''Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby'' album came from a number of shows in the US and Japan: 20 November 1991 in Boston; 27 or 29 November 1991 in New York; 7 December 1991 in Chicago; 10 or 11 February 1992 in Sapporo; 17 February 1992 in Tokyo.\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_live_f}} The ''liveandwell.com'' album was a limited edition live release not available commercially but via subscribing to [[David Bowie#BowieNet|BowieNet]]. 'Although Bowie hoped for the album to have a full commercial release, his label Virgin was unenthusiastic and refused to issue it.' <ref>{{cite web|title=liveandWwll.com|url=https://www.bowiebible.com/albums/liveandwell-com/|website=Bowie Bible|accessdate=17 October 2019|language=en}}</ref> The album only features songs from the albums ''Earthling'' (1997) and ''1. Outside'' (1995). \n* '''g'''{{Note|note_live_g}} The ''Glass Spider'' live album is sourced from a professional recording for a CD promo set that was distributed among American radio stations in late 1987 / early 1988. CD Bootlegs of these recordings appeared in 1989 as ''Bon Soir Montreal''. See Re-releases (and pre-releases) below. The official release, however, was 2007.\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_live_h}} ''Live Santa Monica '72'' was available on bootleg for a number of years before seeing semi-official/legal release as ''[[Santa Monica '72]]'' on 25 April 1994 by MainMan (Bowie's former management company during the seventies) without Bowie's approval.

It is this edition which is included in the '''Five Years (1969\u20131973) box set Edition''' \u2013 see box sets section of discography.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" | '''''[[LiveAndWell.com|liveandwell.com]]''''' (1999)\n| 2000\n| CD\n| '''liveandwell.com [Reissue]'''<br />A second release of the CD in 2000 came with a bonus disc made up of four rare remixes, one being the song \"Fun\", which was itself not released commercially.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" | '''''[[Glass Spider]]''''' (2007)\n| 1989\n| CD\n| '''Bon Soir Montreal'''<br />The Glass Spider live album is sourced from a professional recording for a CD promo set that was distributed among American radio stations in late 1987 / early 1988.

According to author David Buckley, copies had been around for more than 20 years by the time of the semi-official/legal release ''Santa Monica '72'' in 1994.<ref>David Buckley (1999).

The 1995 European reissue was titled ''Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars \"Live\"''.<ref>Pegg, p. 343</ref> In the years to come various versions of this release appeared in different \u2013 and ever more complex \u2013 packaging, and with various extras. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''[[Live Nassau Coliseum '76]]''''' (2017)\n| Unknown\n| LP\n| '''Bootlegs \u2013 various titles'''<br /> The full gig was broadcast live on the King Biscuit Flower Hour show in the US, and was accordingly bootlegged a number of times.\n|-\n| 2010\n| LP\n| '''''[[Station to Station]]''''' '''Special and Deluxe Editions [Remaster]'''<br />Both the special and deluxe editions of  ''Station to Station'' included the entire 1976 Nassau Coliseum show \u2013 albeit with an edited version of \"Panic In Detroit\" \u2013 on two CDs newly remastered. The full version of \"Panic In Detroit\" (which had a long drum solo by Dennis Davis) was made available as a digital download. The 2010 remasters (again with the edited version of \"Panic In Detroit\") were included in the '''Who Can I Be Now? box set Edition''' released in 2016 prior to the album being given a standalone release in 2017.\n|-\n|}\n\n===TV & Radio===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Recording\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"8\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| UK<br/><ref name=\"guinness\" /><ref name=\"UK charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| AUS<br/><ref name=aus/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| NL<br/><ref name=\"dutch charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| NOR<br/><ref name=\"norwegian charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| NZ<br/><ref name=\"new zealand charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| SWE<br/><ref name=\"swedish charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| SWI<br/><ref name=\"swiss charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| US<br/><ref name=\"billboard200\"/><ref name=\"tm_billboard200\"/>\n|-\n\n! scope=\"row\"| '''''[[Bowie at the Beeb|BBC Radio Theatre]]'''''\n|\n* 27 June 2000\n* BBC Radio Theatre, London, UK\n|\n* Released: 2000\n* Label: EMI\n* Formats: LP, CD\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n\n! scope=\"row\"| '''''[[VH1 Storytellers (David Bowie album)|VH1 Storytellers]]'''''\n|\n* 23 August 1999\n* Manhattan Center, New York City, USA\n|\n* Released: 6 July 2009\n* Label: EMI\n* Formats: CD, CD+DVD, DD\n| 114<br/><ref>\"Official Album Chart\".

These were: \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\" / \"Karma Man\" (recorded 1 September 1967) and \"In The Heat Of The Morning\" / \"London Bye Ta-Ta\" [1968 version] (recorded 12 March 1968). Both had a more mainstream pop feel than his previous baroque pop period (1966\u20137). Bowie then formed the multimedia folk trio Turquoise and recorded another single: \"Ching-a-Ling\" (written by Bowie) / \"Back To Where You've Never Been\" (written by Tony Hill). However, Hill left the band just after the recording. The trio continued for a while as Feathers with John 'Hutch' Hutchinson replacing Hill and joining Bowie and the other original member Hermione Farthingale. Hitch even redubbed Hill's vocals in \"Ching-a-Ling\". However, Farthingale left in January 1969 and they had no record deal so the idea of the single was abandoned. Bowie and Hutch continued as a duo for a month or so, before Hutch moved away, and Bowie got a new record deal with Mercury on the basis of a Bowie and Hutch demo of \"Space Oddity\".<ref>Pegg, p. 156</ref><ref>Pegg, p. 132</ref><ref>Pegg, p. 62</ref>\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_60s_c1}}{{Note|note_60s_c2}} \"Space Oddity\" and \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" were released in different edits in different territories. \"Space Oddity\" UK edit was 4'33\"; while USA edit was 3'52\". \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" UK edit was 3'52\"; while USA edit was 3'20\".

first appeared on ''David Bowie'' [aka ''Space Oddity''] (1969) and was over 7 minutes long. For this single, the song was re-recorded in two different parts. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 1\" and \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 2\" were not released in the USA but did have 7\" promo for radio promotion (not for general release). The versions of both songs were edits of the full recordings released in UK and other territories. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 1\" [new version] was 4'02\" in UK, and 3'18\" for the American promo. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 2\" [new version] was 3'34\" in UK, and 2'22\" for the American promo.\n* '''b'''{{Note|note_70s_b1}} Bowie's \"Holy Holy\" single in the UK was not planned for release in the USA. Instead, the next American single would be \"All the Madmen\". For the release, the album track was seriously edited, most significantly having the middle section taken out. There is also some debate as to if the single was actually released. However, collector Jens D\u00f6pke writes the single went out but had \u2018poor sales, so that most existing records ended up in the cut-out bins\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|last=D\u00f6pke|first=Jens|website=David Bowie \u2013 Just Another Collection|url=http://www.bowie-collection.de/|title=1970\u20131974}}</ref> These singles 'have a drill hole through the label to show that it had been discounted after not selling for full price'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bowie-singles.com/USA/All_The_Madmen.html|title=David Bowie 7\" Singles|website=|access-date=}}</ref> \n* '''c'''{{Note|note_70s_c1}}{{Note|note_70s_c2}} After the Arnold Corns \"Moonage Daydream\" / \"Hang On to Yourself\" single in May 1971, another Arnold Corns single was recorded on 17 June 1971: \"Looking For a Friend\" / \"Man In The Middle\". \"Looking For a Friend\" was written by Bowie, and sung by band members and friends Mark Pritchard, Mick Ronson, and Mickey King along with Bowie. \"Man In The Middle\" was written and sung by Pritchard. The single was never released. However, in the wake of the success of Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust period, B&C records (with whom Bowie had a limited deal for the Arnold Corns before signing for RCA with the ''Hunky Dory'' album [1971]), released an unofficial cash-in single: \"Hang On to Yourself\" / \"Man in the Middle\" \u2013 the A Side taken from the B Side of the first official Arnold Corns single, along with the Pritchard track from the second recording session.\n* '''d'''{{Note|note_70s_d1}} The \"Changes\" B Side in USA and Canada was an edited version of \"Andy Warhol\", with the studio chatter at the beginning edited out. In France, the original edition of the single had another ''Hunky Dory'' track for the B Side, 'Song for Bob Dylan', but was soon replaced by \"Andy Warhol\" [chatterless version]. All other editions had the full album version of \"Andy Warhol\" on the B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 24</ref> \n* '''e'''{{Note|note_70s_e1}}{{Note|note_70s_e2}} \"Changes\" did not chart in 1972 in UK and Australia, but following Bowie's death in 2016 the song entered these charts peaking at No. 49 (UK) and No. 80 (Australia).\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_70s_f1}} \"Changes\" was actually released in the USA (and Canada) in December 1971. While the single peaked at No. 66 in 1972, it re-entered the chart in 1974, peaking at No. 41.\n* '''g'''{{Note|note_70s_g1}} The mix of \"Starman\" used for the single differs from the album version in that the 'morse code' sounds of the song are higher in the mix. USA and German versions of the song were edited. The USA edit removes some of the opening bars of the song, the German edit fades early.\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_70s_h1}}{{Note|note_70s_h2}} The Italian and Spanish versions of the \"Starman\" single were issued much later in the year, and have the A Side of the next official single \u2013 \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" \u2013 on the B Side. The Portuguese single is an EP with both \"Starman\" [A1] and \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" [B1] with \"Hang On To Yourself\" [''Ziggy Stardust'' version] [A2] (the B Side of the general release of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\") and \"Suffragette City\" [B2] (the B Side of the general release of \"Starman\").\n* '''i'''{{Note|note_70s_i1}} In late January 1972 \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" was re-recorded during the second ''Aladdin Sane'' album session for inclusion on that album. In the end, it was dropped. However, later pressings of the \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" single had this ''Aladdin Sane'' version (or Sax version, as it is known, due to the prominent use of saxophone). This was not a new release, nor re-release, and had the same B Side and catalogue number.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 142-3\">Pegg, p. 142-3</ref>\n* '''j'''{{Note|note_70s_j1}} \"The Jean Genie\" was released in UK on November 1972, but in the USA during October. The USA version of the single had \"Hang On to Yourself\" [''Ziggy Stardust'' version] on the B Side. Releases across the world occurred between November 1972 and February 1973, with different territories having one of these two B Sides. Except Japan (January 1973), which had \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" [original version] on the B Side.\n* '''k'''{{Note|note_70s_k1}}{{Note|note_70s_k2}} This release of \"Space Oddity\" in January 1973 was primarily focused at the US, where it gained Bowie his first hit. The single was not released in the UK. It was released in a few other territories (Canada, Spain, Australia, etc.) with the same B Side as the USA release. It was also released in Mexico and Puru \u2013 in Mexico with \"Starman\" (from ''Ziggy Stardust'') on the B Side; and in Puru in a slightly edited version (omitting part of the intro) with \"The Jean Genie\" (from ''Aladdin Sane'') on the B Side. In Japan, the single was released in March (just prior to Bowie's Japanese tour in April) with \"It Ain't Easy\" (from ''Ziggy Stardust'') on the B Side.\n* '''l'''{{Note|note_70s_l1}}{{Note|note_70s_l2}} \"Drive-In Saturday\" was released in April 1973, but not in the US and Canada, who instead had the release of the \"Time\" single (edited version). \"Drive-In Saturday\" in Germany was released in an edited version \u2013 the only territory to so. Both \"Drive-In Saturday\" and \"Time\" (USA edit) were released in France, \"Drive-In Saturday\" in April, \"Time\" in July.\n* '''m'''{{Note|note_70s_m1}} \"Round and Round\" was recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971.\n* '''n'''{{Note|note_70s_n1}} \"The Prettiest Star\" [''Aladdin Sane'' version] was the B Side for the \"Time\" single in most of the limited number of territories it was released in, except for Japan, where the B Side was another track from ''Aladdin Sane'', \"Panic in Detroit\".\n* '''o'''{{Note|note_70s_o1}} \"Life on Mars?\" was not released in the USA / North America.\n* '''p'''{{Note|note_70s_p1}} The B Side of \"Life on Mars?\" was in most territories it was released in \"The Man Who Sold the World\". In Spain the B Side was \"Drive-In Saturday\" (from ''Aladdin Sane''); in Portugal \"Black Country Rock\" (from ''The Man Who Sold the World''); and in Italy \"Amsterdam\", recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971. \n* '''q'''{{Note|note_70s_q1}} \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" was a release focused upon the US, and was not released in the UK (where \"Life on Mars?\" was released during the same month instead).\n* '''r'''{{Note|note_70s_r1}} The B Side to \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" in Italy was \"Watch That Man\" and in Japan \"Drive-In Saturday\", both from ''Aladdin Sane''.\n* '''s'''{{Note|note_70s_s1}} \"The Laughing Gnome\" had some different B Sides in some territories: \"Silly Boy Blue\" in Netherlands and West Germany; \"Rubber Band\" (album version) in Italy and Spain. These tracks are taken from the contemporaneous album ''David Bowie'' (1967).\n* '''t'''{{Note|note_70s_t1}} The B Side of \"Sorrow\" had \"Amsterdam\" on the B Side in all territories except Spain, where it was \"Lady Grinning Soul\" (from ''Aladdin Sane''); in South Africa, however, it was mis-titled \"Port of Amsterdam\". \"Amsterdam\" was recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971 (along with the B Side to \"Drive-In Saturday\", \"Round and Round\"), and had already appeared on the B Side to the \"Life on Mars?\" single in Italy earlier in the year.\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_70s_u1}}{{Note|note_70s_u2}} The original single mix of \"Rebel Rebel\" was released in February 1974 and is just a slightly early fade of the album version. It appeared in the UK, USA and most RCA territories. In April 1974 \u2013 in a move reminiscent of what happened with the rerecorded version of the \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" single in the UK \u2013 \"Rebel Rebel\" was heavily remixed and overdubbed in New York, and appeared on single again in the US and Canada the following month with a different B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 222</ref> The Brazilian version of the single uses the album version and has \"Diamond Dogs\" (from the album of the same name) on the B Side. In November \"Rebel Rebel\" was released again in Australia, this time as an EP: the A Side had \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Queen Bitch\" as per the single release; while the B Side was essentially the \"Sorrow\" single from the previous year, with \"Sorrow\" and \"Amsterdam\".\n* '''v'''{{Note|note_70s_v1}} \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" was only released in the UK and a few other territories, not in the USA.\n* '''w'''{{Note|note_70s_w1}} \"Diamond Dogs\" was issued in the UK and limited territories, it was not issued in the USA or Canada. The version in all these territories was the album mix, except in Australia where there was an exceptionally short edit of 2'58\" (as opposed to approx. 6').\n* '''x'''{{Note|note_70s_x1}} \"Holy Holy\" had originally been a single for Bowie back in 1971. In mid to late 1972, during the earliest days of recording songs for ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'' Bowie recorded this new version of the song for the album. It was never used. Very much like the B Sides to the singles \"Sorrow\" with (\"Amsterdam\") and \"Drive-In Saturday\" (with \"Round and Round\").\n* '''y'''{{Note|note_70s_y1}}{{Note|note_70s_y2}}{{Note|note_70s_y3}} The \"1984\" single had very limited release. In the US and New Zealand, the single had \"Queen Bitch\" on the B Side, in Japan only \"Lady Grinning Soul\".\n* '''z'''{{Note|note_70s_z1}}{{Note|note_70s_z2}}{{Note|note_70s_z3}} \"Panic in Detroit\" [Live] was originally a non-album track, as the original version of the album issued in 1974 did not feature the song. The album was issued again in 1990 with additional tracks, and a second time in 2005 with more additional tracks, one of which was \"Panic in Detroit\" [Live]. See Live Albums \u2013 Re-Issues on this page for more information.\n* '''aa'''{{Note|note_70s_aa1}}{{Note|note_70s_aa2}} \"Young Americans\" was only released in its full album version (5'10\")in the UK. In all other territories, it was released in a single edit (3'15\") which edited out some of the verses later in the song.\n* '''bb'''{{Note|note_70s_bb1}} The 1975 release of the \"Space Oddity\" single was focused on the UK (i.e., no USA etc. release). It was, however, also released in Netherlands later in the year, and in Yugoslavia but with only \"Velvet Goldmine\" on the B Side. \"Velvet Goldmine\" was a song originally recorded for ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'' but never made it to the final tracklist. It is one of the many tracks from the recording session in late 1971 which ended up as B Sides over the following years, along with the singles \"Sorrow\" with (\"Amsterdam\"), \"Drive-In Saturday\" (with \"Round and Round\") and \"Diamond Dogs\" with \"Holy Holy\" [rerecorded version].\n* '''cc'''{{Note|note_70s_cc1}} \"TVC 15\" [single edit] was also supposed to appear as the B Sides to a 'radical 3'40\" edit' of the \"Station to Station\" song (from the album of the same name) 'mooted [as a] single in France'. The single was never released, although a few copies were pressed.<ref>Pegg, p. 267</ref>\n* '''dd'''{{Note|note_70s_dd1}}{{Note|note_70s_dd2}} \"Stay\" came out as both an A Side and a B Side in the same month \u2013 July 1976. It came out as a B Side to the official retrospective single \"Suffragette City\" in the UK (and some other territories) where the ''ChangesOneBowie'' compilation was being promoted; and as an A Side in the USA (and some other territories) where the compilation album was not being prompted. In addition, \"Stay\" appears in two formats: the album version (6'16\") and single edit (3'23). The \"Suffragette City\" single had the album version on the B Side (except in Germany); while the \"Stay\" single used the edited version in all the territories where it was released.\n* '''ee'''{{Note|note_70s_ee1}} \"Suffragette City\" while an official retrospective single released 9 July 1976, it was aimed at promoting the contemporary ''[[ChangesOneBowie]]'' compilation released on 21 May 1976. Both compilation and single were focused upon the UK market. The album was also released in some other territories, such as West Germany, but not the USA. Similarly, the \"Suffragette City\" single was not released in the US, but did see release in West Germany, France, and Australia.\n* '''ff'''{{Note|note_70s_ff1}} USA Promo only.

The single version worldwide was an edited cut of the album version, but was released in both Germany and France in two formats: in the original English and in the respective languages. In Germany, the German language version appeared as a single titled \"'Helden'\"; while in France the French language version was still titled \"'Heroes'\" but had 'Chant\u00e9 en Fran\u00e7ais' on the cover (the English language single had 'Version Anglaise' on the cover). The \"'Heroes'\" album was also released in Germany and France with the song \"'Heroes'\" (full length version) in different language versions. These versions have half the song sang in English, and half in the respective languages. These versions of the song are known as: \"'Heroes'\" / \"'Helden'\" [Long English/German version] and \"'Heroes'\" / \"'H\u00e9ros'\" [Long English/French version].\n* '''hh'''{{Note|note_70s_hh1}} Spain only 12\" and David Bowie's first commercially available 12\". There had been a USA promo 12\" for the \"Sound and Vision\" single \u2013 although this was just \"Sound and Vision\" segueing into Iggy Pop's \"Sister Midnight\" song. And there was also a USA promo 12\" for \"'Heroes'\", with the full album version on the A Side and the single edit on the B Side. The 12\" single commercially released for \"'Heroes'\", however, was only released in Spain.\n* '''ii'''{{Note|note_70s_ii1}} Spain only 12\". \"Beauty and the Beast\" was David Bowie's second commercially available 12\" \u2013 both of which were Spanish releases (the first being the previous single \"'Heroes'\"). However, this 12\" was also released in the US as a promo: labelled as the 'Disco Version'.\n* '''jj'''{{Note|note_70s_jj1}}{{Note|note_70s_jj2}} This release of \"Breaking Glass\" is an Australian only single \u2013 the first time Bowie had released a single in Australia and nowhere else. The song is an extended version of \"Breaking Glass\" from the ''Low'' album. The B Side \u2013 \"Art Decade\" \u2013 also comes from ''Low''. Interestingly, the labels on the actual record say that both songs come from the live album ''Stage''. They do not.<ref>http://www.bowie-singles.com/OZNZ/Breaking_Glass.html</ref> It is, however, worth noting that a few months earlier in late 1978 Bowie had released a 7\" single in the UK and some other European territories with \"Breaking Glass\" [live] from ''Stage'' on the A Side and \"Art Decade\" [Live] as well as \"Ziggy Stardust\" [Live] both also from ''Stage'' on the B Side.\n* '''kk'''{{Note|note_70s_kk1}} Netherlands only 12\" of \"Boys Keep Swinging\".

July 1978 right at the end of the 1978 [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] (aka Low / Heroes Tour). The song had featured prominently and a live version from that tour would appear on the live album ''[[Stage (David Bowie album)|Stage]]''. The studio version was thus recorded prior to the recording of the ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' album which began in September 1978.<ref>Pegg, p. 17</ref> \n* '''b'''{{Note|note_80s_b}} This version \u2013 the third \u2013 of \"Space Oddity\" was recorded for a special of ''[[The Kenny Everett Video Show]]'' titled Will ''Kenny Everett Make It To 1980?'' broadcast on New Year's Eve 1979. It is a slight remix which 'notably extends the deafening silence after the line \"may God's love be with you\" by a full three-and-a-half seconds'.<ref>Pegg, p. 259</ref> The first version of \"Space Oddity\" was recorded for the video film ''[[Love You till Tuesday (film)|Love You till Tuesday]]'' in early 1969. It is the second version of the song that has been released as a single many times, beginning late 1969 and providing Bowie with his first UK hit. This version appears on ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969), aka ''Man of Words / Man of Music'' [USA 1969\u20131972] and ''Space Oddity'' [worldwide 1972\u20132009].\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_80s_c}} \"Crystal Japan\" was a Japanese only single, Bowie's second, following \"Revolutionary Song\" of the previous year. The song was originally to be the closing track of ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' and was titled \"Fujimoto San\". It was, however, dropped and replaced during the recording process. The song was instead used in 1980 on a Japanese television commercial for a sake brand called Crystal Jun Rock. Bowie also appeared in the commercial. \n* '''d'''{{Note|note_80s_d1}}{{Note|note_80s_d2}} The \"Ashes to Ashes\" 12\" appeared only in the US and Germany. In the USA it appeared under the title ''The Continuing Story of Major Tom''. On the A Side Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" song from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969), which was a hit in the US in early 1973, segues into the single edit of \"Ashes to Ashes\". The German 12\" has the 'Disco mix' on the A Side, which is just the full length version of the song as on the album ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]''.<ref name=\"David Bowie 12 Singles\"/> \n* '''e'''{{Note|note_80s_e}} Did not enter the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 but peaked at No. 101 on the [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn\" />\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_80s_f}} The \"Fashion\" 12\" was issued in UK, Germany and the USA only.\n* '''g'''{{Note|note_80s_g}} \"It's No Game (Part 1)\" was a Japanese only single, replacing the release of \"Fashion\" in rest of world (which appears on the B Side). This made a lot of sense as the song features Japanese vocals from Hisahi Miura. The song appears here as it does in the US as \"It's No Game (Part 1)\", although in the UK on the ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' album it is called \"It's No Game (No. 1)\".\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_80s_h}} The \"Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)\" 12\" was issued only in Germany.\n* '''i'''{{Note|note_80s_i}} The \"Up the Hill Backwards\" 12\" was issued only in the US, which did not see the release of a 7\". This is because both 7\" and 12\" versions of this rather limited release had the same edit of the song, taken from the ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' album.\n* '''j'''{{Note|note_80s_j}} The \"Under Pressure\" 12\" was issued only in Netherlands, which also saw the release of a 7\". Both 7\" and 12\" versions of this rather unusually used exactly the same cuts of the tracks.\n* '''k'''{{Note|note_80s_k}} \"Wild Is the Wind\" is the album cut in all single versions. The song runs at 5'58\" on all these records, however, a special edit was created running at 3'34\" for the music video.<ref>Pegg, p. 315</ref>\n* '''l'''{{Note|note_80s_l}} The \"Wild Is the Wind\" 12\" was issued only in the UK and Germany (both of which also saw the release of a 7\"). Again, as with the previous \"Up the Hill Backwards\" and \"Under Pressure\" singles, both 7\" and 12\" versions used exactly the same cuts of the tracks.\n* '''m'''{{Note|note_80s_m}} \"Wild Is the Wind\" while an official retrospective single released 13 November 1981, it was aimed at promoting the contemporary ''[[ChangesTwoBowie]]'' compilation released the same month. The album and single were focused upon UK and Europe. No single went out in the USA.\n* '''n'''{{Note|note_80s_n}} Aka ''David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal''. These songs were originally recorded by Bowie in August 1981 for a BBC television version of ''[[Baal (play)|Baal]]''. In September 1981, Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]] went to the Hansa studios in Berlin to re-record the five songs for this single release. The single came out in February 1982 just prior to the TV film broadcast on 2 March 1982. \n* '''o'''{{Note|note_80s_o}} While the ''Baal'' release featured five tracks, the ''de facto'' lead song was \"The Drowned Girl\" for which a music video was made, directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]]. \n* '''p'''{{Note|note_80s_p}} ''Baal'' was only issued as a 7\" EP in the UK, everywhere else it came out as a 12\". \n* '''q'''{{Note|note_80s_q1}}{{Note|note_80s_q2}}{{Note|note_80s_q3}}{{Note|note_80s_q4}} This original recording of the song \"\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" appeared commercially in three versions. The album version ran at 6'08\" and it was this that appeared on the standard 12\" releases (as well as the Portugal 7\"). The standard 7\" single version of the track was an edit running at 4'08\". In Australia, a special extended remix was released running at 9'20 with 'added saxophone and synthesiser'. In addition, there were various promo edits and a USA DJ edit of the album version, varying between 3'08\" and 5'32\".<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 57\">Pegg, p. 57</ref>\n* '''r'''{{Note|note_80s_r}} The \"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\" single was lifted from a Bowie guest spot on ''[[Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas]]'' from 1977. And while an official retrospective release by his record company at the time (RCA), Bowie was not happy about the release and it was essentially unsanctioned: 'a piece of opportunism which did little to improve Bowie's relationship with his soon-to-be-former label'.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 57\"/>\n* '''s'''{{Note|note_80s_s1}}{{Note|note_80s_s2}} The Brazilian single edit of \"Let's Dance\" was not standard single edit, but the album version with an early fade. There was also a USA DJ version of the song, named the 'extended edit', so longer than the standard single edit, but shorter than the full album version.\n* '''t'''{{Note|note_80s_t1}}{{Note|note_80s_t2}}{{Note|note_80s_t3}} The live version of \"Modern Love\" that appeared as the B Side to all \"Modern Love\" singles was a live version of the song recorded on the second night at the Forum de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada (13 July 1983). The entire concert was recorded and, with the exception of \"Breaking Glass\", \"Golden Years\", \"TVC-15\" and \"Stay\", broadcast on American FM radio in the series 'Supergroups in Concert'. At the time \"Modern Love\" [live] was a non-album track (it has however later appeared on both the ''[[Serious Moonlight (1983 film)|Serious Moonlight]]'' live DVD reissue [2006] as an audio only extra and been included on the album of the same name [2018] as its final track \u2013 although the film was recorded at the Pacific Coliseum, Vancouver, Canada on 12 September 1983).\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_80s_u1}} \"This Is Not America\" was issued in both 7\" and 12\" in UK and some other territories, but both releases had the same versions of the same songs on both the A Side and B Side. In some territories only the 7\" was issued \u2013 such as the USA. There was also, however, an extended mix issued in America on a various artists 12\" via DJ subscription only label Disconet.<ref>Pegg, p. 280</ref>\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_80s_u1}} \"Absolute Beginners\" also exists in a shorter edited version (4'46\") that that of the single (5'40'), issued on the A Side of an American promo 12\", with the full version on the B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 14</ref>\n* '''w'''{{Note|note_80s_w1}} \"Magic Dance\" was only released in a very limited number of territories, most prominently the USA. Furthermore, while a single edit was prepared from both the album track and the dance mix, these were never used and the release only came out on 12\".\n* '''x'''{{Note|note_80s_x1}} With \"Day-In Day-Out\" Bowie begins issuing multiple remixes: '[a]lthough several previous singles had spawned 12\" versions, \"Day-In Day-Out\" marked Bowie's first major incursion into the brave new world of multi-format releases and endless remixes\".<ref>Pegg, p. 71</ref> The major UK and worldwide releases were 12\" 1 led by the 'extended dance mix' and 12\" 2 led by the remix [aka Groucho mix]. In USA 12\" 2 was replaced by a slightly different version which included the single edit and replaced the 'extended dub mix' with the 'extended dance mix'. There was also a US promo which had '7\" Dance Edit' [A1]; 'Extended Dub Mix' [B1]; and Edited Dance Mix [B2]. There were also some other local variations of 12\"s, including Germany and Brazil. Bowie also re-recorded the vocals in Spanish the song becoming known as ''Al Alba' and 'Dia Tras Dia'', although it was only played on the radio in Spain once and was not originally released as a single.<ref>Pegg, p. 72</ref>\n* '''y'''{{Note|note_80s_y1}} \"Under the God\" 10\" UK only.\n* '''z'''{{Note|note_80s_z1}} ''Maggie's Farm [live]/Tin Machine'' double A side single was only released in UK and Japan. Despite the song \"Tin Machine\" appearing on the label as 'A' for 7\" and 12\", and '1' for the CD, as well as the back sleeves track listings putting \"Tin Machine\" at the top, the front cover of the single listed \"Maggie's Farm [live]\" before \"Tin Machine\", and the single was promoted with a video of \"Maggie's Farm [live]\".\n* '''aa'''{{Note|note_80s_aa1}} The Japanese CD version of ''Maggie's Farm [live]/Tin Machine'' had a fifth extra track - \"The Interview\" [an interview with the band].

In the end, it was dropped. However, later pressings of the \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" single had this ''Aladdin Sane'' version (or Sax version, as it is known, due to the prominent use of saxophone). This was not a new release, nor re-release, and had the same B Side and catalogue number.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 142-3\"/>\n* '''b''' {{Note|video_singles_b}} The \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" video was made for BBC's Top of the Pops to be shown while Bowie was away touring in the USA. However, it went unboradcast. Reasons include the sexual nature of some of the images in the video, and that - given this was the earliest days of the music video - Bowie's manager Tony Defries wanted to charge the BBC what they saw as exorbitant fee.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 143\"/>\n* '''c''' {{Note|video_singles_c}} This release of \"Space Oddity\" in January 1973 was primarily focused at the US, where it gained Bowie his first hit. The single was not released in the UK. It was however released in a few other territories: Canada, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Puru and Japan.\n* '''d''' {{Note|video_singles_d}} \"Space Oddity\" was recorded twice in 1969. The first version was recorded on 2 February during the making of the music video film ''Love You Till Tuesday'', and consequently had a contemporaneous video made for it (see 'Music video films', below). The second version was recorded between 20\u201323 June, and it is this version that was released as a single a few weeks later, and featured on the album ''David Bowie'' (1969), aka ''Man of Words / Man of Music'' (USA 1969\u20131972) aka ''Space Oddity'' (worldwide 1972\u20132009). This single did not have a video made for it at the time.\n* '''e''' {{Note|video_singles_e}} The \"Space Oddity\" single in 1969 was generally released in different edits in different territories. \"Space Oddity\" UK edit was 4'33\"; while USA edit was 3'52\". European versions of the single were the full-length album recording (5'10). \n* '''f''' {{Note|video_singles_f}} \"Life on Mars?\" was released in the UK and a limited number of other territories. It was not released in the USA / North America.\n* '''g''' {{Note|video_singles_g}} There is also another rough cut version of the \"'Heroes'\" music video, sometimes known as the 'alternative take' or - more accurately, 'take 1'. 'The \u201cHeroes\u201d promo outtakes reel is just under 28 minutes long. It contains one complete take, and 8 partial takes of \u201cHeroes\u201d [...] The official promo for \u201cHeroes\u201d utilizes sections from most of the takes, in long cross dissolves. The only complete take of \u201cHeroes\u201d, Take 1, was barely used \u2013 all that was included was the 10 seconds of \u201cI would be king, and you, you would be queen\u201d [...] The complete Take 1 [...] includes many full-face close-ups of Bowie [... and] was largely unused due to the fact that Bowie's miming in it was not very accurate [...] since the promo was for immediate use \u2013 we see it included on the \u201cL\u2019Altra Domenica\u201d show a few days later \u2013 perhaps there was no time for a very sophisticated edit.' As this source notes regarding the tape: 'In addition, there are a couple of takes of about 30 seconds of Blackout. And about 3 minutes of close-ups of Bowie slowly bringing his hand to his face, mimicking the \u201cHeroes\u201d album cover whilst Sense of Doubt plays in the background.

Bowie also released 14 video albums and 72 music videos.\n\nBowie's debut release was the 1964 single \"[[Liza Jane (David Bowie song)|Liza Jane]]\" by Davie Jones & the King Bees. He released two more singles in 1965 under the names of The Manish Boys and Davy Jones & the Lower Third. His first release using the name David Bowie was the 1966 single \"[[Can't Help Thinking About Me]]\", which was released with The Lower Third. Bowie's next single, \"[[Do Anything You Say]]\", also released in 1966, was the first release by simply David Bowie. Bowie released four more singles and his debut album, ''[[David Bowie (1967 album)|David Bowie]]'', but the first success in the United Kingdom was with the 1969 single \"[[Space Oddity]]\".

Following the success of ''Ziggy Stardust'', sales of ''Hunky Dory'' improved and it eventually peaked at number three in the UK. [[RCA Records|RCA]] re-released the 1969'' David Bowie''  under the title Space Oddity (with an updated Ziggy Stardust-era photo) and ''The Man Who Sold the World'', which reached numbers 17 and 26 in the UK respectively (but the last one reached number 21 after the Bowie'death in 2016).\nBowie released nine more studio albums with RCA, all of which reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, of which ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' (1973), ''[[Pin Ups]]'' (1973), ''[[Diamond Dogs]]'' (1974) and ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'' (1980) reached the number one position. His 1975 RCA album \"Young Americans\" included his first #1 US single \"Fame\" <https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6700699/david-bowie-fame-no-1-hot-100-1975-rewinding-charts>which was co-written by John Lennon, who also performed on the album, and Carlos Alomar. He then released three solo studio albums with [[EMI]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983), whose [[Let's Dance (David Bowie song)|title track]] became his first single to reach number one in both the United Kingdom and the United States, ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]'' (1984) and ''[[Never Let Me Down]]'' (1987). ''Let's Dance'' and ''Tonight'' reached number one on the UK Albums Chart, while ''Never Let Me Down'' reached number six. The success of ''Let's Dance'' revitalized Bowie's back catalogue: throughout the summer of 1983, he had multiple albums on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. This peaked on 16 July that year, with ten entries \u2013 a figure bettered only by [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>*Roberts, David.

These dates must be incorrect because Bowie played The Tower Theater for six nights, from 8 July to 13 July. D\u00f6pke goes on to say: \"On later pressings, this error has been corrected (although the new dates given, 12-13/07/1974, are still not entirely correct).\" D\u00f6pke notes the corrected pressings begin from October 1974, which given the first pressing was released on 21 October 1974, the mistake must have been realised and corrected during the run up to release. The correct dates of the recording, according to D\u00f6pke, are 10-13/07/1974.<ref name=\"bowie-collection.de\">http://www.bowie-collection.de/</ref>\n* '''b'''{{Note|note_live_b}} There were some overdubs recorded in post-production (before mixing) for ''David Live''. Nic Pegg writes 'The backing vocals and some of the saxophone parts were re-recorded at Record Plant because, according to [Tony] Visconti [who supervised the post-production and mixed the album], \"the backing singers and horn players were often sporadically off microphone due to excitement, I guess.\" Similarly, Mike Garson re-recorded his piano solo for \"Aladdin Sane\" because \"the original was wiped. It was only 16-track so I guess that was the only way it could be done then\".' <ref name=\"Pegg, p. 373\"/>\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_live_c}} According to Nic Pegg, Tony Visconti, who was recording and mixing the album, thought 'many of the numbers too fast after the first night's recording in Philadelphia, and the band re-rehearsed on the afternoon of 29 April to re-establish the original studio tempi. So consistent were the band's performances thereafter, explained Victonti, \"that we were able to use the intro and outro of 'Station to Station' from Boston and the bulk from Rhode Island\".' It is thus unlikely any of the recordings from the 28th April were used on the final album.<ref>Pegg, p. 393</ref>\n* '''d'''{{Note|note_live_d}} An early mix of the sound was created by Ken Scott in 1973, and it was this that was used for the [[Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (film)|film]] soundtrack in early broadcasts and screenings. In 1981, Bowie and producer Tony Visconti prepared a new mix for both the release of the film and the release of an accompanying album. Nic Pegg writes: 'Visconti, who described the process as \"more of a salvage job than an artistic endeavour\", explained that \"the sound quality was poor and I was called in to beef it up, which also required David and me to resing many of the backing vocals. They were simply not recorded well on tape \u2013 partly because Trevor Bolder and Mick Ronson didn't sing into the microphones!\"'. In addition, two songs featured Jeff Beck on guitar: \"The Jean Genie / Love Me Do\" medley and \"Round and Round\". Beck redid his solos in December 1981 at CTS Studios, London. However, in the end Beck refused to allow the two songs to be included in the soundtrack (and, of course, in the film).<ref>Pegg, p. 404-5</ref>\n* '''e'''{{Note|note_live_e1}}{{Note|note_live_e2}} The songs on the ''Tin Machine Live: Oy Vey, Baby'' album came from a number of shows in the US and Japan: 20 November 1991 in Boston; 27 or 29 November 1991 in New York; 7 December 1991 in Chicago; 10 or 11 February 1992 in Sapporo; 17 February 1992 in Tokyo.\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_live_f}} The ''liveandwell.com'' album was a limited edition live release not available commercially but via subscribing to [[David Bowie#BowieNet|BowieNet]]. 'Although Bowie hoped for the album to have a full commercial release, his label Virgin was unenthusiastic and refused to issue it.' <ref>{{cite web|title=liveandWwll.com|url=https://www.bowiebible.com/albums/liveandwell-com/|website=Bowie Bible|accessdate=17 October 2019|language=en}}</ref> The album only features songs from the albums ''Earthling'' (1997) and ''1. Outside'' (1995). \n* '''g'''{{Note|note_live_g}} The ''Glass Spider'' live album is sourced from a professional recording for a CD promo set that was distributed among American radio stations in late 1987 / early 1988. CD Bootlegs of these recordings appeared in 1989 as ''Bon Soir Montreal''. See Re-releases (and pre-releases) below. The official release, however, was 2007.\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_live_h}} ''Live Santa Monica '72'' was available on bootleg for a number of years before seeing semi-official/legal release as ''[[Santa Monica '72]]'' on 25 April 1994 by MainMan (Bowie's former management company during the seventies) without Bowie's approval.

It is this edition which is included in the '''Five Years (1969\u20131973) box set Edition''' \u2013 see box sets section of discography.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" | '''''[[LiveAndWell.com|liveandwell.com]]''''' (1999)\n| 2000\n| CD\n| '''liveandwell.com [Reissue]'''<br />A second release of the CD in 2000 came with a bonus disc made up of four rare remixes, one being the song \"Fun\", which was itself not released commercially.\n|-\n| rowspan=\"1\" | '''''[[Glass Spider]]''''' (2007)\n| 1989\n| CD\n| '''Bon Soir Montreal'''<br />The Glass Spider live album is sourced from a professional recording for a CD promo set that was distributed among American radio stations in late 1987 / early 1988.

According to author David Buckley, copies had been around for more than 20 years by the time of the semi-official/legal release ''Santa Monica '72'' in 1994.<ref>David Buckley (1999).

The 1995 European reissue was titled ''Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars \"Live\"''.<ref>Pegg, p. 343</ref> In the years to come various versions of this release appeared in different \u2013 and ever more complex \u2013 packaging, and with various extras. \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''''[[Live Nassau Coliseum '76]]''''' (2017)\n| Unknown\n| LP\n| '''Bootlegs \u2013 various titles'''<br /> The full gig was broadcast live on the King Biscuit Flower Hour show in the US, and was accordingly bootlegged a number of times.\n|-\n| 2010\n| LP\n| '''''[[Station to Station]]''''' '''Special and Deluxe Editions [Remaster]'''<br />Both the special and deluxe editions of  ''Station to Station'' included the entire 1976 Nassau Coliseum show \u2013 albeit with an edited version of \"Panic In Detroit\" \u2013 on two CDs newly remastered. The full version of \"Panic In Detroit\" (which had a long drum solo by Dennis Davis) was made available as a digital download. The 2010 remasters (again with the edited version of \"Panic In Detroit\") were included in the '''Who Can I Be Now? box set Edition''' released in 2016 prior to the album being given a standalone release in 2017.\n|-\n|}\n\n===TV & Radio===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Recording\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"8\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| UK<br/><ref name=\"guinness\" /><ref name=\"UK charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| AUS<br/><ref name=aus/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| NL<br/><ref name=\"dutch charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| NOR<br/><ref name=\"norwegian charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| NZ<br/><ref name=\"new zealand charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| SWE<br/><ref name=\"swedish charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| SWI<br/><ref name=\"swiss charts\"/>\n\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| US<br/><ref name=\"billboard200\"/><ref name=\"tm_billboard200\"/>\n|-\n\n! scope=\"row\"| '''''[[Bowie at the Beeb|BBC Radio Theatre]]'''''\n|\n* 27 June 2000\n* BBC Radio Theatre, London, UK\n|\n* Released: 2000\n* Label: EMI\n* Formats: LP, CD\n| \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n\n! scope=\"row\"| '''''[[VH1 Storytellers (David Bowie album)|VH1 Storytellers]]'''''\n|\n* 23 August 1999\n* Manhattan Center, New York City, USA\n|\n* Released: 6 July 2009\n* Label: EMI\n* Formats: CD, CD+DVD, DD\n| 114<br/><ref>\"Official Album Chart\".

These were: \"Let Me Sleep Beside You\" / \"Karma Man\" (recorded 1 September 1967) and \"In The Heat Of The Morning\" / \"London Bye Ta-Ta\" [1968 version] (recorded 12 March 1968). Both had a more mainstream pop feel than his previous baroque pop period (1966\u20137). Bowie then formed the multimedia folk trio Turquoise and recorded another single: \"Ching-a-Ling\" (written by Bowie) / \"Back To Where You've Never Been\" (written by Tony Hill). However, Hill left the band just after the recording. The trio continued for a while as Feathers with John 'Hutch' Hutchinson replacing Hill and joining Bowie and the other original member Hermione Farthingale. Hitch even redubbed Hill's vocals in \"Ching-a-Ling\". However, Farthingale left in January 1969 and they had no record deal so the idea of the single was abandoned. Bowie and Hutch continued as a duo for a month or so, before Hutch moved away, and Bowie got a new record deal with Mercury on the basis of a Bowie and Hutch demo of \"Space Oddity\".<ref>Pegg, p. 156</ref><ref>Pegg, p. 132</ref><ref>Pegg, p. 62</ref>\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_60s_c1}}{{Note|note_60s_c2}} \"Space Oddity\" and \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" were released in different edits in different territories. \"Space Oddity\" UK edit was 4'33\"; while USA edit was 3'52\". \"Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud\" UK edit was 3'52\"; while USA edit was 3'20\".

first appeared on ''David Bowie'' [aka ''Space Oddity''] (1969) and was over 7 minutes long. For this single, the song was re-recorded in two different parts. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 1\" and \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 2\" were not released in the USA but did have 7\" promo for radio promotion (not for general release). The versions of both songs were edits of the full recordings released in UK and other territories. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 1\" [new version] was 4'02\" in UK, and 3'18\" for the American promo. \"Memory of a Free Festival Part 2\" [new version] was 3'34\" in UK, and 2'22\" for the American promo.\n* '''b'''{{Note|note_70s_b1}} Bowie's \"Holy Holy\" single in the UK was not planned for release in the USA. Instead, the next American single would be \"All the Madmen\". For the release, the album track was seriously edited, most significantly having the middle section taken out. There is also some debate as to if the single was actually released. However, collector Jens D\u00f6pke writes the single went out but had \u2018poor sales, so that most existing records ended up in the cut-out bins\u2019.<ref>{{Cite web|last=D\u00f6pke|first=Jens|website=David Bowie \u2013 Just Another Collection|url=http://www.bowie-collection.de/|title=1970\u20131974}}</ref> These singles 'have a drill hole through the label to show that it had been discounted after not selling for full price'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bowie-singles.com/USA/All_The_Madmen.html|title=David Bowie 7\" Singles|website=|access-date=}}</ref> \n* '''c'''{{Note|note_70s_c1}}{{Note|note_70s_c2}} After the Arnold Corns \"Moonage Daydream\" / \"Hang On to Yourself\" single in May 1971, another Arnold Corns single was recorded on 17 June 1971: \"Looking For a Friend\" / \"Man In The Middle\". \"Looking For a Friend\" was written by Bowie, and sung by band members and friends Mark Pritchard, Mick Ronson, and Mickey King along with Bowie. \"Man In The Middle\" was written and sung by Pritchard. The single was never released. However, in the wake of the success of Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust period, B&C records (with whom Bowie had a limited deal for the Arnold Corns before signing for RCA with the ''Hunky Dory'' album [1971]), released an unofficial cash-in single: \"Hang On to Yourself\" / \"Man in the Middle\" \u2013 the A Side taken from the B Side of the first official Arnold Corns single, along with the Pritchard track from the second recording session.\n* '''d'''{{Note|note_70s_d1}} The \"Changes\" B Side in USA and Canada was an edited version of \"Andy Warhol\", with the studio chatter at the beginning edited out. In France, the original edition of the single had another ''Hunky Dory'' track for the B Side, 'Song for Bob Dylan', but was soon replaced by \"Andy Warhol\" [chatterless version]. All other editions had the full album version of \"Andy Warhol\" on the B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 24</ref> \n* '''e'''{{Note|note_70s_e1}}{{Note|note_70s_e2}} \"Changes\" did not chart in 1972 in UK and Australia, but following Bowie's death in 2016 the song entered these charts peaking at No. 49 (UK) and No. 80 (Australia).\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_70s_f1}} \"Changes\" was actually released in the USA (and Canada) in December 1971. While the single peaked at No. 66 in 1972, it re-entered the chart in 1974, peaking at No. 41.\n* '''g'''{{Note|note_70s_g1}} The mix of \"Starman\" used for the single differs from the album version in that the 'morse code' sounds of the song are higher in the mix. USA and German versions of the song were edited. The USA edit removes some of the opening bars of the song, the German edit fades early.\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_70s_h1}}{{Note|note_70s_h2}} The Italian and Spanish versions of the \"Starman\" single were issued much later in the year, and have the A Side of the next official single \u2013 \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" \u2013 on the B Side. The Portuguese single is an EP with both \"Starman\" [A1] and \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" [B1] with \"Hang On To Yourself\" [''Ziggy Stardust'' version] [A2] (the B Side of the general release of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\") and \"Suffragette City\" [B2] (the B Side of the general release of \"Starman\").\n* '''i'''{{Note|note_70s_i1}} In late January 1972 \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" was re-recorded during the second ''Aladdin Sane'' album session for inclusion on that album. In the end, it was dropped. However, later pressings of the \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" single had this ''Aladdin Sane'' version (or Sax version, as it is known, due to the prominent use of saxophone). This was not a new release, nor re-release, and had the same B Side and catalogue number.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 142-3\">Pegg, p. 142-3</ref>\n* '''j'''{{Note|note_70s_j1}} \"The Jean Genie\" was released in UK on November 1972, but in the USA during October. The USA version of the single had \"Hang On to Yourself\" [''Ziggy Stardust'' version] on the B Side. Releases across the world occurred between November 1972 and February 1973, with different territories having one of these two B Sides. Except Japan (January 1973), which had \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" [original version] on the B Side.\n* '''k'''{{Note|note_70s_k1}}{{Note|note_70s_k2}} This release of \"Space Oddity\" in January 1973 was primarily focused at the US, where it gained Bowie his first hit. The single was not released in the UK. It was released in a few other territories (Canada, Spain, Australia, etc.) with the same B Side as the USA release. It was also released in Mexico and Puru \u2013 in Mexico with \"Starman\" (from ''Ziggy Stardust'') on the B Side; and in Puru in a slightly edited version (omitting part of the intro) with \"The Jean Genie\" (from ''Aladdin Sane'') on the B Side. In Japan, the single was released in March (just prior to Bowie's Japanese tour in April) with \"It Ain't Easy\" (from ''Ziggy Stardust'') on the B Side.\n* '''l'''{{Note|note_70s_l1}}{{Note|note_70s_l2}} \"Drive-In Saturday\" was released in April 1973, but not in the US and Canada, who instead had the release of the \"Time\" single (edited version). \"Drive-In Saturday\" in Germany was released in an edited version \u2013 the only territory to so. Both \"Drive-In Saturday\" and \"Time\" (USA edit) were released in France, \"Drive-In Saturday\" in April, \"Time\" in July.\n* '''m'''{{Note|note_70s_m1}} \"Round and Round\" was recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971.\n* '''n'''{{Note|note_70s_n1}} \"The Prettiest Star\" [''Aladdin Sane'' version] was the B Side for the \"Time\" single in most of the limited number of territories it was released in, except for Japan, where the B Side was another track from ''Aladdin Sane'', \"Panic in Detroit\".\n* '''o'''{{Note|note_70s_o1}} \"Life on Mars?\" was not released in the USA / North America.\n* '''p'''{{Note|note_70s_p1}} The B Side of \"Life on Mars?\" was in most territories it was released in \"The Man Who Sold the World\". In Spain the B Side was \"Drive-In Saturday\" (from ''Aladdin Sane''); in Portugal \"Black Country Rock\" (from ''The Man Who Sold the World''); and in Italy \"Amsterdam\", recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971. \n* '''q'''{{Note|note_70s_q1}} \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" was a release focused upon the US, and was not released in the UK (where \"Life on Mars?\" was released during the same month instead).\n* '''r'''{{Note|note_70s_r1}} The B Side to \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" in Italy was \"Watch That Man\" and in Japan \"Drive-In Saturday\", both from ''Aladdin Sane''.\n* '''s'''{{Note|note_70s_s1}} \"The Laughing Gnome\" had some different B Sides in some territories: \"Silly Boy Blue\" in Netherlands and West Germany; \"Rubber Band\" (album version) in Italy and Spain. These tracks are taken from the contemporaneous album ''David Bowie'' (1967).\n* '''t'''{{Note|note_70s_t1}} The B Side of \"Sorrow\" had \"Amsterdam\" on the B Side in all territories except Spain, where it was \"Lady Grinning Soul\" (from ''Aladdin Sane''); in South Africa, however, it was mis-titled \"Port of Amsterdam\". \"Amsterdam\" was recorded during the first ''Ziggy Stardust'' album sessions in late 1971 (along with the B Side to \"Drive-In Saturday\", \"Round and Round\"), and had already appeared on the B Side to the \"Life on Mars?\" single in Italy earlier in the year.\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_70s_u1}}{{Note|note_70s_u2}} The original single mix of \"Rebel Rebel\" was released in February 1974 and is just a slightly early fade of the album version. It appeared in the UK, USA and most RCA territories. In April 1974 \u2013 in a move reminiscent of what happened with the rerecorded version of the \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" single in the UK \u2013 \"Rebel Rebel\" was heavily remixed and overdubbed in New York, and appeared on single again in the US and Canada the following month with a different B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 222</ref> The Brazilian version of the single uses the album version and has \"Diamond Dogs\" (from the album of the same name) on the B Side. In November \"Rebel Rebel\" was released again in Australia, this time as an EP: the A Side had \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Queen Bitch\" as per the single release; while the B Side was essentially the \"Sorrow\" single from the previous year, with \"Sorrow\" and \"Amsterdam\".\n* '''v'''{{Note|note_70s_v1}} \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" was only released in the UK and a few other territories, not in the USA.\n* '''w'''{{Note|note_70s_w1}} \"Diamond Dogs\" was issued in the UK and limited territories, it was not issued in the USA or Canada. The version in all these territories was the album mix, except in Australia where there was an exceptionally short edit of 2'58\" (as opposed to approx. 6').\n* '''x'''{{Note|note_70s_x1}} \"Holy Holy\" had originally been a single for Bowie back in 1971. In mid to late 1972, during the earliest days of recording songs for ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'' Bowie recorded this new version of the song for the album. It was never used. Very much like the B Sides to the singles \"Sorrow\" with (\"Amsterdam\") and \"Drive-In Saturday\" (with \"Round and Round\").\n* '''y'''{{Note|note_70s_y1}}{{Note|note_70s_y2}}{{Note|note_70s_y3}} The \"1984\" single had very limited release. In the US and New Zealand, the single had \"Queen Bitch\" on the B Side, in Japan only \"Lady Grinning Soul\".\n* '''z'''{{Note|note_70s_z1}}{{Note|note_70s_z2}}{{Note|note_70s_z3}} \"Panic in Detroit\" [Live] was originally a non-album track, as the original version of the album issued in 1974 did not feature the song. The album was issued again in 1990 with additional tracks, and a second time in 2005 with more additional tracks, one of which was \"Panic in Detroit\" [Live]. See Live Albums \u2013 Re-Issues on this page for more information.\n* '''aa'''{{Note|note_70s_aa1}}{{Note|note_70s_aa2}} \"Young Americans\" was only released in its full album version (5'10\")in the UK. In all other territories, it was released in a single edit (3'15\") which edited out some of the verses later in the song.\n* '''bb'''{{Note|note_70s_bb1}} The 1975 release of the \"Space Oddity\" single was focused on the UK (i.e., no USA etc. release). It was, however, also released in Netherlands later in the year, and in Yugoslavia but with only \"Velvet Goldmine\" on the B Side. \"Velvet Goldmine\" was a song originally recorded for ''The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars'' but never made it to the final tracklist. It is one of the many tracks from the recording session in late 1971 which ended up as B Sides over the following years, along with the singles \"Sorrow\" with (\"Amsterdam\"), \"Drive-In Saturday\" (with \"Round and Round\") and \"Diamond Dogs\" with \"Holy Holy\" [rerecorded version].\n* '''cc'''{{Note|note_70s_cc1}} \"TVC 15\" [single edit] was also supposed to appear as the B Sides to a 'radical 3'40\" edit' of the \"Station to Station\" song (from the album of the same name) 'mooted [as a] single in France'. The single was never released, although a few copies were pressed.<ref>Pegg, p. 267</ref>\n* '''dd'''{{Note|note_70s_dd1}}{{Note|note_70s_dd2}} \"Stay\" came out as both an A Side and a B Side in the same month \u2013 July 1976. It came out as a B Side to the official retrospective single \"Suffragette City\" in the UK (and some other territories) where the ''ChangesOneBowie'' compilation was being promoted; and as an A Side in the USA (and some other territories) where the compilation album was not being prompted. In addition, \"Stay\" appears in two formats: the album version (6'16\") and single edit (3'23). The \"Suffragette City\" single had the album version on the B Side (except in Germany); while the \"Stay\" single used the edited version in all the territories where it was released.\n* '''ee'''{{Note|note_70s_ee1}} \"Suffragette City\" while an official retrospective single released 9 July 1976, it was aimed at promoting the contemporary ''[[ChangesOneBowie]]'' compilation released on 21 May 1976. Both compilation and single were focused upon the UK market. The album was also released in some other territories, such as West Germany, but not the USA. Similarly, the \"Suffragette City\" single was not released in the US, but did see release in West Germany, France, and Australia.\n* '''ff'''{{Note|note_70s_ff1}} USA Promo only.

The single version worldwide was an edited cut of the album version, but was released in both Germany and France in two formats: in the original English and in the respective languages. In Germany, the German language version appeared as a single titled \"'Helden'\"; while in France the French language version was still titled \"'Heroes'\" but had 'Chant\u00e9 en Fran\u00e7ais' on the cover (the English language single had 'Version Anglaise' on the cover). The \"'Heroes'\" album was also released in Germany and France with the song \"'Heroes'\" (full length version) in different language versions. These versions have half the song sang in English, and half in the respective languages. These versions of the song are known as: \"'Heroes'\" / \"'Helden'\" [Long English/German version] and \"'Heroes'\" / \"'H\u00e9ros'\" [Long English/French version].\n* '''hh'''{{Note|note_70s_hh1}} Spain only 12\" and David Bowie's first commercially available 12\". There had been a USA promo 12\" for the \"Sound and Vision\" single \u2013 although this was just \"Sound and Vision\" segueing into Iggy Pop's \"Sister Midnight\" song. And there was also a USA promo 12\" for \"'Heroes'\", with the full album version on the A Side and the single edit on the B Side. The 12\" single commercially released for \"'Heroes'\", however, was only released in Spain.\n* '''ii'''{{Note|note_70s_ii1}} Spain only 12\". \"Beauty and the Beast\" was David Bowie's second commercially available 12\" \u2013 both of which were Spanish releases (the first being the previous single \"'Heroes'\"). However, this 12\" was also released in the US as a promo: labelled as the 'Disco Version'.\n* '''jj'''{{Note|note_70s_jj1}}{{Note|note_70s_jj2}} This release of \"Breaking Glass\" is an Australian only single \u2013 the first time Bowie had released a single in Australia and nowhere else. The song is an extended version of \"Breaking Glass\" from the ''Low'' album. The B Side \u2013 \"Art Decade\" \u2013 also comes from ''Low''. Interestingly, the labels on the actual record say that both songs come from the live album ''Stage''. They do not.<ref>http://www.bowie-singles.com/OZNZ/Breaking_Glass.html</ref> It is, however, worth noting that a few months earlier in late 1978 Bowie had released a 7\" single in the UK and some other European territories with \"Breaking Glass\" [live] from ''Stage'' on the A Side and \"Art Decade\" [Live] as well as \"Ziggy Stardust\" [Live] both also from ''Stage'' on the B Side.\n* '''kk'''{{Note|note_70s_kk1}} Netherlands only 12\" of \"Boys Keep Swinging\".

July 1978 right at the end of the 1978 [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] (aka Low / Heroes Tour). The song had featured prominently and a live version from that tour would appear on the live album ''[[Stage (David Bowie album)|Stage]]''. The studio version was thus recorded prior to the recording of the ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'' album which began in September 1978.<ref>Pegg, p. 17</ref> \n* '''b'''{{Note|note_80s_b}} This version \u2013 the third \u2013 of \"Space Oddity\" was recorded for a special of ''[[The Kenny Everett Video Show]]'' titled Will ''Kenny Everett Make It To 1980?'' broadcast on New Year's Eve 1979. It is a slight remix which 'notably extends the deafening silence after the line \"may God's love be with you\" by a full three-and-a-half seconds'.<ref>Pegg, p. 259</ref> The first version of \"Space Oddity\" was recorded for the video film ''[[Love You till Tuesday (film)|Love You till Tuesday]]'' in early 1969. It is the second version of the song that has been released as a single many times, beginning late 1969 and providing Bowie with his first UK hit. This version appears on ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969), aka ''Man of Words / Man of Music'' [USA 1969\u20131972] and ''Space Oddity'' [worldwide 1972\u20132009].\n* '''c'''{{Note|note_80s_c}} \"Crystal Japan\" was a Japanese only single, Bowie's second, following \"Revolutionary Song\" of the previous year. The song was originally to be the closing track of ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' and was titled \"Fujimoto San\". It was, however, dropped and replaced during the recording process. The song was instead used in 1980 on a Japanese television commercial for a sake brand called Crystal Jun Rock. Bowie also appeared in the commercial. \n* '''d'''{{Note|note_80s_d1}}{{Note|note_80s_d2}} The \"Ashes to Ashes\" 12\" appeared only in the US and Germany. In the USA it appeared under the title ''The Continuing Story of Major Tom''. On the A Side Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" song from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969), which was a hit in the US in early 1973, segues into the single edit of \"Ashes to Ashes\". The German 12\" has the 'Disco mix' on the A Side, which is just the full length version of the song as on the album ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]''.<ref name=\"David Bowie 12 Singles\"/> \n* '''e'''{{Note|note_80s_e}} Did not enter the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 but peaked at No. 101 on the [[Bubbling Under the Hot 100]] chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn\" />\n* '''f'''{{Note|note_80s_f}} The \"Fashion\" 12\" was issued in UK, Germany and the USA only.\n* '''g'''{{Note|note_80s_g}} \"It's No Game (Part 1)\" was a Japanese only single, replacing the release of \"Fashion\" in rest of world (which appears on the B Side). This made a lot of sense as the song features Japanese vocals from Hisahi Miura. The song appears here as it does in the US as \"It's No Game (Part 1)\", although in the UK on the ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' album it is called \"It's No Game (No. 1)\".\n* '''h'''{{Note|note_80s_h}} The \"Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)\" 12\" was issued only in Germany.\n* '''i'''{{Note|note_80s_i}} The \"Up the Hill Backwards\" 12\" was issued only in the US, which did not see the release of a 7\". This is because both 7\" and 12\" versions of this rather limited release had the same edit of the song, taken from the ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters.....and Super Creeps]]'' album.\n* '''j'''{{Note|note_80s_j}} The \"Under Pressure\" 12\" was issued only in Netherlands, which also saw the release of a 7\". Both 7\" and 12\" versions of this rather unusually used exactly the same cuts of the tracks.\n* '''k'''{{Note|note_80s_k}} \"Wild Is the Wind\" is the album cut in all single versions. The song runs at 5'58\" on all these records, however, a special edit was created running at 3'34\" for the music video.<ref>Pegg, p. 315</ref>\n* '''l'''{{Note|note_80s_l}} The \"Wild Is the Wind\" 12\" was issued only in the UK and Germany (both of which also saw the release of a 7\"). Again, as with the previous \"Up the Hill Backwards\" and \"Under Pressure\" singles, both 7\" and 12\" versions used exactly the same cuts of the tracks.\n* '''m'''{{Note|note_80s_m}} \"Wild Is the Wind\" while an official retrospective single released 13 November 1981, it was aimed at promoting the contemporary ''[[ChangesTwoBowie]]'' compilation released the same month. The album and single were focused upon UK and Europe. No single went out in the USA.\n* '''n'''{{Note|note_80s_n}} Aka ''David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal''. These songs were originally recorded by Bowie in August 1981 for a BBC television version of ''[[Baal (play)|Baal]]''. In September 1981, Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]] went to the Hansa studios in Berlin to re-record the five songs for this single release. The single came out in February 1982 just prior to the TV film broadcast on 2 March 1982. \n* '''o'''{{Note|note_80s_o}} While the ''Baal'' release featured five tracks, the ''de facto'' lead song was \"The Drowned Girl\" for which a music video was made, directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]]. \n* '''p'''{{Note|note_80s_p}} ''Baal'' was only issued as a 7\" EP in the UK, everywhere else it came out as a 12\". \n* '''q'''{{Note|note_80s_q1}}{{Note|note_80s_q2}}{{Note|note_80s_q3}}{{Note|note_80s_q4}} This original recording of the song \"\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\" appeared commercially in three versions. The album version ran at 6'08\" and it was this that appeared on the standard 12\" releases (as well as the Portugal 7\"). The standard 7\" single version of the track was an edit running at 4'08\". In Australia, a special extended remix was released running at 9'20 with 'added saxophone and synthesiser'. In addition, there were various promo edits and a USA DJ edit of the album version, varying between 3'08\" and 5'32\".<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 57\">Pegg, p. 57</ref>\n* '''r'''{{Note|note_80s_r}} The \"Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy\" single was lifted from a Bowie guest spot on ''[[Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas]]'' from 1977. And while an official retrospective release by his record company at the time (RCA), Bowie was not happy about the release and it was essentially unsanctioned: 'a piece of opportunism which did little to improve Bowie's relationship with his soon-to-be-former label'.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 57\"/>\n* '''s'''{{Note|note_80s_s1}}{{Note|note_80s_s2}} The Brazilian single edit of \"Let's Dance\" was not standard single edit, but the album version with an early fade. There was also a USA DJ version of the song, named the 'extended edit', so longer than the standard single edit, but shorter than the full album version.\n* '''t'''{{Note|note_80s_t1}}{{Note|note_80s_t2}}{{Note|note_80s_t3}} The live version of \"Modern Love\" that appeared as the B Side to all \"Modern Love\" singles was a live version of the song recorded on the second night at the Forum de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, Canada (13 July 1983). The entire concert was recorded and, with the exception of \"Breaking Glass\", \"Golden Years\", \"TVC-15\" and \"Stay\", broadcast on American FM radio in the series 'Supergroups in Concert'. At the time \"Modern Love\" [live] was a non-album track (it has however later appeared on both the ''[[Serious Moonlight (1983 film)|Serious Moonlight]]'' live DVD reissue [2006] as an audio only extra and been included on the album of the same name [2018] as its final track \u2013 although the film was recorded at the Pacific Coliseum, Vancouver, Canada on 12 September 1983).\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_80s_u1}} \"This Is Not America\" was issued in both 7\" and 12\" in UK and some other territories, but both releases had the same versions of the same songs on both the A Side and B Side. In some territories only the 7\" was issued \u2013 such as the USA. There was also, however, an extended mix issued in America on a various artists 12\" via DJ subscription only label Disconet.<ref>Pegg, p. 280</ref>\n* '''u'''{{Note|note_80s_u1}} \"Absolute Beginners\" also exists in a shorter edited version (4'46\") that that of the single (5'40'), issued on the A Side of an American promo 12\", with the full version on the B Side.<ref>Pegg, p. 14</ref>\n* '''w'''{{Note|note_80s_w1}} \"Magic Dance\" was only released in a very limited number of territories, most prominently the USA. Furthermore, while a single edit was prepared from both the album track and the dance mix, these were never used and the release only came out on 12\".\n* '''x'''{{Note|note_80s_x1}} With \"Day-In Day-Out\" Bowie begins issuing multiple remixes: '[a]lthough several previous singles had spawned 12\" versions, \"Day-In Day-Out\" marked Bowie's first major incursion into the brave new world of multi-format releases and endless remixes\".<ref>Pegg, p. 71</ref> The major UK and worldwide releases were 12\" 1 led by the 'extended dance mix' and 12\" 2 led by the remix [aka Groucho mix]. In USA 12\" 2 was replaced by a slightly different version which included the single edit and replaced the 'extended dub mix' with the 'extended dance mix'. There was also a US promo which had '7\" Dance Edit' [A1]; 'Extended Dub Mix' [B1]; and Edited Dance Mix [B2]. There were also some other local variations of 12\"s, including Germany and Brazil. Bowie also re-recorded the vocals in Spanish the song becoming known as ''Al Alba' and 'Dia Tras Dia'', although it was only played on the radio in Spain once and was not originally released as a single.<ref>Pegg, p. 72</ref>\n* '''y'''{{Note|note_80s_y1}} \"Under the God\" 10\" UK only.\n* '''z'''{{Note|note_80s_z1}} ''Maggie's Farm [live]/Tin Machine'' double A side single was only released in UK and Japan. Despite the song \"Tin Machine\" appearing on the label as 'A' for 7\" and 12\", and '1' for the CD, as well as the back sleeves track listings putting \"Tin Machine\" at the top, the front cover of the single listed \"Maggie's Farm [live]\" before \"Tin Machine\", and the single was promoted with a video of \"Maggie's Farm [live]\".\n* '''aa'''{{Note|note_80s_aa1}} The Japanese CD version of ''Maggie's Farm [live]/Tin Machine'' had a fifth extra track - \"The Interview\" [an interview with the band].

In the end, it was dropped. However, later pressings of the \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" single had this ''Aladdin Sane'' version (or Sax version, as it is known, due to the prominent use of saxophone). This was not a new release, nor re-release, and had the same B Side and catalogue number.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 142-3\"/>\n* '''b''' {{Note|video_singles_b}} The \"John, I\u2019m Only Dancing\" video was made for BBC's Top of the Pops to be shown while Bowie was away touring in the USA. However, it went unboradcast. Reasons include the sexual nature of some of the images in the video, and that - given this was the earliest days of the music video - Bowie's manager Tony Defries wanted to charge the BBC what they saw as exorbitant fee.<ref name=\"Pegg, p. 143\"/>\n* '''c''' {{Note|video_singles_c}} This release of \"Space Oddity\" in January 1973 was primarily focused at the US, where it gained Bowie his first hit. The single was not released in the UK. It was however released in a few other territories: Canada, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Puru and Japan.\n* '''d''' {{Note|video_singles_d}} \"Space Oddity\" was recorded twice in 1969. The first version was recorded on 2 February during the making of the music video film ''Love You Till Tuesday'', and consequently had a contemporaneous video made for it (see 'Music video films', below). The second version was recorded between 20\u201323 June, and it is this version that was released as a single a few weeks later, and featured on the album ''David Bowie'' (1969), aka ''Man of Words / Man of Music'' (USA 1969\u20131972) aka ''Space Oddity'' (worldwide 1972\u20132009). This single did not have a video made for it at the time.\n* '''e''' {{Note|video_singles_e}} The \"Space Oddity\" single in 1969 was generally released in different edits in different territories. \"Space Oddity\" UK edit was 4'33\"; while USA edit was 3'52\". European versions of the single were the full-length album recording (5'10). \n* '''f''' {{Note|video_singles_f}} \"Life on Mars?\" was released in the UK and a limited number of other territories. It was not released in the USA / North America.\n* '''g''' {{Note|video_singles_g}} There is also another rough cut version of the \"'Heroes'\" music video, sometimes known as the 'alternative take' or - more accurately, 'take 1'. 'The \u201cHeroes\u201d promo outtakes reel is just under 28 minutes long. It contains one complete take, and 8 partial takes of \u201cHeroes\u201d [...] The official promo for \u201cHeroes\u201d utilizes sections from most of the takes, in long cross dissolves. The only complete take of \u201cHeroes\u201d, Take 1, was barely used \u2013 all that was included was the 10 seconds of \u201cI would be king, and you, you would be queen\u201d [...] The complete Take 1 [...] includes many full-face close-ups of Bowie [... and] was largely unused due to the fact that Bowie's miming in it was not very accurate [...] since the promo was for immediate use \u2013 we see it included on the \u201cL\u2019Altra Domenica\u201d show a few days later \u2013 perhaps there was no time for a very sophisticated edit.' As this source notes regarding the tape: 'In addition, there are a couple of takes of about 30 seconds of Blackout. And about 3 minutes of close-ups of Bowie slowly bringing his hand to his face, mimicking the \u201cHeroes\u201d album cover whilst Sense of Doubt plays in the background.

The proposed railroad (likely the [[Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad]] which was sometimes known as \"The Meadville Line\") would almost connect with a larger nearby system (the [[Atlantic and Great Western Railroad]]), which meant that it could become a feeder route to the larger railroad.

He first settled in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]] in October 1854. On December 10, 1854, after helping to find a location for the new townsite of Topeka, he wrote a letter to his wife saying:\n\n<blockquote>I am now thirty miles above Lawrence on the Kansas River assisting in starting a new town.

This is mostly caused by commercial losses. Furthermore, the constant increase of [[Economy of Kosovo|economic]] development and [[Demographics of Kosovo|population]] have increased the energy demands.\nGeneration of energy from power plants has increased year by year, while the generation of energy from hydroelectric power plants has decreased. To cover the request Kosovo imports energy in certain periods of time (mostly during the winter).<ref>{{cite web|title=Strategjia e Kosoves per Energji|url=http://kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/Strategjia_e_Energjise_e_Republikes_se_Kosoves_2009-2018_SHQ.pdf|publisher=Kosovo Prime Minister Office|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Import-Export===\nImport covers 5-10% of the consumption.\nUsually, in Kosovo the imported energy is much more expensive than export.

Since May 2013, Kosovo Energy Distribution and Supply split from Kosovo Energy Cooperation and started its operational activities as a joint stock company. KEDS is owned now by Turkish companies \u00c7al\u0131k Holding and Limak. KEDS is considered as one of the largest employers in Kosovo, having 2618 employees. Furthermore, over 450 thousand customers are provided with electricity supply covering household customers, commercial and industrial customers. Currently there are three main projects concerning distribution: Construction of medium voltage distribution facilities of the new 110/10(20) kV Prishtina 7 substation, Expansion and reinforcement of the low voltage distribution network 2013, and Expansion and reinforcement of the medium voltage distribution network 2013.

The decrease of commercial and technical losses would affect positively. Factors that have kept the low prizes until now are: foreign investments as grants, [[Government of Kosovo|government]] subventions, the lack of investments for environment protection and inexpensive labor force.<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.ero-ks.org/|publisher=[[Energy Regulatory Office]]|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref> \nKEK generating about 97% of the energy has the monopoly of market. ERO has the jurisdiction of setting [[Electricity pricing|tariffs]] for energy services.\n\n==Power plants impact on environment and health==\nEnvironment protection is a mission of the [[Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning of Kosovo|Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning]] (MMPH). Since most of electric power is produced by power plants in Kosovo they are considered as the main environment pollutant. Actual emission of gases, dust and waste-water discharged from the existing power plants, are above the levels allowed by the EU directives. According to the [[World Bank]]\u2019s statistics, 835 deaths, 310 new cases of chronic bronchitis, 22,900 new cases of respiratory diseases among children, 11,160 emergency visits to country\u2019s hospital and there is a 100 million euros loss are caused each year because of coal plants.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Kosovo Campaign Targets Proposed New Power Plant|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-campaign-targets-proposed-new-power-plant|publisher=[[Balkan Insight]]|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Energy efficiency===\nKosovo Agency for Energy Efficiency - KAEE is executive institution under the Ministry of Economic Development.

The fact that the electrical energy system of Albania relies on hydro energy (almost 100%), while Kosovo relies on power plants, is a great opportunity for cooperation between the two countries. Moreover, a 400 kV interconnection line is in its final proceeding before the beginning of building.\nThe kosovar Ministry of Economic Development has negotiated with [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] economy institutions to deepen the cooperation, especially in the energy sector.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kosovo Energy Strategy|url=http://kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/Strategjia_e_Energjise_e_Republikes_se_Kosoves_2009-2018_SHQ.pdf|publisher=Kosovo Prime Minister Office|accessdate=2 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==New alternatives for energy==\n[[Kosova e Re]] is a project for building a new power plant.

In 1944 he sang Jos\u00e9 in \"[[Carmen]]\" at [[New York City Opera]] opposite [[Jennie Tourel]].\n\nHe played many roles, the most important of which were in ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'', ''[[Parsifal]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''. However, it is mainly in French opera that he had his greatest successes.\n\nUpon the death of Maurice Corneil de Thoran in January 1953, he was called upon to direct the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre of La Monnaie, a position he held until 1959, giving way to [[Maurice Huisman]].

Some unions only report their registered players, i.e. those who play for an affiliated club or region. Other unions, such as England's [[Rugby Football Union]], also report people taking part in outreach and educational programs, or unregistered players. In the 2012 figures reported by the RFU they reported 1,990,988 people playing rugby in England, including 1,102,971 under 13s, 731,685 teens and 156,332 seniors. Some of those recorded would have experienced rugby via educational visits to schools, playing tag or touch rugby, rather than playing regularly for a club. The figures released in 2014 give an overall figure of those playing rugby union, or one of its variants, as 6,684,118, but also reports that of that total, 3.36 million are registered players, while 4.3 million are unregistered.</ref>\n| clubs = 180,630\n| contact = [[Full-contact|Full contact]]\n| team = 15 (with up to 8 substitutes)\n| mgender = Separate competitions\n| category = [[Team sport]], Outdoor\n| equipment = [[Football (ball)#Rugby union|Rugby ball]], [[Scrum cap]] (optional), [[Cleat (shoe)|Rugby boots]]\n| venue =\n| olympic = Part of the Summer Olympic programme in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]<br />[[Rugby sevens]] included in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]\n}}\n\n'''Rugby union''', widely known simply as '''rugby''', is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|full contact]] [[team sport]] that originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century. One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an [[Rugby ball|oval-shaped ball]] on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.\n\nRugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. [[Rugby union#Laws|rules]] do not differ between genders. In 2014, there were more than 6&nbsp;million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36&nbsp;million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.\n\nIn 1845, the first football laws were written by pupils at [[Rugby School]]; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by [[Blackheath F.C.]] to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and, in 1895, the acrimonious [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] between the then amateur rugby union and the professional [[rugby league]].  Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scianitti|first=Matthew|title=The world awaits for Canada's rugby team|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team|accessdate=8 March 2020|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=18 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129194424/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRugby union spread from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland and was embraced by many of the countries associated with the [[British Empire]].

country, by age and sex to publish instead an overall figure per country. This document, titled '119 countries... 6.6 million players' adds the number of registered and unregistered players reported by each country. Some unions only report their registered players, i.e. those who play for an affiliated club or region. Other unions, such as England's [[Rugby Football Union]], also report people taking part in outreach and educational programs, or unregistered players. In the 2012 figures reported by the RFU they reported 1,990,988 people playing rugby in England, including 1,102,971 under 13s, 731,685 teens and 156,332 seniors. Some of those recorded would have experienced rugby via educational visits to schools, playing tag or touch rugby, rather than playing regularly for a club. The figures released in 2014 give an overall figure of those playing rugby union, or one of its variants, as 6,684,118, but also reports that of that total, 3.36 million are registered players, while 4.3 million are unregistered.</ref>\n| clubs = 180,630\n| contact = [[Full-contact|Full contact]]\n| team = 15 (with up to 8 substitutes)\n| mgender = Separate competitions\n| category = [[Team sport]], Outdoor\n| equipment = [[Football (ball)#Rugby union|Rugby ball]], [[Scrum cap]] (optional), [[Cleat (shoe)|Rugby boots]]\n| venue =\n| olympic = Part of the Summer Olympic programme in [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]<br />[[Rugby sevens]] included in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]\n}}\n\n'''Rugby union''', widely known simply as '''rugby''', is a [[Contact sport#Terminology|full contact]] [[team sport]] that originated in [[England]] in the first half of the 19th century. One of the [[Comparison of rugby league and rugby union|two codes]] of [[rugby football]], is based on running with the ball in hand.  In its most common form, a game is played between two teams of 15 players using an [[Rugby ball|oval-shaped ball]] on a rectangular field called a pitch. The field has H-shaped goalposts at both ends.\n\nRugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and female players of all ages. [[Rugby_union#Laws|rules]] do not differ between genders. In 2014, there were more than 6 million people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered players. [[World Rugby]], previously called the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has 101 countries as full members and 18 associate members.\n\nIn 1845, the first football laws were written by pupils at [[Rugby School]]; other significant events in the early development of rugby include the decision by [[Blackheath F.C.]] to leave [[the Football Association]] in 1863 and, in 1895, the acrimonious [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|split]] between the then amateur rugby union and the professional [[rugby league]].  Historically rugby union was an amateur sport, but in 1995 formal restrictions on payments to players were removed, making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scianitti|first=Matthew|title=The world awaits for Canada's rugby team|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team|accessdate=8 March 2020|newspaper=[[National Post]]|date=18 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129194424/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/06/18/the-world-awaits-for-canadas-rugby-team/|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRugby union spread from the [[Home Nations]] of Great Britain and Ireland and was embraced by many of the countries associated with the [[British Empire]].

Although these clubs decided to ban hacking soon afterwards, the split was permanent, and [[Laws of the Game (association football)|the FA's codified rules]] became known as \"[[association football]]\" whilst the clubs that had favoured the Rugby Rules formed the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1871,<ref name=\"Godwin10\"/> and their code became known as \"rugby football\".\n\nIn 1895, there was [[History of rugby league#The schism in England|a major schism within rugby football]] in England in which numerous clubs from Northern England resigned from the RFU over the issue of reimbursing players for time lost from their workplaces. The split highlighted the social and class divisions in the sport in England, and led directly to the creation of the separate code of \"[[rugby league]]\".

The role of the two props is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.<ref name=\"IRB BGRU 6\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rugbycoaching.net/rugby-coaching/rugby-positions-explained/|title=Rugby Positions Explained|publisher=Rugby Coaching|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''Second row'''<br />\nThe second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialise as line-out jumpers.<ref name=\"IRB BGRU 6\"/> The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side.

The centres will attempt to tackle attacking players; whilst in attack, they should employ speed and strength to breach opposition defences.<ref name=\"IRB BGRU 7\"/> The wings are generally positioned on the outside of the backline.
