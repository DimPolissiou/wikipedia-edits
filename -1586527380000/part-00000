The airline began operating commercial aircraft in 1983 under the name [[Channel Express]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartgroup.co.uk|title=Welcome - Dart Group plc|work=dartgroup.co.uk}}</ref> when it was purchased by the Dart Group's current Executive Chairman, Philip Meeson. Initially a freight operator, from 2001 the airline also began operating passenger charter services using [[Boeing]] aircraft to international destinations on mainly short and medium-haul routes.\n\n===Formative years===\n[[File:Jet2 737 Leeds Bradford Airport.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737-300 wearing the airline's former livery, taking off at Leeds Bradford Airport in 2008]]\nIn 2002, [[Channel Express]] established the Jet2.com brand from [[Leeds Bradford International Airport]]. The re-branded Jet2.com began operating as a leisure airline with its first flight from Leeds Bradford to [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]] on 12 February 2003, which operated a twice daily rotation with two [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] aircraft. During 2003, further scheduled flights were launched to seven European sun and city break destinations.\n\nIn 2004, a second base was opened at [[Manchester Airport]] with the airline operating from Terminal 1. The airline also acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]].\n\nIn 2005, Jet2.com opened a third base at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle]]. Later in the year, the company acquired two [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]] aircraft, enabling it to fly medium-long haul destinations as well as carrying more passengers on popular existing routes. These aircraft helped the company to open two more bases at [[Blackpool Airport|Blackpool]]  and [[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 2006 the company relocated from [[Bournemouth]] to [[Leeds]] and was renamed Jet2.com Limited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/b5eb00126cd2a251a7e4256abf67587c/compdetails |title=Companies House - English Company 02739537 |publisher=Wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=26 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion ===\nThe airline acquired further Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft and opened a base at [[Belfast International Airport]]. In November 2008 Jet2.com changed its slogan from \"The North's Low Cost Airline\" to \"Friendly Low Fares\". This preceded the announcement of opening a hub at [[East Midlands Airport]], the first of the airline's outside the North of England and Scotland.

The first crossing point after Lapstone Zig Zag was at Wascoe's Siding at what is now [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]]. The single track would contribute to a fatal accident at [[Emu Plains]] in 1878 where eastbound and westbound goods trains collided.<ref name=\"Low\" />\n\nIn 1890 signal boxes were built at both Lower and Upper Points of the Zig Zag, this was to replace the operation of pointsmen using hand levers.<ref name=\"environment.nsw.gov.au\">{{Cite NSW HD|1170821|G024 : Lapstone Zig Zag|date=|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n====The Glenbrook tunnel deviation====\nCommissioner of Railways, E. M. Eddy, decided that the ZigZag should be replaced by the [[Glenbrook Deviation 1892, New South Wales|deviation]] including a [[Glenbrook Tunnel|tunnel]], both built around 1890. The Lapstone ZigZag and [[Lucasville railway station|Lucasville station]] were officially closed on 18 December 1892 and the rails were raised, after the completion of the Glenbrook Tunnel Deviation.<ref name=\"environment.nsw.gov.au\"/> The Deviation soon experienced problems as it was built at the same too steep grade as the Zig Zag which caused the locomotives to slip in the tunnel, mostly due to water leaking onto the tunnel floor from nearby creek, and smoke also became a problem for uphill trains, as the tunnel was not designed to vent the smoke.<ref name=\"Low\" /> \n\nThe building of the tunnel is the subject of [[Arthur Streeton|Arthur Streeton's]] famous painting ''Fire's On''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistsfootsteps.com/html/Streeton_fireson.htm |title=Artist's Footsteps |publisher=Artistsfootsteps.com |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nBy 1910, the line as a whole was being duplicated (made into [[double track]]) and the \"rathole\" tunnel was replaced on a different deviation with a gentler alignment with 1 in 60 (1.67%) grades and the New [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] tunnel at Bluffs point on the Glenbrook Creek escartment. From then on the lower section of the track, including the historic [[Knapsack Viaduct|Knapsack Gully Viaduct]], was converted into a road, the Great Western Highway, the main road up the Lapstone hill until the M4 motorway replaced it in 1993.<ref name=\"knpasack\">{{cite web|author=Martin, David |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/lapstone.htm |title=Lapstone Hill Railway Routes: Blue Mountains, Australia |work=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> The older tunnel was converted for mushroom growing but was also used by the [[RAAF]] for storage during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|author=Martin, David |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/glen-tunnel-old.htm |title=Glenbrook's old Railway Tunnel: Blue Mountains Railway Pages |work=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=9 December 1912 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> During 1943 to 1946 Glenbrook tunnel stored chemical weapons.<ref>[http://www.mustardgas.org/depots.htm]</ref> Today the Zig Zag, Knapsack Viaduct, The Old Glenbook Tunnel, and Lucasville station can all be accessed by walking tracks.\n\n== Knapsack Viaduct, 1863-65 ==\nThe Knapsack Viaduct was designed by and built by [[John Whitton]]. Its purpose was to carry the Railway Line across Knapsack Gully. It formed part of the Zig Zag, which climbed the eastern escarpment from Emu Plains to today's Glenbrook. Whitton also designed and built The Victoria Bridge across the Nepean River at Penrith. \n[[File:Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone (2886372648).jpg|thumb|View From Emu Plains, New South Wales]]\nConstruction of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct started in March 1863 by contractor W. Watkins, who also completed the stone piers of the Victoria Bridge at Penrith. Work was completed in 1865, with the bridge being constructed from local sandstone quarried in the neighbourhood around [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]], and carried a single rail line.\n\nThe viaduct fell into disuse in 1913 after the completion of the Glenbrook Gorge Deviation. In 1926, after over a decade of disuse, the Knapsack Viaduct was taken over by the Main Roads Board. The board sort to improve the route of the Great Western Highway between [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] and [[Blaxland, New South Wales|Blaxland]], that at the time zig zagged up what is today Old Bathurst Road. The viaduct's carriageway was widened to allow for two car lanes, by trimming back the inside face of the stone parapets. The new road was opened by Governor Sir Dudley DeChair on 23 October 1926. The viaduct was again widened in 1939, with the construction of a reinforced concrete cantilevered deck, because of increased traffic use.\n\nThe final deviation of the [[Great Western Highway]], with the opening of the [[M4 (Sydney)#M4 Western Motorway|M4 Western Motorway]] in 1993, ended traffic flow across the Knapsack Viaduct. In 1995 the Viaduct was reopened to the public as part of the historic Lapstone Zig Zag walk.<ref>{{Cite NSW HD|4301012|Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone|date=|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe line of the old track and cuttings (including the long abandoned platform of Lucasville station), and the old Knapsack Gully bridge is now a popular [[bushwalking]] track.<ref name=\"walks1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/glenbrook-eastern-blue-mountains/lapstone-bridge-zigzig-walk.html |title=Wildwalks |location=AU-NS |publisher=Wildwalks |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Often a cacophony of [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] and insects can be heard where the gully is deep at the viaduct and it would tend to echo these sounds, especially that of the [[bell miner]].

The first crossing point after Lapstone Zig Zag was at Wascoe's Siding at what is now [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]]. The single track would contribute to a fatal accident at [[Emu Plains]] in 1878 where eastbound and westbound goods trains collided.<ref name=\"Low\" />\n\nIn 1890 signal boxes were built at both Lower and Upper Points of the Zig Zag, this was to replace the operation of pointsmen using hand levers.<ref name=\"environment.nsw.gov.au\">{{Cite NSW HD|1170821|G024 : Lapstone Zig Zag|date=|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n====The Glenbrook tunnel deviation====\nCommissioner of Railways, E. M. Eddy, decided that the ZigZag should be replaced by the [[Glenbrook Deviation 1892, New South Wales|deviation]] including a [[Glenbrook Tunnel|tunnel]], both built around 1890. The Lapstone ZigZag and [[Lucasville railway station|Lucasville station]] were officially closed on 18 December 1892 and the rails were raised, after the completion of the Glenbrook Tunnel Deviation.<ref name=\"environment.nsw.gov.au\"/> The Deviation soon experienced problems as it was built at the same too steep grade as the Zig Zag which caused the locomotives to slip in the tunnel, mostly due to water leaking onto the tunnel floor from nearby creek, and smoke also became a problem for uphill trains, as the tunnel was not designed to vent the smoke.<ref name=\"Low\" /> \n\nThe building of the tunnel is the subject of [[Arthur Streeton|Arthur Streeton's]] famous painting ''Fire's On''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistsfootsteps.com/html/Streeton_fireson.htm |title=Artist's Footsteps |publisher=Artistsfootsteps.com |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nBy 1910, the line as a whole was being duplicated (made into [[double track]]) and the \"rathole\" tunnel was replaced on a different deviation with a gentler alignment with 1 in 60 (1.67%) grades and the New [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]] tunnel at Bluffs point on the Glenbrook Creek escartment. From then on the lower section of the track, including the historic [[Knapsack Viaduct|Knapsack Gully Viaduct]], was converted into a road, the Great Western Highway, the main road up the Lapstone hill until the M4 motorway replaced it in 1993.<ref name=\"knpasack\">{{cite web|author=Martin, David |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/lapstone.htm |title=Lapstone Hill Railway Routes: Blue Mountains, Australia |work=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> The older tunnel was converted for mushroom growing but was also used by the [[RAAF]] for storage during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"tunnel\">{{cite web|author=Martin, David |url=http://infobluemountains.net.au/rail/lower/glen-tunnel-old.htm |title=Glenbrook's old Railway Tunnel: Blue Mountains Railway Pages |work=Infobluemountains.net.au |date=9 December 1912 |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> During 1943 to 1946 Glenbrook tunnel stored chemical weapons.<ref>[http://www.mustardgas.org/depots.htm]</ref> Today the Zig Zag, Knapsack Viaduct, The Old Glenbook Tunnel, and Lucasville station can all be accessed by walking tracks.\n\n== Knapsack Viaduct, 1863-65 ==\nThe Knapsack Viaduct was designed by and built by [[John Whitton]]. Its purpose was to carry the Railway Line across Knapsack Gully. It formed part of the Zig Zag, which climbed the eastern escarpment from Emu Plains to today's Glenbrook. Whitton also designed and built The Victoria Bridge across the Nepean River at Penrith. \n[[File:Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone (2886372648).jpg|thumb|View From Emu Plains, New South Wales]]\nConstruction of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct started in March 1863 by contractor W. Watkins, who also completed the stone piers of the Victoria Bridge at Penrith. Work was completed in 1865, with the bridge being constructed from local sandstone quarried in the neighbourhood around [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]], and carried a single rail line.\n\nThe viaduct fell into disuse in 1913 after the completion of the Glenbrook Gorge Deviation. In 1926, after over a decade of disuse, the Knapsack Viaduct was taken over by the Main Roads Board. The board sort to improve the route of the Great Western Highway between [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] and [[Blaxland, New South Wales|Blaxland]], that at the time zig zagged up what is today Old Bathurst Road. The viaduct's carriageway was widened to allow for two car lanes, by trimming back the inside face of the stone parapets. The new road was opened by Governor Sir Dudley DeChair on 23 October 1926. The viaduct was again widened in 1939, with the construction of a reinforced concrete cantilevered deck, because of increased traffic use.\n\nThe final deviation of the [[Great Western Highway]], with the opening of the [[M4 (Sydney)#M4 Western Motorway|M4 Western Motorway]] in 1993, ended traffic flow across the Knapsack Viaduct. In 1995 the Viaduct was reopened to the public as part of the historic Lapstone Zig Zag walk.<ref>{{Cite NSW HD|4301012|Knapsack Viaduct, Lapstone|date=|access-date=2018-06-02}}</ref>\n\n== Present day ==\nThe line of the old track and cuttings (including the long abandoned platform of Lucasville station), and the old Knapsack Gully bridge is now a popular [[bushwalking]] track.<ref name=\"walks1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildwalks.com/bushwalking-and-hiking-in-nsw/glenbrook-eastern-blue-mountains/lapstone-bridge-zigzig-walk.html |title=Wildwalks |location=AU-NS |publisher=Wildwalks |date= |accessdate=5 December 2011}}</ref> Often a cacophony of [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] and insects can be heard where the gully is deep at the viaduct and it would tend to echo these sounds, especially that of the [[bell miner]].

The state bordered the [[Gilgit Agency]] to the south and the former princely state of [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as [[Karimabad (Hunza)|Karimabad]]); another old settlement is [[Ganish Village]] which means \"ancient gold\" village.

The state bordered the [[Gilgit Agency]] to the south and the former princely state of [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as [[Karimabad (Hunza)|Karimabad]]); another old settlement is [[Ganish Village]] which means \"ancient gold\" village. Hunza was an independent principality for more than 900 years until the [[British Raj|British]] gained control of it and the neighboring valley of Nagar between 1889 and 1891 through military conquest. The then [[Tham (title)|Mir/Tham]] (ruler), branch of [[Katoor Dynasty|Katur Dynasty]], Safdar Khan of Hunza fled to [[Kashghar]] in China and sought what would now be called political asylum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valley|first1=Hunza|title=Hunza Valley|url=http://www.skardu.pk/hunza-valley/|website=www.skardu.pk|publisher=Skardu.pk|accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Mir/Tham===\n{{main|Mir of Hunza}}\n\nAn account wrote by John Biddulph in his book ''[[Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh]]'' {{cquote|The ruling family of Hunza is called Ayesha (heavenly). The two states of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] were formerly one, ruled by a branch of the Shahreis, the ruling family of [[Gilgit]], whose seat of government was Nager. First muslim came to Hunza-Nagar Valley some 1000 years (At the time of Imam Isl\u0101m Sh\u0101h 30th Imam Ismaili Muslims). After the introduction of [[Islam]] to Gilgit, married a daughter of Trakhan of [[Gilgit]], who bore him twin sons, named Moghlot and Girkis. From the former, the present ruling family of Nager is descended. The twins are said to have shown hostility to one another from birth. Thereupon their father, unable to settle the question of succession, divided his state between them, giving Girkis the north/west, and to Moghlot the south/east bank of the river.<ref>Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh by John Biddulph page 26</ref>}}\n\n===2010 landslide===\nIn 2010, a landslide blocked the river and created [[Attabad Lake]] (also called shishket Lake), resulting in 20 deaths and 8 injuries and has effectively blocked about {{convert|26|km}} of the [[Karakoram Highway]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Waheed |first1=Abdul |title=The Attabad Landslide Disaster |url=https://pamirtimes.net/2013/01/04/the-attabad-landslide-disaster/ |accessdate=12 October 2019 |publisher=Pamir Times |date=4 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=SHISHKET LAKE CRISES \u2013 2010 \u2013 CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS |url=http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/aboutus/SHISHKET_lake_2010.pdf |website=ndma.gov.pk |publisher=[[National Disaster Management Authority (Pakistan)|NDMA]] |accessdate=12 October 2019 |date=27 July 2010}}</ref> The new lake extends {{convert|30|km|mi}} and rose to a depth of {{convert|400|ft|m}} when it was formed as the Hunza River backed up.<ref name=\"fourworlds_HiMaT_2013\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fourworlds.ca/documents/ASecondGreenRevolution.pdf | title=Needed: a second green revolution in Hunza | publisher=HiMaT | date=May 2013 | accessdate=26 November 2015 | pages=4 | author1=Michael Bopp | author2=Judie Bopp}} Karakorum Area Development Organization (KADO), Aliabad</ref> The landslide completely covered sections of the Karakoram Highway.<ref name=\"fourworlds_HiMaT_2013\" />\n\n===2018 Rescue mission===\n[[File:Hunza Tunnel.jpg|thumb|right|Tunnel]]\nOn 1 July 2018, [[Pakistan Army]] pilots in a daring mission rescued 3 foreign mountaineers stuck in snow avalanche at above the height of {{Convert|19000|ft}} on [[Ultar Sar|Ultar Sar Peak]] near Hunza.

They were built by [[Commonwealth Engineering|Comeng]] and [[Clyde Engineering]] between 1987 and 1996.\n\n==History==\nIn March 1985, the [[State Transport Authority (South Australia)|State Transport Authority]] (STA) awarded a tender for 20 diesel railcars (eight 3000 class units with a cab at each end and twelve 3100 class with a cab at one end only) to [[Commonwealth Engineering|Comeng]], [[Dandenong]].<ref>\"Here & There\" ''[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]]'' issue 573 July 1985 page 53</ref><ref>\"New Railcars for STA\" ''[[Catch Point (periodical)|Catch Point]]'' issue 48 July 1985 page 13</ref><ref>\"South Australia\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' July 1985 page 215</ref> The design was based on the stainless steel shell of the [[Comeng (train)|Comeng electric train]] then in production for [[Melbourne]]'s [[Public Transport Corporation]], but 2.3 metres longer and with only two doors per side. Because of a contractual requirement to maximise local content, the fit out was conducted at Comeng's [[Dry Creek, South Australia|Dry Creek]] facility.

However Comeng came back to the STA with a significantly higher price, so the work was put out to tender and a contract for 50 awarded to [[Clyde Engineering]] in November 1989.<ref>New Railcars ''[[The Recorder (periodical)|The Recorder]]'' November 1989 page 20</ref> Comeng concluded a deal to sell the 3000 class design and tooling. However by the time construction commenced, Comeng had sold its Dandenong plant to [[ABB Group|ABB]] who backed away from an agreement to hand over the jigs and tooling, so they were built between 1992 and 1996 by Clyde Engineering's [[Martin & King]] factory in [[Somerton, Victoria]].<ref name=Dunn/><ref>\"Here & There\" ''Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin'' issue 639 January 1991 page 22</ref><ref name=RDMar06>\"The Adelaide 3000 class railcars\" ''Railway Digest'' March 2006 pages 20-23</ref> \n\nAll were delivered with unpainted stainless steel offset by blue and orange stripes.

They have on occasions ventured beyond the Adelaide metropolitan area, operating special services to [[Nuriootpa, South Australia|Nuriootpa]] on the [[Barossa Valley railway line|Barossa Valley line]] and [[Riverton, South Australia|Riverton]] on the [[Roseworthy-Peterborough railway line|Roseworthy-Peterborough line]]. These tours stopped in the mid 2000s.<ref>\"Shirley Bassey in the Valley\" ''Catch Point'' issue 119 May 1997 page 10</ref><ref>\"General Operations - ARG Broad Gauge Lines\" ''Catch Point'' issue 161 May 2004 page 28</ref>\n\n==Mechanics==\nFollowing the 3000/3100 class life extension programme commencing in 2018, all 70 cars were repowered with [[Mercedes-Benz]] OM502LA series v8 engines.\n\nThe 3000 class bogies were built by Comeng and feature airbag secondary suspension. All 3000 class railcars are fitted with electro-magnetic [[track brake]]s, which are comparatively rare on trains, though they are commonly found on [[tram]]s. These are operated separately from the normal mechanical and dynamic braking.\n\nTrains are equipped with automatic [[Scharfenberg coupler]]s which are operated from the driver's cab. Coupling operations are sometimes performed at [[Adelaide railway station|Adelaide station]], requiring an extra staff member to flag the driver as well as to connect the safety chains. This feature allows sets of up to six cars to be formed.\n\nTwo headlights are mounted at the top of the car in the centre on driver's cab ends. There are no marker lights at the front; however, there are red marker lights for the rear located on the upper corners. There are metal steps up the side of the car to each door, but they are not used by passengers. They are illuminated by lights at night.

They were built by [[Commonwealth Engineering|Comeng]] and [[Clyde Engineering]] between 1987 and 1996.\n\n==History==\nIn March 1985, the [[State Transport Authority (South Australia)|State Transport Authority]] (STA) awarded a tender for 20 diesel railcars (eight 3000 class units with a cab at each end and twelve 3100 class with a cab at one end only) to [[Commonwealth Engineering|Comeng]], [[Dandenong]].<ref>\"Here & There\" ''[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]]'' issue 573 July 1985 page 53</ref><ref>\"New Railcars for STA\" ''[[Catch Point (periodical)|Catch Point]]'' issue 48 July 1985 page 13</ref><ref>\"South Australia\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' July 1985 page 215</ref> The design was based on the stainless steel shell of the [[Comeng (train)|Comeng electric train]] then in production for [[Melbourne]]'s [[Public Transport Corporation]], but 2.3 metres longer and with only two doors per side. Because of a contractual requirement to maximise local content, the fit out was conducted at Comeng's [[Dry Creek, South Australia|Dry Creek]] facility. The first commenced testing in May 1987, entering service in November 1987.<ref>\"New STA Railcars\" ''Catch Point'' issue 60 July 1987 page 14</ref><ref>New Railcar in Service ''[[Among Ourselves]]'' issue 242 July 1987 pages 2, 3, 17</ref> The eight 3000s were built first with the first 3100 class completed in mid-1988.<ref>\"New STASA Suburban DEMUs'' ''Rail Australia'' August 1987</ref><ref>\"South Australia's STA 3000 & 3100 Class Railcars\" ''Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin'' issue 608 June 2008 pages 122-128</ref><ref name=Dunn>{{cite book|last=Dunn|first=John|title=Comeng: A History of Commonwealth Engineering Volume 5: 1985-2012|year=2012|publisher=Rosenberg Publishing|location=Kenthurst|pages=77\u201386|isbn=9781922013521}}</ref> The last entered service in December 1988.<ref>3000 Order Complete ''[[Transit Australia]]'' February 1989 page 37</ref>\n\nIn the original contract, there was an option to order 76 further examples. However Comeng came back to the STA with a significantly higher price, so the work was put out to tender and a contract for 50 awarded to [[Clyde Engineering]] in November 1989.<ref>New Railcars ''[[The Recorder (periodical)|The Recorder]]'' November 1989 page 20</ref> Comeng concluded a deal to sell the 3000 class design and tooling. However by the time construction commenced, Comeng had sold its Dandenong plant to [[ABB Group|ABB]] who backed away from an agreement to hand over the jigs and tooling, so they were built between 1992 and 1996 by Clyde Engineering's [[Martin & King]] factory in [[Somerton, Victoria]].<ref name=Dunn/><ref>\"Here & There\" ''Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin'' issue 639 January 1991 page 22</ref><ref name=RDMar06>\"The Adelaide 3000 class railcars\" ''Railway Digest'' March 2006 pages 20-23</ref> \n\nAll were delivered with unpainted stainless steel offset by blue and orange stripes. In April 2002 the first was repainted by [[Bluebird Rail Operations]] in Adelaide Metro's yellow, blue and red.<ref>\"Here & There\" ''Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin'' issue 777 July 2002 page 278</ref> \n\nOriginally they operated on all [[Railways in Adelaide|Adelaide suburban lines]], however since the electrification of the [[Seaford railway line|Seaford]] and [[Tonsley railway line|Tonsley]] lines in 2014, they have been confined to the [[Belair railway line|Belair]], [[Gawler railway line|Gawler]], [[Grange railway line|Grange]] and [[Outer Harbor railway line|Outer Harbor]] lines. They have on occasions ventured beyond the Adelaide metropolitan area, operating special services to [[Nuriootpa, South Australia|Nuriootpa]] on the [[Barossa Valley railway line|Barossa Valley line]] and [[Riverton, South Australia|Riverton]] on the [[Roseworthy-Peterborough railway line|Roseworthy-Peterborough line]]. These tours stopped in the mid 2000s.<ref>\"Shirley Bassey in the Valley\" ''Catch Point'' issue 119 May 1997 page 10</ref><ref>\"General Operations - ARG Broad Gauge Lines\" ''Catch Point'' issue 161 May 2004 page 28</ref>\n\n==Mechanics==\nFollowing the 3000/3100 class life extension programme commencing in 2018, all 70 cars were repowered with [[Mercedes-Benz]] OM502LA series v8 engines.\n\nThe 3000 class bogies were built by Comeng and feature airbag secondary suspension. All 3000 class railcars are fitted with electro-magnetic [[track brake]]s, which are comparatively rare on trains, though they are commonly found on [[tram]]s. These are operated separately from the normal mechanical and dynamic braking.\n\nTrains are equipped with automatic [[Scharfenberg coupler]]s which are operated from the driver's cab. Coupling operations are sometimes performed at [[Adelaide railway station|Adelaide station]], requiring an extra staff member to flag the driver as well as to connect the safety chains. This feature allows sets of up to six cars to be formed.\n\nTwo headlights are mounted at the top of the car in the centre on driver's cab ends. There are no marker lights at the front; however, there are red marker lights for the rear located on the upper corners. There are metal steps up the side of the car to each door, but they are not used by passengers. They are illuminated by lights at night. All cars are air-conditioned.\n\n==Refurbishment ==\n[[File:AdelaideRail_1.jpg|thumb|[[TransAdelaide]] liveried 3025 at [[Goodwood railway station|Goodwood station]] in May 2005]]\nIn the 2008/09 State Budget it was announced that five out of six of Adelaide's railway lines were to be [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] commencing with the [[Seaford railway line|Noarlunga]] and [[Gawler railway line|Gawler]] lines.
