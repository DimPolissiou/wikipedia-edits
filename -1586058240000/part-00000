A pioneer in the field, she was the first female market researcher in Australia or the United Kingdom, and the first person to conduct an Australia-wide public opinion poll. Mentored by two of the finest market researchers of the day, she used her experience to great effect and steadily grew her business. During the [[Second World War]] her company experienced hardships due to a public that was suspicious of inquisitive representatives who would poll public sentiment about the war and the prime minister; in addition there was a reluctance among companies to spend money on market research, which they felt was unnecessary in a time of rationing. Nevertheless she came to the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who offered her the opportunity to set up Australia's first public-opinion research subsidiary. When Sir [[Frank Packer]] made a counter-offer she accepted, and made Ashby Research Services a subsidiary of [[Australian Consolidated Press]].\n\nAshby employed mainly women to survey housewives, who she considered to have great purchasing power, despite her view that most housewives were timid and shy creatures beholden to their husbands. After the war she continued innovative research, establishing the Ashby Consumer Panel, in which households maintained regular diaries that enabled her to gather continuous market research data. Toward the end of her life, Sir Frank Packer sold her back her company for the same price as he purchased it, before ailing health caused Ashby to sell her company to Beacon Research.\n\n==Early life==\nAshby was born on 08 June 1908 at New Sawley in [[Derbyshire]], England to Bertha, {{nee|Powell}}, and her husband, brickmaker Walter Bertrand Ashby. She was their fourth child; her siblings included Bertha Joan Prior and William Bertrand Ashby.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"billashby\"/><ref name=\"eldest-sister\"/> The family migrated to [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] in Melbourne when Ashby was five, and she was educated in Auburn, Hawthorn, and Camberwell state schools.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1923 Ashby started two years of training at a business college run by [[Frederick Zerko]],<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> after which she took up a secretarial job at [[J. Walter Thompson|J. Walter Thompson Australia Pty Ltd]] (colloquially known as JWT).<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> The company downsized considerably when it lost the [[General Motors]] account, due to the [[Great Depression]], and Ashby was relocated to the Sydney office. There she worked in the market research and psychology departments under [[Rudolph Simmat]],<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and by 1933 was [[Bill McNair|William McNair]]'s assistant.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Both Simmat and McNair gave her valuable experience and mentoring in market research; Simmat had authored one of the first studies into Australian market research,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and McNair later formed the McNair Survey, a company that undertook major television and radio audience ratings surveys.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> In 1933 she resigned and moved to London,<ref name=\"women-in-sport\"/> where she worked first for the [[London Press Exchange]], and then for the Charles W. Hobson agency.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> Though the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' notes that \"she spent much time reorganizing his library\",<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ashby found the contacts invaluable and the experience highly rewarding<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\"/>\u2014particularly in that it taught her \"to be always on the look-out for ideas for campaigns\".<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\"/> While in London she attended conferences and seminars in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> During this time she also worked with the German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry for Propaganda]], conducting research into how to improve relations between Britain and Germany, though when it was leaked to the public, sentiment was such that she immediately withdrew from that program.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/>\n\n==Formation of the Ashby Research Service==\n[[File:Mrs Right and Mrs Wrong - Sylvia Ashby.png|thumb|Sylvia Ashby showing the difference between \"Mrs. Right\" and \"Mrs. Wrong\"]]\nAshby returned to Sydney in 1936 and started her own business, the Ashby Research Service. Although she almost immediately secured a contract with an advertising agency to conduct a three-month-long survey of Melbourne's leading evening newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'',<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> it was nevertheless a difficult start. She later recounted that her initial problems were partly caused by \"business executives [who] appeared to know little and to care even less\" about market research;<ref name=\"routledge\"/> this was compounded by prevailing societal views of women, which were not positive toward women who ran their own business.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Yet Ashby became a tireless promoter of market research in a market that did not yet see the value of such research, let alone paying for it. In a profile for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' she was described as \"perhaps the only woman in Australia who has specialised in market research\".<ref name=\"smh-1937\"/> Ashby herself later declared that she was the only woman in the British Empire conducting an independent market research bureau.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/> She persevered against the challenges, and within five years her clients included the [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Pick-me-up Condiment Co. Ltd,<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> the [[National Bank of Australasia]], Dunlop-Perdriau rubber goods, [[Bushells]], the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'' and a number of advertising agencies.<ref name=\"crawford-p8\"/>\n\nAshby's method was to employ mainly women, who she believed were more conscientious and effective investigators than men. In particular she found female investigators \"much more patient with other women\", and that \"women will talk to another woman more freely\".<ref name=\"smh-1938\"/> She preferred unmarried women, as she believed that \"a single woman is better able to concentrate solely upon the problem on hand [and] has no home worries to distract her [and] has more time to keep herself physically fit\". Ashby essentially believed that unmarried women had \"a singleness of purpose denied to the married woman\".<ref name=\"unmarried-women-views\"/> She found focused interviews directly with housewives the most effective approach to market research. In a later interview with ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', she showed two small wooden, jointed [[mannequins]]\u2014one showing \"Mrs. Right\" and one \"Mrs. Wrong\". Mrs. Right, she explained, \"is erect, relaxed; the left arm (holding her bag and papers) is slightly to the rear; the right arm is forward; the head is slightly tilted\u2014she is the epitome of confidence.\" Mrs. Wrong \"is a bundle of nerves; head downcast, bag clutched to her\u2014the epitome of apologetic timidity.\" Those who displayed a lack of appropriate deportment, she maintained, would cause suspicion and sometimes hostility, and the interviewee would be unresponsive to questioning, leading to poor survey results.<ref name=\"womens-weekly-1961\"/>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy 1939 Britain had declared war on Germany. The [[Second World War]] caused major issues for a marketing research company that undertook direct interviews &mdash; quite a few of Ashby's researchers were reported by citizens suspicious of those asking questions during a time of war, and consequently they were detained by police. At one point Ashby herself was vigorously questioned over several hours by the police, who accused her of \"disloyalty\" and threatened her with arrest if she did not stop surveying popular opinion on the war and the [[Australian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"crawford-via-ashby\"/> Furthermore, rationing meant that firms were less concerned with marketing efforts as the availability of goods became more scarce and consumers were more likely to buy what they could find.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Despite this, she largely ignored the threats of the authorities and continued to conduct surveys on topics such as conscription, the war effort and war psychology.<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\"/>\n\nAshby hired John Stuart Lucy, a journalist from New Zealand, to help with her business. She later married him in 1939. Lucy was to later form a rival research firm, but this did not seem to cause any problems in the marriage &mdash; Ashby told ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' that \"we're rivals only in business. My husband completely approves of my career.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> She gave birth to a daughter, Susan, in 1940 and a son, Richard, in 1943.<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> Despite her previously expressed views on the capabilities of married women at work, the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' notes that \"busy and ambitious as she was, Sylvia did not neglect her two children. On weekends her time was devoted to them; school holidays were enjoyed together, sometimes at 'the farm', her husband's property at Narrabeen. At home there was always a maid or housekeeper; Susan was sent to Frensham and Richard to Geelong Church of England Grammar School.\"<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\nHer wartime polling gained the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who not only ran the ''[[Herald & Weekly Times]]'' but was also briefly Director-General of Information for the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] in 1940. Murdoch commissioned Ashby to run research into the war effort, and Ashby ran the first Australia-wide public opinion survey.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Murdoch later invited her to join him in establishing a public opinion subsidiary. Sir [[Frank Packer]], rival proprietor of [[Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP), got wind of the offer however, and put in a counter offer to make the Ashby Research Service a subsidiary of ACP. As Ashby had done work for the ''Australian Women's Weekly'' before the war, she chose to accept Packer's offer over Murdoch's.<ref name=\"crawford-p9\"/> Murdoch then approached [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] to conduct opinion polling, and he organised the Australian Gallop Poll. From 1942 to 1944 the Ashby Research Service was renamed to the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, but was renamed back to the Ashby Research Service after the war ended.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' in her capacity as Director of the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, Ashby caused a stir in July 1942 by proposing that the nation combine every two electorates and then subdivide them again into two electorates, to which women would elect a woman in one electorate, and men would elect a man in the second electorate. She felt this was necessary because \"some of those who aspire to leadership unfortunately appear to have the habit of drawing upon themselves most unfavourable publicity, which distresses the average woman, who at heart (although her husband never guesses it) is a timid and shy creature, full of complexes, which cause her to withdraw into herself at the slightest sign of any thing in the nature of a public brawl.\" By allowing each citizen to only vote for their own gender, Ashby believed this would encourage a better class of female candidate and women would become more politically engaged.<ref name=\"ashby-vote-proposal\"/>\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the Second World War ended, the Ashby Research Service saw a resurgence in business: surveys in 1945 included 14 for clients and 30 for ACP; in 1946 the number of surveys rose significantly, to 30 and 42 respectively.<ref name=\"postwar-surveys\"/> But the war had shown Ashby that revenue could be affected by external events; so she decided to conduct ongoing research surveys alongside her commissioned research to build up her existing data and attract new work. To this end, in 1945 she established the Ashby Consumer Panel as a trial in NSW and rolled out Australia-wide in 1947. The panel directly polled households through diaries of their buying habits. Householders would return from shopping and record their purchases and observations directly into an Ashby Consumer Purchase Record. By 1964 the Ashby Research Service boasted in an advertisement that 6165 households (containing 18,192 individuals) were keeping day-to-day records for the Service. To maintain quality, 237 regular employees inspected the logs, which were then sampled for checking by supervisors. The advertisement claimed that it was \"the largest survey-group permanently employed in the South Hemisphere\".<ref name=\"newspaper-news-advert\"/> Households were not paid, but received a subscription to ''The Women's Weekly''.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nBecause it was important to maintain credibility and relevance, the Ashby Research Service maintained a statistical library, managed by their professional statisticians. Australia's post-war relaxation of immigration policies encouraged workers from Europe to emigrate to Australia, so Ashby's service employed workers who spoke a variety of European languages to ensure the consistency and accuracy of their data.<ref name=\"crawford-p13\"/> She also regularly requested new equipment from Packer, including an electric calculator and a punching machine,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> in light of this influx and the more general [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom|post-war population boom]]. \n\nBetween September to November 1953 Ashby undertook an overseas business trip to the UK and the US. This caused ructions with the notoriously tight-fisted Packer, who did not necessarily believe in the benefits of such a trip. In a letter to Packer in June 1953, she argued forcefully for the trip, writing:\n\n{{quote|Mr Packer ... it is essential that we keep up with movements in the technique of Market Research, and it is also essential for our prestige that I go overseas. The twelve years in your employ is a long time to \u2018stay put\u2019 ... and when other Research people are constantly coming and going ... After ten years of most profitable operation, through lack of co-operation from Consolidated Press, the Ashby Research Service latterly has been hindered from progressing ... . Periodical overseas visits are essential to a Director of Market Research and this was discussed prior to the signing of my initial contract.<ref name=\"letter-packer-overseas-travel\"/>}}\n\nHer travels impressed on her that her work was first class and ahead of the rest of the world. ''The Argus'' reported that during her 1953 overseas trip \"she tried to find a woman counterpart, 'But without success, I'm afraid. It seems I'm quite unique'.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> On a 1958 business trip she was unimpressed with the work of [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s consumer panels and noted that Alfred Politz Research Inc.\u2014a leading market research company based in [[Manhattan]]\u2014did not conduct audits and \"do not provide anything resembling a standardised service\".<ref name=\"crawford-p17\"/>\n\nAs the success of the Ashby Research Service grew, so too did their competition. Profits decreased between 1965 to 1966, and in 1968 the firm recorded a loss. This caused ACP to demand a full audit; but Ashby put together a strident defence, pointing out that it was the only time in the subsidiary's history that their expenditure exceeded their revenue. She referred to a particularly problematic client and the costs of using a computer. To her frustration, Ashby found that her subsidiary was being underused by ACP, and regularly wrote to Packer to suggest ways of using her services.<ref name=\"crawford-p18-19\"/>\n\n==Australian Research Service buy-back and death==\nIn 1974, both Packer and Ashby were looking to retire. In a magnanimous gesture to Ashby, Packer sold the Ashby Research Service back to her for the same amount that he had paid for it in 1941 &mdash; $2,800.<ref name=\"crawford-p21\"/> Ashby, who was by this time becoming very ill, sold the business to Beacon Research Co. Pty Ltd.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> As her health continued to fail, she became confined to a wheelchair, before finally dying of cancer on 9 September 1978 at [[Palm Beach, New South Wales]] and was cremated.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1471050?c=people Sylvia Rose Ashby] - [[Trove Australia]]\n* [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110314880 Ashby Research Service records, ca. 19] - Archives [[State Library of NSW]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|goot-1993|\u03b7}} Goot, 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"eldest-sister\">{{ref|table-talk-1929|\u03be}} ''Table Talk'' 1929, p. 64</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dict-sydney\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"children\">{{ref|weekly-times-1946|\u03bf}}''Weekly Times'' 1946, p. 26</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\">{{ref|daily-examiner-1939|\u03ba}} ''Daily Examiner'' 1939, p. 4</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"women-in-sport\">{{ref|daily-telegraph-1934|\u03bb}} ''The Daily Telegraph'' 1934, p. 16</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"crawford-p6\">{{ref|crawford-2019|\u03b6}} Crawford 2019, p. 6</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing 'War Effort', 'Conscription, 1941', '2nd Conscription Survey, February 1942', 'War Psychology, September 1942', 'Election Survey, May 1943', 'Wartime and Political Knowledge, December 1942', Box 78, Ashby Research Service records, c1937-c1972 MLMSS 8907, [[Mitchell Library]], [[State Library of New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016, p. 34; citing [[Mitchell Library]] Correspondence files, MLMSS 8907.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"routledge\">{{ref|crawford-routeledge-2016|\u03b4}} Crawford 2016; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"billashby\">[[State Library of New South Wales]], MLMSS 8907, Box 70, 'Letter from W.

9 September 1978) was a British-born Australian [[market researcher]] and founder of the Ashby Research Service. A pioneer in the field, she was the first female market researcher in Australia or the United Kingdom, and the first person to conduct an Australia-wide public opinion poll. Mentored by two of the finest market researchers of the day, she used her experience to great effect and steadily grew her business. During the [[Second World War]] her company experienced hardships due to a public that was suspicious of inquisitive representatives who would poll public sentiment about the war and the prime minister; in addition there was a reluctance among companies to spend money on market research, which they felt was unnecessary in a time of rationing. Nevertheless she came to the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who offered her the opportunity to set up Australia's first public-opinion research subsidiary. When Sir [[Frank Packer]] made a counter-offer she accepted, and made Ashby Research Services a subsidiary of [[Australian Consolidated Press]].\n\nAshby employed mainly women to survey housewives, who she considered to have great purchasing power, despite her view that most housewives were timid and shy creatures beholden to their husbands. After the war she continued innovative research, establishing the Ashby Consumer Panel, in which households maintained regular diaries that enabled her to gather continuous market research data. Toward the end of her life, Sir Frank Packer sold her back her company for the same price as he purchased it, before ailing health caused Ashby to sell her company to Beacon Research.\n\n==Early life==\nAshby was born on 08 June 1908 at New Sawley in [[Derbyshire]], England to Bertha, {{nee|Powell}}, and her husband, brickmaker Walter Bertrand Ashby. She was their fourth child; her siblings included Bertha Joan Prior and William Bertrand Ashby.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"billashby\"/><ref name=\"eldest-sister\"/> The family migrated to [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] in Melbourne when Ashby was five, and she was educated in Auburn, Hawthorn, and Camberwell state schools.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1923 Ashby started two years of training at a business college run by [[Frederick Zerko]],<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> after which she took up a secretarial job at [[J. Walter Thompson|J. Walter Thompson Australia Pty Ltd]] (colloquially known as JWT).<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> The company downsized considerably when it lost the [[General Motors]] account, due to the [[Great Depression]], and Ashby was relocated to the Sydney office. There she worked in the market research and psychology departments under [[Rudolph Simmat]],<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and by 1933 was [[Bill McNair|William McNair]]'s assistant.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Both Simmat and McNair gave her valuable experience and mentoring in market research; Simmat had authored one of the first studies into Australian market research,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> and McNair later formed the McNair Survey, a company that undertook major television and radio audience ratings surveys.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> In 1933 she resigned and moved to London,<ref name=\"women-in-sport\"/> where she worked first for the [[London Press Exchange]], and then for the Charles W. Hobson agency.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> Though the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'' notes that \"she spent much time reorganizing his library\",<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ashby found the contacts invaluable and the experience highly rewarding<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\"/>\u2014particularly in that it taught her \"to be always on the look-out for ideas for campaigns\".<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\"/> While in London she attended conferences and seminars in Europe and North America.<ref name=\"crawford-p6\"/> During this time she also worked with the German [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Ministry for Propaganda]], conducting research into how to improve relations between Britain and Germany, though when it was leaked to the public, sentiment was such that she immediately withdrew from that program.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/>\n\n==Formation of the Ashby Research Service==\n[[File:Mrs Right and Mrs Wrong - Sylvia Ashby.png|thumb|Sylvia Ashby showing the difference between \"Mrs. Right\" and \"Mrs. Wrong\"]]\nAshby returned to Sydney in 1936 and started her own business, the Ashby Research Service. Although she almost immediately secured a contract with an advertising agency to conduct a three-month-long survey of Melbourne's leading evening newspaper ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'',<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> it was nevertheless a difficult start. She later recounted that her initial problems were partly caused by \"business executives [who] appeared to know little and to care even less\" about market research;<ref name=\"routledge\"/> this was compounded by prevailing societal views of women, which were not positive toward women who ran their own business.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Yet Ashby became a tireless promoter of market research in a market that did not yet see the value of such research, let alone paying for it. In a profile for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' she was described as \"perhaps the only woman in Australia who has specialised in market research\".<ref name=\"smh-1937\"/> Ashby herself later declared that she was the only woman in the British Empire conducting an independent market research bureau.<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\"/> She persevered against the challenges, and within five years her clients included the [[Australian Gas Light Company]], Pick-me-up Condiment Co. Ltd,<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> the [[National Bank of Australasia]], Dunlop-Perdriau rubber goods, [[Bushells]], the ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'' and a number of advertising agencies.<ref name=\"crawford-p8\"/>\n\nAshby's method was to employ mainly women, who she believed were more conscientious and effective investigators than men. In particular she found female investigators \"much more patient with other women\", and that \"women will talk to another woman more freely\".<ref name=\"smh-1938\"/> She preferred unmarried women, as she believed that \"a single woman is better able to concentrate solely upon the problem on hand [and] has no home worries to distract her [and] has more time to keep herself physically fit\". Ashby essentially believed that unmarried women had \"a singleness of purpose denied to the married woman\".<ref name=\"unmarried-women-views\"/> She found focused interviews directly with housewives the most effective approach to market research. In a later interview with ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]'', she showed two small wooden, jointed [[mannequins]]\u2014one showing \"Mrs. Right\" and one \"Mrs. Wrong\". Mrs. Right, she explained, \"is erect, relaxed; the left arm (holding her bag and papers) is slightly to the rear; the right arm is forward; the head is slightly tilted\u2014she is the epitome of confidence.\" Mrs. Wrong \"is a bundle of nerves; head downcast, bag clutched to her\u2014the epitome of apologetic timidity.\" Those who displayed a lack of appropriate deportment, she maintained, would cause suspicion and sometimes hostility, and the interviewee would be unresponsive to questioning, leading to poor survey results.<ref name=\"womens-weekly-1961\"/>\n\n==Second World War==\nBy 1939 Britain had declared war on Germany. The [[Second World War]] caused major issues for a marketing research company that undertook direct interviews &mdash; quite a few of Ashby's researchers were reported by citizens suspicious of those asking questions during a time of war, and consequently they were detained by police. At one point Ashby herself was vigorously questioned over several hours by the police, who accused her of \"disloyalty\" and threatened her with arrest if she did not stop surveying popular opinion on the war and the [[Australian Prime Minister|Prime Minister]].<ref name=\"crawford-via-ashby\"/> Furthermore, rationing meant that firms were less concerned with marketing efforts as the availability of goods became more scarce and consumers were more likely to buy what they could find.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/> Despite this, she largely ignored the threats of the authorities and continued to conduct surveys on topics such as conscription, the war effort and war psychology.<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\"/>\n\nAshby hired John Stuart Lucy, a journalist from New Zealand, to help with her business. She later married him in 1939. Lucy was to later form a rival research firm, but this did not seem to cause any problems in the marriage &mdash; Ashby told ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' that \"we're rivals only in business. My husband completely approves of my career.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> She gave birth to a daughter, Susan, in 1940 and a son, Richard, in 1943.<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> Despite her previously expressed views on the capabilities of married women at work, the ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' notes that \"busy and ambitious as she was, Sylvia did not neglect her two children. On weekends her time was devoted to them; school holidays were enjoyed together, sometimes at 'the farm', her husband's property at Narrabeen. At home there was always a maid or housekeeper; Susan was sent to Frensham and Richard to Geelong Church of England Grammar School.\"<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\nHer wartime polling gained the attention of Sir [[Keith Murdoch]], who not only ran the ''[[Herald & Weekly Times]]'' but was also briefly Director-General of Information for the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] in 1940. Murdoch commissioned Ashby to run research into the war effort, and Ashby ran the first Australia-wide public opinion survey.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Murdoch later invited her to join him in establishing a public opinion subsidiary. Sir [[Frank Packer]], rival proprietor of [[Australian Consolidated Press]] (ACP), got wind of the offer however, and put in a counter offer to make the Ashby Research Service a subsidiary of ACP. As Ashby had done work for the ''Australian Women's Weekly'' before the war, she chose to accept Packer's offer over Murdoch's.<ref name=\"crawford-p9\"/> Murdoch then approached [[Roy Morgan Research|Roy Morgan]] to conduct opinion polling, and he organised the Australian Gallop Poll. From 1942 to 1944 the Ashby Research Service was renamed to the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, but was renamed back to the Ashby Research Service after the war ended.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' in her capacity as Director of the Daily Telegraph Research Bureau, Ashby caused a stir in July 1942 by proposing that the nation combine every two electorates and then subdivide them again into two electorates, to which women would elect a woman in one electorate, and men would elect a man in the second electorate. She felt this was necessary because \"some of those who aspire to leadership unfortunately appear to have the habit of drawing upon themselves most unfavourable publicity, which distresses the average woman, who at heart (although her husband never guesses it) is a timid and shy creature, full of complexes, which cause her to withdraw into herself at the slightest sign of any thing in the nature of a public brawl.\" By allowing each citizen to only vote for their own gender, Ashby believed this would encourage a better class of female candidate and women would become more politically engaged.<ref name=\"ashby-vote-proposal\"/>\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the Second World War ended, the Ashby Research Service saw a resurgence in business: surveys in 1945 included 14 for clients and 30 for ACP; in 1946 the number of surveys rose significantly, to 30 and 42 respectively.<ref name=\"postwar-surveys\"/> But the war had shown Ashby that revenue could be affected by external events; so she decided to conduct ongoing research surveys alongside her commissioned research to build up her existing data and attract new work. To this end, in 1945 she established the Ashby Consumer Panel as a trial in NSW and rolled out Australia-wide in 1947. The panel directly polled households through diaries of their buying habits. Householders would return from shopping and record their purchases and observations directly into an Ashby Consumer Purchase Record. By 1964 the Ashby Research Service boasted in an advertisement that 6165 households (containing 18,192 individuals) were keeping day-to-day records for the Service. To maintain quality, 237 regular employees inspected the logs, which were then sampled for checking by supervisors. The advertisement claimed that it was \"the largest survey-group permanently employed in the South Hemisphere\".<ref name=\"newspaper-news-advert\"/> Households were not paid, but received a subscription to ''The Women's Weekly''.<ref name=\"dict-sydney\"/>\n\nBecause it was important to maintain credibility and relevance, the Ashby Research Service maintained a statistical library, managed by their professional statisticians. Australia's post-war relaxation of immigration policies encouraged workers from Europe to emigrate to Australia, so Ashby's service employed workers who spoke a variety of European languages to ensure the consistency and accuracy of their data.<ref name=\"crawford-p13\"/> She also regularly requested new equipment from Packer, including an electric calculator and a punching machine,<ref name=\"popcaanz\"/> in light of this influx and the more general [[Mid-twentieth century baby boom|post-war population boom]]. \n\nBetween September to November 1953 Ashby undertook an overseas business trip to the UK and the US. This caused ructions with the notoriously tight-fisted Packer, who did not necessarily believe in the benefits of such a trip. In a letter to Packer in June 1953, she argued forcefully for the trip, writing:\n\n{{quote|Mr Packer ... it is essential that we keep up with movements in the technique of Market Research, and it is also essential for our prestige that I go overseas. The twelve years in your employ is a long time to \u2018stay put\u2019 ... and when other Research people are constantly coming and going ... After ten years of most profitable operation, through lack of co-operation from Consolidated Press, the Ashby Research Service latterly has been hindered from progressing ... . Periodical overseas visits are essential to a Director of Market Research and this was discussed prior to the signing of my initial contract.<ref name=\"letter-packer-overseas-travel\"/>}}\n\nHer travels impressed on her that her work was first class and ahead of the rest of the world. ''The Argus'' reported that during her 1953 overseas trip \"she tried to find a woman counterpart, 'But without success, I'm afraid. It seems I'm quite unique'.\"<ref name=\"the-argus-1953\"/> On a 1958 business trip she was unimpressed with the work of [[Johnson & Johnson]]'s consumer panels and noted that Alfred Politz Research Inc.\u2014a leading market research company based in [[Manhattan]]\u2014did not conduct audits and \"do not provide anything resembling a standardised service\".<ref name=\"crawford-p17\"/>\n\nAs the success of the Ashby Research Service grew, so too did their competition. Profits decreased between 1965 to 1966, and in 1968 the firm recorded a loss. This caused ACP to demand a full audit; but Ashby put together a strident defence, pointing out that it was the only time in the subsidiary's history that their expenditure exceeded their revenue. She referred to a particularly problematic client and the costs of using a computer. To her frustration, Ashby found that her subsidiary was being underused by ACP, and regularly wrote to Packer to suggest ways of using her services.<ref name=\"crawford-p18-19\"/>\n\n==Australian Research Service buy-back and death==\nIn 1974, both Packer and Ashby were looking to retire. In a magnanimous gesture to Ashby, Packer sold the Ashby Research Service back to her for the same amount that he had paid for it in 1941 &mdash; $2,800.<ref name=\"crawford-p21\"/> Ashby, who was by this time becoming very ill, sold the business to Beacon Research Co. Pty Ltd.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> As her health continued to fail, she became confined to a wheelchair, before finally dying of cancer on 9 September 1978 at [[Palm Beach, New South Wales]] and was cremated.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://trove.nla.gov.au/people/1471050?c=people Sylvia Rose Ashby] - [[Trove Australia]]\n* [http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110314880 Ashby Research Service records, ca. 19] - Archives [[State Library of NSW]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|goot-1993|\u03b7}} Goot, 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"eldest-sister\">{{ref|table-talk-1929|\u03be}} ''Table Talk'' 1929, p. 64</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dict-sydney\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"children\">{{ref|weekly-times-1946|\u03bf}}''Weekly Times'' 1946, p. 26</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"daily-examiner-1939\">{{ref|daily-examiner-1939|\u03ba}} ''Daily Examiner'' 1939, p. 4</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"women-in-sport\">{{ref|daily-telegraph|1934|\u03bb}} ''The Daily Telegraph'' 1934, p. 16</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"crawford-p6\">{{ref|crawford-2019|\u03b6}} Crawford 2019, p. 6</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsyd-via-mcnair\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dictsydney-via-ashbyrecords\">{{ref|crawford-dictsyd-2018|\u03b5}} Crawford 2018; citing 'War Effort', 'Conscription, 1941', '2nd Conscription Survey, February 1942', 'War Psychology, September 1942', 'Election Survey, May 1943', 'Wartime and Political Knowledge, December 1942', Box 78, Ashby Research Service records, c1937-c1972 MLMSS 8907, [[Mitchell Library]], [[State Library of New South Wales]]</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"popcaanz-via-corresp\">{{ref|riley-2016|\u03b8}} Riley 2016, p. 34; citing [[Mitchell Library]] Correspondence files, MLMSS 8907.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"routledge\">{{ref|crawford-routeledge-2016|\u03b4}} Crawford 2016; citing {{ref|ashby-1979|\u03b3}} Ashby 1979, pp. 8&ndash;9</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"billashby\">[[State Library of New South Wales]], MLMSS 8907, Box 70, 'Letter from W.

Prince Yi Kang was not the [[Crown Prince]], even though he was older than his brother [[Yi Un|Prince Imperial Yeong]], due to the status of his mother.\n\nHe was only recognized as a legitimate prince with the name of Yi Kang and was titled Prince Uihwa with the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'' in 1891, following a decree issued by his father. He married Lady [[Gim Sudeok]], later known as the Princess Duk-in (22 December 1879 &ndash; 14 January 1964), a daughter of 1st [[Baron]] Gim Sajun.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Education and early life===\nPrince Yi Kang was appointed special ambassador to the Empire of Japan for the celebration ceremonies for Japan's victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894-1895.  The next year, he visited six [[Europe]]an countries as an ambassador extraordinary: the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. In 1899, he studied for a year at [[Keio University]] in Tokyo. He was promoted to the rank of Prince Imperial Eui, and styled ''[[His Imperial Highness]]'' the same year.\nIn 1900, he went to the [[United States]] and began studies at [[Roanoke College]] in [[Salem, Virginia]] from March 1901, where he majored in mathematics. After graduation, he spent a brief period at the [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]], and then travelled to [[San Francisco]] and [[Hawaii]], returning to Korea in 1905. While in the United States, he scandalized the Korean government with his profligate spending and playboy lifestyle.\n\nPrince Yi Kang served as the president of the [[Red Cross|Korean Red Cross]] from 1906 to 1910.\n\n===Under Japanese rule===\nFollowing the abdication of [[Gojong of Korea|King Gojong]] in 1907, and the [[Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910]] by which Korea was annexed to the Empire of Japan, Prince Yi Kang grew increasingly dissatisfied with his status, even though the Japanese provided him with a huge annual allowance.\n\nIn 1919, he collaborated with Choe Ik-hwan, a member of Daedongdan, who attempted to support him as the new leader of Korea.  Prince Yi Kang then tried to escape to the [[Provisional Government of Korea]] based in Shanghai, which was only lukewarm to receiving him due to their republican sympathies. Prince Yi Kang was discovered in [[Dandong]] [[Manchuria]] and returned to his home country. After this, he cooperated and supported the Japanese government's occupation of Korea, and had continued this support until the end of the war.\n\nAfter the independence of Korea, he continued to live in [[Seoul]], but in increasing poverty. On August 9, 1955 he was baptized a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], given the Christian name of Pius, and died a week later on August 15, 1955, at the age of 78, at Seongrak Manor, Seongbuk-dong, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, and is buried at Hongyu-reung in [[Namyangju|Namyang-ju]] near Seoul.\n\n==Children==\nPrince Yi Gang, a man with an active personality and handsome features, had 14 concubines in addition to his official wife, Princess Duk-in.

It will assess the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal plasma and magnetic field, the energy flow that heats the solar corona and impels the solar wind, and the mechanisms that accelerate energetic particles.\n\nThe spacecraft's systems are protected from the extreme heat and radiation near the [[Sun]] by a solar shield. Incident solar radiation at perihelion is approximately {{val|{{#expr:475*1.361 round -1}}|u=kW|up=m2}}, or 475 times the [[solar constant|intensity at Earth orbit]].{{r|extreme|Fox 2016|p2=31}} The solar shield is hexagonal, mounted on the Sun-facing side of the spacecraft, {{cvt|2.3|m|ft}} in diameter,{{r|jhuapl}} {{cvt|11.4|cm}} thick, and is made of [[reinforced carbon\u2013carbon]] composite, which is designed to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft of about {{cvt|2500|F|C|order=flip}}.<ref name=extreme />\n\n[[File:Parker Solar Probe.webm|thumb|right|The NASA's ''Parker Solar Probe'' during extensive environmental testing.]]\nA white reflective [[alumina]] surface layer minimizes absorption. The spacecraft systems and [[scientific instruments]] are located in the central portion of the shield's shadow, where direct radiation from the Sun is fully blocked. If the shield were not between the spacecraft and the Sun, the probe would be damaged and become inoperative within tens of seconds. As radio communication with Earth will take about eight minutes in each direction, the ''Parker Solar Probe'' will have to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself. This will be done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct [[sunlight]] coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from [[reaction wheels]] to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again. According to project scientist Nicky Fox, the team describe it as \"the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown\".{{r|bbc22jl18}}\n\nThe primary power for the mission is a dual system of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] ([[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic arrays]]). A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside {{Val|0.25|u=au}}, is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach. This secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain [[operating temperature]] of the solar panels and instrumentation.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20090004577.pdf|title=Solar Power System Design for the Solar Probe+ Mission|conference=6th International Energy Conversion Engineering Conference |location=Cleveland, Ohio.|first1=Geoffrey A.|last1=Landis|first2=Paul C.|last2=Schmitz|first3=James|last3=Kinnison|first4=Martin|last4=Fraeman|first5=Lew|last5=Roufberg|first6=Steve|last6=Vernon |first7=Melissa |last7=Wirzburger|display-authors=1|date=July 28\u201330, 2008|id=AIAA 2008-5712}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techexplorist.com/traveling-sun-parker-solar-probe-melt/15586/ |title=Traveling to the Sun: Why won't Parker Solar Probe melt?|first=Pranjal|last=Mehar|website=Tech Explorist|date=July 20, 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Trajectory ==\n[[File:Animation of Parker Solar Probe trajectory.gif|thumb|right|An animation of ''Parker Solar Probe''{{'s}} trajectory from August 7, 2018 to August 29, 2025:<br/>{{legend2|magenta|''Parker Solar Probe''}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Yellow|[[Sun]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Lime|[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|[[Venus]]}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|RoyalBlue|[[Earth]]}}<br/>For more detailed animation, see [[:File:Animation of Parker Solar Probe trajectory.webm|this video.]]]]\n\nThe ''Parker Solar Probe'' mission design uses repeated [[gravity assist]]s at Venus to incrementally decrease its orbital [[perihelion]] to achieve a final altitude (above the surface) of approximately 8.5 solar radii, or about {{cvt|6|e6km|e6mi+au}}.<ref name=jhuapl>{{cite web|title=Solar Probe Plus: A NASA Mission to Touch the Sun|url=http://solarprobe.jhuapl.edu/|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory|date=September 4, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref> The spacecraft trajectory will include seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its elliptical orbit around the Sun, for a total of 24 orbits.{{r|extreme}} The near Sun radiation environment is predicted to cause spacecraft charging effects, radiation damage in materials and electronics, and communication interruptions, so the orbit will be highly elliptical with short times spent near the Sun.{{r|Fox 2016}}\n\nThe trajectory requires high launch energy, so the probe was launched on a [[Delta IV Heavy]] class [[launch vehicle]] and an upper stage based on the [[STAR-48|STAR 48BV]] solid rocket motor.{{r|Fox 2016}} Interplanetary [[gravity assist]]s will provide further deceleration relative to its [[heliocentric orbit]], which will result in a heliocentric speed record at [[perihelion]].{{r|Delta 4}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Scharf|first1=Caleb A.|title=The Fastest Spacecraft Ever?|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/life-unbounded/the-fastest-spacecraft-ever/|website=Scientific American Blog Network|language=en}}</ref> As the probe passes around the [[Sun]], it will achieve a velocity of up to {{cvt|200|km/s}}, which will temporarily make it the fastest human-made object, almost three times as fast as the previous record holder, [[Helios (spacecraft)#Helios-B|Helios-2]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/performance/q0023.shtml|title=Aircraft Speed Records|last=|first=|date=November 13, 2014 |website=Aerospaceweb.org|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66135-fastest-spacecraft-speed|title=Fastest spacecraft speed|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2015|website=guinnessworldrecords.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219024804/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66135-fastest-spacecraft-speed |archive-date=December 19, 2016 |url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Parker Solar Probe \u2013 Check123, Video Encyclopedia|url=https://www.check123.com/videos/13450-parker-solar-probe|language=en|accessdate=June 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810211059/https://www.check123.com/videos/13450-parker-solar-probe|archive-date=August 10, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Like every object in an orbit, due to gravity the spacecraft will accelerate as it nears perihelion, then slow down again afterward until it reaches its [[aphelion]].\n\n==Mission==\n[[File:Parker Solar Probe Launch (NHQ201808120013).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Launch of ''Parker Solar Probe'' in 2018.]]\n[[File:Magnificent CME Erupts on the Sun - August 31.jpg|thumb|The overall goal is to increase understanding of Earth's star, the Sun{{mdash}} an astronomical body of immense impact on the Earth and the Solar System due to its release of light and solar wind, in addition to its large gravity.

On the second flyby, the period shortens to 130 days. After less than two orbits (only 198 days later) it encounters Venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of Venus. This encounter shortens its period to half of that of Venus, or about 112.5 days. After two orbits it meets Venus a fourth time at about the same place, shortening its period to about 102 days. After 237 days it meets Venus for the fifth time and its period is shortened to about 96 days, three-sevenths that of Venus. It then makes seven orbits while Venus makes three. The sixth encounter, almost two years after the fifth, brings its period down to 92 days, two-fifths that of Venus. After five more orbits (two orbits of Venus) it meets Venus for the seventh and last time, decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the Sun.<ref name=the_mission>See data and figure at {{cite web |url=http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Journey-to-the-Sun |title=Solar Probe Plus: The Mission |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image |Velocity of Parker Solar Probe wide.svg |900px |The speed of the probe and distance from the Sun, from launch until 2026.

As radio communication with Earth will take about eight minutes in each direction, the ''Parker Solar Probe'' will have to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself. This will be done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct [[sunlight]] coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from [[reaction wheels]] to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again. According to project scientist Nicky Fox, the team describe it as \"the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown\".{{r|bbc22jl18}}\n\nThe primary power for the mission is a dual system of [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] ([[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic arrays]]). A primary photovoltaic array, used for the portion of the mission outside {{Val|0.25|u=au}}, is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the Sun, and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach.

Second, even when the probe is not particularly near the Sun, when the angle between the probe and the Sun (as seen from Earth) is too small, the Sun's radiation will overwhelm the communication link.<ref name=\"mission design\"/>{{rp|11\u201314}}\n\n== Science goals ==\n[[File:Sun's Apparent Size as Seen From Earth vs From Solar Probe Plus's orbit.png|thumb|An apparent size of the Sun as seen from ''Parker Solar Probe'' at perihelion compared to its apparent size seen from Earth.]]\nThe goals of the mission are:<ref name=\"Fox 2016\">{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=N.J.|last2=Velli|first2=M.C.|last3=Bale|first3=S.D.|last4=Decker|first4=R.|last5=Driesman|first5=A.|last6=Howard|first6=R.A. |last7=Kasper|first7=J.C.|last8=Kinnison|first8=J.|last9=Kusterer|first9=M.|first10=D.|last10=Lario|first11=M.K.|last11=Lockwood|first12=D.J.|last12=McComas|first13=N.E.|last13=Raouafi|first14=A.|last14=Szabo|date=November 11, 2015|title=The Solar Probe Plus Mission: Humanity's First Visit to Our Star|journal=Space Science Reviews|language=en|volume=204|issue=1\u20134|pages=7\u201348|doi=10.1007/s11214-015-0211-6 |issn=0038-6308|bibcode=2016SSRv..204....7F}}</ref>\n* Trace the flow of energy that heats the [[corona]] and accelerates the [[solar wind]]\n* Determine the structure and dynamics of the [[Sun#Magnetic field|magnetic fields]] at the sources of solar wind\n* Determine what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles\n\n===Investigations===\n[[File:Parker Solar Probe preparation of the Energetic Particle Instrument-Low Energy (EPI-Lo).jpg|thumb|The EPI-Lo instrument for [[Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun|IS\u2609IS]] is prepared.]]\nTo achieve these goals, the mission will perform five major experiments or investigations:<ref name=\"Fox 2016\"/>\n* Electromagnetic Fields Investigation ('''[[FIELDS]]'''){{snd}}This investigation will make direct measurements of [[Electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, radio waves, [[Poynting vector|Poynting flux]], absolute [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] density, and [[electron temperature]].

On the second flyby, the period shortens to 130 days. After less than two orbits (only 198 days later) it encounters Venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of Venus. This encounter shortens its period to half of that of Venus, or about 112.5 days. After two orbits it meets Venus a fourth time at about the same place, shortening its period to about 102 days. After 237 days it meets Venus for the fifth time and its period is shortened to about 96 days, three-sevenths that of Venus. It then makes seven orbits while Venus makes three. The sixth encounter, almost two years after the fifth, brings its period down to 92 days, two-fifths that of Venus. After five more orbits (two orbits of Venus) it meets Venus for the seventh and last time, decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the Sun.<ref name=the_mission>See data and figure at {{cite web |url=http://parkersolarprobe.jhuapl.edu/The-Mission/index.php#Journey-to-the-Sun |title=Solar Probe Plus: The Mission |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image |Velocity of Parker Solar Probe wide.svg |900px |The speed of the probe and distance from the Sun, from launch until 2026.

Clockwise from top: Ainz, Demiurge, Sebas, Albedo and Cocytus, Shalltear, Mare, and Aura.}}\nThis is a list of characters appearing in the novel series ''[[Overlord (novel series)|Overlord]]'', written by Kugane Maruyama and illustrated by so-bin, and its [[anime]] and [[manga]] adaptations.\n\n==Great Tomb of Nazarick==\nThe {{Nihongo|Great Tomb of Nazarick|\u30ca\u30b6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af \u5730\u4e0b\u5927\u58b3\u5893|Nazarikku Chika Dai Funbo}}, usually referred to as Nazarick, is the guild headquarters of the guild {{Nihongo|Ainz Ooal Gown|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} in YGGDRASIL. Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in Yggdrasil, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in Yggdrasil, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:The overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him and has attempted to seduce and even rape him on multiple occasions. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She also harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving her and the other NPCs. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful vampire girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a demon dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. They also often serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians. While they must follow the commands of their respective floor Guardian while outside their specific area, they answer only to Ainz while within it.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing him to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\". It is a parasitic creature, using humans as a \"House\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neuronist Painkill|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30eb|\nNy\u016bronisuto Peinkiru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] (anime)|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}\n:Nazarick's Special Intelligence Investigator in charge of interrogating and torturing prisoners and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Occupation\". She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the throne room. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World. Also, despite their appearances, they actually have no skills as maids.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's a werewolf in human form and serves as the group's healer. In public, she is a sociable and friendly person who likes to make lewd jokes. However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form. Instead, she is the strongest of the Pleiades, being a magic caster that specializes in lightning spells. She serves as Ainz' companion while under his \"Momon\" identity, going by the alias {{Nihongo|Nabe|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9|N\u0101be}}. However, she despises and looks down on humans, which often causes trouble for him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|CZ2128 Delta|\u30b7\u30ba\u30fb\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf|Shizu Deruta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Seto]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Michelle Rojas]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's an automaton who fights using guns and war knives. While silent and emotionless, she holds no particular dislike towards humans.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Solution Epsilon|\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30fb\u30a4\u30d7\u30b7\u30ed\u30f3|Soryushan Ipushiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayane Sakura]] (drama CD, anime)|Mallorie Rodak}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Slime that takes on a human form. She is an assassin and can absorb people and objects into her body to be stored or devoured. Being a Slime, she preys on humans and generally despises and looks down on them.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Entoma Vasilissa Zeta|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c8\u30de\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30b7\u30ea\u30c3\u30b5\u30fb\u30bc\u30fc\u30bf|Entoma Vuashirissa Z\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kei Shindo]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Tia Ballard]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is an Insectoid who disguises herself as a human by wearing a mask and changing her voice. She is an entomancer, being able to summon fellow Insectoids. Being an Insectoid, she preys on humans when hungry, but otherwise doesn't consider them worth her attention. She harbors a grudge towards Evileye from the Adventurer Group Blue Rose, who defeated and humiliated her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aureole Omega|\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30aa\u30e1\u30ac|\u014cre\u014dru Omega}}\n:The leader of Pleiades and the Area Guardian of the region known as the Cherry Blossom Sanctuary. Due to her dual positions, she is unable to lead the group most of the time, causing Yuri Alpha to serve as leader in her stead. She is in charge of Nazarick's Teleportation Gates. She stated to be to only Human NPC in Nazarick. However, most don't consider her human due to her being immortal. Ainz seems to trust her a great deal, entrusting her with the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown whenever he leaves Nazarick.\n\n===Others===\n;{{nihongo|Pestonya Shortcake Wanko|\u30da\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30fb\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3|Pesut\u014dnya Sh\u014dtok\u0113ki Wanko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]|[[Jamie Marchi]]}}\n:The Head-Maid of Nazarick. She has the body of a human but the head of a Shetland Sheepdog with a vertical scar on her face running down the center of her face. She harbors no dislike towards human and is even willing to rescue them from her fellow NPCs' cruelty.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Eclair Ecleir Eicler|\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fb\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30a8\u30a4\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fc|\nEkurea Ekur\u0113ru Eikure\u0101}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nobuyuki Hiyama]]|Kyle Phillips}}\n:The assistant butler of Nazarick. He takes on the form of an emperor penguin with a superiority complex. He has been programmed with a desire to overthrow Ainz and take over Nazarick as a gag by his creator. The other NPCs are fully aware of this, but they don't care as he poses no threat and they know it is just a part of his settings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nigredo|\u30cb\u30b0\u30ec\u30c9|Niguredo}}\n:The older sister of Albedo, being created by the same creator. She specializes in information gathering. While she bears some similarity to Albedo, her face has no skin, resulting in a twisted appearance. Her mind is similarly broken, unless a baby-doll is given to her. However, while she has a body-doll, is actually one of the few NPCs of Nazarick that is genuinely kind-hearted. Despite being polar opposites in appearance and personality, she and Albedo generally get along just fine.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rubedo|\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|\nRubedo}}\n:The Younger sister of Albedo and Nigredo, being created by the same creator. She is the strongest NPC in Nazarick. Not much is known about her, but Albedo loves her while Nigredo fears her.\n==New World==\nThe New World is the world where Nazarick was transported to. There seems to be some sort of connection between this world and \"YGGDRASIL\", as it is implied that Players from the game are transported to it every couple of centuries. The world once had its own form of magic known as \"Wild Magic\". However, after Players introduced their \"Tier Magic\", it became more and more scarce. This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence. While Ainz obtained the loyalty of the world's inhabitants though mostly peaceful methods, the NPCs violently conquered any territory they laid their eyes on.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hamsuke/The Wise King of the Forest|\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30b1|Hamusuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akeno Watanabe]] (drama CD, anime)|Heather Walker}}\n:A giant female Hamster with a snake-like tail that lived in the forest near Carne Village. She was thought to be the strongest beast among the forest denizens. While publicly known as \"The Wise King of the Forest\", she's actually more-or-less a dense idiot, though she is capable of human speech. Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame.

He first met Ainz while investigating the destruction of several villages and came to greatly respect him due to him saving Carne Village. Unfortunately, they later became enemies when the Kingdom and Nazarick went to war with each other. He challenged Ainz to a one-on-one duel where the latter reluctantly killed him.

He regains his will, when he sees Climb, withstand the intense killing intent from Sebas, understanding that humans can still change and become stronger.

Upon meeting Ainz, she became infatuated by his belief that strength is required to protect others and she later becomes his guard after he agrees to aid the Holy Kingdom. During her service to him, Ainz lent her high-level equipment, causing her to be central in liberating the Northern Holy Kingdom. After the liberation, she became the leader of a cult that worships Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Remedios Custodio|\u30ec\u30e1\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30b9\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Remediosu Kasutodio}}\n:The former bodyguard of the late Holy Queen Calca as well as the elder sister of High-Priestess Kelart and the grandmaster of the Paladin Order. She is also a member of the Nine Colors, holding the title of 'White'. She is highly self-righteous and driven mainly by her emotions, which often prevents her from making tough decisions and makes her a general inconvenience to others. After the fall of the Northern Holy Kingdom, she became a captain in the 'Holy Kingdom Liberation Army'. She holds prejudice towards demi-humans and distrusts Ainz, due to his undead nature, which only grows worse as he earns the citizens' trust. After the liberation, the new Holy King, Caspond, has her demoted.\n\n====Paladin Order====\nThe Paladin Order is the highest knight order in the Holy Kingdom, which its members specializing in both swordsmanship and magic.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gustav Montagn\u00e9s|\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fb\u30e2\u30f3\u30bf\u30cb\u30a7\u30b9|Gusut\u0101bo Montanyesu}}\n:An adjudant of the Paladin Order. Unlike his superior, Remedios, he is a realist who is willing to compromise on his ideals if necessary. Due to this, he often serves as an adviser as well as a voice of reason to her. After the liberation, the new Holy King, Caspond, promotes him to grandmaster of the order, taking Remedios' place\n\n====Hoburns====\n{{Nihongo|Hoburns|\u30db\u30d0\u30f3\u30b9|Hobansu}} is the capital of the Holy Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Calca Bessarez|\u30ab\u30eb\u30ab\u30fb\u30d9\u30b5\u30fc\u30ec\u30b9|Karuka Bes\u0101resu}}\n:The former Holy Queen of the Holy Kingdom as well as the first female monarch in the nation's history. She cared deeply about the well-being of her nation and people and her kindness even extended to non-violent Demi-Humans. She was also a divine-magic prodigy. When Jaldabaoth attacked the Holy Kingdom, she personally faced him.

Despite being the elder brother, he gave up his claim to the throne. After Jaldabaoth laid siege to the Northern Holy Kingdom, he was taken prisoner by Demi-Humans until he was rescued by the \"Holy Kingdom Liberation Army\". Afterwards, he took command of the Liberation Army and led it to victory. Unbeknownst to the public, however, the 'real' Caspond is long dead, replaced by a D\u00f6ppelganger serving Demiurge and is currently working to destabilize the Holy Kingdom.\n\n====Temple of the Four Great Gods====\nThe Temple of the Four Great Gods is the primary religious institution of the Holy Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kelart Custodio|\u30b1\u30e9\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Keraruto Kasutodio}}\n:The High Priestess of Holy Kingdom and younger sister of Remedios. She is similar to her sister, but calmer. She is also a powerful magic caster by New World standards. When Jaldabaoth attacked the Holy Kingdom, she was by Holy Queen Calca's side as she faced him, but they were defeated and she was killed. Her head was later taken by a demon and used for magic, before the demon was defeated by Neia and CZ.\n\n====Nine Colors====\nThe {{Nihongo|Nine Colors|\u4e5d\u8272|Ky\u016b-shoku}} is a group of individuals who's skills were recognized by the Holy Kingdom.

At least two of members, including the leader, were Players from YGGDRASIL. Also, despite the name, there were actually more than thirteen members. However, the others were non-humans and thus weren't honored.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rigrit Bers Caurau|\u30ea\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30b9\u30fc\u30fb\u30ab\u30a6\u30e9\u30a6|Riguritto Berus\u016b Kaurau}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Masako Nozawa]]|[[Wendy Powell]]}}\n:A member of the Thirteen Heroes 200 years ago. She is a Necromancer who used her abilities to extend her life beyond natural limits. Despite her age, she maintains a cheerful and mischievous personality. She was also a member of Blue Rose for a while, being the one who transformed it into a top-ranked Adventurer group, but retired and forced Evileye to take her place on the team. She sees Nazarick as a great threat to the New World.\n\n====Dragon Lords====\n{{Nihongo|Dragon Lord|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9|Doragonr\u014ddo}} is a title for the most powerful dragons in the New World. As dragons are the strongest species, Dragon Lords are the strongest beings in the New World. However, around 500 years ago, they went to war with the YGGDRASIL players known as the {{Nihongo|Eight Greed Kings|\u516b\u6b32\u738b|Hachiyoku-o}} and lost, resulting in their kind being reduced to a handful.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tsaindorcus Vaision|\u30c4\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\uff1d\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3|Tsuaindorukusu vuaishion}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Jin Yamanoi]]|[[R.

Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in Yggdrasil, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in Yggdrasil, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:The overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him and has attempted to seduce and even rape him on multiple occasions. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She also harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving her and the other NPCs. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful vampire girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a demon dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. They also often serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians. While they must follow the commands of their respective floor Guardian while outside their specific area, they answer only to Ainz while within it.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing him to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\". It is a parasitic creature, using humans as a \"House\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neuronist Painkill|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30eb|\nNy\u016bronisuto Peinkiru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] (anime)|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}\n:Nazarick's Special Intelligence Investigator in charge of interrogating and torturing prisoners and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Occupation\". She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the throne room. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World. Also, despite their appearances, they actually have no skills as maids.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's a werewolf in human form and serves as the group's healer. In public, she is a sociable and friendly person who likes to make lewd jokes. However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form.

This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence.

Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame. Upon finding her, however, he is extremely disappointed, not understanding what others see in her, and proceeds to easily defeat her. He then promptly tames her and names her \"Hamsuke\". She then joins Ainz's adventurer group as his registered beast and totally devotes herself to him. While initially arrogant due to being strong by the New World's standards, upon meeting Nazarick's NPCs she realizes her weakness and devotes herself to becoming stronger.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tuareninya Veyron|\u30c4\u30a2\u30ec\u30cb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3|Tsuaren\u012bnya Beiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]] (Japanese)|Rachel Glass}}\n:Nazarick's newest apprentice-maid under Sebas Tian's supervision.

Learning about Ainz didn't change her feelings towards Sebas, however, as she was willing to let him kill her to prove his loyalty. Luckily, this was merely a test and her life was spared.

He manages to create a Purple potion, out of materials from Nazarick and the new world, which works better than the blue potion but still less than Yggdrasil's Red Potion.

She also joins the Villagers in fighting against the Kingdom and for Ainz in the 9th Novel.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lizzie Bareare|\u30ea\u30a3\u30b8\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30a2\u30ec|Ryij\u012b Bareare}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ikuko Tani]] (anime)|[[Juli Erickson]]}}\n:Nfirea's grandmother, considered the best pharmacist in E-Rantel.

In response, the tribes formed an alliance, but were defeated.

They eventually become closer and marry and even have a son, who is an albino. She becomes a representative for the Lizard people, after the fight against Cocytus. She meets Ainz, talking to him in fear and respect, and he offers to bring back Zaryusu in return for her acting as an informant to him, for any sign of rebellion. She is the most powerful magic caster among the lizardmen, but due to her skin, she is extremely vulnerable to the sun, making her wear a ridiculous bush outfit whenever she goes out in the day.

However, his scheme was seen through and he was forced to travel to the tomb to apologize to Ainz. Upon seeing the power of Nazarick, he proposed an alliance to prevent them from attacking the Empire. He planned on forming an alliance with the other human nations against Nazarick, but they abandoned him. Afterwards, the Emperor gave up and submitted to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Fluder Paradyne|\u30d5\u30fc\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30fb\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30f3|F\u016br\u016bda Paradain}}\n:{{voiced by|Takaya Hashi|Kenny Green}}\n:The imperial court wizard of the Empire and one of the strongest Magic casters in the New World.

Unlike most dragons, who are brute and violent, he has a more scholarly in attitude. Due to constant reading, he has weak eyesight, causing him to wear a pair of spectacles. He is also fat and timid to the point of cowardness. When Ainz invaded his family's home, he was sent by his father to stop him. However, he realized that there was no match for the undead and surrendered. He then swore loyalty to him and is given to Aura as a pet.

When Aura and Shalltear appeared before him and told him to surrender, the king was too stunted by the seemingly ridiculous demand to answer.

This model works well for the description of a number of plasma structures observed in the solar corona: e.g. [[coronal loops]], prominence fibrils, plumes, various filaments. Such a structure acts as a [[waveguide]] of MHD waves.\n\nThis discussion is adapted from Nakariakov & Verwichte (2009).<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Nakariakov |first1=V.

These modes are weakly [[compressibility|compressible]], but could nevertheless be observed with imaging instruments as periodic standing or propagating displacements of coronal structures, e.g. [[coronal loop]]s. The frequency of transverse or \"kink\" modes is given by the following expression:\n\n:<math>\\omega_{K}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_{z}B^{2}}{\\mu(\\rho_{i}+\\rho_{e})}}</math>\n\nFor kink modes the parameter the azimuthal wave number in a cylindrical model of a loop, <math>m</math> is equal to 1, meaning that the cylinder is swaying with fixed ends.\n\n* Sausage modes, which are also oblique fast magnetoacoustic waves guided by the plasma structure; the mode causes expansions and contractions of the plasma structure, but does not displace its axis. These modes are compressible and cause significant variation of the absolute value of the magnetic field in the oscillating structure. The frequency of sausage modes is given by the following expression:\n\n:<math>\\omega_{S}=\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{z}^{2}B^{2}}{\\mu\\rho_{e}}}</math>\n\nFor sausage modes the parameter <math>m</math> is equal to 0; this would be interpreted as a \"breathing\" in and out, again with fixed endpoints.\n\n* Longitudinal (or slow, or [[Acoustics|acoustic]]) modes, which are slow magnetoacoustic waves propagating mainly along the magnetic field in the plasma structure; these mode are essentially compressible. The magnetic field [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]] in these modes is negligible. The frequency of slow modes is given by the following expression:\n\n:<math>\\omega_{L}=\\sqrt{k^{2}_{z}\\left ( \\frac{C_{s}^{2}C_{A}^{2}}{C_{s}^{2}+C_{A}^{2}} \\right )}</math>\n\nWhere we define <math>C_{s}</math> as the [[sound speed]] and <math>C_{A}</math> as the [[Alfv\u00e9n wave#Alfv\u00e9n velocity|Alfv\u00e9n velocity]].\n\n* Torsional ([[Alfv\u00e9n wave|Alfv\u00e9n]] or twist) modes are incompressible transverse perturbations of the magnetic field along certain individual magnetic surfaces. In contrast with kink modes, torsional modes cannot be observed with imaging instruments, as they do not cause the displacement of either the structure axis or its boundary.\n\n:<math>\\omega_{A}=\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{z}^{2}B^{2}}{\\mu\\rho_{i}}}</math>\n\n==Observations==\n[[Image:Coronal_arcade.png|thumb|alt=coronal arcade after flare|TRACE image of a coronal arcade]]\nWave and oscillatory phenomena are observed in the hot plasma of the corona mainly in EUV, optical and microwave bands with a number of spaceborne and ground-based instruments, e.g. the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO), the [[Transition Region and Coronal Explorer]] (TRACE), the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH, see the [[Nobeyama radio observatory]]). Phenomenologically, researchers distinguish between compressible waves in polar plumes and in legs of large [[coronal loops]], flare-generated transverse oscillations of loops, acoustic oscillations of loops, propagating kink waves in loops and in structures above arcades (an '''arcade''' being a close collection of loops in a cylindrical structure, see image to right), sausage oscillations of flaring loops, and oscillations of prominences and fibrils (see [[solar prominence]]), and this list is continuously updated.\n\nCoronal seismology is one of the aims of the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory#Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)|Atmospheric Imaging Assembly]] (AIA) instrument on the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO) mission.\n\nA mission to send a spacecraft as close as 9 solar radii from the sun, [[Parker Solar Probe]], is planned for launch in 2015 and aims to provide in-situ measurements of the solar magnetic field, solar wind and corona. It should include a magnetometer and plasma wave sensor, allowing unprecedented observations for coronal seismology.\n\n==Conclusions==\nThe potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal [[magnetic field]], density [[scale height]], \"fine structure\" (by which is meant the variation in structure of an inhomogeneous structure such as an inhomogeneous coronal loop) and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups. Work relating to the coronal magnetic field was mentioned earlier.<ref name=\"Nakariakov2001\"/>\nIt has been shown that sufficiently broadband slow magnetoacoustic waves, consistent with currently available observations in the low frequency part of the spectrum, could provide the rate of heat deposition sufficient to heat a [[coronal loop]].\n<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1=Tsiklauri |first1=D.\n |last2=Nakariakov |first2=V.

A second order ordinary differential equation has been derived describing the displacement of the loop axis.

In all these approaches, waves of various kind are used to probe a medium. \n\nThe theoretical foundation of coronal seismology is the [[dispersion relation]] of MHD modes of a plasma cylinder: a plasma structure which is nonuniform in the transverse direction and extended along the magnetic field. This model works well for the description of a number of plasma structures observed in the solar corona: e.g. [[coronal loops]], prominence fibrils, plumes, various filaments. Such a structure acts as a [[waveguide]] of MHD waves.\n\nThis discussion is adapted from Nakariakov & Verwichte (2009).<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Nakariakov |first1=V.

These modes are weakly [[compressibility|compressible]], but could nevertheless be observed with imaging instruments as periodic standing or propagating displacements of coronal structures, e.g. [[coronal loop]]s. The frequency of transverse or \"kink\" modes is given by the following expression:\n\n:<math>\\omega_{K}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_{z}B^{2}}{\\mu(\\rho_{i}+\\rho_{e})}}</math>\n\nFor kink modes the parameter the azimuthal wave number in a cylindrical model of a loop, <math>m</math> is equal to 1, meaning that the cylinder is swaying with fixed ends.\n\n* Sausage modes, which are also oblique fast magnetoacoustic waves guided by the plasma structure; the mode causes expansions and contractions of the plasma structure, but does not displace its axis. These modes are compressible and cause significant variation of the absolute value of the magnetic field in the oscillating structure. The frequency of sausage modes is given by the following expression:\n\n:<math>\\omega_{S}=\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{z}^{2}B^{2}}{\\mu\\rho_{e}}}</math>\n\nFor sausage modes the parameter <math>m</math> is equal to 0; this would be interpreted as a \"breathing\" in and out, again with fixed endpoints.\n\n* Longitudinal (or slow, or [[Acoustics|acoustic]]) modes, which are slow magnetoacoustic waves propagating mainly along the magnetic field in the plasma structure; these mode are essentially compressible. The magnetic field [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]] in these modes is negligible. The frequency of slow modes is given by the following expression:\n\n:<math>\\omega_{L}=\\sqrt{k^{2}_{z}\\left ( \\frac{C_{s}^{2}C_{A}^{2}}{C_{s}^{2}+C_{A}^{2}} \\right )}</math>\n\nWhere we define <math>C_{s}</math> as the [[sound speed]] and <math>C_{A}</math> as the [[Alfv\u00e9n wave#Alfv\u00e9n velocity|Alfv\u00e9n velocity]].\n\n* Torsional ([[Alfv\u00e9n wave|Alfv\u00e9n]] or twist) modes are incompressible transverse perturbations of the magnetic field along certain individual magnetic surfaces. In contrast with kink modes, torsional modes cannot be observed with imaging instruments, as they do not cause the displacement of either the structure axis or its boundary.\n\n:<math>\\omega_{A}=\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{z}^{2}B^{2}}{\\mu\\rho_{i}}}</math>\n\n==Observations==\n[[Image:Coronal_arcade.png|thumb|alt=coronal arcade after flare|TRACE image of a coronal arcade]]\nWave and oscillatory phenomena are observed in the hot plasma of the corona mainly in EUV, optical and microwave bands with a number of spaceborne and ground-based instruments, e.g. the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO), the [[Transition Region and Coronal Explorer]] (TRACE), the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH, see the [[Nobeyama radio observatory]]). Phenomenologically, researchers distinguish between compressible waves in polar plumes and in legs of large [[coronal loops]], flare-generated transverse oscillations of loops, acoustic oscillations of loops, propagating kink waves in loops and in structures above arcades (an '''arcade''' being a close collection of loops in a cylindrical structure, see image to right), sausage oscillations of flaring loops, and oscillations of prominences and fibrils (see [[solar prominence]]), and this list is continuously updated.\n\nCoronal seismology is one of the aims of the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory#Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)|Atmospheric Imaging Assembly]] (AIA) instrument on the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO) mission.\n\nA mission to send a spacecraft as close as 9 solar radii from the sun, [[Parker Solar Probe]], is planned for launch in 2015 and aims to provide in-situ measurements of the solar magnetic field, solar wind and corona. It should include a magnetometer and plasma wave sensor, allowing unprecedented observations for coronal seismology.\n\n==Conclusions==\nThe potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal [[magnetic field]], density [[scale height]], \"fine structure\" (by which is meant the variation in structure of an inhomogeneous structure such as an inhomogeneous coronal loop) and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups. Work relating to the coronal magnetic field was mentioned earlier.<ref name=\"Nakariakov2001\"/>\nIt has been shown that sufficiently broadband slow magnetoacoustic waves, consistent with currently available observations in the low frequency part of the spectrum, could provide the rate of heat deposition sufficient to heat a [[coronal loop]].\n<ref>{{cite journal\n |last1=Tsiklauri |first1=D.\n |last2=Nakariakov |first2=V.

Varying between magnitudes 5.87 and 5.94, it has been classified as an [[FK Comae Berenices variable]], but the classification is still uncertain. It has a [[spectral classification]] of G1IIIe, meaning that it is a [[giant star]] that shows [[emission lines]] in its spectrum. <ref name=gcvs/> It is also likely in its [[horizontal branch]] phase of evolution.<ref name=Stock2018/>\n\n==Fast rotation==\nThe spin rate of OU Andromedae is unusually high for an [[stellar evolution|evolved]] star of this type, showing a [[projected rotational velocity]] of 21.5&nbsp;km/s. One possible explanation is that it may have engulfed a nearby [[giant planet]], such as a [[hot Jupiter]], since an [[infrared]] excess has been observed.<ref name=Silva2015/> Another explanation relies on its strong [[magnetic field]]; if OU Andromedae was an [[Ap star]] during its [[main sequence]] stage of evolution, it could have retained both the strong magnetic field and the fast rotation of Ap stars.<ref name=Borisova2016/>\n\n==X-ray source==\nOU Andromedae is a bright X-ray source, due to the activity of its [[corona]]; it's estimated that solar-like active regions cover 30% of the surface. This is another effect of the strong magnetic field, which produces an uninterrupted flaring activity that generates a large volume of hot plasma at coronal temperatures (~7.5{{e|6}} [[Kelvin|K]]).<ref name=Gondoin2003/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=gcvs>{{cite web|url=http://webviz.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-S?V*%20OU%20And |title=OU And database entry |work=[[Combined General Catalog of Variable Stars]] |edition=2017 |author1=N.

It was the second round of the [[2001 Formula One World Championship]] and the third edition of the [[Malaysian Grand Prix|event]] as part of the series. The 55-lap race was won from [[pole position]] by [[Michael Schumacher]], driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. His teammate [[Rubens Barrichello]] finished second and [[McLaren]]'s [[David Coulthard]] was third.\n\nThe race was delayed and shortened from 56 to 55 laps because [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] of the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team was out of position on the starting [[Glossary of motorsport terms#G|grid]]. When it did start, Michael Schumacher led the first two laps until the Ferraris were caught out by oil from [[Olivier Panis]]' [[British American Racing]] (BAR) car and a tropical monsoon. They ran into a [[Run-off area|gravel trap]] and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] driver [[Jarno Trulli]] took the lead for one lap until he and several drivers [[Aquaplaning|aquaplaned]] in the deteriorating weather. Coulthard led for 11 laps after a phase of [[pit stop]]s for [[Rain tyre|wet-weather tyres]] before Michael Schumacher passed him on lap 16. Schumacher led for the remainder of the race to take his second victory of the season and in Malaysia and the 46th of his career.\n\nMichael Schumacher's victory was his sixth in a row from pole position, bettering a record jointly held by former world champions [[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Alberto Ascari]]. The race result left him ten [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]] clear of his teammate Barrichello and Coulthard in joint second in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]]. [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] of Jordan moved past [[Sauber]]'s [[Nick Heidfeld]] for fourth. In the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]], Ferrari further extended its advantage over McLaren in second while Sauber fell to fourth behind Jordan with fifteen races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bird-eye view of Sepang F1 Circuit - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sepang International Circuit]] ''(pictured in 2016)'', where the race was held.]]\n\nThe 2001 Malaysian Grand Prix was the 2nd of the 17 races in the [[2001 Formula One World Championship]] and the 3rd edition of the [[Malaysian Grand Prix|event]] as part of the series.

It was the second round of the [[2001 Formula One World Championship]] and the third edition of the [[Malaysian Grand Prix|event]] as part of the series. The 55-lap race was won from [[pole position]] by [[Michael Schumacher]], driving for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. His teammate [[Rubens Barrichello]] finished second and [[McLaren]]'s [[David Coulthard]] was third.\n\nThe race was delayed and shortened from 56 to 55 laps because [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] of the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team was out of position on the starting [[Glossary of motorsport terms#G|grid]]. When it did start, Michael Schumacher led the first two laps until the Ferraris were caught out by oil from [[Olivier Panis]]' [[British American Racing]] (BAR) car and a tropical monsoon. They ran into a [[Run-off area|gravel trap]] and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] driver [[Jarno Trulli]] took the lead for one lap until he and several drivers [[Aquaplaning|aquaplaned]] in the deteriorating weather. Coulthard led for 11 laps after a phase of [[pit stop]]s for [[Rain tyre|wet-weather tyres]] before Michael Schumacher passed him on lap 16. Schumacher led for the remainder of the race to take his second victory of the season and in Malaysia and the 46th of his career.\n\nMichael Schumacher's victory was his sixth in a row from pole position, bettering a record jointly held by former world champions [[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Alberto Ascari]]. The race result left him ten [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]] clear of his teammate Barrichello and Coulthard in joint second in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]]. [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] of Jordan moved past [[Sauber]]'s [[Nick Heidfeld]] for fourth. In the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]], Ferrari further extended its advantage over McLaren in second while Sauber fell to fourth behind Jordan with fifteen races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bird-eye view of Sepang F1 Circuit - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sepang International Circuit]] ''(pictured in 2016)'', where the race was held.]]\n\nThe 2001 Malaysian Grand Prix was the 2nd of the 17 races in the [[2001 Formula One World Championship]] and the 3rd edition of the [[Malaysian Grand Prix|event]] as part of the series.

signage.jpg|thumb|Ponderosa Park, Arizona]]\n'''Ponderosa Park''' is a [[unincorporated area|populated place]] in [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]], [[Arizona]], United States. \nIt is located about five miles South of [[Prescott, Arizona]] off of [[Arizona State Route 89]] via Ponderosa Park Road and is within (surrounded by) the [[Prescott National Forest]]. The area was homesteaded in 1884 and currently contains about 300 homes. The homes vary in design from small seasonal cabins to large year-round homes.  The name is derived from the prominent [[ponderosa pines]] in the National Forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ponderosaparkassociation.org/index.html |title=index |website=Ponderosaparkassociation.org |date=2014-11-26 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nPonderosa Park is located at {{coord|34.471236|-112.490565|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.  It is located in a valley split by [[Indian Creek (Hassayampa River)|Indian Creek]] which flows into the [[Hassayampa River]].  The elevation of the Park varies based on location and ranges from 5560 feet at the creek at the southern end of the community, and rising to 5760 feet on both sides of the valley.\n\n==Water==\nThe community has no local government (other than the Yavapai County government). Water service is provided by a public water district.

located about five miles South of [[Prescott, Arizona]] off of [[Arizona State Route 89]] via Ponderosa Park Road and is within (surrounded by) the [[Prescott National Forest]]. The area was homesteaded in 1884 and currently contains about 300 homes. The homes vary in design from small seasonal cabins to large year-round homes.  The name is derived from the prominent [[ponderosa pines]] in the National Forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ponderosaparkassociation.org/index.html |title=index |website=Ponderosaparkassociation.org |date=2014-11-26 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nPonderosa Park is located at {{coord|34.471236|-112.490565|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.  It is located in a valley split by [[Indian Creek (Hassayampa River)|Indian Creek]] which flows into the [[Hassayampa River]].  The elevation of the Park varies based on location and ranges from 5560 feet at the creek at the southern end of the community, and rising to 5760 feet on both sides of the valley.\n\n==Water==\nThe community has no local government (other than the Yavapai County government). Water service is provided by a public water district.  The district, known as the Ponderosa Park Water Improvement District operates five shared ground water wells in the community that are used to fill two storage tanks (126,000 and 186,1000 gallons) to maintain constant pressure through the distribution system. The shallowest well is 186' and the deepest well is 600'.  The district is funded both by monthly fees to all properties receiving water from the system as well as a property tax assessment on all properties located within the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ponderosaparkdwid.com/about.html |title=About |website=Ponderosaparkdwid.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==Fire Protection==\nPonderosa Park is served by the Central Yavapai Fire District (CYFD).
