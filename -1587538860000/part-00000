Improper agricultural practices leading to [[soil erosion]] and impoverishment, depletion of underground water resources, water pollution and health impacts from inappropriate use of [[pesticides]] and [[fertilizers]], and environmental pollution from haphazard dumping of slaughter waste and animal farms are from the main problems of this sector. Agriculture is also diminishing to rampant urbanization, such as in the coastal plains and in parts of the Beqaa Valley. The government's policies appear to be targeting the increase in the availability of water irrigation (especially in the [[South Governorate|South]]) and controlling the use of pesticides, with no or little investment or incentives for water- and soil-conserving irrigation techniques. The private sector is gradually taking advantage of new but small scale opportunities offered by organic farming and high-value agricultural produce.<ref name=LSER>{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.lb/NR/rdonlyres/2A90DB39-4C66-4CC8-9734-19931F82753D/0/Chap2Agriculture.pdf |title=Lebanon State of the Environment Report |format=.pdf |work=Ministry of Environment/LEDO |accessdate=2008-06-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005081710/http://www.moe.gov.lb/NR/rdonlyres/2A90DB39-4C66-4CC8-9734-19931F82753D/0/Chap2Agriculture.pdf |archivedate=October 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Phoenicians and wine}}\n\n[[Image:Bekaa Libanon 2003.jpg|thumb|right|During [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, the [[Beqaa Valley]] was considered to be the granary of [[Ancient Rome]].]]\n\nAgriculture in Lebanon dates back to [[Phoenicia]]n times with the first trading activities taking place in the eastern Mediterranean. The wine making tradition, which has a 5,000 years of history in the region was a known skill for its ancient dwellers. The Phoenicians tended vineyards, made wine and exported a significant amount to neighboring countries such as Egypt, Greece and [[Assyria]].<ref>[http://www.lebwine.com/ http://www.lebwine.com/], Wine of Lebanon. Retrieved on 2008-06-25.</ref> Although the trading activity was active in that period, however agriculture was not their main source of wealth because most of the land was not arable; therefore, they focused on commerce and trading instead. They did, however, raise sheep and sell them and their wool.\n\nDuring the [[History of Lebanon under Arab rule|Arab rule]], in the [[Middle ages]], the country enjoyed an economic boom in which the Lebanese harbors of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] were busy with shipping of industrial and agricultural products. Lebanese products were sought after not only in [[Arab]] countries but also throughout the Mediterranean Basin. This period of economic growth was later oppressed with the beginning of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule and the high taxes imposed on the Lebanese production.\n[[Image:Beyrouth-histoire1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beirut]] in the 19th century. In that period, even the capital had a significant portion of agricultural land, along with the bordering rural regions.]]\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Lebanon had regained its past agricultural boom where almost one-fourth of its land had been cultivable (the highest proportion in the Arab world). After the 1950s and the prosperous decades that followed, agriculture faced a decline with the beginning of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and especially after the [[1982 Lebanon War|Israeli invasion]] in the early 1980s. In the latter period, the government prepared plans to irrigate an additional 60,000 hectares, and by 1984 studies were under way on 6 major irrigation projects, all designed to be carried out as part of the 1982-91 reconstruction plan. However, with the Israeli invasion came a continuous diversion of water from rivers mainly located in the south. Even in the relative calm between 1978 and 1981, about 1,100 hectares of tobacco were destroyed, 300 hectares of agricultural land were abandoned because of land mines, and 51,000 olive trees and 70,000 fruit trees were destroyed, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. By the mid-1980s Lebanon had become one of the world's most prominent narcotics trafficking centers, with the prosperous phase that it witnessed (especially in the Beqaa valley). Before 1975 much of this trade was exported by air from small airstrips in the Beqaa Valley. After the valley came under [[Syrian]] control, the drug crop left the country by sea through [[Christians|Christian]]-controlled ports to [[Cyprus]], overland to [[Syria]] or sometimes through [[Israel]] to [[Egypt]].<ref name=USLC>[http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/71.htm http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/71.htm], Crop Production.

Fruit and olive trees occupy 45% of the total cultivated area, and have increased by about 230,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in the past 10 years. The area covered by greenhouse production has also significantly increased over the past years, from 6,700&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in the late 1980s to almost 50,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in 1999. Agricultural production in greenhouses is more intensive than in open fields and requires more agro-chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers). Agricultural production is concentrated in the Beqaa, which accounts for 42% of total cultivated land. The Beqaa hosts 62% of the total area used for industrial crops (including sugar beet, tobacco, and vineyards) and 57% of the total area used for cereal production. The North ([[Akkar District|Akkar]] and [[El-Koura|Koura]] regions) host 40% the area used for olive production in the country.

While the number of goats have been relatively stable for more than two decades, sheep production has increased sharply. In recent years, livestock production (goats and sheep) has relied increasingly on feed blocks and feed supplements, thereby reducing dependence on wild grazing and ultimately leading to more sedentary animal production. [[Bovinae|Bovines]] and dairy production is becoming increasingly popular. In the past five years, several medium-to large-scale dairy farms have been established in the North and in the Beqaa. Several grant and loan agreements (proposed by organizations such as [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]) have encouraged farmers to expand dairy production.<ref name=LSER /> The table shows the evolution of livestock production from 1980 to 1999:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Category!!1980!!1999!!Variation (%)\n|-\n|Cows||align=\"center\"|55,612||align=\"center\"|75,874||align=\"center\"|+ 36\n|-\n|Sheep||align=\"center\"|145,068||align=\"center\"|378,050||align=\"center\"|+ 160\n|-\n|Goats||align=\"center\"|444,448||align=\"center\"|435,965||align=\"center\"|- 2\n|-\n|Total||align=\"center\"|645,128||align=\"center\"|889,889||align=\"center\"|+ 38\n|}\n\n===Horticulture===\nLebanon produces a variety of fruits and vegetables.

Exotic crops include [[avocados]] mainly in north Mount Lebanon and [[hashish]] in the Beqaa valley.<ref name=\"IDAL\"/>\n\nHorticulture has traditionally provided the Lebanese with all their fresh fruit and vegetable needs, with a smaller export industry. However, loosened border controls and increasing imports have threatened local industries. In recent years governmental projects such as Export Plus have put into action the encouragement of local fruits and vegetables production, quality control and investment incentives for farmers in order to boost their produce and raise the level of the Lebanese horticulture industry.

Annual fish production in 1996 doubled in average over a phase of ten years, with production amounting to 4,485 tonnes (4,110 tonnes of sea fish and 375 tonnes of freshwater fish, mostly in fish farms). Fishing in rivers has relatively small importance in Lebanon with productions significantly taking place in the [[Lake Qaraoun]] (about 30 tonnes per year of mainly [[carp]] and [[trout]] production) and other rivers such as the [[Litani River|Litani]] and [[Nahr Ibrahim]].\n\nWhile sea fish production in Lebanon is compared to that of neighboring countries on a km of coastline basis, freshwater fish production continues to lag behind. Absence of sea fish breeding along the coast due to strong coastal currents have been substituted by offshore fishing of [[pelagic fish]] (such as [[Tuna]], [[Blue fish]], etc.) using [[dragline]]s. This type of fishing has become trendy in the past decade, mostly among sports amateurs equipped with motor speedboats.<ref name=LSER />\n\n==Governance==\nAgriculture is a state responsibility in Lebanon, where the ministry of agriculture is involved in setting agricultural policies and regulations. In the 1990s, the Lebanese government has awarded 89 contracts in the agricultural sector worth a total of US$13.6 million and an additional 46 projects in the irrigation sector, worth US$51.8 million. Contracts include consultancy and design, as well as works and equipment supply. Capital investment in the agricultural sector includes the rehabilitation of the Ministry of Agriculture, land reclamation projects, as well as the rehabilitation of agricultural schools and research stations. The agricultural sector is struggling to survive in a competitive regional market. Through loans and grant agreements, the government has implemented large-scale irrigation projects and has taken steps to ban a long list of hazardous pesticides. However, there are many problems facing the agricultural development with effective extension programs, use of water-conserving irrigation techniques, and rational use of agro-chemicals still scant or localized.<ref name=\"LSER\"/>\n\n===Key Policies and Actions===\n* Banning dangerous pesticides, the ministry of agriculture banned 110 pesticides in 1998, including [[aldrin]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]] and [[DDT]].\n* Safe handling of obsolete pesticides, [[FAO]] supported a project in 1998 (US$101,000) to assist the Lebanese government in eliminating a stock of 8.5 tonnes of pesticides and train the staff of the Agricultural Research Institute to manage and handle the pesticides stock.\n* Phasing out [[methyl bromide]], the ministry of economy initiated the Methyl Bromide Alternatives Project in May 1999. The project has shown the efficiency of all available alternatives to methyl bromide over four consecutive growing seasons in 19 sites around the country, totaling 52 [[greenhouse]]s covering a total area of 20.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n* Land reclamation projects:\n# Provided assistance, either financial or technical, to 1407 farmers.\n# Reclaimed 756 [[hectares]] of abandoned lands.\n# Supported the construction of several earth-lined hill lakes (total capacity of 5,300,000 m<sup>3</sup>) and cement reservoirs (total capacity 500,000 m<sup>3</sup>).\n# Terraced approximately 16,000 hectares. This is equivalent to 6.3% of the total surface area currently under cultivation.\n* Improving water management, Canal 800 (a series of surface water distribution networks) and the IRMP will convert/add 32,255 hectares to irrigated agriculture. These irrigation schemes are designed to tap surface water resources and may therefore alleviate current demand pressure on groundwater.\n* Promoting [[organic farming]], the introduction and improvement of certified and labeled [[Organic food|organic produce]] to local and foreign markets.<ref name=\"LSER\"/>\n\nIn September 1995, Lebanon through the Ministry of Agriculture signed the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification ([[UNCCD]]). Lebanon has requested assistance from the United Nations Development Programme ([[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]) and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation ([[GTZ]]) to support the implementation of the Convention and to establish a National Action Programme for Combating Desertification which was launched in June 2003. The NAP project has four immediate goals:\n\n# Promotion of Innovative Trade Initiatives Promoted to Increase Market Opportunities for Dryland Products\n# Sub-national and Local Level NAP Priority Projects Implemented\n# Developing a National Resource Mobilization Strategy for UNCCD/NAP Implementation\n# Flood Risk Management and Water Harvesting for Livelihood Recovery in Baalback-Hermel\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Lebanon|Agropedia}}\n* [[Geography of Lebanon]]\n* [[Mediterranean climate]]\n* [[Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests]]\n\n==References==\n<ref>{{cite news|last1=\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646|title=\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646|url=https://www.lebwindow.net/141|ref=https://www.lebwindow.net/141|access-date=2014-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006150441/https://www.lebwindow.net/141|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Agriculture of Lebanon}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060509165449/http://www.agriculture.gov.lb/english_file/index_e.htm Ministry of Agriculture]\n* [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/index.asp?lang=en&iso3=LBN&subj=4 FAO Lebanon - Agriculture sector]\n*[https://presentations.copernicus.org/EGU2015-717_presentation.pdf Organic Food Market Segmentation in Lebanon - European Geosciences UnionGeneral Assembly 2015]\n\n{{Asia topic|Agriculture in}}\n{{Lebanon topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Agriculture In Lebanon}}\n[[Category:Agriculture in Lebanon| ]]\n[[Category:Economy of Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Agriculture in Asia|Lebanon]]\n", "text_old": "{{Economy of Lebanon}}\n\n'''Agriculture in [[Lebanon]]''' is the third most important sector in the country after the [[Tertiary sector|tertiary]] and [[Secondary sector of economic activity|industrial]] sectors.

Improper agricultural practices leading to [[soil erosion]] and impoverishment, depletion of underground water resources, water pollution and health impacts from inappropriate use of [[pesticides]] and [[fertilizers]], and environmental pollution from haphazard dumping of slaughter waste and animal farms are from the main problems of this sector. Agriculture is also diminishing to rampant urbanization, such as in the coastal plains and in parts of the Beqaa Valley. The government's policies appear to be targeting the increase in the availability of water irrigation (especially in the [[South Governorate|South]]) and controlling the use of pesticides, with no or little investment or incentives for water- and soil-conserving irrigation techniques. The private sector is gradually taking advantage of new but small scale opportunities offered by organic farming and high-value agricultural produce.<ref name=LSER>{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.lb/NR/rdonlyres/2A90DB39-4C66-4CC8-9734-19931F82753D/0/Chap2Agriculture.pdf |title=Lebanon State of the Environment Report |format=.pdf |work=Ministry of Environment/LEDO |accessdate=2008-06-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005081710/http://www.moe.gov.lb/NR/rdonlyres/2A90DB39-4C66-4CC8-9734-19931F82753D/0/Chap2Agriculture.pdf |archivedate=October 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Phoenicians and wine}}\n\n[[Image:Bekaa Libanon 2003.jpg|thumb|right|During [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, the [[Beqaa Valley]] was considered to be the granary of [[Ancient Rome]].]]\n\nAgriculture in Lebanon dates back to [[Phoenicia]]n times with the first trading activities taking place in the eastern Mediterranean. The wine making tradition, which has a 5,000 years of history in the region was a known skill for its ancient dwellers. The Phoenicians tended vineyards, made wine and exported a significant amount to neighboring countries such as Egypt, Greece and [[Assyria]].<ref>[http://www.lebwine.com/ http://www.lebwine.com/], Wine of Lebanon. Retrieved on 2008-06-25.</ref> Although the trading activity was active in that period, however agriculture was not their main source of wealth because most of the land was not arable; therefore, they focused on commerce and trading instead. They did, however, raise sheep and sell them and their wool.\n\nDuring the [[History of Lebanon under Arab rule|Arab rule]], in the [[Middle ages]], the country enjoyed an economic boom in which the Lebanese harbors of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] were busy with shipping of industrial and agricultural products. Lebanese products were sought after not only in [[Arab]] countries but also throughout the Mediterranean Basin. This period of economic growth was later oppressed with the beginning of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule and the high taxes imposed on the Lebanese production.\n[[Image:Beyrouth-histoire1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beirut]] in the 19th century. In that period, even the capital had a significant portion of agricultural land, along with the bordering rural regions.]]\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Lebanon had regained its past agricultural boom where almost one-fourth of its land had been cultivable (the highest proportion in the Arab world). After the 1950s and the prosperous decades that followed, agriculture faced a decline with the beginning of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and especially after the [[1982 Lebanon War|Israeli invasion]] in the early 1980s. In the latter period, the government prepared plans to irrigate an additional 60,000 hectares, and by 1984 studies were under way on 6 major irrigation projects, all designed to be carried out as part of the 1982-91 reconstruction plan. However, with the Israeli invasion came a continuous diversion of water from rivers mainly located in the south. Even in the relative calm between 1978 and 1981, about 1,100 hectares of tobacco were destroyed, 300 hectares of agricultural land were abandoned because of land mines, and 51,000 olive trees and 70,000 fruit trees were destroyed, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. By the mid-1980s Lebanon had become one of the world's most prominent narcotics trafficking centers, with the prosperous phase that it witnessed (especially in the Beqaa valley). Before 1975 much of this trade was exported by air from small airstrips in the Beqaa Valley. After the valley came under [[Syrian]] control, the drug crop left the country by sea through [[Christians|Christian]]-controlled ports to [[Cyprus]], overland to [[Syria]] or sometimes through [[Israel]] to [[Egypt]].<ref name=USLC>[http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/71.htm http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/71.htm], Crop Production.

Fruit and olive trees occupy 45% of the total cultivated area, and have increased by about 230,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in the past 10 years. The area covered by greenhouse production has also significantly increased over the past years, from 6,700&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in the late 1980s to almost 50,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in 1999. Agricultural production in greenhouses is more intensive than in open fields and requires more agro-chemicals (pesticides and fertilizers). Agricultural production is concentrated in the Beqaa, which accounts for 42% of total cultivated land. The Beqaa hosts 62% of the total area used for industrial crops (including sugar beet, tobacco, and vineyards) and 57% of the total area used for cereal production. The North ([[Akkar District|Akkar]] and [[El-Koura|Koura]] regions) host 40% the area used for olive production in the country.

While the number of goats have been relatively stable for more than two decades, sheep production has increased sharply. In recent years, livestock production (goats and sheep) has relied increasingly on feed blocks and feed supplements, thereby reducing dependence on wild grazing and ultimately leading to more sedentary animal production. [[Bovinae|Bovines]] and dairy production is becoming increasingly popular. In the past five years, several medium-to large-scale dairy farms have been established in the North and in the Beqaa. Several grant and loan agreements (proposed by organizations such as [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]) have encouraged farmers to expand dairy production.<ref name=LSER /> The table shows the evolution of livestock production from 1980 to 1999:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Category!!1980!!1999!!Variation (%)\n|-\n|Cows||align=\"center\"|55,612||align=\"center\"|75,874||align=\"center\"|+ 36\n|-\n|Sheep||align=\"center\"|145,068||align=\"center\"|378,050||align=\"center\"|+ 160\n|-\n|Goats||align=\"center\"|444,448||align=\"center\"|435,965||align=\"center\"|- 2\n|-\n|Total||align=\"center\"|645,128||align=\"center\"|889,889||align=\"center\"|+ 38\n|}\n\n===Horticulture===\nLebanon produces a variety of fruits and vegetables.

Exotic crops include [[avocados]] mainly in north Mount Lebanon and [[hashish]] in the Beqaa valley.<ref name=\"IDAL\"/>\n\nHorticulture has traditionally provided the Lebanese with all their fresh fruit and vegetable needs, with a smaller export industry. However, loosened border controls and increasing imports have threatened local industries. In recent years governmental projects such as Export Plus have put into action the encouragement of local fruits and vegetables production, quality control and investment incentives for farmers in order to boost their produce and raise the level of the Lebanese horticulture industry.

Annual fish production in 1996 doubled in average over a phase of ten years, with production amounting to 4,485 tonnes (4,110 tonnes of sea fish and 375 tonnes of freshwater fish, mostly in fish farms). Fishing in rivers has relatively small importance in Lebanon with productions significantly taking place in the [[Lake Qaraoun]] (about 30 tonnes per year of mainly [[carp]] and [[trout]] production) and other rivers such as the [[Litani River|Litani]] and [[Nahr Ibrahim]].\n\nWhile sea fish production in Lebanon is compared to that of neighboring countries on a km of coastline basis, freshwater fish production continues to lag behind. Absence of sea fish breeding along the coast due to strong coastal currents have been substituted by offshore fishing of [[pelagic fish]] (such as [[Tuna]], [[Blue fish]], etc.) using [[dragline]]s. This type of fishing has become trendy in the past decade, mostly among sports amateurs equipped with motor speedboats.<ref name=LSER />\n\n==Governance==\nAgriculture is a state responsibility in Lebanon, where the ministry of agriculture is involved in setting agricultural policies and regulations. In the 1990s, the Lebanese government has awarded 89 contracts in the agricultural sector worth a total of US$13.6 million and an additional 46 projects in the irrigation sector, worth US$51.8 million. Contracts include consultancy and design, as well as works and equipment supply. Capital investment in the agricultural sector includes the rehabilitation of the Ministry of Agriculture, land reclamation projects, as well as the rehabilitation of agricultural schools and research stations. The agricultural sector is struggling to survive in a competitive regional market. Through loans and grant agreements, the government has implemented large-scale irrigation projects and has taken steps to ban a long list of hazardous pesticides. However, there are many problems facing the agricultural development with effective extension programs, use of water-conserving irrigation techniques, and rational use of agro-chemicals still scant or localized.<ref name=\"LSER\"/>\n\n===Key Policies and Actions===\n* Banning dangerous pesticides, the ministry of agriculture banned 110 pesticides in 1998, including [[aldrin]], [[dieldrin]], [[endrin]] and [[DDT]].\n* Safe handling of obsolete pesticides, [[FAO]] supported a project in 1998 (US$101,000) to assist the Lebanese government in eliminating a stock of 8.5 tonnes of pesticides and train the staff of the Agricultural Research Institute to manage and handle the pesticides stock.\n* Phasing out [[methyl bromide]], the ministry of economy initiated the Methyl Bromide Alternatives Project in May 1999. The project has shown the efficiency of all available alternatives to methyl bromide over four consecutive growing seasons in 19 sites around the country, totaling 52 [[greenhouse]]s covering a total area of 20.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n* Land reclamation projects:\n# Provided assistance, either financial or technical, to 1407 farmers.\n# Reclaimed 756 [[hectares]] of abandoned lands.\n# Supported the construction of several earth-lined hill lakes (total capacity of 5,300,000 m<sup>3</sup>) and cement reservoirs (total capacity 500,000 m<sup>3</sup>).\n# Terraced approximately 16,000 hectares. This is equivalent to 6.3% of the total surface area currently under cultivation.\n* Improving water management, Canal 800 (a series of surface water distribution networks) and the IRMP will convert/add 32,255 hectares to irrigated agriculture. These irrigation schemes are designed to tap surface water resources and may therefore alleviate current demand pressure on groundwater.\n* Promoting [[organic farming]], the introduction and improvement of certified and labeled [[Organic food|organic produce]] to local and foreign markets.<ref name=\"LSER\"/>\n\nIn September 1995, Lebanon through the Ministry of Agriculture signed the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification ([[UNCCD]]). Lebanon has requested assistance from the United Nations Development Programme ([[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]]) and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation ([[GTZ]]) to support the implementation of the Convention and to establish a National Action Programme for Combating Desertification which was launched in June 2003. The NAP project has four immediate goals:\n\n# Promotion of Innovative Trade Initiatives Promoted to Increase Market Opportunities for Dryland Products\n# Sub-national and Local Level NAP Priority Projects Implemented\n# Developing a National Resource Mobilization Strategy for UNCCD/NAP Implementation\n# Flood Risk Management and Water Harvesting for Livelihood Recovery in Baalback-Hermel\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Lebanon|Agropedia}}\n* [[Geography of Lebanon]]\n* [[Mediterranean climate]]\n* [[Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests]]\n\n==References==\n<ref>{{cite news|last1=\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646|title=\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0627\u0631\u0639\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646|url=https://www.lebwindow.net/141|ref=https://www.lebwindow.net/141|access-date=2014-10-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006150441/https://www.lebwindow.net/141|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Agriculture of Lebanon}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060509165449/http://www.agriculture.gov.lb/english_file/index_e.htm Ministry of Agriculture]\n* [http://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/index.asp?lang=en&iso3=LBN&subj=4 FAO Lebanon - Agriculture sector]\n*[https://presentations.copernicus.org/EGU2015-717_presentation.pdf Organic Food Market Segmentation in Lebanon - European Geosciences UnionGeneral Assembly 2015]\n\n{{Asia topic|Agriculture in}}\n{{Lebanon topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Agriculture In Lebanon}}\n[[Category:Agriculture in Lebanon| ]]\n[[Category:Economy of Lebanon]]\n[[Category:Agriculture in Asia|Lebanon]]\n", "name_user": "94.187.52.104", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Lebanon"}

His mother was German and his father at least part-Jewish in ancestry. After premed education in Berlin and Rostock, he joined a regiment of the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|Prussian Guard]].<ref>Person, Ethel Spector, The Sexual Century. New Haven: Yale University Press. 1999.</ref> He received his doctorate in medicine in 1912 in [[T\u00fcbingen]] for a dissertation on [[tuberculosis]]. Sexual medicine interested him, but was not part of his medical studies. In an interview conducted in 1985 he recalled:\n\n{{quote|I do remember going, as a young person, to a lecture by [[Auguste Forel]], whose book ''The Sexual Question'' was a sensation at the time and which impressed me greatly. I also met [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] very early on through a girl friend, who knew the police official Kopp, who was in charge investigating of sexual offenses. He, in turn, was a friend of Hirschfeld's, and so I met both men. That was around 1907. They repeatedly took me along on their rounds through the homosexual bars in Berlin. I especially remember the 'Eldorado' with its drag shows, where also many of the customers appeared in the clothing of the other sex. The word \"transvestite\" had not yet been invented. Hirschfeld coined it only in 1910 in his well-known study.<ref>[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/TRANS_B5.HTM  Hu-Berlnin.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227133920/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/TRANS_B5.HTM |date=2004-12-27 }}.</ref>}}\n\nBenjamin visited the United States in 1913, to work with a [[quack doctor]] who claimed to have found a cure for tuberculosis.<ref>Stein, Marc. Encyclopedia of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history in America. New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons/Thomson/Gale, 2004.  page 133 {{ISBN|0-684-31427-4}}, 978-0-684-31427-3</ref> The liner in which Benjamin was returning to Germany was caught mid-Atlantic both by the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914, and the [[Royal Navy]]. Given the choice of a British [[internment camp]], as an \"[[enemy alien]]\", or returning to New York, he used his last dollars to travel back to America, where he made his home for the rest of his life, although he maintained and built many international professional connections and visited Europe frequently when wars allowed.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to start a medical career in [[New York City|New York]], in 1915 Benjamin rented a consulting room, in which he also slept, and started his own general medical practice. Later he practiced in [[San Francisco]] (at 450 Sutter Street) in the summer of every year, and otherwise at 44 East 67th Street in New York.\n\n== Work with transgender people ==\nIn 1948, in San Francisco, Benjamin was asked by [[Alfred Kinsey]], a fellow sexologist, to see a child who \"wanted to become a girl\" despite being born male; the mother wished for help that would assist rather than thwart the child. Kinsey had encountered the child as a result of his interviews for ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'', which was published that year. Kinsey and Benjamin had seen nothing of the like previously. This child rapidly led Benjamin to understand that there was a different condition to that of transvestism, under which adults who had such needs had been classified to that time.<ref>[http://www.the-sisterhood.net/thepinknazi/id4.html The Sisterhood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407072237/http://www.the-sisterhood.net/thepinknazi/id4.html |date=2005-04-07 }}.</ref>\n\nDespite the psychiatrists with whom Benjamin involved in the case not agreeing on a path of treatment, Benjamin eventually decided to treat the child with estrogen ([[Premarin]], introduced in 1941), which had a \"calming effect\", and helped arrange for the mother and child to go to Germany, where surgery{{specify}} to assist the child could be performed but, from there, they ceased to maintain contact, to Benjamin's regret. However, Benjamin continued to refine his understanding and went on to treat several hundred patients with similar needs in a similar manner, often without accepting any payment.\n\nMany of his patients were referred by [[David Cauldwell]], [[Robert Stoller]], and doctors in Denmark. These doctors received hundreds of requests from individuals who had read about their work connected with changing sex, as it was then largely described.\n\nHowever, due to the personal political opinions of the American doctors and a Danish law prohibiting sex reassignment surgery on noncitizens, these doctors referred the letter-writers to the one doctor of the era who would aid transsexual individuals, Harry Benjamin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Meyerowitz |first=Joan |title=How Sex Changed: A History of Transsexuality in the United States |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard University |year=2002 |page=143 |isbn=0674009258 }}</ref> Benjamin conducted treatment with the assistance of carefully selected colleagues of various disciplines (such as psychiatrists C.L Ihlenfeld and John Alden, electrologist Martha Foss, and surgeons Jose Jesus Barbosa,<ref>[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Retrospective2.html University of Michigan].</ref> Roberto C Granato, and [[Georges Burou]]).\n\nBenjamin's patients regarded him as a man of immense caring, respect and kindness, and many kept in touch with him until his death. He was a prolific and assiduous correspondent, in both English and German, and many letters are archived at the [[Magnus Hirschfeld Archive for Sexology]], Humboldt University, Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/COLLBEN.HTM|title=Archive for Sexology|work=hu-berlin.de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204181920/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/COLLBEN.HTM|archivedate=2007-12-04}}</ref>\n\nThe legal, social and medical background to this in the United States, as in many other countries, was often a stark contrast, since wearing items of clothing associated with the opposite sex in public was often illegal, castration of a male was often illegal, anything seen as homosexuality was often persecuted or illegal, and many doctors considered all such people (including children) at best denied any affirmation of their gender identity, or involuntarily subjected to treatments such as drugged detention, [[electroconvulsive therapy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Gender_shock.html|title=Google Books|work=google.com}}</ref> or [[lobotomy]].\n\nThough he had already published papers and lectured to professional audiences extensively, Benjamin's 1966 book, ''The Transsexual Phenomenon'', was immensely important as the first large work describing and explaining the affirmative treatment path he pioneered.<ref>Michie, Jonathan. Reader's guide to the social sciences. London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-57958-091-9}}</ref> Publicity surrounding his patient [[Christine Jorgensen]] brought the issue into the mainstream in 1952 and led to a great many people presenting for assistance, internationally. In the preface of Christine Jorgensen's autobiography, Dr. Benjamin also gives Jorgensen credit for the advancement of his studies. He wrote, \"Indeed Christine, without you, probably none of this would have happened; the grant, my publications, lectures, etc.\"<ref>Jorgensen, Christine, and Susan Stryker. \"Preface.\" Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Autobiography. 1st ed. Cleis, 2000.</ref>\n\nSimilar cases in other countries (such as that of [[Roberta Cowell]], whose surgery by [[Harold Gillies]] in England was in 1951 but was not publicised until 1954; [[Coccinelle (entertainer)|Coccinelle]]<ref>[http://www.coccinelleshow.com Coccinelle Show].</ref> who received much publicity in France in 1958, and [[April Ashley]], whose exposure in 1961 by the British tabloid press was reported worldwide) fuelled this. But most of Benjamin's patients lived (and many still live) quiet lives.\n\n[[Reed Erickson]] (1917\u20131992), a successful industrialist, sought treatment from Benjamin in 1963. Erickson was the founder and funder of the [[Erickson Educational Foundation]], which published educational booklets, funded medical conferences, counselling services, and the establishment of gender clinics. The EEF funded the Harry Benjamin Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Devor|first1=Aaron H.|authorlink=Aaron Devor|title=Reed Erickson and The Erickson Educational Foundation|url=http://web.uvic.ca/~erick123/|website=web.uvic.ca|publisher=University of Victoria|accessdate=5 June 2017|date=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Other work and interests ==\nApart from endocrinology and sexology, he worked on [[life extension]] and would now also be described as a [[gerontologist]]. Benjamin himself lived to be 101.\n\nBenjamin was married to Gretchen, to whom he dedicated his 1966 major work, for 60 years.\n\nIn 1979 the [[Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association]] was formed, using Benjamin's name by permission. The group consists of therapists and psychologists who devised a set of [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] (SOC) for the treatment of gender dysphoria, largely based on Benjamin's cases, and studies.<ref>Brien, Jodi.

His mother was German and his father at least part-Jewish in ancestry. After premed education in Berlin and Rostock, he joined a regiment of the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|Prussian Guard]].<ref>Person, Ethel Spector, The Sexual Century. New Haven: Yale University Press. 1999.</ref> He received his doctorate in medicine in 1912 in [[T\u00fcbingen]] for a dissertation on [[tuberculosis]]. Sexual medicine interested him, but was not part of his medical studies. In an interview conducted in 1985 he recalled:\n\n{{quote|I do remember going, as a young person, to a lecture by [[Auguste Forel]], whose book ''The Sexual Question'' was a sensation at the time and which impressed me greatly. I also met [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] very early on through a girl friend, who knew the police official Kopp, who was in charge investigating of sexual offenses. He, in turn, was a friend of Hirschfeld's, and so I met both men. That was around 1907. They repeatedly took me along on their rounds through the homosexual bars in Berlin. I especially remember the 'Eldorado' with its drag shows, where also many of the customers appeared in the clothing of the other sex. The word \"transvestite\" had not yet been invented. Hirschfeld coined it only in 1910 in his well-known study.<ref>[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/TRANS_B5.HTM  Hu-Berlnin.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227133920/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/TRANS_B5.HTM |date=2004-12-27 }}.</ref>}}\n\nBenjamin visited the United States in 1913, to work with a [[quack doctor]] who claimed to have found a cure for tuberculosis.<ref>Stein, Marc. Encyclopedia of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history in America. New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons/Thomson/Gale, 2004.  page 133 {{ISBN|0-684-31427-4}}, 978-0-684-31427-3</ref> The liner in which Benjamin was returning to Germany was caught mid-Atlantic both by the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914, and the [[Royal Navy]]. Given the choice of a British [[internment camp]], as an \"[[enemy alien]]\", or returning to New York, he used his last dollars to travel back to America, where he made his home for the rest of his life, although he maintained and built many international professional connections and visited Europe frequently when wars allowed.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to start a medical career in [[New York City|New York]], in 1915 Benjamin rented a consulting room, in which he also slept, and started his own general medical practice. Later he practiced in [[San Francisco]] (at 450 Sutter Street) in the summer of every year, and otherwise at 44 East 67th Street in New York.\n\n== Work with transgender people ==\nIn 1948, in San Francisco, Benjamin was asked by [[Alfred Kinsey]], a fellow sexologist, to see a child who \"wanted to become a girl\" despite being born male; the mother wished for help that would assist rather than thwart the child. Kinsey had encountered the child as a result of his interviews for ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'', which was published that year. Kinsey and Benjamin had seen nothing of the like previously. This child rapidly led Benjamin to understand that there was a different condition to that of transvestism, under which adults who had such needs had been classified to that time.<ref>[http://www.the-sisterhood.net/thepinknazi/id4.html The Sisterhood] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407072237/http://www.the-sisterhood.net/thepinknazi/id4.html |date=2005-04-07 }}.</ref>\n\nDespite the psychiatrists with whom Benjamin involved in the case not agreeing on a path of treatment, Benjamin eventually decided to treat the child with estrogen ([[Premarin]], introduced in 1941), which had a \"calming effect\", and helped arrange for the mother and child to go to Germany, where surgery{{specify}} to assist the child could be performed but, from there, they ceased to maintain contact, to Benjamin's regret. However, Benjamin continued to refine his understanding and went on to treat several hundred patients with similar needs in a similar manner, often without accepting any payment.\n\nMany of his patients were referred by [[David Cauldwell]], [[Robert Stoller]], and doctors in Denmark. These doctors received hundreds of requests from individuals who had read about their work connected with changing sex, as it was then largely described.\n\nHowever, due to the personal political opinions of the American doctors and a Danish law prohibiting sex reassignment surgery on noncitizens, these doctors referred the letter-writers to the one doctor of the era who would aid transsexual individuals, Harry Benjamin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Meyerowitz |first=Joan |title=How Sex Changed: A History of Transsexuality in the United States |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard University |year=2002 |page=143 |isbn=0674009258 }}</ref> Benjamin conducted treatment with the assistance of carefully selected colleagues of various disciplines (such as psychiatrists C.L Ihlenfeld and John Alden, electrologist Martha Foss, and surgeons Jose Jesus Barbosa,<ref>[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Retrospective2.html University of Michigan].</ref> Roberto C Granato, and [[Georges Burou]]).\n\nBenjamin's patients regarded him as a man of immense caring, respect and kindness, and many kept in touch with him until his death. He was a prolific and assiduous correspondent, in both English and German, and many letters are archived at the [[Magnus Hirschfeld Archive for Sexology]], Humboldt University, Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/COLLBEN.HTM|title=Archive for Sexology|work=hu-berlin.de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204181920/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/COLLBEN.HTM|archivedate=2007-12-04}}</ref>\n\nThe legal, social and medical background to this in the United States, as in many other countries, was often a stark contrast, since wearing items of clothing associated with the opposite sex in public was often illegal, castration of a male was often illegal, anything seen as homosexuality was often persecuted or illegal, and many doctors considered all such people (including children) at best denied any affirmation of their gender identity, or involuntarily subjected to treatments such as drugged detention, [[electroconvulsive therapy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Gender_shock.html|title=Google Books|work=google.com}}</ref> or [[lobotomy]].\n\nThough he had already published papers and lectured to professional audiences extensively, Benjamin's 1966 book, ''The Transsexual Phenomenon'', was immensely important as the first large work describing and explaining the affirmative treatment path he pioneered.<ref>Michie, Jonathan. Reader's guide to the social sciences. London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-57958-091-9}}</ref> Publicity surrounding his patient [[Christine Jorgensen]] brought the issue into the mainstream in 1952 and led to a great many people presenting for assistance, internationally. In the preface of Christine Jorgensen's autobiography, Dr. Benjamin also gives Jorgensen credit for the advancement of his studies. He wrote, \"Indeed Christine, without you, probably none of this would have happened; the grant, my publications, lectures, etc.\"<ref>Jorgensen, Christine, and Susan Stryker. \"Preface.\" Christine Jorgensen: A Personal Autobiography. 1st ed. Cleis, 2000.</ref>\n\nSimilar cases in other countries (such as that of [[Roberta Cowell]], whose surgery by [[Harold Gillies]] in England was in 1951 but was not publicised until 1954; [[Coccinelle (entertainer)|Coccinelle]]<ref>[http://www.coccinelleshow.com Coccinelle Show].</ref> who received much publicity in France in 1958, and [[April Ashley]], whose exposure in 1961 by the British tabloid press was reported worldwide) fuelled this. But most of Benjamin's patients lived (and many still live) quiet lives.\n\n[[Reed Erickson]] (1917\u20131992), a successful industrialist, sought treatment from Benjamin in 1963. Erickson was the founder and funder of the [[Erickson Educational Foundation]], which published educational booklets, funded medical conferences, counselling services, and the establishment of gender clinics. The EEF funded the Harry Benjamin Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Devor|first1=Aaron H.|authorlink=Aaron Devor|title=Reed Erickson and The Erickson Educational Foundation|url=http://web.uvic.ca/~erick123/|website=web.uvic.ca|publisher=University of Victoria|accessdate=5 June 2017|date=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Other work and interests ==\nApart from endocrinology and sexology, he worked on [[life extension]] and would now also be described as a [[gerontologist]]. Benjamin himself lived to be 101.\n\nBenjamin was married to Gretchen, to whom he dedicated his 1966 major work, for 60 years.\n\nIn 1979 the [[Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association]] was formed, using Benjamin's name by permission. The group consists of therapists and psychologists who devised a set of [[Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People|Standards of Care]] (SOC) for the treatment of gender dysphoria, largely based on Benjamin's cases, and studies.<ref>Brien, Jodi.

The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet.

Billy Graham conducted 417 crusades in 185 countries and territories on six continents. The first Billy Graham evangelistic campaign, held September 13\u201321, 1947, in the Civic Auditorium in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was attended by 6,000 people. He would rent a large venue, such as a stadium, park, or street. As the sessions became larger, he arranged a group of up to 5,000 people to sing in a choir. He would preach the [[gospel]] and invite people to come forward to ask Jesus to be their saviour and pray together. The inquirers were often given a copy of the [[Gospel of John]] or a [[Bible]] study booklet. In [[Durban]], South Africa, in 1973, the crowd of some 100,000 was the first large mixed-race event in [[apartheid]] South Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cswc.div.ed.ac.uk/2018/03/billy-graham-1918-2018-prophet-of-world-christianity/|title=Billy Graham (1918\u20132018): Prophet of World Christianity?|last=Stanley|first=Brian|authorlink=Brian Stanley (historian)|date=March 2, 2018|website=Centre for the Study of World Christianity|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> In [[Moscow]], in 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 people in Graham's audience went forward at his call.<ref name=\"time1993\">Nancy Gibbs & Richard N.

Thirty days' notice is required before the order can be issued, and the scheduling expires after a year; however, the period may be extended six months if rulemaking proceedings to permanently schedule the drug are in progress. In any case, once these proceedings are complete, the temporary order is automatically vacated. Unlike ordinary scheduling proceedings, such temporary orders are not subject to [[judicial review]].\n\nThe CSA also creates a closed system of distribution<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Closed System of Controlled Substance Distribution |title=Pharmacy Practice and the Law |page=184 |first=Richard R. |last=Abood |date=21 November 2012 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett |isbn=978-1-4496-8691-8 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9gp80lkqXMC&pg=PA184 |access-date=2012-12-30 }}</ref> for those authorized to handle controlled substances. The cornerstone of this system is the registration of all those authorized by the DEA to handle controlled substances. All individuals and firms that are registered are required to maintain complete and accurate inventories and records of all transactions involving controlled substances, as well as security for the storage of controlled substances.\n\n==Treaty obligations==\nThe Congressional findings in [[21 USC]] \u00a7\u00a7 {{USCSub2|21|801|7}}, {{USCSub2|21|801a|2}}, and {{USCSub2|21|801a|3}} state that a major purpose of the CSA is to \"enable the United States to meet all of its obligations\" under international [[treaty|treaties]]. The CSA bears many resemblances to these Conventions. Both the CSA and the treaties set out a system for classifying controlled substances in several schedules in accordance with the binding scientific and medical findings of a public health authority. Under {{usc|21|811}} of the CSA, that authority is the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Under Article 3 of the Single Convention and Article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the [[World Health Organization]] is that authority.\n\nThe domestic and international legal nature of these treaty obligations must be considered in light of the supremacy of the [[United States Constitution]] over treaties or acts and the equality of treaties and Congressional acts. In ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] addressed both these issues directly and clearly holding:\n\n{{quote|\n[N]o agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.\n\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]], the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the Constitution, declares:\n\n\"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . .\"\n\nThere is nothing in this language which intimates that treaties and laws enacted pursuant to them do not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Nor is there anything in the debates which accompanied the drafting and ratification of the Constitution which even suggests such a result. These debates, as well as the history that surrounds the adoption of the treaty provision in Article VI, make it clear that the reason treaties were not limited to those made in \"pursuance\" of the Constitution was so that agreements made by the United States under the Articles of Confederation, including the important peace treaties which concluded the Revolutionary War, would remain in effect. It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for the Bill of Rights\u2014let alone alien to our entire constitutional history and tradition\u2014to construe Article VI as permitting the United States to exercise power under an international agreement without observing constitutional prohibitions. In effect, such construction would permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned by Article V. The prohibitions of the Constitution were designed to apply to all branches of the National Government, and they cannot be nullified by the Executive or by the Executive and the Senate combined.\n\nThere is nothing new or unique about what we say here. This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty. For example, in ''Geofroy v. Riggs'', 133 U. S. 258, 133 U. S. 267, it declared:\n\n\"The treaty power, as expressed in the Constitution, is in terms unlimited except by those restraints which are found in that instrument against the action of the government or of its departments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself and of that of the States. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government, or in that of one of the States, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent.\"\n\nThis Court has repeatedly taken the position that an Act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that, when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null. It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html|title=Reid v.

The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] and the [[President of the United States]] have the absolute [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] right to withdraw from or abrogate at any time these two instruments, in accordance with said nation's [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], at which point these treaties will cease to bind that nation in any way, shape, or form.<ref name=\"cato.org\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb108/hb108-17.pdf |title=Cato Handbook for Congress: Policy Recommendations for the 108th Congress |chapter=The War on Drugs |pages=171\u2013178 |year=2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>\n\nA provision for automatic compliance with treaty obligations is found at {{uscsub|21|811|d|}}, which also establishes mechanisms for amending international drug control regulations to correspond with HHS findings on scientific and medical issues. If control of a substance is mandated by the Single Convention, the Attorney General is required to \"issue an order controlling such drug under the schedule he deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations,\" without regard to the normal scheduling procedure or the findings of the HHS Secretary. However, the Secretary has great influence over any drug scheduling proposal under the Single Convention, because {{uscsub|21|811|d|2|B}} requires the Secretary the power to \"evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on the representative of the United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal.\"\n\nSimilarly, if the United Nations [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] adds or transfers a substance to a schedule established by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so that current U.S. regulations on the drug do not meet the treaty's requirements, the Secretary is required to issue a recommendation on how the substance should be scheduled under the CSA. If the Secretary agrees with the Commission's scheduling decision, he can recommend that the Attorney General initiate proceedings to reschedule the drug accordingly. If the HHS Secretary disagrees with the UN controls, however, the Attorney General must temporarily place the drug in Schedule IV or V (whichever meets the minimum requirements of the treaty) and exclude the substance from any regulations not mandated by the treaty, while the Secretary is required to request that the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] take action, through the Commission or the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], to remove the drug from international control or transfer it to a different schedule under the Convention. The temporary scheduling expires as soon as control is no longer needed to meet international treaty obligations.\n\nThis provision was invoked in 1984 to place Rohypnol ([[flunitrazepam]]) in Schedule IV. The drug did not then meet the Controlled Substances Act's criteria for scheduling; however, control was required by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In 1999, an FDA official explained to Congress:\n\n{{quote|Rohypnol is not approved or available for medical use in the United States, but it is temporarily controlled in Schedule IV pursuant to a treaty obligation under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. At the time flunitrazepam was placed temporarily in Schedule IV (November 5, 1984), there was no evidence of abuse or trafficking of the drug in the United States.<ref>[https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html \"Date Rape\" Drugs<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516010858/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html |date=2006-05-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Cato Institute]]'s ''Handbook for Congress'' calls for repealing the CSA, an action that would likely bring the United States into conflict with [[international law]], were the United States not to exercise its sovereign right to withdraw from and/or abrogate the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and/or the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] prior to repealing the Controlled Substances Act.<ref name=\"cato.org\"/> The exception would be if the U.S. were to claim that the treaty obligations violate the [[United States Constitution]].

This request is sent to the Assistant Secretary of Health of HHS. Then, HHS solicits information from the Commissioner of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and evaluations and recommendations from the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] and, on occasion, from the scientific and medical community at large.

An example is when international treaties require control of a substance. In addition, {{uscsub|21|811|h}} allows the Attorney General to temporarily place a substance in Schedule I \"to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety\". Thirty days' notice is required before the order can be issued, and the scheduling expires after a year; however, the period may be extended six months if rulemaking proceedings to permanently schedule the drug are in progress. In any case, once these proceedings are complete, the temporary order is automatically vacated. Unlike ordinary scheduling proceedings, such temporary orders are not subject to [[judicial review]].\n\nThe CSA also creates a closed system of distribution<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Closed System of Controlled Substance Distribution |title=Pharmacy Practice and the Law |page=184 |first=Richard R. |last=Abood |date=21 November 2012 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett |isbn=978-1-4496-8691-8 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9gp80lkqXMC&pg=PA184 |access-date=2012-12-30 }}</ref> for those authorized to handle controlled substances. The cornerstone of this system is the registration of all those authorized by the DEA to handle controlled substances. All individuals and firms that are registered are required to maintain complete and accurate inventories and records of all transactions involving controlled substances, as well as security for the storage of controlled substances.\n\n==Treaty obligations==\nThe Congressional findings in [[21 USC]] \u00a7\u00a7 {{USCSub2|21|801|7}}, {{USCSub2|21|801a|2}}, and {{USCSub2|21|801a|3}} state that a major purpose of the CSA is to \"enable the United States to meet all of its obligations\" under international [[treaty|treaties]]. The CSA bears many resemblances to these Conventions. Both the CSA and the treaties set out a system for classifying controlled substances in several schedules in accordance with the binding scientific and medical findings of a public health authority. Under {{usc|21|811}} of the CSA, that authority is the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Under Article 3 of the Single Convention and Article 2 of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, the [[World Health Organization]] is that authority.\n\nThe domestic and international legal nature of these treaty obligations must be considered in light of the supremacy of the [[United States Constitution]] over treaties or acts and the equality of treaties and Congressional acts. In ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] addressed both these issues directly and clearly holding:\n\n{{quote|\n[N]o agreement with a foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of Government, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.\n\n[[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]], the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the Constitution, declares:\n\n\"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof, and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . .\"\n\nThere is nothing in this language which intimates that treaties and laws enacted pursuant to them do not have to comply with the provisions of the Constitution. Nor is there anything in the debates which accompanied the drafting and ratification of the Constitution which even suggests such a result. These debates, as well as the history that surrounds the adoption of the treaty provision in Article VI, make it clear that the reason treaties were not limited to those made in \"pursuance\" of the Constitution was so that agreements made by the United States under the Articles of Confederation, including the important peace treaties which concluded the Revolutionary War, would remain in effect. It would be manifestly contrary to the objectives of those who created the Constitution, as well as those who were responsible for the Bill of Rights\u2014let alone alien to our entire constitutional history and tradition\u2014to construe Article VI as permitting the United States to exercise power under an international agreement without observing constitutional prohibitions. In effect, such construction would permit amendment of that document in a manner not sanctioned by Article V. The prohibitions of the Constitution were designed to apply to all branches of the National Government, and they cannot be nullified by the Executive or by the Executive and the Senate combined.\n\nThere is nothing new or unique about what we say here. This Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty. For example, in ''Geofroy v. Riggs'', 133 U. S. 258, 133 U. S. 267, it declared:\n\n\"The treaty power, as expressed in the Constitution, is in terms unlimited except by those restraints which are found in that instrument against the action of the government or of its departments, and those arising from the nature of the government itself and of that of the States. It would not be contended that it extends so far as to authorize what the Constitution forbids, or a change in the character of the government, or in that of one of the States, or a cession of any portion of the territory of the latter, without its consent.\"\n\nThis Court has repeatedly taken the position that an Act of Congress, which must comply with the Constitution, is on a full parity with a treaty, and that, when a statute which is subsequent in time is inconsistent with a treaty, the statute to the extent of conflict renders the treaty null. It would be completely anomalous to say that a treaty need not comply with the Constitution when such an agreement can be overridden by a statute that must conform to that instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/354/1/case.html|title=Reid v. Covert, 354 U.

The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] and the [[President of the United States]] have the absolute [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] right to withdraw from or abrogate at any time these two instruments, in accordance with said nation's [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], at which point these treaties will cease to bind that nation in any way, shape, or form.<ref name=\"cato.org\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb108/hb108-17.pdf |title=Cato Handbook for Congress: Policy Recommendations for the 108th Congress |chapter=The War on Drugs |pages=171\u2013178 |year=2003 |publisher=Cato Institute |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>\n\nA provision for automatic compliance with treaty obligations is found at {{uscsub|21|811|d|}}, which also establishes mechanisms for amending international drug control regulations to correspond with HHS findings on scientific and medical issues. If control of a substance is mandated by the Single Convention, the Attorney General is required to \"issue an order controlling such drug under the schedule he deems most appropriate to carry out such obligations,\" without regard to the normal scheduling procedure or the findings of the HHS Secretary. However, the Secretary has great influence over any drug scheduling proposal under the Single Convention, because {{uscsub|21|811|d|2|B}} requires the Secretary the power to \"evaluate the proposal and furnish a recommendation to the Secretary of State which shall be binding on the representative of the United States in discussions and negotiations relating to the proposal.\"\n\nSimilarly, if the United Nations [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] adds or transfers a substance to a schedule established by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so that current U.S. regulations on the drug do not meet the treaty's requirements, the Secretary is required to issue a recommendation on how the substance should be scheduled under the CSA. If the Secretary agrees with the Commission's scheduling decision, he can recommend that the Attorney General initiate proceedings to reschedule the drug accordingly. If the HHS Secretary disagrees with the UN controls, however, the Attorney General must temporarily place the drug in Schedule IV or V (whichever meets the minimum requirements of the treaty) and exclude the substance from any regulations not mandated by the treaty, while the Secretary is required to request that the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] take action, through the Commission or the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], to remove the drug from international control or transfer it to a different schedule under the Convention. The temporary scheduling expires as soon as control is no longer needed to meet international treaty obligations.\n\nThis provision was invoked in 1984 to place Rohypnol ([[flunitrazepam]]) in Schedule IV. The drug did not then meet the Controlled Substances Act's criteria for scheduling; however, control was required by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In 1999, an FDA official explained to Congress:\n\n{{quote|Rohypnol is not approved or available for medical use in the United States, but it is temporarily controlled in Schedule IV pursuant to a treaty obligation under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. At the time flunitrazepam was placed temporarily in Schedule IV (November 5, 1984), there was no evidence of abuse or trafficking of the drug in the United States.<ref>[https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html \"Date Rape\" Drugs<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516010858/http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t990311b.html |date=2006-05-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Cato Institute]]'s ''Handbook for Congress'' calls for repealing the CSA, an action that would likely bring the United States into conflict with [[international law]], were the United States not to exercise its sovereign right to withdraw from and/or abrogate the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and/or the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] prior to repealing the Controlled Substances Act.<ref name=\"cato.org\"/> The exception would be if the U.S. were to claim that the treaty obligations violate the [[United States Constitution]].
