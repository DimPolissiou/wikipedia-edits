As one of Nintendo's most famous and familiar icons, Kirby's round appearance and ability to copy his foes' powers has made him a well-known figure in video games, consistently ranked as one of the most iconic video game characters. He first appeared in 1992 in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the [[Game Boy]]. Originally a placeholder, created by [[Masahiro Sakurai]], at the age of 19, for the game's early development, he has since then starred in over 20 games, ranging from [[Action game|action]] [[Platform game|platformers]] to [[Puzzle game|puzzle]], [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]], and even [[Kirby's Pinball Land|pinball]], and has been featured as a playable fighter in all ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' games. He has also starred in his own [[Kirby: Right Back at Ya|anime]] and manga series. His most recent appearance is in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. Since 1999, he has been voiced by [[Makiko Ohmoto]].\n\nKirby is well known for his ability to inhale objects and creatures to gain their abilities, also he Kirby also met this guy named Josh Platten when he went to war. Kirby kidnapped and tortured him. Josh is now dead(Don't tell Mario). :(, as well as his ability to float by expanding his body. He uses these abilities to rescue various lands, including his homeworld of Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as [[Dark Matter (Kirby)|Dark Matter]] or [[Nightmare (Kirby)|Nightmare]]. On these adventures he often crosses paths with his rivals, the gluttonous [[King Dedede]] and the mysterious [[Meta Knight]], though Meta Knight can be seen as a hero, depending on the game. Kirby has been described as one of the most legendary video game characters of all time by ''[[PC World]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/220620/25_legendary_video_game_characters.html|title=25 Legendary Video Game Characters|magazine=PC World|last=Filice|first=Albert|date=3 March 2011}}</ref> In virtually all his appearances, Kirby is depicted as cheerful, innocent and food-loving but becomes fearless, bold and clever in the face of danger.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nKirby was created by video game designer [[Masahiro Sakurai]] as the [[player character]] of the 1992 game ''Kirby's Dream Land''. The character's design was intended to serve as placeholder graphics for the game's original protagonist in early development and thus was given a simplistic ball-like appearance. Sakurai switched to the placeholder design for the final character design when he believed that it served the character better.<ref name=\"kirby facts\">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/41729/11-amazing-kirby-facts-and-secrets/ | title=11 amazing Kirby facts and secrets | author=Zablotny, Marc | date=September 10, 2012 | work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] | accessdate=January 23, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031152020/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/41729/11-amazing-kirby-facts-and-secrets/ | archive-date=October 31, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The character was known as {{nihongo|Popopo|\u30dd\u30dd\u30dd}} during development until the name \"Kirby\" was chosen from a draft list of potential names. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated that \"Kirby\" was chosen in honor of American lawyer [[John Kirby (attorney)|John Kirby]], who defended Nintendo in the ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'' case in 1984 and that the [[guttural]]-sounding name contrasted amusingly with the character's cute appearance.<ref name=\"Kirby's name origin\">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/42153/how-did-mario-get-his-name-and-the-origins-of-your-favourite-nintendo-stars/?page=6 | title=How did your favourite Nintendo characters get their names? | author=Zablotny, Marc | date=September 20, 2012 | work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] | accessdate=March 26, 2014 | url-status=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924055013/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/42153/how-did-mario-get-his-name-and-the-origins-of-your-favourite-nintendo-stars/?page=6 | archivedate=September 24, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/06/17/miyamoto-wii-amp-wii-u-are-colored-white-for-all-ages-appeal.aspx|title=Miyamoto Talks Wii U, Zelda, And Nintendo's Past|last=Turi|first=Tim|website=Game Informer|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=October 26, 2018}}</ref> Kirby appears white in ''Kirby's Dream Land'' due to the [[grayscale]] [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of the Game Boy system. Sakurai intended the character to be pink, though Miyamoto originally wanted the character to be yellow. Kirby does appear white in the game's North American promotional materials and artwork to reflect the character's in-game appearance.<ref name=\"kirby facts\"/>\n\nIn North America, Kirby consistently appears in artwork with a more striking, bolder expression than in Japan, where his expression is more relaxed. Nintendo has said that the more battle-ready appearance appeals to a wider audience in North America.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-is-kirby-always-angry-in-the-us-nintendo-explains/1100-6419263/ | title=Why is Kirby always angry in the US? Nintendo explains | author=Gaston, Martin | date=April 28, 2014 | publisher = Gamespot}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical appearance===\nKirby has a pink, spherical, body with small stubby arms and large red feet. His eyes are a distinctive oval shape and are white (eye shine) at the top, black in the center and dark blue on the bottom (all black in early games) with rosy cheek-blushes near his eyes. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch or flatten and adopt different shapes, open his mouth really wide to inhale foes, or inflate himself with air and fly. According to the ''Super Smash Bros.'' manual he is 8 inches (or 20.32 centimeters) tall,<ref name=profilejp>{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0003/miryoku/index.html|title = Kirby's profile|accessdate = 2008-09-02|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.|language = Japanese}}</ref><ref>''Super Smash Bros.'' - Kirby's in-game biography</ref> however the games themselves are inconsistent with Kirby's height. Kirby's appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger blue eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\n===Personality===\nKirby hails from the distant Planet Popstar, where he lives in a dome-shaped house in the country of Dream Land. He has a positive attitude, and frequently helps to save Dream Land through the use of his unique powers. His age is never directly stated, although he is referred to as a \"little boy\" in the English manual for ''Kirby's Dream Land'', described as a baby in the anime, and was referred to as being a \"jolly fellow\" in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]''.\n\nKirby is cheerful and innocent. He is often depicted with a voracious appetite. His other hobbies include singing, although he is [[tone deafness|tone-deaf]].<ref name=\"profilejp\"/>\n\nThe same personality and nature is presented in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' games. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', his trophy profile states that he is an \"extremely skilled technician\". Kirby plays a prominent role in the Subspace Emissary plot as a protagonist, the story mode of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. Although he appears cute and innocent, many commercials and ads have contrasted this with his extreme fighting skills when he takes on the abilities of an enemy.\n\nKirby is a character of few words and rarely speaks in-game. His dialogue is largely limited to appearances in some games' instruction manuals, and brief comments such as \"Hi!\" or \"Poyo!\" in games including ''Super Smash Bros.'' and ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]''. Despite his lack of dialogue, Kirby narrates the functions of certain Copy Abilities on the pause menu in ''[[Kirby's Adventure#Remakes and ports|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', and ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]''. Kirby gives short descriptions of various menu options when they are highlighted. The concept of Kirby being mostly mute is supported by Masahiro Sakurai's insistence that Kirby does not speak in the [[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!#Production|anime series]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, although he does occasionally say the names of his special attacks and certain foods and sometimes repeats other words that he hears. In the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, when Kirby copies a foe's ability, Kirby says the name of some attacks, such as [[Captain Falcon]]'s \"Falcon Punch\", Ness' PK Flash, Lucas' PK Freeze, Ryu's Hadoken/Shakunetsu Hadoken, \"Jump/Speed/Shield/Buster/Smash\" when using [[Shulk]]'s Monado Arts and [[Terry Bogard]]'s Power Wave. There are some notable exceptions where Kirby actually does speak in-game, such as ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker#Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu|Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]''.\n\nDespite his loveable nature, he sometimes acts in an impulsive or naive way, such as when he accuses King Dedede of interfering with the Fountain of Dreams in ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', and then leaves to retrieve the pieces of the shattered Star Rod without receiving a full explanation.<ref name = \"adventure\">{{cite web|url = http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/games/adventure/instruction.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080320121750/http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/games/adventure/instruction.html|archivedate = 2008-03-20|title = ''Kirby's Adventure'' instruction manual|accessdate = 2008-09-02}}</ref> He also attacked Meta Knight in ''[[Kirby Squeak Squad]]'' for ownership of a chest that he believed contained a slice of his stolen strawberry shortcake. In reality, the Star Rod was going to be taken by Nightmare, who would corrupt the Fountain of Dreams and turn every dream into a Nightmare, and the chest that Kirby wanted contained Dark Nebula, a powerful being with evil intentions. King Dedede and Meta Knight were aware of these problems, and were trying to protect the world.\n\n===Abilities===\n[[File:Kirby_gets_an_ability_(videogame_gameplay).png|thumb|Kirby can gain the properties of enemies or objects he eats. For example; by inhaling a sword wielding foe, Kirby becomes a skilled swordsman.]]Kirby's main ability is inhaling enemies and objects and spitting them out with incredible force. Both his mouth and body expand to allow him to inhale things much larger than himself. However, there is a limit to what he can inhale; excessively large or heavy foes like [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] can resist Kirby's inhale. Against these opponents Kirby must find smaller objects to use as ammo or intercept his opponent's attacks and send them back at them.\n\nKirby is able to float like a balloon by inhaling a gulp of air to make himself more buoyant, flying slowly by flapping his arms. However, his only method of attack in this state is to spit the gulp of air, sending him back towards the ground. While in most games he can float indefinitely, he gets tired in some games such as ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', [[Team Kirby Clash Deluxe]], [[Kirby Fighters Deluxe]] and ''Super Smash Bros.''.\n\nKirby's main mode of transportation is a star shaped, flying vehicle called a Warp Star. By clinging to its side or riding it like a surfboard Kirby is able to move quickly through the air and travel quickly between areas.\n\nFrom the [[Kirby's Adventure|second game]] onwards, by swallowing foes, Kirby can copy their primary attribute, called a Copy Ability. Giving Kirby new abilities such as gaining fire abilities from inhaling a fiery creature or the ability to shoot needles from his body by eating a spiky creature. Kirby can only have one Copy Ability at a time and must discard his current one if he wishes to use another. Additionally, if he takes too much damage his Copy Ability will be knocked out of him; though if he's quick he can inhale it again.\n\n''Kirby Super Star'' greatly expanded on the concept of Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure''. Originally Kirby just obtained one technique from a Copy Ability which replaced his Inhale but ''Kirby Super Star'' introduced multiple fighting techniques for each ability with their own controls. Additionally while ''Kirby's Adventure'' didn't have Kirby's appearance drastically change when he had a Copy Ability, aside from his color changing to orange or snow white, or wielding a weapon for abilities like ''Sword'' or ''Hammer''. ''Kirby Super Star'' gave each Copy Ability its own costume, such as a fiery crown for Fire Kirby or a floppy green cap that resembles [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link's]] for Sword Kirby.\n\nIn ''Kirby Super Star'', Kirby could sacrifice his current Copy Ability to create a 'Helper', an allied version of the enemy Kirby typically gets that ability from.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.digitpress.com/library/manuals/snes/kirby%20super%20star.pdf|title = ''Kirby Super Star'' manual|page = 10|publisher = Nintendo of America}}</ref> The new Helper could be controlled by the game or a second player. This feature has not yet been included in later Kirby games, although it was included in ''Kirby Super Star's'' remake, ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'' and was intended to return in the cancelled ''Gamecube Kirby'' game which would have had Kirby able to make up to four helpers at once. In the game [[Kirby Star Allies]], the game\u2019s main mechanic is similar to this, but with now up to 3 helpers.\n\nOther games have developed his powers even further, often with new ways to utilize his Copy Abilities. As a whole, however, his basic moves have remained the same. In ''Kirby 64'' Kirby can combine two Copy Abilities to create new ones. This returns in ''Kirby: Squeak Squad'' in a limited form, but only with Bomb and Sword which are both able to combine with Ice, Fire, and Spark. In Kirby Star Allies, this returns again with more combinations available to the player.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', some Copy Abilities received enhanced versions called Super Abilities. Stronger than normal Copy Abilities, Super Abilities are capable of destroying scenery and interacting with the environment but unlike normal Copy Abilities their use has a time limit. Likewise, in ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'', Kirby can eat a Miracle Fruit to become Hypernova Kirby, giving his basic inhale ability a temporary boost that allows him to inhale huge objects.\n\nIn addition to his natural and Copy Abilities Kirby makes use of a variety of power-ups and items. In ''Kirby's Dream Land'', Kirby's first appearance, Kirby did not have Copy Abilities. He collected power ups, such as a mint leaf, which enabled him to shoot out endless air pellets for a limited amount of time, and super spicy curry, which let Kirby shoot out fireballs from his mouth until the item's effect wore off or he lost a life. Kirby uses food or other special items like Maxim Tomatoes or Invincibility Lollipops to heal his health or gain temporary invincibility in the case of the lollipop. ''Kirby Super Star'', ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' contain a feature where Kirby can share his food with the second player.\n\nIn ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', Kirby's Final Smash is his Cook ability from ''Kirby Super Star'', which cook opponents, items and more.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/16/6179547/super-smash-bros-3ds-wii-u-final-smash|title=Super Smash Bros 3DS final smashes, compared to Brawl|last=Riendeau|first=Danielle|date=2014-09-16|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref> In ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', Kirby's Final Smash is an Ultra Sword attack.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'' and its 3DS remake, at the start of the game, Kirby inhales a yarn-based Maxim Tomato (referred to by Yin-Yarn as a Metamato) transforming him into yarn, granting Kirby the ability to transform into a car, a surfboarding penguin, a ''[[UFO]]'', and many other forms. Also, since Kirby cannot suck up enemies in this game (since air just goes through him), he uses a yarn whip to grab enemies and turn them into yarn balls, which can be thrown at other foes, attached to buttons, move zippers and more.\n\n===Species===\nAlthough never explored in great detail in the series, Kirby is not the only member of his kind. Similar looking characters are seen in the ending of ''Kirby's Dream Land'', and its remake ''Spring Breeze'' in ''Kirby Super Star.'' Meta Knight and Galacta Knight, both of whom bear a close resemblance to Kirby without their masks are often hinted to be of the same species as Kirby. In general, members of the species all look similar, but sometimes have different colored skin, eyes, and feet.\n\nNo official term exists for them other than Kirby's species. They are commonly referred to as 'Kirbys', just as [[Yoshi]] in the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' series]] is the name of both the species and character. As a name, however, 'Kirby' refers to only one character. In the English manual of ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'', the term 'Kirbys' is used at points, to illustrate the feature of having four differently colored versions of Kirby active in the game simultaneously, although in this situation the four \"Kirbys\" are four pieces of Kirby rather than four individual Kirby-like beings. Another common term is 'Dream Landers', a term used in the instruction manual for ''Kirby's Adventure''.<ref name=\"adventure\"/> This term, however, also refers to anyone who lives in Dream Land, including characters like King Dedede. The biography of Kirby in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' says Kirby is a [[Citizenship|citizen]] of Dream Land.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/characters/kirby.html|title = Smash Bros. DOJO! - Kirby's Profile|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.}}</ref> Sometimes the term 'puffballs' is used referring to the species' round shape.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Adventure#Remakes and ports|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'' and ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', different colored Kirbys appear as other players in multi-player games. In the case of the latter, they are the result of Kirby being divided into four by Dark Meta Knight.<ref name = \"katam\">{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/bk8j/story/index.html|title = Kirby & the Amazing Mirror Story|accessdate = 2006-11-21|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.|language = Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn the anime, Kirby has also been called a Star Warrior, along with Meta Knight and other characters that have appeared in the Kirby animated series. It is said that Kirby is just a young Star Warrior or an underdeveloped one. In the first episode of the animated series, Kirby's space ship prematurely crashed on Pop Star. The trip was supposed to take him several hundred years and in that time he was supposed to be dormant; however, his ship drifted into a space rift causing it to warp to Dream Land and making his trip shorter, not allowing him to develop into the Star Warrior he was going to become. Kirby was also called a Warpstar Knight or a Warpstar Warrior, but this was only occasionally seen in select advertisements.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', a mysterious enemy appears called Batamon, notable for its resemblance to Kirby aside from a more flattened shape and different face. These creatures are always seen walking past walls or ceilings beyond Kirby's reach, with the exception of a single stage in Cloudy Park, where Kirby can continue past the exit and come into contact with some.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Main series===\n{{main|Kirby (series)}}\n\nKirby's primary media form is video games, as he is the star and protagonist of the Nintendo owned series named after him. Most Kirby games are [[platform games]] in which Kirby fights enemies, solves puzzles, and challenges bosses. Each game typically adds a new twist or change to Kirby's abilities that the levels of the game emphasize, such as combining power ups in ''Kirby 64'' or Super Abilities in ''Return to Dream Land''. Most games involve Kirby saving a world or even universe from a dark, evil force of some kind. Typical Kirby games have a powerful being, such as Dark Matter or Nightmare, controlling or corrupting a secondary villain.\n\nThe series has 26 games currently, with the first being ''Kirby's Dream Land'' in 1992 and the latest being ''Kirby Star Allies'' in 2018. Although most are platform games, some spin offs have included pinball, racing, and puzzle games.\n\n===''Super Smash Bros.'' series===\nKirby appears in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series of games as a playable character, which is also created by Masahiro Sakurai. He is the sole ''Kirby'' series representative in ''[[Super Smash Bros. (video game)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', and has been one of three (the others being Meta Knight and King Dedede) as of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. He reprises his role as a playable character in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', the latter of which features him playing a starring role in the \"World of Light\" story mode.\n\n===Anime===\n{{main|Kirby: Right Back at Ya!}}\nKirby appears in his own [[anime]] titled '''''Kirby: Right Back at Ya!''''', (Japanese: \u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3 ''Hoshi no Kaabii'') in Japan. The series was licensed in [[North America]] by [[4Kids Entertainment]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] company [[Nelvana]], and produced by Warpstar Inc., a company formed between a joint investment between Nintendo and [[HAL Laboratory]]. It aired on [[4Kids Entertainment|4Kids TV]], via [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting]] (since 2001 which has done 100 episodes).\n\nThe anime series is set in its own universe independent of the games and offers its own take on the setting and characters, however, Kirby's creator, Masahiro Sakurai, was greatly involved in its creation, so it did not stray far from his vision of how Kirby should be.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2001/08/21/103%2C998390482%2C934%2C0%2C0.html|title = Kirby article|accessdate = 2006-12-07|publisher = [[Famitsu|Famitsu Magazine]]|language = Japanese}}</ref> The anime contains darker themes such as war, and death while still maintaining the cheerful and surreal themes the games are known for.\n\nIn the anime Kirby's origin and backstory are explored much more deeply than in the games. Kirby is a legendary Star Warrior who, according to legend, is fated to save Pop Star from destruction, but he was awoken from his slumber 200 years too early by mistake and as such has many baby or childlike qualities. Because of his age, he is still getting the hang of his powers and depends even more on the help of his friends to pull through tough situations. It is also implied that Kirby was originally a creation of the ancient evil entity called [[List of Kirby characters#Nightmare|Nightmare]] but refused to follow his evil orders and was discarded into the depths of space.\n\nKirby's Warpstar is also expanded upon, as in the games it is a mode of transportation, but here the Warpstar is also the source of his power but as he's too young to keep it safe for himself the character Tiff takes it upon herself to keep the Warpstar safe.\n\nThough Sakurai instructed that Kirby not speak in full sentences (citing the ''[[Peanuts]]'' character [[Snoopy]]) he did allow him to use a small vocabulary including a catch phrase \"Poyo\" and the names of various attacks and characters.\n\nPrior to this Kirby was also in a short educational video that was released exclusively in Japan in 1994, designed to teach [[Kanji]] to young children. The feature was not animated, but contained illustrations and was bundled with a similar video featuring [[Mario]] and [[Wario]].\n\n===Manga and comics===\nKirby also stars in several [[manga]] series, most of which have only been released in Japanese. The longest running series is titled \u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3 \u30c7\u30c7\u30c7\u3067\u30d7\u30d7\u30d7\u306a\u3082\u306e\u304c\u305f\u308a (''lit.

As one of Nintendo's most famous and familiar icons, Kirby's round appearance and ability to copy his foes' powers has made him a well-known figure in video games, consistently ranked as one of the most iconic video game characters. He first appeared in 1992 in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the [[Game Boy]]. Originally a placeholder, created by [[Masahiro Sakurai]], at the age of 19, for the game's early development, he has since then starred in over 20 games, ranging from [[Action game|action]] [[Platform game|platformers]] to [[Puzzle game|puzzle]], [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]], and even [[Kirby's Pinball Land|pinball]], and has been featured as a playable fighter in all ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' games. He has also starred in his own [[Kirby: Right Back at Ya|anime]] and manga series. His most recent appearance is in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. Since 1999, he has been voiced by [[Makiko Ohmoto]].\n\nKirby is well known for his ability to inhale objects and creatures to gain their abilities, as well as his ability to float by expanding his body. He uses these abilities to rescue various lands, including his homeworld of Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as [[Dark Matter (Kirby)|Dark Matter]] or [[Nightmare (Kirby)|Nightmare]]. On these adventures he often crosses paths with his rivals, the gluttonous [[King Dedede]] and the mysterious [[Meta Knight]], though Meta Knight can be seen as a hero, depending on the game. Kirby has been described as one of the most legendary video game characters of all time by ''[[PC World]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/220620/25_legendary_video_game_characters.html|title=25 Legendary Video Game Characters|magazine=PC World|last=Filice|first=Albert|date=3 March 2011}}</ref> In virtually all his appearances, Kirby is depicted as cheerful, innocent and food-loving but becomes fearless, bold and clever in the face of danger.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nKirby was created by video game designer [[Masahiro Sakurai]] as the [[player character]] of the 1992 game ''Kirby's Dream Land''. The character's design was intended to serve as placeholder graphics for the game's original protagonist in early development and thus was given a simplistic ball-like appearance. Sakurai switched to the placeholder design for the final character design when he believed that it served the character better.<ref name=\"kirby facts\">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/41729/11-amazing-kirby-facts-and-secrets/ | title=11 amazing Kirby facts and secrets | author=Zablotny, Marc | date=September 10, 2012 | work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] | accessdate=January 23, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031152020/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/41729/11-amazing-kirby-facts-and-secrets/ | archive-date=October 31, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The character was known as {{nihongo|Popopo|\u30dd\u30dd\u30dd}} during development until the name \"Kirby\" was chosen from a draft list of potential names. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated that \"Kirby\" was chosen in honor of American lawyer [[John Kirby (attorney)|John Kirby]], who defended Nintendo in the ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'' case in 1984 and that the [[guttural]]-sounding name contrasted amusingly with the character's cute appearance.<ref name=\"Kirby's name origin\">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/42153/how-did-mario-get-his-name-and-the-origins-of-your-favourite-nintendo-stars/?page=6 | title=How did your favourite Nintendo characters get their names? | author=Zablotny, Marc | date=September 20, 2012 | work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] | accessdate=March 26, 2014 | url-status=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924055013/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/42153/how-did-mario-get-his-name-and-the-origins-of-your-favourite-nintendo-stars/?page=6 | archivedate=September 24, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/06/17/miyamoto-wii-amp-wii-u-are-colored-white-for-all-ages-appeal.aspx|title=Miyamoto Talks Wii U, Zelda, And Nintendo's Past|last=Turi|first=Tim|website=Game Informer|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=October 26, 2018}}</ref> Kirby appears white in ''Kirby's Dream Land'' due to the [[grayscale]] [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of the Game Boy system. Sakurai intended the character to be pink, though Miyamoto originally wanted the character to be yellow. Kirby does appear white in the game's North American promotional materials and artwork to reflect the character's in-game appearance.<ref name=\"kirby facts\"/>\n\nIn North America, Kirby consistently appears in artwork with a more striking, bolder expression than in Japan, where his expression is more relaxed. Nintendo has said that the more battle-ready appearance appeals to a wider audience in North America.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-is-kirby-always-angry-in-the-us-nintendo-explains/1100-6419263/ | title=Why is Kirby always angry in the US? Nintendo explains | author=Gaston, Martin | date=April 28, 2014 | publisher = Gamespot}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical appearance===\nKirby has a pink, spherical, body with small stubby arms and large red feet. His eyes are a distinctive oval shape and are white (eye shine) at the top, black in the center and dark blue on the bottom (all black in early games) with rosy cheek-blushes near his eyes. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch or flatten and adopt different shapes, open his mouth really wide to inhale foes, or inflate himself with air and fly. According to the ''Super Smash Bros.'' manual he is 8 inches (or 20.32 centimeters) tall,<ref name=profilejp>{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0003/miryoku/index.html|title = Kirby's profile|accessdate = 2008-09-02|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.|language = Japanese}}</ref><ref>''Super Smash Bros.'' - Kirby's in-game biography</ref> however the games themselves are inconsistent with Kirby's height. Kirby's appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger blue eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\n===Personality===\nKirby hails from the distant Planet Popstar, where he lives in a dome-shaped house in the country of Dream Land. He has a positive attitude, and frequently helps to save Dream Land through the use of his unique powers. His age is never directly stated, although he is referred to as a \"little boy\" in the English manual for ''Kirby's Dream Land'', described as a baby in the anime, and was referred to as being a \"jolly fellow\" in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]''.\n\nKirby is cheerful and innocent. He is often depicted with a voracious appetite. His other hobbies include singing, although he is [[tone deafness|tone-deaf]].<ref name=\"profilejp\"/>\n\nThe same personality and nature is presented in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' games. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', his trophy profile states that he is an \"extremely skilled technician\". Kirby plays a prominent role in the Subspace Emissary plot as a protagonist, the story mode of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. Although he appears cute and innocent, many commercials and ads have contrasted this with his extreme fighting skills when he takes on the abilities of an enemy.\n\nKirby is a character of few words and rarely speaks in-game. His dialogue is largely limited to appearances in some games' instruction manuals, and brief comments such as \"Hi!\" or \"Poyo!\" in games including ''Super Smash Bros.'' and ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]''. Despite his lack of dialogue, Kirby narrates the functions of certain Copy Abilities on the pause menu in ''[[Kirby's Adventure#Remakes and ports|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', and ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]''. Kirby gives short descriptions of various menu options when they are highlighted. The concept of Kirby being mostly mute is supported by Masahiro Sakurai's insistence that Kirby does not speak in the [[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!#Production|anime series]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, although he does occasionally say the names of his special attacks and certain foods and sometimes repeats other words that he hears. In the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, when Kirby copies a foe's ability, Kirby says the name of some attacks, such as [[Captain Falcon]]'s \"Falcon Punch\", Ness' PK Flash, Lucas' PK Freeze, Ryu's Hadoken/Shakunetsu Hadoken, \"Jump/Speed/Shield/Buster/Smash\" when using [[Shulk]]'s Monado Arts and [[Terry Bogard]]'s Power Wave. There are some notable exceptions where Kirby actually does speak in-game, such as ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker#Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu|Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]''.\n\nDespite his loveable nature, he sometimes acts in an impulsive or naive way, such as when he accuses King Dedede of interfering with the Fountain of Dreams in ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', and then leaves to retrieve the pieces of the shattered Star Rod without receiving a full explanation.<ref name = \"adventure\">{{cite web|url = http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/games/adventure/instruction.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080320121750/http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/games/adventure/instruction.html|archivedate = 2008-03-20|title = ''Kirby's Adventure'' instruction manual|accessdate = 2008-09-02}}</ref> He also attacked Meta Knight in ''[[Kirby Squeak Squad]]'' for ownership of a chest that he believed contained a slice of his stolen strawberry shortcake. In reality, the Star Rod was going to be taken by Nightmare, who would corrupt the Fountain of Dreams and turn every dream into a Nightmare, and the chest that Kirby wanted contained Dark Nebula, a powerful being with evil intentions. King Dedede and Meta Knight were aware of these problems, and were trying to protect the world.\n\n===Abilities===\n[[File:Kirby_gets_an_ability_(videogame_gameplay).png|thumb|Kirby can gain the properties of enemies or objects he eats. For example; by inhaling a sword wielding foe, Kirby becomes a skilled swordsman.]]Kirby's main ability is inhaling enemies and objects and spitting them out with incredible force. Both his mouth and body expand to allow him to inhale things much larger than himself. However, there is a limit to what he can inhale; excessively large or heavy foes like [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] can resist Kirby's inhale. Against these opponents Kirby must find smaller objects to use as ammo or intercept his opponent's attacks and send them back at them.\n\nKirby is able to float like a balloon by inhaling a gulp of air to make himself more buoyant, flying slowly by flapping his arms. However, his only method of attack in this state is to spit the gulp of air, sending him back towards the ground. While in most games he can float indefinitely, he gets tired in some games such as ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', [[Team Kirby Clash Deluxe]], [[Kirby Fighters Deluxe]] and ''Super Smash Bros.''.\n\nKirby's main mode of transportation is a star shaped, flying vehicle called a Warp Star. By clinging to its side or riding it like a surfboard Kirby is able to move quickly through the air and travel quickly between areas.\n\nFrom the [[Kirby's Adventure|second game]] onwards, by swallowing foes, Kirby can copy their primary attribute, called a Copy Ability. Giving Kirby new abilities such as gaining fire abilities from inhaling a fiery creature or the ability to shoot needles from his body by eating a spiky creature. Kirby can only have one Copy Ability at a time and must discard his current one if he wishes to use another. Additionally, if he takes too much damage his Copy Ability will be knocked out of him; though if he's quick he can inhale it again.\n\n''Kirby Super Star'' greatly expanded on the concept of Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure''. Originally Kirby just obtained one technique from a Copy Ability which replaced his Inhale but ''Kirby Super Star'' introduced multiple fighting techniques for each ability with their own controls. Additionally while ''Kirby's Adventure'' didn't have Kirby's appearance drastically change when he had a Copy Ability, aside from his color changing to orange or snow white, or wielding a weapon for abilities like ''Sword'' or ''Hammer''. ''Kirby Super Star'' gave each Copy Ability its own costume, such as a fiery crown for Fire Kirby or a floppy green cap that resembles [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link's]] for Sword Kirby.\n\nIn ''Kirby Super Star'', Kirby could sacrifice his current Copy Ability to create a 'Helper', an allied version of the enemy Kirby typically gets that ability from.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.digitpress.com/library/manuals/snes/kirby%20super%20star.pdf|title = ''Kirby Super Star'' manual|page = 10|publisher = Nintendo of America}}</ref> The new Helper could be controlled by the game or a second player. This feature has not yet been included in later Kirby games, although it was included in ''Kirby Super Star's'' remake, ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'' and was intended to return in the cancelled ''Gamecube Kirby'' game which would have had Kirby able to make up to four helpers at once. In the game [[Kirby Star Allies]], the game\u2019s main mechanic is similar to this, but with now up to 3 helpers.\n\nOther games have developed his powers even further, often with new ways to utilize his Copy Abilities. As a whole, however, his basic moves have remained the same. In ''Kirby 64'' Kirby can combine two Copy Abilities to create new ones. This returns in ''Kirby: Squeak Squad'' in a limited form, but only with Bomb and Sword which are both able to combine with Ice, Fire, and Spark. In Kirby Star Allies, this returns again with more combinations available to the player.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', some Copy Abilities received enhanced versions called Super Abilities. Stronger than normal Copy Abilities, Super Abilities are capable of destroying scenery and interacting with the environment but unlike normal Copy Abilities their use has a time limit. Likewise, in ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'', Kirby can eat a Miracle Fruit to become Hypernova Kirby, giving his basic inhale ability a temporary boost that allows him to inhale huge objects.\n\nIn addition to his natural and Copy Abilities Kirby makes use of a variety of power-ups and items. In ''Kirby's Dream Land'', Kirby's first appearance, Kirby did not have Copy Abilities. He collected power ups, such as a mint leaf, which enabled him to shoot out endless air pellets for a limited amount of time, and super spicy curry, which let Kirby shoot out fireballs from his mouth until the item's effect wore off or he lost a life. Kirby uses food or other special items like Maxim Tomatoes or Invincibility Lollipops to heal his health or gain temporary invincibility in the case of the lollipop. ''Kirby Super Star'', ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' contain a feature where Kirby can share his food with the second player.\n\nIn ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', Kirby's Final Smash is his Cook ability from ''Kirby Super Star'', which cook opponents, items and more.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/16/6179547/super-smash-bros-3ds-wii-u-final-smash|title=Super Smash Bros 3DS final smashes, compared to Brawl|last=Riendeau|first=Danielle|date=2014-09-16|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref> In ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', Kirby's Final Smash is an Ultra Sword attack.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'' and its 3DS remake, at the start of the game, Kirby inhales a yarn-based Maxim Tomato (referred to by Yin-Yarn as a Metamato) transforming him into yarn, granting Kirby the ability to transform into a car, a surfboarding penguin, a ''[[UFO]]'', and many other forms. Also, since Kirby cannot suck up enemies in this game (since air just goes through him), he uses a yarn whip to grab enemies and turn them into yarn balls, which can be thrown at other foes, attached to buttons, move zippers and more.\n\n===Species===\nAlthough never explored in great detail in the series, Kirby is not the only member of his kind. Similar looking characters are seen in the ending of ''Kirby's Dream Land'', and its remake ''Spring Breeze'' in ''Kirby Super Star.'' Meta Knight and Galacta Knight, both of whom bear a close resemblance to Kirby without their masks are often hinted to be of the same species as Kirby. In general, members of the species all look similar, but sometimes have different colored skin, eyes, and feet.\n\nNo official term exists for them other than Kirby's species. They are commonly referred to as 'Kirbys', just as [[Yoshi]] in the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' series]] is the name of both the species and character. As a name, however, 'Kirby' refers to only one character. In the English manual of ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'', the term 'Kirbys' is used at points, to illustrate the feature of having four differently colored versions of Kirby active in the game simultaneously, although in this situation the four \"Kirbys\" are four pieces of Kirby rather than four individual Kirby-like beings. Another common term is 'Dream Landers', a term used in the instruction manual for ''Kirby's Adventure''.<ref name=\"adventure\"/> This term, however, also refers to anyone who lives in Dream Land, including characters like King Dedede. The biography of Kirby in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' says Kirby is a [[Citizenship|citizen]] of Dream Land.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/characters/kirby.html|title = Smash Bros. DOJO! - Kirby's Profile|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.}}</ref> Sometimes the term 'puffballs' is used referring to the species' round shape.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Adventure#Remakes and ports|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'' and ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', different colored Kirbys appear as other players in multi-player games. In the case of the latter, they are the result of Kirby being divided into four by Dark Meta Knight.<ref name = \"katam\">{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/bk8j/story/index.html|title = Kirby & the Amazing Mirror Story|accessdate = 2006-11-21|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.|language = Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn the anime, Kirby has also been called a Star Warrior, along with Meta Knight and other characters that have appeared in the Kirby animated series. It is said that Kirby is just a young Star Warrior or an underdeveloped one. In the first episode of the animated series, Kirby's space ship prematurely crashed on Pop Star. The trip was supposed to take him several hundred years and in that time he was supposed to be dormant; however, his ship drifted into a space rift causing it to warp to Dream Land and making his trip shorter, not allowing him to develop into the Star Warrior he was going to become. Kirby was also called a Warpstar Knight or a Warpstar Warrior, but this was only occasionally seen in select advertisements.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', a mysterious enemy appears called Batamon, notable for its resemblance to Kirby aside from a more flattened shape and different face. These creatures are always seen walking past walls or ceilings beyond Kirby's reach, with the exception of a single stage in Cloudy Park, where Kirby can continue past the exit and come into contact with some.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Main series===\n{{main|Kirby (series)}}\n\nKirby's primary media form is video games, as he is the star and protagonist of the Nintendo owned series named after him. Most Kirby games are [[platform games]] in which Kirby fights enemies, solves puzzles, and challenges bosses. Each game typically adds a new twist or change to Kirby's abilities that the levels of the game emphasize, such as combining power ups in ''Kirby 64'' or Super Abilities in ''Return to Dream Land''. Most games involve Kirby saving a world or even universe from a dark, evil force of some kind. Typical Kirby games have a powerful being, such as Dark Matter or Nightmare, controlling or corrupting a secondary villain.\n\nThe series has 26 games currently, with the first being ''Kirby's Dream Land'' in 1992 and the latest being ''Kirby Star Allies'' in 2018. Although most are platform games, some spin offs have included pinball, racing, and puzzle games.\n\n===''Super Smash Bros.'' series===\nKirby appears in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series of games as a playable character, which is also created by Masahiro Sakurai. He is the sole ''Kirby'' series representative in ''[[Super Smash Bros. (video game)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', and has been one of three (the others being Meta Knight and King Dedede) as of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. He reprises his role as a playable character in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', the latter of which features him playing a starring role in the \"World of Light\" story mode.\n\n===Anime===\n{{main|Kirby: Right Back at Ya!}}\nKirby appears in his own [[anime]] titled '''''Kirby: Right Back at Ya!''''', (Japanese: \u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3 ''Hoshi no Kaabii'') in Japan. The series was licensed in [[North America]] by [[4Kids Entertainment]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] company [[Nelvana]], and produced by Warpstar Inc., a company formed between a joint investment between Nintendo and [[HAL Laboratory]]. It aired on [[4Kids Entertainment|4Kids TV]], via [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting]] (since 2001 which has done 100 episodes).\n\nThe anime series is set in its own universe independent of the games and offers its own take on the setting and characters, however, Kirby's creator, Masahiro Sakurai, was greatly involved in its creation, so it did not stray far from his vision of how Kirby should be.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2001/08/21/103%2C998390482%2C934%2C0%2C0.html|title = Kirby article|accessdate = 2006-12-07|publisher = [[Famitsu|Famitsu Magazine]]|language = Japanese}}</ref> The anime contains darker themes such as war, and death while still maintaining the cheerful and surreal themes the games are known for.\n\nIn the anime Kirby's origin and backstory are explored much more deeply than in the games. Kirby is a legendary Star Warrior who, according to legend, is fated to save Pop Star from destruction, but he was awoken from his slumber 200 years too early by mistake and as such has many baby or childlike qualities. Because of his age, he is still getting the hang of his powers and depends even more on the help of his friends to pull through tough situations. It is also implied that Kirby was originally a creation of the ancient evil entity called [[List of Kirby characters#Nightmare|Nightmare]] but refused to follow his evil orders and was discarded into the depths of space.\n\nKirby's Warpstar is also expanded upon, as in the games it is a mode of transportation, but here the Warpstar is also the source of his power but as he's too young to keep it safe for himself the character Tiff takes it upon herself to keep the Warpstar safe.\n\nThough Sakurai instructed that Kirby not speak in full sentences (citing the ''[[Peanuts]]'' character [[Snoopy]]) he did allow him to use a small vocabulary including a catch phrase \"Poyo\" and the names of various attacks and characters.\n\nPrior to this Kirby was also in a short educational video that was released exclusively in Japan in 1994, designed to teach [[Kanji]] to young children. The feature was not animated, but contained illustrations and was bundled with a similar video featuring [[Mario]] and [[Wario]].\n\n===Manga and comics===\nKirby also stars in several [[manga]] series, most of which have only been released in Japanese. The longest running series is titled \u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3 \u30c7\u30c7\u30c7\u3067\u30d7\u30d7\u30d7\u306a\u3082\u306e\u304c\u305f\u308a (''lit.

An intense gun battle erupted, resulting in the deaths of four government agents and six Branch Davidians. Upon the ATF's failure to raid the compound, a siege lasting 51 days was initiated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Eventually, the FBI launched an assault and initiated a [[tear gas]] attack in an attempt to force the Branch Davidians out of the ranch. During the attack, a fire engulfed Mount Carmel Center.

In 1959, Victor's widow, Florence Houteff, announced that the expected [[Armageddon]] was about to take place, and members were told to gather at the center to await this event. Many built houses, others stayed in tents, trucks, or buses, and most sold their possessions.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\"/>\n\nFollowing the failure of this prophecy, control of the site ([[Mount Carmel Center]]) fell to [[Benjamin Roden]], founder of the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association (Branch Davidians). He promoted different doctrinal beliefs than Victor Houteff's original Davidian Seventh-day Adventist organization. On Roden's death, control fell to his wife, [[Lois Roden]]. Lois considered their son, [[George Roden]], unfit to assume the position of [[prophet]]. Instead, she groomed Vernon Howell (later known as [[David Koresh]]) as her chosen successor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1984, a meeting led to a division of the group, with Howell leading one faction (calling themselves the Branch Davidians) and George Roden leading the competing faction.

This store, named the \"Mag-Bag\", had been identified by said postal worker as suspicious in deliveries. The postal worker continued deliveries to the Mt. Carmel Center and reported seeing manned observation posts; in the affidavit, it states he believed they were armed personnel at these observations posts.\n\nThe McClennan county sheriff was notified in May and June of that year of two cases of inert grenades, black gunpowder, 90 pounds of powdered aluminum metal, and 30\u201340 cardboard tubes. Furthermore, the sheriff noticed another shipment of sixty AR-15/M-16 magazines, to which Davy Aguilera made the statement, \"I have been involved in many cases where defendants, following a relatively simple process, convert AR-15 semi-automatic rifles to fully automatic rifles of the nature of the M-16\" to justify the ATF's involvement in the case.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother report was made to the Sheriff in November of 1992 by a local farmer who believed he heard machine gun fire. \"By the sound of it,\" he said, \"it was likely a .50 caliber machine gun and multiple M-16's.\" This farmer claimed he was very familiar with machine guns, having done a tour overseas in the U.S Army.\nThe affidavit closes with Aguilera verifying the story via interviews made with associated parties and gun shops from which the Mag-Bag purchased items. Among these items were over forty-five AR-15 upper receivers and five M-16 upper receivers, which Aguilera clearly annotates, \"These kits contain all the parts of an M-16 machine gun except for the lower receiver unit which is the \"firearm\" by lawful definition,\" admitting that neither the noise complaints nor the items ordered were necessarily illegal. <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kznx77jhuxkC&pg=PT200&lpg=PT200&dq=%22it+was+likely+a+.50+caliber+machine+gun+and+multiple+M-16%27s+waco&source=bl&ots=jOnf-Omo_C&sig=ACfU3U22BoU25FmGCYEuTnhEWXaZeMN-8Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihlP2P0_PoAhUVpp4KHYaLD8QQ6AEwAHoECA0QKA#v=onepage&q=%22it%20was%20likely%20a%20.50%20caliber%20machine%20gun%20and%20multiple%20M-16's%20waco&f=false This Is Not An Assault: Penetrating the Web of Official Lies Regarding the Waco Assault] </ref>\n\nDepartment of Human Services is noted in the affidavit as well. BATF happened to get statements from a department worker who managed to investigate a case on the Carmel site.  This agent, Joyce Sparks, had two separate visits to the grounds where she questioned members of the Branch Davidians and toured the compound. The first visit involved interviewing a young boy of the compound \"who was in a rush to grow up so he can have a long gun.\" This issue was not looked into until Ms. Sparks' second visit, when she was able to speak to David Koresh himself. He nonchalantly mentioned there were only a few guns, but when Ms. Sparks asked if it is okay to tour the compound, he requested she wait for thirty minutes so he can hide any guns from members not shown the guns. During this tour was when Ms. Sparks looked inside a trap door and noticed a buried bus with a refrigerator at the end. It was obvious to Ms. Sparks that the refrigerator was used as target practice by the Davidians, with the bullet holes in it and the guns strewn along the floor of this makeshift basement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== ATF raid ==\n=== Preparations ===\n[[File:Branch Davidian Compound Near Waco.jpg|thumb|The Branch Davidian compound as photographed during the ensuing siege]]\n\nUsing the [[affidavit]] filed by Aguilera that alleged that the Davidians had violated [[Law of the United States|federal law]], the ATF obtained search and [[arrest warrant]]s for Koresh and specific followers on weapons charges, citing the many firearms they had accumulated.<ref>Search Warrant W93-15M for the \"residence of Vernon Wayne Howell, and others\", signed by U.S. Judge or Magistrate Dennis G.

One agent was killed and another wounded. The third agent scampered over the peak of the roof and joined other agents attempting to enter the arms room. The window was smashed, a flashbang [[stun grenade]] was thrown in, and three agents entered the arms room. When another tried to follow them, a hail of bullets penetrated the wall and wounded him, but he was able to reach a ladder and slide to safety. An agent fired with his shotgun at Branch Davidians until he was hit in the head by return fire and killed.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/> Inside the arms room, the agents killed a Branch Davidian and discovered a cache of weapons but then came under heavy fire; two were wounded. As they escaped, the third agent laid down covering fire, killing a Branch Davidian. As he made his escape, he hit his head on a wooden support beam and fell off the roof but survived. An agent outside provided them with covering fire but was shot by a Branch Davidian and killed instantly. Dozens of ATF agents took cover, many behind Branch Davidian vehicles, and exchanged fire with the Branch Davidians. The number of ATF wounded increased, and an agent was killed by gunfire from the compound as agents were firing at a Branch Davidian perched on top of the water tower. The exchange of fire continued, but 45 minutes into the raid the gunfire began to slow down as agents began to run low on ammunition. The shooting continued for two hours.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/>\n\nSheriff Lt. Lynch of the McLennan County Sheriff Department contacted the ATF and negotiated a ceasefire.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Sheriff Harwell states in [[William Gazecki]]'s documentary ''[[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]]'' that the ATF agents withdrew only after they were out of ammunition.<ref name=\"roe\">{{cite video | people = William Gazecki | title = Waco \u2013 The Rules of Engagement | medium = Film documentary | publisher = New Yorker Video |year=2003 }}</ref> ATF agent Chuck Hustmyre later wrote: \"About 45 minutes into the shootout, the volume of gunfire finally started to slacken. We were running out of ammunition. The Davidians, however, had plenty.\" In all, four ATF agents (Steve Willis, Robert Williams, Todd McKeehan, and Conway Charles LeBleu) had been killed during the firefight. Another 16 had been injured. After the ceasefire, the Branch Davidians allowed the ATF dead and wounded to be evacuated and held their fire during the ATF retreat.\n\nThe five Branch Davidians killed in the raid were Winston Blake, Peter Gent, Peter Hipsman, Perry Jones, and Jaydean Wendell; two were killed at the hands of the Branch Davidians after having been wounded.<ref>Coulson, Danny O & Shannon, Elaine, ''No Heroes'' {{ISBN|0-671-02062-5}}</ref> Their bodies were buried on the grounds.

The FBI took command soon after as a result of the deaths of federal agents, placing [[Jeff Jamar]], head of the Bureau's [[San Antonio]] [[List of FBI field offices|field office]], in charge of the siege as Site Commander. The FBI [[Hostage Rescue Team]] (HRT) was headed by HRT Commander Richard Rogers, who had previously been criticized for his actions during the [[Ruby Ridge|Ruby Ridge incident]]. As at Ruby Ridge, Rogers often overrode the Site Commander at Waco and had mobilized both the Blue and Gold HRT tactical teams to the same site, which ultimately created pressure to resolve the situation tactically due to lack of HRT reserves.\n\nAt first, the Davidians had telephone contact with local news media, and Koresh gave phone interviews. The FBI cut Davidian communication to the outside world. For the next 51 days, communication with those inside was by telephone by a group of 25 FBI negotiators.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The final [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] report found that negotiators criticized the tactical commanders for undercutting negotiations.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/reportofdepartme00unit Report of the Department of the Treasury on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Investigation of Vernon Wayne Howell also known as David Koresh, September, 1993] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042646/https://archive.org/details/reportofdepartme00unit |date=April 2, 2016 }}, Appendix D, 136\u201340.</ref>\n\nIn the first few days, the FBI believed they had made a breakthrough when they negotiated with Koresh an agreement that the Branch Davidians would peacefully leave the compound in return for a message, recorded by Koresh, being broadcast on national radio.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The broadcast was made, but Koresh then told negotiators that God had told him to remain in the building and \"wait\".<ref name=\"iw\" /> Despite this, soon afterwards negotiators managed to facilitate the release of 19 children, ranging in age from five months to 12 years old, without their parents.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\" /> However, 98 people remained in the building.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The children were then interviewed by the FBI and [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], some for hours at a time.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\" /> Allegedly, the children had been physically and sexually abused long before the standoff.<ref name=\"child_abuse\">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Child_Abuse|title=Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas/Child Abuse|author=FBI|accessdate=2009-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817102810/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Child_Abuse|archive-date=August 17, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=FBI}}</ref> This was the key justification offered by the FBI (both to President [[Bill Clinton]] and to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]]) for launching [[tear gas]] attacks to force the Branch Davidians out of the compound.<ref name=\"lost\">{{Cite news | work = The Guardian | title = Lost in America | author = Nick Davies | date = January 14, 1994 | url = http://www.nickdavies.net/1993/12/01/the-battle-at-waco/ | access-date = March 19, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042258/http://www.nickdavies.net/1993/12/01/the-battle-at-waco/ | archive-date = March 4, 2016 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all | author-link = Nick Davies }}</ref>\n\nDuring the siege, the FBI sent a video camera to the Branch Davidians. In the video tape made by Koresh's followers, Koresh introduced his children and his \"wives\" to the FBI negotiators, including several [[minor (law)|minors]] who claimed to have had babies fathered by Koresh. (Koresh had fathered perhaps 14 of the children who stayed with him in the compound.) Several Branch Davidians made statements in the video.<ref>[[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]] contains several sequences taken from the FBI negotiation videotape.</ref> On day nine, Monday March 8, the Branch Davidians sent out the video tape to show the FBI that there were no hostages, but in fact everyone was staying inside of their own free will.

His conversations\u2014dense with Biblical imagery\u2014alienated the federal negotiators, who treated the situation as a hostage crisis; just amongst themselves, the negotiation teams took to calling these diatribes \"Bible babble\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Noesner|first = Gary|title = Stalling for Time: My Life as an FBI Hostage Negotiator|publisher = Random House|page = 114|language = English|isbn = 978-0-525-51128-1|year = 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs the siege wore on, two factions developed within the FBI,<ref name=\"iw\" /> one believing negotiation to be the answer, the other, force. Increasingly aggressive techniques were used to try to force the Branch Davidians out. For instance, [[sleep deprivation]] of the inhabitants by means of all-night broadcasts of recordings of jet planes, pop music, chanting, and the screams of rabbits being slaughtered. Outside the compound, nine [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]]s carrying [[United States 40&nbsp;mm grenades#Less Lethal and Riot Control Cartridges|M651 CS tear gas grenades]] and [[Riot gun#Ferret rounds|Ferret rounds]] and five [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]]s obtained from the [[U.S. Army]] began patrolling.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The armored vehicles were used to destroy perimeter fencing and outbuildings and crush cars belonging to the Branch Davidians. Armored vehicles repeatedly drove over the grave of Branch Davidian Peter Gent despite protests by the Branch Davidians and the negotiators.<ref name=\"iw\" />\n\nTwo of the three water storage tanks on the roof of the main building had been damaged during the initial ATF raid. Eventually the FBI cut all power and water to the compound, forcing those inside to survive on rain water and stockpiled military [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]] rations.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Criticism was later leveled by Schneider's attorney, Jack Zimmerman, at the tactic of using sleep-and-peace-disrupting sound against the Branch Davidians: \"The point was this\u2014they were trying to have sleep disturbance and they were trying to take someone that they viewed as unstable to start with, and they were trying to drive him crazy. And then they got mad 'cos he does something that they think is irrational!\"<ref>Testimony to the Subcommittee on National Security ''et al.'', loc cite. Congressional Record, July 1995.</ref>\n\nDespite the increasingly aggressive tactics, Koresh ordered a group of followers to leave. Eleven people left and were arrested as material witnesses, with one person charged with [[conspiracy to murder]].<ref name=\"iw\" /> The children's willingness to stay with Koresh disturbed the negotiators, who were unprepared to work around the Branch Davidians' religious zeal. However, as the siege went on, the children were aware that an earlier group of children who had left with some women were immediately separated, and the women arrested.\n\nDuring the siege, a number of scholars who study [[apocalypticism]] in religious groups attempted to persuade the FBI that the siege tactics being used by government agents would only reinforce the impression within the Branch Davidians that they were part of a Biblical \"[[End time|end-of-times]]\" confrontation that had cosmic significance.<ref name=\"usatodayreligion\">{{Cite news | title = U.S. ignores religion's fringes | work = USA Today | date = October 4, 2001 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2001-10-04-ncguest2.htm | accessdate = May 27, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614235202/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2001-10-04-ncguest2.htm | archive-date = June 14, 2010 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> This would likely increase the chances of a violent and deadly outcome.

Recalling the April 19, 1985, [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]] (CSAL) siege in [[Arkansas]] (which was ended without loss of life by a blockade without a deadline), President Clinton suggested similar tactics against the Branch Davidians. Reno countered that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was tired of waiting; that the standoff was costing a million dollars per week; that the Branch Davidians could hold out longer than the CSAL; and that the chances of child sexual abuse and mass suicide were imminent. Clinton later recounted: \"Finally, I told her that if she thought it was the right thing to do, she could go ahead.\"<ref>Bill Clinton, ''My Life'', Alfred A. Knopf, Vintage Books (Random House), {{ISBN|1-4000-3003-X}}, 2005. pp. 497\u201399.</ref> Over the next several months, Janet Reno's reason for approving the final gas attack varied from her initial claim that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team had told her that Koresh was sexually abusing children and beating babies (the FBI Hostage Rescue Team later denied evidence of child abuse during the standoff) to her claim that [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson]]'s \"Unorganized Militia of the United States\" was on the way to Waco \"either to help Koresh or to attack him.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/waco/blunders.html |title=Joe Rosenbloom III, \"Waco: More than Simple Blunders?,\" Wall Street Journal, October 17, 1995 |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2013-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930081343/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/waco/blunders.html |archive-date=September 30, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe assault took place on April 19, 1993. Because the Branch Davidians were heavily armed, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's arms included [[.50 caliber]] (12.7&nbsp;mm) rifles and armored Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEV). The CEVs used explosives to punch holes in the walls of buildings of the compound so they could pump in [[CS gas]] (\"tear gas\") and try to force the Branch Davidians out without harming them. The stated plan called for increasing amounts of gas to be pumped in over two days to increase pressure.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Officially, no armed assault was to be made. Loudspeakers were to be used to tell the Branch Davidians that there would be no armed assault and to ask them not to fire on the vehicles. According to the FBI, the Hostage Rescue Team agents had been permitted to return any incoming fire, but no shots were fired by federal agents on April 19. When several Branch Davidians opened fire, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's response was only to increase the amount of gas being used.<ref name=\"iw\" />\n\nThe FBI Hostage Rescue Team delivered {{convert|40|mm|adj=on}} CS grenade fire from [[M79 grenade launcher]]s. Very early in the morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team fired two military M651 rounds at the Branch Davidian construction site. Around mid-morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team began to run low on 40&nbsp;mm Ferret CS rounds and asked Texas Ranger Captain David Byrnes for tear gas rounds.

On August 3, 1993, a federal grand jury returned a superseding ten-count indictment against 12 of the surviving Branch Davidians. The grand jury charged, among other things, that the Branch Davidians had conspired to, and aided and abetted in, murder of federal officers, and had unlawfully possessed and used various firearms. The government dismissed the charges against one of the 12 Branch Davidians pursuant to a plea bargain.\n\nAfter a jury trial lasting nearly two months, the jury acquitted four of the Branch Davidians on all charges. Additionally, the jury acquitted all of the Branch Davidians on the murder-related charges but convicted five of them on lesser charges, including aiding and abetting the [[voluntary manslaughter]] of federal agents.<ref>p. 7403 of the trial transcripts.</ref> Eight Branch Davidians were convicted on firearms charges.\n\nThe convicted Branch Davidians, who received sentences of up to 40 years,<ref name=\"The Sunday Times December 14, 2008\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629115153/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5324263.ece 'The British Waco survivors']- The Sunday Times December 14, 2008.</ref> were:\n* Kevin A.

They raised a host of issues, challenging the constitutionality of the prohibition on possession of machine guns, the jury instructions, the district court's conduct of the trial, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the sentences imposed. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] vacated the defendants' sentences for use of machine guns, determining that the district court had made no finding that they had \"actively employed\" the weapons, but left the verdicts undisturbed in all other respects, in United States v. Branch,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100517062433/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/91/91.F3d.699.94-50437.html United States v.

Fagan was repeatedly moved between at least nine different facilities. He was strip-searched every time he took exercise, so he refused exercise. Released and deported back to the UK in July 2007, he still held on to his religious beliefs.<ref name=\"The Sunday Times December 14, 2008\" />\n\n=== Civil suits by Branch Davidians ===\nSeveral of the surviving Branch Davidians, as well as more than a hundred family members of those who had died or were injured in the confrontation, brought civil suits against the United States government, numerous federal officials, the former governor of Texas [[Ann Richards]], and members of the [[Texas Army National Guard]]. They sought monetary damages under the [[Federal Tort Claims Act]], civil rights statutes, the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]], and Texas state law. The bulk of these claims were dismissed because they were insufficient as a matter of law or because the plaintiffs could advance no material evidence in support of them.\n\nThe court, after a month-long trial, rejected the Branch Davidians' case. The court found that, on February 28, 1993, the Branch Davidians initiated a gun battle when they fired at federal officers who were attempting to serve lawful warrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1210879.html|title=United States vs. Branch|date=August 2, 1996|publisher=|via=caselaw.findlaw.com|access-date=June 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328111753/http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1210879.html|archive-date=March 28, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ATF agents returned gunfire to the building, the court ruled, in order to protect themselves and other agents from death or serious bodily harm. The court found that the government's planning of the siege\u2014i.e., the decisions to use tear gas against the Branch Davidians; to insert the tear gas by means of military vehicles; and to omit specific planning for the possibility that a fire would erupt\u2014was a discretionary function for which the government could not be sued. The court also found that the use of tear gas was not negligent. Further, even if the United States government were negligent by causing damage to the buildings before the fires broke out, thus either blocking escape routes or enabling the fires to spread faster, that negligence did not legally cause the plaintiffs' injuries because the Branch Davidians started the fires.\n\nThe Branch Davidians appealed. Their contention was that the trial court judge, Walter S. Smith, Jr., should have recused himself from hearing their claims on account of his relationships with defendants, defense counsel, and court staff; prior judicial determinations; and comments during trial. The Fifth Circuit concluded that these allegations did not reflect conduct that would cause a reasonable observer to question Judge Smith's impartiality, and it affirmed the take-nothing judgment, in Andrade v.

DeGuerin also testified that only the right-hand entry door had bullet holes, while the left-hand entry door was intact. The government presented the left-hand entry door at the trial, claiming that the right-hand entry door had been lost. The left-hand door contained numerous bullet holes made by both outgoing and incoming rounds. Texas Trooper Sgt.

Wright published in ''Nova Religio'' discussed how the FBI mishandled the siege, stating that \"there is no greater example of misfeasance than the failure of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to bring about a bloodless resolution to the 51-day standoff.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|last=Wright |first=Stuart A. |title=A Decade After Waco: Reassessing Crisis Negotiations at Mount Carmel in Light of New Government Disclosures |publisher=Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, Vol. 7, No. 2 |date=October 2003 }}</ref> Some of Wright's major concerns about the operation include that the FBI officials, especially Dick Rogers, behaved increasingly aggressively and impatiently, when the conflict could have been resolved by more peaceful negotiation. He mentions that Rogers said in an interview with the FBI that \"when we started depriving them, [we were] really driving people closer to him [Koresh] because of their devotion to him,\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> which was different from what he said in the Department of Justice report.\n\nCritics suggest that, during the final raid, the CS gas was injected into the building by armored vehicles in an unsafe manner, which could have started a fire. While two of the three fires were started well inside the building, away from where the CS gas was pumped in, survivor David Thibodeau claimed in a 1999 interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' that damage to the building allowed the gas to spread, stating, \"They started to break the walls, break the windows down, spread the CS gas out.\" Further controversy involves the use of gas grenades. Attorney General Reno had specifically directed that no pyrotechnic devices be used in the assault. Between 1993 and 1999, FBI spokesmen denied (even under oath) the use of any sort of pyrotechnic devices during the assault; however, pyrotechnic Flite-Rite CS gas grenades had been found in the rubble immediately following the fire. In 1999, FBI spokesmen were forced to admit that they had used the grenades; however, they claimed that these devices\u2014which dispense CS gas through an internal burning process\u2014had been used during an early morning attempt to penetrate a covered, water-filled construction pit 40 yards (35 m) away and were not fired into the building.<ref name=\"newsweekfire\" /> According to FBI claims, the fires started approximately three hours after the grenades had been fired. When the FBI's documents were turned over to Congress for an investigation in 1994, the page listing the use of the pyrotechnic devices was missing. The failure for six years to disclose the use of pyrotechnics despite her specific directive led Reno to demand an investigation. A senior FBI official told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that as many as 100 FBI agents had known about the use of pyrotechnics, but no one spoke up until 1999.<ref name=\"newsweekfire\" /> On May 12, less than a month after the incident, Texas state authorities bulldozed the site, rendering further gathering of forensic evidence impossible.\n\nThe FBI had planted surveillance devices in the walls of the building, which captured a number of conversations which the government claims are evidence that the Davidians started the fire.<ref name=\"newport\" />{{rp|287}} The recordings were imperfect and many times difficult to understand, and the two transcriptions that were made had differences at many points.<ref name=\"newport\" />{{rp|287}} According to reporter Diana Fuentes, when the FBI's April 19 tapes were played in court during the Branch Davidian trials, few people heard what the FBI audio expert claimed to hear; the tapes \"were filled with noise, and voices only occasionally were discernible. ...

During a 1999 deposition for civil suits by Branch Davidian survivors, fire survivor Graeme Craddock was interviewed. He stated that he saw some Branch Davidians moving about a dozen one gallon (3.8 L) cans of fuel so they would not be run over by armored vehicles, heard talk of pouring fuel outside the building, and, after the fire had started, something that sounded like \"light the fire\" from another individual.<ref>[[s: Graeme Craddock Testimony on Waco Fire]], October 1999 civil suit deposition regarding April 19, 1993 fire at Branch Davidian home and church.</ref> Professor Kenneth Newport's book ''The Branch Davidians of Waco'' attempts to prove that starting the fire themselves was pre-planned and consistent with the Branch Davidians' theology. He cites as evidence conversations the FBI recorded during the siege, testimonials of survivors Clive Doyle and Graeme Craddock, and the buying of [[diesel fuel]] one month before the start of the siege.<ref name=\"newport\" />\n\nThe FBI received contradictory reports on the possibility of Koresh's suicide and was not sure about whether he would commit suicide. The evidence made them believe that there was no possibility of mass suicide, with Koresh and Schneider repeatedly denying to the negotiators that they had plans to commit mass suicide, and people leaving the compound saying that they had seen no preparations for such a thing.<ref name=\"deputy_suicide\">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Attitudes_of_Koresh_and_others_in_the_Compound|title=Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas/Attitudes of Koresh and others in the Compound|author=FBI|accessdate=2009-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615051500/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Attitudes_of_Koresh_and_others_in_the_Compound|archive-date=June 15, 2010|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=FBI}}</ref> There was a possibility that some of his followers would follow Koresh if he committed suicide.<ref name=\"deputy_suicide\" /> According to Alan A. Stone's report, during the siege the FBI used an incorrect psychiatric perspective to evaluate Branch Davidians' responses, which caused them to over-rely on Koresh's statements that they would not commit suicide. According to Stone, this incorrect evaluation caused the FBI to not ask pertinent questions to Koresh and to others on the compound about whether they were planning a mass suicide. A more pertinent question would have been, \"What will you do if we tighten the noose around the compound in a show of overwhelming power, and using CS gas, force you to come out?\"<ref name=\"stone_report\" /> Stone wrote: <blockquote>The tactical arm of federal law enforcement may conventionally think of the other side as a band of criminals or as a military force or, generically, as the aggressor. But the Branch Davidians were an unconventional group in an exalted, disturbed, and desperate state of mind. They were devoted to David Koresh as the [[Lamb of God]]. They were willing to die defending themselves in an apocalyptic ending and, in the alternative, to kill themselves and their children. However, these were neither psychiatrically depressed, suicidal people nor cold-blooded killers. They were ready to risk death as a test of their faith. The psychology of such behavior\u2014together with its religious significance for the Branch Davidians\u2014was mistakenly evaluated, if not simply ignored, by those responsible for the FBI strategy of \"tightening the noose\". The overwhelming show of force was not working in the way the tacticians supposed. It did not provoke the Branch Davidians to surrender, but it may have provoked David Koresh to order the mass-suicide.<ref name=\"stone_report\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Danforth Report ===\nThe [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995 caused the media to revisit many of the questionable aspects of the government's actions at Waco, and many Americans who previously supported those actions began asking for an investigation.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Mass-mediated terrorism: the central role of the media in terrorism and counterterrorism |author= Brigitte Lebens Nacos |edition= illustrated |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |year= 2002 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/massmediatedterr0000naco/page/168 168\u201369] |isbn= 978-0-7425-1083-8 |url= https://archive.org/details/massmediatedterr0000naco/page/168 }}</ref> By 1999\u2014as a result of certain aspects of the documentaries discussed [[#Media portrayals|below]], as well as allegations made by advocates for Branch Davidians during litigation\u2014public opinion held that the federal government had engaged in serious misconduct at Waco. A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' poll conducted on August 26, 1999, for example, indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian complex.\n\nIn September 1999, Attorney General Reno appointed former U.S. Senator [[John C. Danforth]] as [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Special Counsel]] to investigate the matter. In particular, the Special Counsel was directed to investigate charges that government agents started or spread the fire at the Mount Carmel complex, directed gunfire at the Branch Davidians, and unlawfully employed the armed forces of the United States. A yearlong investigation ensued, during which the Office of the Special Counsel interviewed 1,001 witnesses, reviewed over 2.3 million pages of documents, and examined thousands of pounds of physical evidence. In the \"[[s:Final report to the Deputy Attorney General concerning the 1993 confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco Texas|Final report to the Deputy Attorney General concerning the 1993 confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco Texas]]\" of November 8, 2000, Special Counsel Danforth concluded that the allegations were meritless. The report found, however, that certain government employees had failed to disclose during litigation against the Branch Davidians the use of pyrotechnic devices at the complex, and had obstructed the Special Counsel's investigation. Disciplinary action was pursued against those individuals.\n\nAllegations that the government started the fire were based largely on an FBI agent's having fired three \"pyrotechnic\" tear gas rounds, which are delivered with a charge that burns. The Special Counsel concluded that the rounds did not start or contribute to the spread of the fire, based on the finding that the FBI fired the rounds nearly four hours before the fire started, at a concrete construction pit partially filled with water, {{convert|75|ft|m}} away and downwind from the main living quarters of the complex. The Special Counsel noted, by contrast, that recorded interceptions of Branch Davidian conversations included such statements as \"David said we have to get the fuel on\" and \"So we light it first when they come in with the tank right ... right as they're coming in.\" Some Branch Davidians who survived the fire acknowledged that other Branch Davidians started the fire. FBI agents witnessed Branch Davidians pouring fuel and igniting a fire, and noted these observations contemporaneously. Lab analysis found accelerants on the clothing of Branch Davidians, and investigators found deliberately punctured fuel cans and a homemade torch at the site. Based on this evidence and testimony, the Special Counsel concluded that the fire was started by the Branch Davidians.\n\nCharges that government agents fired shots into the complex on April 19, 1993, were based on [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) video recorded by the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|Night Stalkers]] aircraft. These tapes showed 57 flashes, with some occurring around government vehicles that were operating near the complex. The Office of Special Counsel conducted a field test of FLIR technology on March 19, 2000, to determine whether gunfire caused the flashes. The testing was conducted under a protocol agreed to and signed by attorneys and experts for the Branch Davidians and their families, as well as for the government. Analysis of the shape, duration, and location of the flashes indicated that they resulted from a reflection off debris on or around the complex, rather than gunfire. Additionally, independent expert review of photography taken at the scene showed no people at or near the points from which the flashes emanated. Interviews of Branch Davidians, government witnesses, filmmakers, writers, and advocates for the Branch Davidians found that none had witnessed any government gunfire on April 19. None of the Branch Davidians who died on that day displayed evidence of having been struck by a high velocity round, as would be expected had they been shot from outside of the complex by government sniper rifles or other assault weapons. In view of this evidence, the Special Counsel concluded that the claim that government gunfire occurred on April 19, 1993, amounted to \"an unsupportable case based entirely upon flawed technological assumptions.\"\n\nThe Special Counsel considered whether the use of active duty military at Waco violated the [[Posse Comitatus Act]] or the Military Assistance to Law Enforcement Act. These statutes generally prohibit direct military participation in law enforcement functions but do not preclude indirect support such as lending equipment, training in the use of equipment, offering expert advice, and providing equipment maintenance. The Special Counsel noted that the military provided \"extensive\" loans of equipment to the ATF and FBI, including\u2014among other things\u2014two tanks, the offensive capability of which had been disabled. Additionally, the military provided limited advice, training, and medical support. The Special Counsel concluded that these actions amounted to indirect military assistance within the bounds of applicable law. The Texas National Guard, in its state status, also provided substantial loans of military equipment, as well as performing reconnaissance flights over the Branch Davidian complex. Because the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the National Guard in its state status, the Special Counsel determined that the National Guard lawfully provided its assistance.\n\nDavid Koresh's lawyer called the Danforth report a [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]].<ref>[http://archive.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/7/22/91556 Koresh's Lawyer Critical of Danforth Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817034615/http://archive.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000%2F7%2F22%2F91556 |date=August 17, 2009 }}, [[United Press International|UPI]], July 22, 2000</ref> [[Ramsey Clark]]\u2014a former U.S. Attorney General, who represented several Branch Davidian survivors and relatives in a [[civil lawsuit]]\u2014said that the report \"failed to address the obvious\": \"History will clearly record, I believe, that these assaults on the Mt.

Eight years prior to the Waco fire, the ATF and FBI raided another compound of a religious cult: [[The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]]. Some ATF agents who were present at that raid were present at Waco. April 19 was also the date from the [[American Revolution]]'s opening battles (\"[[Battles of Lexington and Concord|the shot heard round the world]]\").\n\n=== Media portrayals ===\nThe Waco siege has been the subject of numerous documentary films and books. The first film was a made-for television docudrama film, ''[[In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco]]'', which was made during the siege, before the April 19 assault on the church, and presented the initial firefight of February 28, 1993 as an ambush. The film's writer, Phil Penningroth, has since disowned his screenplay as pro-ATF \"propaganda\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Penningroth |first=Phil |url=http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/dogma/righting-waco-confessions-of-a-hollywood-propagandist/ |title=Righting Waco: Confessions of a Hollywood Propagandist < Killing the Buddha |publisher=Killingthebuddha.com |date=2001-08-25 |accessdate=2013-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103065705/http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/dogma/righting-waco-confessions-of-a-hollywood-propagandist/ |archive-date=January 3, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first book about the incident was 1993's ''Inside the Cult'' co-authored by ex-Branch Davidian Marc Breault, who left the group in September 1989, and Martin King who interviewed Koresh for Australian television in 1992. In July 1993, true crime author Clifford L. Linedecker published his book ''Massacre at Waco, Texas''. Shortly after, in 1994, a collection of 45 essays called ''From the Ashes: Making Sense of Waco'' was published, about the events of Waco from various cultural, historical, and religious perspectives. The essays in the book include one by Michael Barkun that talked about how the Branch Davidians' behavior was consistent with other millenarian religious sects and how the use of the word cult is used to discredit religious organizations, one by James R. Lewis that claims a large amount of evidence that the FBI lit the fires, and many others. All of these perspectives are united in the belief that the deaths of the Branch Davidians at Waco could have been prevented and that \"the popular demonization of nontraditional religious movements in the aftermath of Waco represents a continuing threat to freedom of religion\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis |first=James |title=From the Ashes: Making Sense of Waco |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |date=1994|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe first documentary films critical of the official versions were ''[[Waco, the Big Lie]]''<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5369116450757675658&q=waco+the+big+lie&hl=en Waco: The big lie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516114821/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5369116450757675658&q=waco+the+big+lie&hl=en |date=May 16, 2011 }}, documentary, Google Video.</ref> and ''Waco II, the Big Lie Continues'', both produced by [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson]] in 1993. Thompson's films made a number of controversial allegations, the most notorious of which was her claim that footage of an armored vehicle breaking through the outer walls of the compound, with an appearance of orange light on its front,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlsThwd75w|title=Bill Hicks Waco Bradley Tank Setting Fire To The Compound|last=captainwess|date=November 10, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=June 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414141019/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlsThwd75w|archive-date=April 14, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was showing a [[flamethrower]] attached to the vehicle, setting fire to the building. As a response to Thompson, Michael McNulty released footage to support his counter-claim that the appearance of light was a reflection on aluminized insulation that was torn from the wall and snagged on the vehicle. (The vehicle is an M728 CEV, which is not normally equipped with a flamethrower.<ref>{{cite web| last = Ewing| first = Phillip| author2 = Hoffman, Michael| title = Flamethrowing Tanks Gave U.S. the Edge on Iwo Jima| publisher = Marine Corps Tankers Association| date = May 30, 2009| url = http://www.usmarinetankers.org/2009/05/flamethrowing-tanks-gave-us-edge-on-iwo/| accessdate = April 25, 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614000635/http://www.usmarinetankers.org/2009/05/flamethrowing-tanks-gave-us-edge-on-iwo/| archivedate = June 14, 2010| df = mdy-all}}</ref>). McNulty accused Thompson of \"creative editing\" in his film ''Waco: An Apparent Deviation''. Thompson worked from a VHS copy of the surveillance tape; McNulty was given access to a beta original.

Radio host and conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones]] made his own documentary film, ''America Wake Up (Or Waco)'', in 2000.\n\nIn 1997, filmmakers Dan Gifford and Amy Sommer produced their [[Emmy Award]]-winning documentary film, ''[[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]]'',<ref name=\"rulesof\" /> presenting a history of the Branch Davidian movement and a critical examination of the conduct of law enforcement, both leading up to the raid and through the aftermath of the fire. The film features footage of the Congressional hearings on Waco, and the juxtaposition of official government spokespeople with footage and evidence often directly contradicting the spokespeople. In the documentary, Dr. Edward Allard (who held patents on FLIR technology) maintained that flashes on the FBI's infra-red footage were consistent with grenade launcher and automatic small arms fire from FBI positions at the back of the complex toward the locations which would have been exits for Branch Davidians attempting to flee the fire. ''Waco: The Rules of Engagement'' was nominated for a 1997 [[Academy Award]] for best documentary and was followed by another film in 1999, ''Waco: A New Revelation''.<ref>[http://www.waco-anewrevelation.com/ Waco: a new revelation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426135551/http://www.waco-anewrevelation.com/ |date=April 26, 2006 }}, official site of the documentary.</ref> In 2001, another Michael McNulty documentary, ''The F.L.I.R.

Infra-red experts continue to disagree and filmmaker Amy Sommer stands by the original conclusions presented in ''Waco: The Rules of Engagement''.\n\nThe television show [[South Park]] parodied the siege in its season 3 episode [[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]].<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]], [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|date = November 2002|title=South Park: The Complete Third Season: \"Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub\" ''(Audio commentary)'' |medium= DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> \n\nThe documentary ''The Assault on Waco'' was first aired in 2006 on the [[Discovery Channel]], detailing the entire incident.

Suspecting the group of stockpiling illegal weapons, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] (ATF) obtained a search warrant for the compound and arrest warrants for Koresh and a select few of the group's members.\n\nThe incident began when the ATF attempted to raid the ranch. An intense gun battle erupted, resulting in the deaths of four government agents and six Branch Davidians. Upon the ATF's failure to raid the compound, a siege lasting 51 days was initiated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Eventually, the FBI launched an assault and initiated a [[tear gas]] attack in an attempt to force the Branch Davidians out of the ranch. During the attack, a fire engulfed Mount Carmel Center. This resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians, including 25 children, two pregnant women and David Koresh.<ref>Dick J.

In 1959, Victor's widow, Florence Houteff, announced that the expected [[Armageddon]] was about to take place, and members were told to gather at the center to await this event. Many built houses, others stayed in tents, trucks, or buses, and most sold their possessions.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\"/>\n\nFollowing the failure of this prophecy, control of the site ([[Mount Carmel Center]]) fell to [[Benjamin Roden]], founder of the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association (Branch Davidians). He promoted different doctrinal beliefs than Victor Houteff's original Davidian Seventh-day Adventist organization. On Roden's death, control fell to his wife, [[Lois Roden]]. Lois considered their son, [[George Roden]], unfit to assume the position of [[prophet]]. Instead, she groomed Vernon Howell (later known as [[David Koresh]]) as her chosen successor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1984, a meeting led to a division of the group, with Howell leading one faction (calling themselves the Branch Davidians) and George Roden leading the competing faction.

This store, named the \"Mag-Bag\", had been identified by said postal worker as suspicious in deliveries. The postal worker continued deliveries to the Mt. Carmel Center and reported seeing manned observation posts; in the affidavit, it states he believed they were armed personnel at these observations posts.\n\nThe McClennan county sheriff was notified in May and June of that year of two cases of inert grenades, black gunpowder, 90 pounds of powdered aluminum metal, and 30\u201340 cardboard tubes. Furthermore, the sheriff noticed another shipment of sixty AR-15/M-16 magazines, to which Davy Aguilera made the statement, \"I have been involved in many cases where defendants, following a relatively simple process, convert AR-15 semi-automatic rifles to fully automatic rifles of the nature of the M-16\" to justify the ATF's involvement in the case.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother report was made to the Sheriff in November of 1992 by a local farmer who believed he heard machine gun fire. \"By the sound of it,\" he said, \"it was likely a .50 caliber machine gun and multiple M-16's.\" This farmer claimed he was very familiar with machine guns, having done a tour overseas in the U.S Army.\nThe affidavit closes with Aguilera verifying the story via interviews made with associated parties and gun shops from which the Mag-Bag purchased items. Among these items were over forty-five AR-15 upper receivers and five M-16 upper receivers, which Aguilera clearly annotates, \"These kits contain all the parts of an M-16 machine gun except for the lower receiver unit which is the \"firearm\" by lawful definition,\" admitting that neither the noise complaints nor the items ordered were necessarily illegal. <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kznx77jhuxkC&pg=PT200&lpg=PT200&dq=%22it+was+likely+a+.50+caliber+machine+gun+and+multiple+M-16%27s+waco&source=bl&ots=jOnf-Omo_C&sig=ACfU3U22BoU25FmGCYEuTnhEWXaZeMN-8Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihlP2P0_PoAhUVpp4KHYaLD8QQ6AEwAHoECA0QKA#v=onepage&q=%22it%20was%20likely%20a%20.50%20caliber%20machine%20gun%20and%20multiple%20M-16's%20waco&f=false This Is Not An Assault: Penetrating the Web of Official Lies Regarding the Waco Assault] </ref>\n\nDepartment of Human Services is noted in the affidavit as well. BATF happened to get statements from a department worker who managed to investigate a case on the Carmel site.  This agent, Joyce Sparks, had two separate visits to the grounds where she questioned members of the Branch Davidians and toured the compound. The first visit involved interviewing a young boy of the compound \"who was in a rush to grow up so he can have a long gun.\" This issue was not looked into until Ms. Sparks' second visit, when she was able to speak to David Koresh himself. He nonchalantly mentioned there were only a few guns, but when Ms. Sparks asked if it is okay to tour the compound, he requested she wait for thirty minutes so he can hide any guns from members not shown the guns. During this tour was when Ms. Sparks looked inside a trap door and noticed a buried bus with a refrigerator at the end. It was obvious to Ms. Sparks that the refrigerator was used as target practice by the Davidians, with the bullet holes in it and the guns strewn along the floor of this makeshift basement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== ATF raid ==\n=== Preparations ===\n[[File:Branch Davidian Compound Near Waco.jpg|thumb|The Branch Davidian compound as photographed during the ensuing siege]]\n\nUsing the [[affidavit]] filed by Aguilera that alleged that the Davidians had violated [[Law of the United States|federal law]], the ATF obtained search and [[arrest warrant]]s for Koresh and specific followers on weapons charges, citing the many firearms they had accumulated.<ref>Search Warrant W93-15M for the \"residence of Vernon Wayne Howell, and others\", signed by U.S. Judge or Magistrate Dennis G.

One agent was killed and another wounded. The third agent scampered over the peak of the roof and joined other agents attempting to enter the arms room. The window was smashed, a flashbang [[stun grenade]] was thrown in, and three agents entered the arms room. When another tried to follow them, a hail of bullets penetrated the wall and wounded him, but he was able to reach a ladder and slide to safety. An agent fired with his shotgun at Branch Davidians until he was hit in the head by return fire and killed.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/> Inside the arms room, the agents killed a Branch Davidian and discovered a cache of weapons but then came under heavy fire; two were wounded. As they escaped, the third agent laid down covering fire, killing a Branch Davidian. As he made his escape, he hit his head on a wooden support beam and fell off the roof but survived. An agent outside provided them with covering fire but was shot by a Branch Davidian and killed instantly. Dozens of ATF agents took cover, many behind Branch Davidian vehicles, and exchanged fire with the Branch Davidians. The number of ATF wounded increased, and an agent was killed by gunfire from the compound as agents were firing at a Branch Davidian perched on top of the water tower. The exchange of fire continued, but 45 minutes into the raid the gunfire began to slow down as agents began to run low on ammunition. The shooting continued for two hours.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/>\n\nSheriff Lt. Lynch of the McLennan County Sheriff Department contacted the ATF and negotiated a ceasefire.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Sheriff Harwell states in [[William Gazecki]]'s documentary ''[[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]]'' that the ATF agents withdrew only after they were out of ammunition.<ref name=\"roe\">{{cite video | people = William Gazecki | title = Waco \u2013 The Rules of Engagement | medium = Film documentary | publisher = New Yorker Video |year=2003 }}</ref> ATF agent Chuck Hustmyre later wrote: \"About 45 minutes into the shootout, the volume of gunfire finally started to slacken.

The Davidians, however, had plenty.\" In all, four ATF agents (Steve Willis, Robert Williams, Todd McKeehan, and Conway Charles LeBleu) had been killed during the firefight. Another 16 had been injured. After the ceasefire, the Branch Davidians allowed the ATF dead and wounded to be evacuated and held their fire during the ATF retreat.\n\nThe five Branch Davidians killed in the raid were Winston Blake, Peter Gent, Peter Hipsman, Perry Jones, and Jaydean Wendell; two were killed at the hands of the Branch Davidians after having been wounded.<ref>Coulson, Danny O & Shannon, Elaine, ''No Heroes'' {{ISBN|0-671-02062-5}}</ref> Their bodies were buried on the grounds.

The FBI took command soon after as a result of the deaths of federal agents, placing [[Jeff Jamar]], head of the Bureau's [[San Antonio]] [[List of FBI field offices|field office]], in charge of the siege as Site Commander. The FBI [[Hostage Rescue Team]] (HRT) was headed by HRT Commander Richard Rogers, who had previously been criticized for his actions during the [[Ruby Ridge|Ruby Ridge incident]]. As at Ruby Ridge, Rogers often overrode the Site Commander at Waco and had mobilized both the Blue and Gold HRT tactical teams to the same site, which ultimately created pressure to resolve the situation tactically due to lack of HRT reserves.\n\nAt first, the Davidians had telephone contact with local news media, and Koresh gave phone interviews. The FBI cut Davidian communication to the outside world. For the next 51 days, communication with those inside was by telephone by a group of 25 FBI negotiators.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The final [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] report found that negotiators criticized the tactical commanders for undercutting negotiations.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/reportofdepartme00unit Report of the Department of the Treasury on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Investigation of Vernon Wayne Howell also known as David Koresh, September, 1993] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402042646/https://archive.org/details/reportofdepartme00unit |date=April 2, 2016 }}, Appendix D, 136\u201340.</ref>\n\nIn the first few days, the FBI believed they had made a breakthrough when they negotiated with Koresh an agreement that the Branch Davidians would peacefully leave the compound in return for a message, recorded by Koresh, being broadcast on national radio.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The broadcast was made, but Koresh then told negotiators that God had told him to remain in the building and \"wait\".<ref name=\"iw\" /> Despite this, soon afterwards negotiators managed to facilitate the release of 19 children, ranging in age from five months to 12 years old, without their parents.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\" /> However, 98 people remained in the building.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The children were then interviewed by the FBI and [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], some for hours at a time.<ref name=\"perrynetworker\" /> Allegedly, the children had been physically and sexually abused long before the standoff.<ref name=\"child_abuse\">{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Child_Abuse|title=Report to the Deputy Attorney General on the Events at Waco, Texas/Child Abuse|author=FBI|accessdate=2009-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817102810/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_to_the_Deputy_Attorney_General_on_the_Events_at_Waco,_Texas/Child_Abuse|archive-date=August 17, 2009|url-status=live|df=mdy-all|author-link=FBI}}</ref> This was the key justification offered by the FBI (both to President [[Bill Clinton]] and to [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]]) for launching [[tear gas]] attacks to force the Branch Davidians out of the compound.<ref name=\"lost\">{{Cite news | work = The Guardian | title = Lost in America | author = Nick Davies | date = January 14, 1994 | url = http://www.nickdavies.net/1993/12/01/the-battle-at-waco/ | access-date = March 19, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042258/http://www.nickdavies.net/1993/12/01/the-battle-at-waco/ | archive-date = March 4, 2016 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all | author-link = Nick Davies }}</ref>\n\nDuring the siege, the FBI sent a video camera to the Branch Davidians.

His conversations\u2014dense with Biblical imagery\u2014alienated the federal negotiators, who treated the situation as a hostage crisis; just amongst themselves, the negotiation teams took to calling these diatribes \"Bible babble\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Noesner|first = Gary|title = Stalling for Time: My Life as an FBI Hostage Negotiator|publisher = Random House|page = 114|language = English|isbn = 978-0-525-51128-1|year = 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs the siege wore on, two factions developed within the FBI,<ref name=\"iw\" /> one believing negotiation to be the answer, the other, force. Increasingly aggressive techniques were used to try to force the Branch Davidians out. For instance, [[sleep deprivation]] of the inhabitants by means of all-night broadcasts of recordings of jet planes, pop music, chanting, and the screams of rabbits being slaughtered. Outside the compound, nine [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]]s carrying [[United States 40&nbsp;mm grenades#Less Lethal and Riot Control Cartridges|M651 CS tear gas grenades]] and [[Riot gun#Ferret rounds|Ferret rounds]] and five [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]]s obtained from the [[U.S. Army]] began patrolling.<ref name=\"iw\" /> The armored vehicles were used to destroy perimeter fencing and outbuildings and crush cars belonging to the Branch Davidians. Armored vehicles repeatedly drove over the grave of Branch Davidian Peter Gent despite protests by the Branch Davidians and the negotiators.<ref name=\"iw\" />\n\nTwo of the three water storage tanks on the roof of the main building had been damaged during the initial ATF raid. Eventually the FBI cut all power and water to the compound, forcing those inside to survive on rain water and stockpiled military [[Meal, Ready-to-Eat|MRE]] rations.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Criticism was later leveled by Schneider's attorney, Jack Zimmerman, at the tactic of using sleep-and-peace-disrupting sound against the Branch Davidians: \"The point was this\u2014they were trying to have sleep disturbance and they were trying to take someone that they viewed as unstable to start with, and they were trying to drive him crazy. And then they got mad 'cos he does something that they think is irrational!\"<ref>Testimony to the Subcommittee on National Security ''et al.'', loc cite. Congressional Record, July 1995.</ref>\n\nDespite the increasingly aggressive tactics, Koresh ordered a group of followers to leave. Eleven people left and were arrested as material witnesses, with one person charged with [[conspiracy to murder]].<ref name=\"iw\" /> The children's willingness to stay with Koresh disturbed the negotiators, who were unprepared to work around the Branch Davidians' religious zeal. However, as the siege went on, the children were aware that an earlier group of children who had left with some women were immediately separated, and the women arrested.\n\nDuring the siege, a number of scholars who study [[apocalypticism]] in religious groups attempted to persuade the FBI that the siege tactics being used by government agents would only reinforce the impression within the Branch Davidians that they were part of a Biblical \"[[End time|end-of-times]]\" confrontation that had cosmic significance.<ref name=\"usatodayreligion\">{{Cite news | title = U.S. ignores religion's fringes | work = USA Today | date = October 4, 2001 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2001-10-04-ncguest2.htm | accessdate = May 27, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614235202/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/2001-10-04-ncguest2.htm | archive-date = June 14, 2010 | url-status=live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> This would likely increase the chances of a violent and deadly outcome.

Recalling the April 19, 1985, [[The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]] (CSAL) siege in [[Arkansas]] (which was ended without loss of life by a blockade without a deadline), President Clinton suggested similar tactics against the Branch Davidians. Reno countered that the FBI Hostage Rescue Team was tired of waiting; that the standoff was costing a million dollars per week; that the Branch Davidians could hold out longer than the CSAL; and that the chances of child sexual abuse and mass suicide were imminent. Clinton later recounted: \"Finally, I told her that if she thought it was the right thing to do, she could go ahead.\"<ref>Bill Clinton, ''My Life'', Alfred A.

Because the Branch Davidians were heavily armed, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's arms included [[.50 caliber]] (12.7&nbsp;mm) rifles and armored Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEV). The CEVs used explosives to punch holes in the walls of buildings of the compound so they could pump in [[CS gas]] (\"tear gas\") and try to force the Branch Davidians out without harming them. The stated plan called for increasing amounts of gas to be pumped in over two days to increase pressure.<ref name=\"iw\" /> Officially, no armed assault was to be made. Loudspeakers were to be used to tell the Branch Davidians that there would be no armed assault and to ask them not to fire on the vehicles. According to the FBI, the Hostage Rescue Team agents had been permitted to return any incoming fire, but no shots were fired by federal agents on April 19. When several Branch Davidians opened fire, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team's response was only to increase the amount of gas being used.<ref name=\"iw\" />\n\nThe FBI Hostage Rescue Team delivered {{convert|40|mm|adj=on}} CS grenade fire from [[M79 grenade launcher]]s. Very early in the morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team fired two military M651 rounds at the Branch Davidian construction site. Around mid-morning, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team began to run low on 40&nbsp;mm Ferret CS rounds and asked Texas Ranger Captain David Byrnes for tear gas rounds. The tear gas rounds procured from Company \"F\" in Waco turned out to be unusable pyrotechnic rounds and were returned to the Company \"F\" office afterwards.<ref name=casteel>[http://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/to%20casteel%20090999.pdf Interoffice Memorandum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220054042/https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/director_staff/public_information/branch_davidian/to%20casteel%20090999.pdf |date=February 20, 2011 }} Memo to Bruce Casteel, Chief, Texas Rangers, from Earl R.

The government dismissed the charges against one of the 12 Branch Davidians pursuant to a plea bargain.\n\nAfter a jury trial lasting nearly two months, the jury acquitted four of the Branch Davidians on all charges.

They raised a host of issues, challenging the constitutionality of the prohibition on possession of machine guns, the jury instructions, the district court's conduct of the trial, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the sentences imposed. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] vacated the defendants' sentences for use of machine guns, determining that the district court had made no finding that they had \"actively employed\" the weapons, but left the verdicts undisturbed in all other respects, in United States v.

The court also found that the use of tear gas was not negligent. Further, even if the United States government were negligent by causing damage to the buildings before the fires broke out, thus either blocking escape routes or enabling the fires to spread faster, that negligence did not legally cause the plaintiffs' injuries because the Branch Davidians started the fires.\n\nThe Branch Davidians appealed. Their contention was that the trial court judge, Walter S. Smith, Jr., should have recused himself from hearing their claims on account of his relationships with defendants, defense counsel, and court staff; prior judicial determinations; and comments during trial. The Fifth Circuit concluded that these allegations did not reflect conduct that would cause a reasonable observer to question Judge Smith's impartiality, and it affirmed the take-nothing judgment, in Andrade v.

The government presented the left-hand entry door at the trial, claiming that the right-hand entry door had been lost.

He mentions that Rogers said in an interview with the FBI that \"when we started depriving them, [we were] really driving people closer to him [Koresh] because of their devotion to him,\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> which was different from what he said in the Department of Justice report.\n\nCritics suggest that, during the final raid, the CS gas was injected into the building by armored vehicles in an unsafe manner, which could have started a fire. While two of the three fires were started well inside the building, away from where the CS gas was pumped in, survivor David Thibodeau claimed in a 1999 interview with ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' that damage to the building allowed the gas to spread, stating, \"They started to break the walls, break the windows down, spread the CS gas out.\" Further controversy involves the use of gas grenades. Attorney General Reno had specifically directed that no pyrotechnic devices be used in the assault. Between 1993 and 1999, FBI spokesmen denied (even under oath) the use of any sort of pyrotechnic devices during the assault; however, pyrotechnic Flite-Rite CS gas grenades had been found in the rubble immediately following the fire. In 1999, FBI spokesmen were forced to admit that they had used the grenades; however, they claimed that these devices\u2014which dispense CS gas through an internal burning process\u2014had been used during an early morning attempt to penetrate a covered, water-filled construction pit 40 yards (35 m) away and were not fired into the building.<ref name=\"newsweekfire\" /> According to FBI claims, the fires started approximately three hours after the grenades had been fired. When the FBI's documents were turned over to Congress for an investigation in 1994, the page listing the use of the pyrotechnic devices was missing. The failure for six years to disclose the use of pyrotechnics despite her specific directive led Reno to demand an investigation. A senior FBI official told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that as many as 100 FBI agents had known about the use of pyrotechnics, but no one spoke up until 1999.<ref name=\"newsweekfire\" /> On May 12, less than a month after the incident, Texas state authorities bulldozed the site, rendering further gathering of forensic evidence impossible.\n\nThe FBI had planted surveillance devices in the walls of the building, which captured a number of conversations which the government claims are evidence that the Davidians started the fire.<ref name=\"newport\" />{{rp|287}} The recordings were imperfect and many times difficult to understand, and the two transcriptions that were made had differences at many points.<ref name=\"newport\" />{{rp|287}} According to reporter Diana Fuentes, when the FBI's April 19 tapes were played in court during the Branch Davidian trials, few people heard what the FBI audio expert claimed to hear; the tapes \"were filled with noise, and voices only occasionally were discernible. ...

During a 1999 deposition for civil suits by Branch Davidian survivors, fire survivor Graeme Craddock was interviewed. He stated that he saw some Branch Davidians moving about a dozen one gallon (3.8 L) cans of fuel so they would not be run over by armored vehicles, heard talk of pouring fuel outside the building, and, after the fire had started, something that sounded like \"light the fire\" from another individual.<ref>[[s: Graeme Craddock Testimony on Waco Fire]], October 1999 civil suit deposition regarding April 19, 1993 fire at Branch Davidian home and church.</ref> Professor Kenneth Newport's book ''The Branch Davidians of Waco'' attempts to prove that starting the fire themselves was pre-planned and consistent with the Branch Davidians' theology.

Stone's report, during the siege the FBI used an incorrect psychiatric perspective to evaluate Branch Davidians' responses, which caused them to over-rely on Koresh's statements that they would not commit suicide. According to Stone, this incorrect evaluation caused the FBI to not ask pertinent questions to Koresh and to others on the compound about whether they were planning a mass suicide. A more pertinent question would have been, \"What will you do if we tighten the noose around the compound in a show of overwhelming power, and using CS gas, force you to come out?\"<ref name=\"stone_report\" /> Stone wrote: <blockquote>The tactical arm of federal law enforcement may conventionally think of the other side as a band of criminals or as a military force or, generically, as the aggressor. But the Branch Davidians were an unconventional group in an exalted, disturbed, and desperate state of mind. They were devoted to David Koresh as the [[Lamb of God]]. They were willing to die defending themselves in an apocalyptic ending and, in the alternative, to kill themselves and their children. However, these were neither psychiatrically depressed, suicidal people nor cold-blooded killers. They were ready to risk death as a test of their faith. The psychology of such behavior\u2014together with its religious significance for the Branch Davidians\u2014was mistakenly evaluated, if not simply ignored, by those responsible for the FBI strategy of \"tightening the noose\". The overwhelming show of force was not working in the way the tacticians supposed. It did not provoke the Branch Davidians to surrender, but it may have provoked David Koresh to order the mass-suicide.<ref name=\"stone_report\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Danforth Report ===\nThe [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995 caused the media to revisit many of the questionable aspects of the government's actions at Waco, and many Americans who previously supported those actions began asking for an investigation.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Mass-mediated terrorism: the central role of the media in terrorism and counterterrorism |author= Brigitte Lebens Nacos |edition= illustrated |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |year= 2002 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/massmediatedterr0000naco/page/168 168\u201369] |isbn= 978-0-7425-1083-8 |url= https://archive.org/details/massmediatedterr0000naco/page/168 }}</ref> By 1999\u2014as a result of certain aspects of the documentaries discussed [[#Media portrayals|below]], as well as allegations made by advocates for Branch Davidians during litigation\u2014public opinion held that the federal government had engaged in serious misconduct at Waco. A ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' poll conducted on August 26, 1999, for example, indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian complex.\n\nIn September 1999, Attorney General Reno appointed former U.S. Senator [[John C. Danforth]] as [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Special Counsel]] to investigate the matter. In particular, the Special Counsel was directed to investigate charges that government agents started or spread the fire at the Mount Carmel complex, directed gunfire at the Branch Davidians, and unlawfully employed the armed forces of the United States. A yearlong investigation ensued, during which the Office of the Special Counsel interviewed 1,001 witnesses, reviewed over 2.3 million pages of documents, and examined thousands of pounds of physical evidence. In the \"[[s:Final report to the Deputy Attorney General concerning the 1993 confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco Texas|Final report to the Deputy Attorney General concerning the 1993 confrontation at the Mt. Carmel Complex, Waco Texas]]\" of November 8, 2000, Special Counsel Danforth concluded that the allegations were meritless. The report found, however, that certain government employees had failed to disclose during litigation against the Branch Davidians the use of pyrotechnic devices at the complex, and had obstructed the Special Counsel's investigation. Disciplinary action was pursued against those individuals.\n\nAllegations that the government started the fire were based largely on an FBI agent's having fired three \"pyrotechnic\" tear gas rounds, which are delivered with a charge that burns. The Special Counsel concluded that the rounds did not start or contribute to the spread of the fire, based on the finding that the FBI fired the rounds nearly four hours before the fire started, at a concrete construction pit partially filled with water, {{convert|75|ft|m}} away and downwind from the main living quarters of the complex. The Special Counsel noted, by contrast, that recorded interceptions of Branch Davidian conversations included such statements as \"David said we have to get the fuel on\" and \"So we light it first when they come in with the tank right ... right as they're coming in.\" Some Branch Davidians who survived the fire acknowledged that other Branch Davidians started the fire. FBI agents witnessed Branch Davidians pouring fuel and igniting a fire, and noted these observations contemporaneously. Lab analysis found accelerants on the clothing of Branch Davidians, and investigators found deliberately punctured fuel cans and a homemade torch at the site. Based on this evidence and testimony, the Special Counsel concluded that the fire was started by the Branch Davidians.\n\nCharges that government agents fired shots into the complex on April 19, 1993, were based on [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) video recorded by the [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|Night Stalkers]] aircraft. These tapes showed 57 flashes, with some occurring around government vehicles that were operating near the complex. The Office of Special Counsel conducted a field test of FLIR technology on March 19, 2000, to determine whether gunfire caused the flashes. The testing was conducted under a protocol agreed to and signed by attorneys and experts for the Branch Davidians and their families, as well as for the government. Analysis of the shape, duration, and location of the flashes indicated that they resulted from a reflection off debris on or around the complex, rather than gunfire. Additionally, independent expert review of photography taken at the scene showed no people at or near the points from which the flashes emanated. Interviews of Branch Davidians, government witnesses, filmmakers, writers, and advocates for the Branch Davidians found that none had witnessed any government gunfire on April 19. None of the Branch Davidians who died on that day displayed evidence of having been struck by a high velocity round, as would be expected had they been shot from outside of the complex by government sniper rifles or other assault weapons. In view of this evidence, the Special Counsel concluded that the claim that government gunfire occurred on April 19, 1993, amounted to \"an unsupportable case based entirely upon flawed technological assumptions.\"\n\nThe Special Counsel considered whether the use of active duty military at Waco violated the [[Posse Comitatus Act]] or the Military Assistance to Law Enforcement Act. These statutes generally prohibit direct military participation in law enforcement functions but do not preclude indirect support such as lending equipment, training in the use of equipment, offering expert advice, and providing equipment maintenance. The Special Counsel noted that the military provided \"extensive\" loans of equipment to the ATF and FBI, including\u2014among other things\u2014two tanks, the offensive capability of which had been disabled. Additionally, the military provided limited advice, training, and medical support. The Special Counsel concluded that these actions amounted to indirect military assistance within the bounds of applicable law. The Texas National Guard, in its state status, also provided substantial loans of military equipment, as well as performing reconnaissance flights over the Branch Davidian complex. Because the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to the National Guard in its state status, the Special Counsel determined that the National Guard lawfully provided its assistance.\n\nDavid Koresh's lawyer called the Danforth report a [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]].<ref>[http://archive.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000/7/22/91556 Koresh's Lawyer Critical of Danforth Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817034615/http://archive.newsmax.com/articles/?a=2000%2F7%2F22%2F91556 |date=August 17, 2009 }}, [[United Press International|UPI]], July 22, 2000</ref> [[Ramsey Clark]]\u2014a former U.S. Attorney General, who represented several Branch Davidian survivors and relatives in a [[civil lawsuit]]\u2014said that the report \"failed to address the obvious\": \"History will clearly record, I believe, that these assaults on the Mt.

Eight years prior to the Waco fire, the ATF and FBI raided another compound of a religious cult: [[The Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord]]. Some ATF agents who were present at that raid were present at Waco. April 19 was also the date from the [[American Revolution]]'s opening battles (\"[[Battles of Lexington and Concord|the shot heard round the world]]\").\n\n=== Media portrayals ===\nThe Waco siege has been the subject of numerous documentary films and books. The first film was a made-for television docudrama film, ''[[In the Line of Duty: Ambush in Waco]]'', which was made during the siege, before the April 19 assault on the church, and presented the initial firefight of February 28, 1993 as an ambush. The film's writer, Phil Penningroth, has since disowned his screenplay as pro-ATF \"propaganda\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Penningroth |first=Phil |url=http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/dogma/righting-waco-confessions-of-a-hollywood-propagandist/ |title=Righting Waco: Confessions of a Hollywood Propagandist < Killing the Buddha |publisher=Killingthebuddha.com |date=2001-08-25 |accessdate=2013-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103065705/http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/dogma/righting-waco-confessions-of-a-hollywood-propagandist/ |archive-date=January 3, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first book about the incident was 1993's ''Inside the Cult'' co-authored by ex-Branch Davidian Marc Breault, who left the group in September 1989, and Martin King who interviewed Koresh for Australian television in 1992. In July 1993, true crime author Clifford L. Linedecker published his book ''Massacre at Waco, Texas''. Shortly after, in 1994, a collection of 45 essays called ''From the Ashes: Making Sense of Waco'' was published, about the events of Waco from various cultural, historical, and religious perspectives. The essays in the book include one by Michael Barkun that talked about how the Branch Davidians' behavior was consistent with other millenarian religious sects and how the use of the word cult is used to discredit religious organizations, one by James R. Lewis that claims a large amount of evidence that the FBI lit the fires, and many others. All of these perspectives are united in the belief that the deaths of the Branch Davidians at Waco could have been prevented and that \"the popular demonization of nontraditional religious movements in the aftermath of Waco represents a continuing threat to freedom of religion\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Lewis |first=James |title=From the Ashes: Making Sense of Waco |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |date=1994|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe first documentary films critical of the official versions were ''[[Waco, the Big Lie]]''<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5369116450757675658&q=waco+the+big+lie&hl=en Waco: The big lie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516114821/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5369116450757675658&q=waco+the+big+lie&hl=en |date=May 16, 2011 }}, documentary, Google Video.</ref> and ''Waco II, the Big Lie Continues'', both produced by [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson]] in 1993. Thompson's films made a number of controversial allegations, the most notorious of which was her claim that footage of an armored vehicle breaking through the outer walls of the compound, with an appearance of orange light on its front,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlsThwd75w|title=Bill Hicks Waco Bradley Tank Setting Fire To The Compound|last=captainwess|date=November 10, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube|access-date=June 27, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414141019/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlsThwd75w|archive-date=April 14, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> was showing a [[flamethrower]] attached to the vehicle, setting fire to the building. As a response to Thompson, Michael McNulty released footage to support his counter-claim that the appearance of light was a reflection on aluminized insulation that was torn from the wall and snagged on the vehicle. (The vehicle is an M728 CEV, which is not normally equipped with a flamethrower.<ref>{{cite web| last = Ewing| first = Phillip| author2 = Hoffman, Michael| title = Flamethrowing Tanks Gave U.S. the Edge on Iwo Jima| publisher = Marine Corps Tankers Association| date = May 30, 2009| url = http://www.usmarinetankers.org/2009/05/flamethrowing-tanks-gave-us-edge-on-iwo/| accessdate = April 25, 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100614000635/http://www.usmarinetankers.org/2009/05/flamethrowing-tanks-gave-us-edge-on-iwo/| archivedate = June 14, 2010| df = mdy-all}}</ref>).

Radio host and conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones]] made his own documentary film, ''America Wake Up (Or Waco)'', in 2000.\n\nIn 1997, filmmakers Dan Gifford and Amy Sommer produced their [[Emmy Award]]-winning documentary film, ''[[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]]'',<ref name=\"rulesof\" /> presenting a history of the Branch Davidian movement and a critical examination of the conduct of law enforcement, both leading up to the raid and through the aftermath of the fire. The film features footage of the Congressional hearings on Waco, and the juxtaposition of official government spokespeople with footage and evidence often directly contradicting the spokespeople. In the documentary, Dr. Edward Allard (who held patents on FLIR technology) maintained that flashes on the FBI's infra-red footage were consistent with grenade launcher and automatic small arms fire from FBI positions at the back of the complex toward the locations which would have been exits for Branch Davidians attempting to flee the fire. ''Waco: The Rules of Engagement'' was nominated for a 1997 [[Academy Award]] for best documentary and was followed by another film in 1999, ''Waco: A New Revelation''.<ref>[http://www.waco-anewrevelation.com/ Waco: a new revelation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426135551/http://www.waco-anewrevelation.com/ |date=April 26, 2006 }}, official site of the documentary.</ref> In 2001, another Michael McNulty documentary, ''The F.L.I.R.

Infra-red experts continue to disagree and filmmaker Amy Sommer stands by the original conclusions presented in ''Waco: The Rules of Engagement''.\n\nThe television show [[South Park]] parodied the siege in its season 3 episode [[Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub]].<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]], [[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]]|date = November 2002|title=South Park: The Complete Third Season: \"Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub\" ''(Audio commentary)'' |medium= DVD|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> \n\nThe documentary ''The Assault on Waco'' was first aired in 2006 on the [[Discovery Channel]], detailing the entire incident.

This mission has been tentatively identified by NASA as a technology test of the [[Venera]] series space probes. It may have been an attempted [[Venus]] impact, presumably similar to the later [[Kosmos 27]] mission, or it may have been intended from the beginning to remain in [[geocentric orbit]]. In any case, the spacecraft never left [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]] after insertion by the [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya]] launcher. The orbit decayed on 14 November 1963, three days after launch.\n\n== Launch ==\n\nKosmos 21 was launched at 06:23:34 GMT on 11 November 1963, atop a [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya]] 8K78 s/n G103-18 carrier rocket flying from [[Gagarin's Start|Site 1/5]] at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]].\n\n== Spacecraft designation ==\n\nBeginning in 1963, the name [[Kosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]] was given to Soviet spacecraft which remained in Earth orbit, regardless of whether that was their intended final destination. The designation of this mission as an intended planetary probe is based on evidence from Soviet and non-Soviet sources and historical documents. Typically Soviet planetary missions were initially put into an Earth [[parking orbit]] as a launch platform with a rocket engine and attached probe. The probes were then launched toward their targets with an engine burn with a duration of roughly 4 minutes. If the engine misfired or the burn was not completed, the probes would be left in Earth orbit and given a Kosmos designation.<ref>https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1963-044A - 27 February 2020</ref>\n\nThe spacecraft's original development name before being given the Kosmos 21 denomination once it reached orbit was '''3MV-1 No.1'''.<ref name=\"LL\">{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt |title=Launch Log|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|website=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis was the first \"third-generation\" deep space planetary probes of the 3MV series of the Soviet Union. Like the second generation, Soviet engineers planned four types of the 3MV, the 3MV-1 (for Venus impact), 3MV-2 (for Venus flyby), 3MV-3 (for Mars impact), and 3MV-4 (for Mars flyby). The primary difference over the second-generation was vastly improved (and in many cases doubled) orientation system elements as well as improved onboard propulsion systems.

This mission has been tentatively identified by NASA as a technology test of the [[Venera]] series space probes. It may have been an attempted [[Venus]] impact, presumably similar to the later [[Kosmos 27]] mission, or it may have been intended from the beginning to remain in [[geocentric orbit]]. In any case, the spacecraft never left [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]] after insertion by the [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya]] launcher. The orbit decayed on 14 November 1963, three days after launch.\n\n== Launch ==\n\nKosmos 21 was launched at 06:23:34 GMT on 11 November 1963, atop a [[Molniya (rocket)|Molniya]] 8K78 s/n G103-18 carrier rocket flying from [[Gagarin's Start|Site 1/5]] at the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]].\n\n== Spacecraft designation ==\n\nBeginning in 1963, the name [[Cosmos (satellite)|Kosmos]] was given to Soviet spacecraft which remained in Earth orbit, regardless of whether that was their intended final destination. The designation of this mission as an intended planetary probe is based on evidence from Soviet and non-Soviet sources and historical documents. Typically Soviet planetary missions were initially put into an Earth [[parking orbit]] as a launch platform with a rocket engine and attached probe. The probes were then launched toward their targets with an engine burn with a duration of roughly 4 minutes. If the engine misfired or the burn was not completed, the probes would be left in Earth orbit and given a Kosmos designation.<ref>https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1963-044A - 27 February 2020</ref>\n\nThe spacecraft's original development name before being given the Kosmos 21 denomination once it reached orbit was '''3MV-1 No.1'''.<ref name=\"LL\">{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt |title=Launch Log|last=McDowell|first=Jonathan|website=Jonathan's Space Page|accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThis was the first \"third-generation\" deep space planetary probes of the 3MV series of the Soviet Union. Like the second generation, Soviet engineers planned four types of the 3MV, the 3MV-1 (for Venus impact), 3MV-2 (for Venus flyby), 3MV-3 (for Mars impact), and 3MV-4 (for Mars flyby). The primary difference over the second-generation was vastly improved (and in many cases doubled) orientation system elements as well as improved onboard propulsion systems. While these four versions were meant to study Mars and Venus, the Soviets conceived of two additional variants of the series, similar but not\nidentical to the 3MV-1 and 3MV-4 versions, with the designations 3MV-1A and 3MV-4A.<ref name=siddiqi/>\n\nThese \"Object-Probes\" (ob'yekt-zond) were designed to verify key technological systems during simpler missions into deep space and back to Earth.
