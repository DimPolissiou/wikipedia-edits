On 22 May, Lambton resigned from both his office and Parliament, which caused a by-election for his seat which was won by [[Alan Beith]] for the Liberal Party. Shortly after, the name Jellicoe emerged in connection to a rendezvous for one of Norma's girls at a [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] mansion block which had been named Jellicoe House, after the earl's kinsman [[Basil Jellicoe]] (1899\u20131935), the housing reformer and priest from Magdalen College (Oxford). There was a confusion and [[George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]], the [[Lord Privy Seal]] and [[Leader of the House of Lords]], admitted 'casual affairs' with prostitutes from a Mayfair escort agency but denied knowing Norma Levy.<ref name=scandal/>\n\nA security inquiry on the prostitution scandal concluded that there had been \"nothing in (Lambton's) conduct to suggest that the risk of indiscretions on these occasions was other than negligible.\" Lambton stated that he had never taken his red state boxes of government documents with him when he visited Norma Levy. The security inquiry was held due to fears that the prostitution scandal may have involved an actual or potential breach of national security (as had occurred in the [[Profumo affair|Profumo scandal]] in the 1960s).\n\nWhen Lambton was interviewed by [[MI5]] officer [[Charles Elwell]], Lambton first claimed that the pressure of his job as a minister was what drove him to procure the prostitutes. Later, Lambton stated that his sense of \"the futility of the job\" and lack of demanding tasks as a junior minister were reasons he went to prostitutes. Finally, Lambton claimed that his judgment was faulty when he went to the prostitutes due to his obsession with the battle over the use of an aristocratic title that had been used by his father; Lambton claimed that he sought to soothe this obsession by engaging in frantic activities such as gardening and debauchery.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Villa cetinale, veduta.jpg|thumb|For the last three decades of his life, Lambton spent his energies restoring Villa Cetinale in Tuscany]]\n[[File:Anthony Howard and Lord Lambton appearing on \"After Dark\", 2 February 1991.jpg|180px|left|thumb|On ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' (right)]]\nFollowing the scandal, Lambton retired, separated from his wife and bought [[Villa Cetinale]], a 17th-century villa in [[Tuscany]], where he lived with Claire Ward, n\u00e9e Baring, mother of actress [[Rachel Ward]] and daughter of the cricketer [[Giles Baring]].<ref>Anonymous.

He was elected to [[Durham City Council]] and to [[Durham County Council]] in 1947, serving for two years.

He succeeded to the [[Earl of Durham|Earldom of Durham]] upon his father's death on 4 February 1970 but [[Peerage Act 1963|disclaimed]] it on 23 February to continue as an MP and Government Minister. He nonetheless insisted on being addressed as \"Lord Lambton\", the form of address appropriate to his former courtesy title, though a ruling of the [[Committee for Privileges]] said that he should not do so in the House of Commons since he had renounced his peerage. Contradictory rulings from two [[Speaker of the House of Commons|speaker]]s, [[Horace King, Baron Maybray-King|Horace King]] and [[Selwyn Lloyd]], then left the point unresolved.<ref name=obit>{{cite news|title=Obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1538319/Antony-Lambton.html|accessdate=13 April 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph (London)|date=2 Jan 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Resignation===\nIn 1973, Lambton's liaisons with prostitutes were revealed in the Sunday tabloid ''[[News of the World|The News of the World]].'' The husband of one of the prostitutes, Norma Levy, had secretly taken photographs of Lambton in bed with Levy and had attempted to sell the photographs to [[Fleet Street]] tabloids.<ref name=scandal>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3360629.stm|title=Sex scandal Tory blamed pressure|first=|last=|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1 January 2004}}</ref> As well, a police search of Lambton's home found a small amount of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. On 22 May, Lambton resigned from both his office and Parliament, which caused a by-election for his seat which was won by [[Alan Beith]] for the Liberal Party. Shortly after, the name Jellicoe emerged in connection to a rendezvous for one of Norma's girls at a [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] mansion block which had been named Jellicoe House, after the earl's kinsman [[Basil Jellicoe]] (1899\u20131935), the housing reformer and priest from Magdalen College (Oxford). There was a confusion and [[George Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]], the [[Lord Privy Seal]] and [[Leader of the House of Lords]], admitted 'casual affairs' with prostitutes from a Mayfair escort agency but denied knowing Norma Levy.<ref name=scandal/>\n\nA security inquiry on the prostitution scandal concluded that there had been \"nothing in (Lambton's) conduct to suggest that the risk of indiscretions on these occasions was other than negligible.\" Lambton stated that he had never taken his red state boxes of government documents with him when he visited Norma Levy. The security inquiry was held due to fears that the prostitution scandal may have involved an actual or potential breach of national security (as had occurred in the [[Profumo affair|Profumo scandal]] in the 1960s).\n\nWhen Lambton was interviewed by [[MI5]] officer [[Charles Elwell]], Lambton first claimed that the pressure of his job as a minister was what drove him to procure the prostitutes. Later, Lambton stated that his sense of \"the futility of the job\" and lack of demanding tasks as a junior minister were reasons he went to prostitutes. Finally, Lambton claimed that his judgment was faulty when he went to the prostitutes due to his obsession with the battle over the use of an aristocratic title that had been used by his father; Lambton claimed that he sought to soothe this obsession by engaging in frantic activities such as gardening and debauchery.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Villa cetinale, veduta.jpg|thumb|For the last three decades of his life, Lambton spent his energies restoring Villa Cetinale in Tuscany]]\n[[File:Anthony Howard and Lord Lambton appearing on \"After Dark\", 2 February 1991.jpg|180px|left|thumb|On ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' (right)]]\nFollowing the scandal, Lambton retired, separated from his wife and bought [[Villa Cetinale]], a 17th-century villa in [[Tuscany]], where he lived with Claire Ward, n\u00e9e Baring, mother of actress [[Rachel Ward]] and daughter of the cricketer [[Giles Baring]].<ref>Anonymous.

It has been used to make yarn, textiles and clothing for hundreds of years. Cashmere is closely associated with the [[Kashmir shawl]], the word \"cashmere\" deriving from an anglicisation of ''[[Kashmir]]'' when the Kashmir shawl reached Europe in the 19th century from [[Colonial India]]. Common usage defines the fiber as [[wool]], but it is finer, stronger, lighter, softer and approximately three times more insulating than [[sheep]] wool.<ref>Von Bergen, 1963</ref> Both the soft undercoat and the guard hairs may be used; the softer hair is reserved for textiles, while the coarse guard hair is used for brushes and other non-apparel purposes.\n\nA number of countries produce cashmere and have improved processing techniques over the years, but China and Mongolia are two of the leading producers as of 2019. Some yarns and clothing marketed as containing cashmere have been found to contain little to no cashmere fiber, so more stringent testing has been requested to make sure items are fairly represented.<ref name=\"Lanham\">{{cite web|url=https://www.natlawreview.com/article/yarn-spun-advertising-not-tailored-to-lanham-act-claim|title=A Yarn Spun, But Advertising Not Tailored to a Lanham Act Claim|publisher=[[The National Law Review]]|last=Browning|first=John|date=October 21, 2015|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Crackdown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB110375854829407721|title=The Cashmere Police Crack Down|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|last=Beatty|last2=Choi|first=Sally|first2=Hae Won|date=December 23, 2004|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHigh demand for the valuable fiber has resulted in the decimation and transformation of grasslands into deserts in Asia, increasing local temperatures and causing air pollution which has traveled to the Americas.<ref name=\"Chinadesert\">{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-china-cashmere-htmlstory-htmlstory.html|title=Your cheap sweater's real cost|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|last=Osnos|first=Evan|date=December 16, 2006|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Grassland\">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/12/09/504118819/how-your-cashmere-sweater-is-decimating-mongolias-grasslands|title=How Your Cashmere Sweater Is Decimating Mongolia's Grasslands|last=Schmitz|first=Rob|work=[[NPR]]|date=December 9, 2016|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Sources  ==\n[[File:Pashmina goats.jpg|thumb|[[Pashmina goat]]s, [[Ladakh]], [[India]]]]\nCashmere wool fiber for clothing and other textile articles is obtained from the neck region of Cashmere and other goats. Historically, fine-haired Cashmere goats have been called ''Capra hircus laniger'', as if they were a subspecies of the domestic goat ''Capra hircus''. However, they are now more commonly considered part of the domestic goat subspecies ''Capra aegagrus hircus'' or the alternate version ''Hircus Blythi Goat''. Cashmere goats produce a double [[Wool|fleece]] that consists of a fine, soft undercoat or underdown of hair mingled with a straighter and much coarser outer coating of hair called [[guard hair]]. For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. De-hairing is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair. After de-hairing, the resulting \"cashmere\" is ready to be dyed and converted into textile yarn, fabrics and garments.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Gathering ==\n[[File:cashmeregoat shearing.png|thumb|right|Cashmere shearing. [[Corindhap, Victoria|Corindhap]], Australia.]]\nCashmere wool is collected during the spring [[moulting]] season when the goats naturally shed their winter coat. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the goats moult as early as March and as late as May.\n\nIn some regions, the mixed mass of down and coarse hair is removed by hand with a coarse comb that pulls tufts of fiber from the animal as the comb is raked through the fleece. The collected fiber then has a higher yield of pure cashmere after the fiber has been washed and dehaired. The long, coarse guard hair is then typically clipped from the animal and is often used for brushes, [[interfacing]]s and other non-apparel uses. Animals in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australian Cashmere goat|Australia]] are typically [[shorn]] of their fleece, resulting in a higher coarse hair content and lower pure cashmere yield. In America, the most popular method is combing. The process takes up to two weeks, but with a trained eye for when the fiber is releasing, it is possible to comb the fibers out in about a week. The term \"baby cashmere\" is used for fibres harvested from younger goats, and has a reputation of being softer.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Shawl makers in Kashmir (1867).jpg|thumb|right|An 1867 [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]] painting depicting men manufacturing [[shawl]]s using pashm wool]]\n\n[[China]] has become the largest producer of raw cashmere, estimated at 19,200 metric tons (in hair) per year(2016). [[Mongolia]] follows with 8,900 tons (in hair) as of 2016,<ref>National Statistical Office of Mongolia, 2015, http://nso.mn</ref> while [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Toigonbaev |first1=Sabyr |title=The finer, the better |url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/cashmere-kyrgyzstan-distributed-global-scale-primary-producers-however-do-not-get-fair-price |work=D+C Development and Cooperation |volume=42 |issue=4 |date=18 March 2015 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> and other Central Asian republics produce lesser amounts. The annual world clip is estimated to be between 15,000 and 20,000 tons (13,605 and 18,140 tonnes) (in hair). Pure cashmere, resulting from removing animal grease, dirt and coarse hairs from the fleece, is estimated at about 6,500 tons (5,895 tonnes). Ultra-fine Cashmere or [[Pashmina]] is still produced by communities in [[Kashmir]] but its rarity and high price, along with political instability in the region, make it very hard to source and to regulate quality. It is estimated that on average yearly production per goat is {{convert|150|g|lb}}.\n\nPure cashmere can be dyed and spun into yarns and [[knitted]] into [[Sweater|jumpers]] (sweaters), [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s, [[sock]]s and other clothing, or woven into [[fabric]]s then cut and assembled into garments such as outer [[coat (clothing)|coats]], [[jacket]]s, [[trousers]] (pants), [[pajamas]], [[scarf|scarves]], [[blanket]]s, and other items. Fabric and garment producers in [[Scotland]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] have long been known as market leaders. Cashmere may also be blended with other fibers to bring the garment cost down, or to gain their properties, such as elasticity from wool, or sheen from silk.\n\nThe town of [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]], in the [[United States]] was an incubator for the cashmere wool industry.

Historically, fine-haired Cashmere goats have been called ''Capra hircus laniger'', as if they were a subspecies of the domestic goat ''Capra hircus''. However, they are now more commonly considered part of the domestic goat subspecies ''Capra aegagrus hircus'' or the alternate version ''Hircus Blythi Goat''. Cashmere goats produce a double [[Wool|fleece]] that consists of a fine, soft undercoat or underdown of hair mingled with a straighter and much coarser outer coating of hair called [[guard hair]]. For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. De-hairing is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair. After de-hairing, the resulting \"cashmere\" is ready to be dyed and converted into textile yarn, fabrics and garments.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Gathering ==\n[[File:cashmeregoat shearing.png|thumb|right|Cashmere shearing. [[Corindhap, Victoria|Corindhap]], Australia.]]\nCashmere wool is collected during the spring [[moulting]] season when the goats naturally shed their winter coat. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the goats moult as early as March and as late as May.\n\nIn some regions, the mixed mass of down and coarse hair is removed by hand with a coarse comb that pulls tufts of fiber from the animal as the comb is raked through the fleece. The collected fiber then has a higher yield of pure cashmere after the fiber has been washed and dehaired. The long, coarse guard hair is then typically clipped from the animal and is often used for brushes, [[interfacing]]s and other non-apparel uses. Animals in [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australian Cashmere goat|Australia]] are typically [[shorn]] of their fleece, resulting in a higher coarse hair content and lower pure cashmere yield. In America, the most popular method is combing. The process takes up to two weeks, but with a trained eye for when the fiber is releasing, it is possible to comb the fibers out in about a week. The term \"baby cashmere\" is used for fibres harvested from younger goats, and has a reputation of being softer.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Shawl makers in Kashmir (1867).jpg|thumb|right|An 1867 [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]] painting depicting men manufacturing [[shawl]]s using pashm wool]]\n\n[[China]] has become the largest producer of raw cashmere, estimated at 19,200 metric tons (in hair) per year(2016).

The annual world clip is estimated to be between 15,000 and 20,000 tons (13,605 and 18,140 tonnes) (in hair). Pure cashmere, resulting from removing animal grease, dirt and coarse hairs from the fleece, is estimated at about 6,500 tons (5,895 tonnes). Ultra-fine Cashmere or [[Pashmina]] is still produced by communities in [[Kashmir]] but its rarity and high price, along with political instability in the region, make it very hard to source and to regulate quality. It is estimated that on average yearly production per goat is {{convert|150|g|lb}}.\n\nPure cashmere can be dyed and spun into yarns and [[knitted]] into [[Sweater|jumpers]] (sweaters), [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s, [[sock]]s and other clothing, or woven into [[fabric]]s then cut and assembled into garments such as outer [[coat (clothing)|coats]], [[jacket]]s, [[trousers]] (pants), [[pajamas]], [[scarf|scarves]], [[blanket]]s, and other items. Fabric and garment producers in [[Scotland]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]] have long been known as market leaders.

The Scottish Board of Trustees for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures offered a 300 [[pound sterling]] reward to the first person who could spin cashmere in Scotland based on the French system. Captain Charles Stuart Cochrane collected the required information while in Paris and received a Scottish patent for the process in 1831. In the autumn of 1831, he sold the patent to Henry Houldsworth and sons of Glasgow. In 1832 Henry Houldsworth and sons commenced the manufacture of yarn, and in 1833 received the reward.<ref name=\"Scotland\">{{cite book| author=The Ministers of the respective parishes|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland, Volume VI| publisher=William Blackwood & sons |location=Edinburgh and London| year=1854| page=168|url= https://books.google.com/?id=RaICAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=Cochrane+cashmere}}</ref>\n\nDawson International claim to have invented the first commercial dehairing machine in 1890, and from 1906 they purchased cashmere from China, but were restricted to purchasing fiber from Beijing and Tianjin until 1978. In 1978 trade was liberalised and Dawson International began buying cashmere from many provinces.<ref name=\"Mcgregor\" />\n\nMany early textile centers developed as part of the American Industrial Revolution. Among them, the [[Blackstone Valley]] became a major contributor to the American Industrial Revolution. The town of [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]], became an early textile center in the Blackstone Valley, which was known for the manufacture of cashmere wool and satinets.\n\nAustrian Textile Manufacturer [[Bernhard Altmann]] is credited with bringing cashmere to the United States of America on a mass scale beginning in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://vintagefashionguild.org/label-resource/bernhard-altmann/|title=Vintage Fashion Guild : Label Resource : Altmann, Bernhard |work=vintagefashionguild.org}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe demand for the fiber has caused some vendors, both knowingly and not, to sell yarns or textiles containing little to no cashmere<ref name=\"Lanham\" /> representing themselves as being composed of cashmere. Wool and other fibers have been mixed in by unscrupulous manufacturers, deliberately selling mislabeled items to well-known department stores.

The line is {{RailGauge|3ft |lk=on|allk=}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] and {{convert|15.3|mi|km|1}} long. It is the remainder of what was a much larger network (over {{convert|46|mi|km|0}}) that also served the western town of [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], the northern town of [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] and the small [[Pit village|mining village]] of [[Foxdale]]. Now in [[government]] ownership, it uses original rolling stock and locomotives and there are few concessions to modernity.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Railway-osm-iom stream-bike.png|thumb|Isle Of Man Railway<br>Port Erin line (highlighted)]]\n[[File:Isle of Man Railway 1875.jpg|thumb|Share certificate of the Isle of Man Railway Company Ltd, issued 16 September 1875]]\nThe {{convert|15.3|mi|km|adj=on}} line from Douglas to Port Erin is the last remaining line of the former Isle of Man Railway Company, formed in 1870. Its first line, from [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] to [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], opened on 1 July 1873, followed by the Port Erin line on 1 August 1874. Initially the Port Erin line had been planned to terminate at [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]], but the construction of deep water docks at Port Erin caused an extension to the line. A few years after completion, the dock was destroyed by heavy seas and the idea of deep water vessels abandoned there. The remains of the breakwater are still visible at low tide.\n\nA third line was built in 1878\u20131879 by the [[Manx Northern Railway]], from [[St John's, Isle of Man|St John's]] (on the Douglas to Peel line) to [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]]. A further short line was constructed from St John's to Foxdale in 1885 to serve the lead mines there. Although it was built by the nominally independent [[Foxdale Railway]], it was leased to and operated by the Manx Northern. The loss of the mineral traffic from Foxdale and competition for the Douglas-Ramsey passenger traffic from the [[Manx Electric Railway]] placed the Manx Northern Railway in financial difficulties. It was taken over by the IMR in 1904.\n\nDuring the mid-1920s the IMR formed a bus subsidiary that operated most of the island's bus services, and helped the railway to remain profitable into the 1960s. The first serious examination of the long term viability of the railway came with the Howden Report in 1949, which recommended the closure of the Ramsey line, which was already losing money; the eventual closure of the Peel line, which was breaking even in the late 1940s; and the retention of the then profitable Port Erin line. Howden also reported that the existing equipment of the railway had an economic life of 10\u201325 years. Economies were made throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. These included the ending of evening and Sunday services, the deferral of track maintenance, and cuts to train mileage as locomotives became unserviceable. To further reduce expenses, there were winter closures of the Peel line (1960-61 only) and the Ramsey line after September 1961, but A. M. Sheard, the then general manager, refused to close the Ramsey line which by this time was losing a considerable amount of money each year.\n\nFollowing the closure of the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee|County Donegal Railways]] in 1960, the IMR purchased the CDR's two most modern diesel railcars, which were then largely used on the Peel line in summer, and after 1962 worked the whole of the winter service except when withdrawn for maintenance. The system closed after the 1965 season but was briefly revived when the [[Archibald Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa|Marquess of Ailsa]] obtained a lease and reopened all three routes in 1967.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18192356/isle_of_man_railway_to_reopen/| title=Manx railway may reopen for tourists| newspaper=The Guardian| date=20 February 1967| location=London| page=14| via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}</ref> Both the Peel and Ramsey lines shut following the 1968 season, but goods services between Peel and Milntown (just short of Ramsey) continued until mid-1969. Traffic was poor on the two northern lines, especially that to Ramsey, so after the end of the 1968 season, Ailsa decided to concentrate on passenger service on the South Line for three more seasons until he took the option to end his lease at the close of the 1971 season.\n\nThere were occasional empty coaching stock workings between Douglas and St John's in 1970 and 1971 for the retrieval of stored stock between seasons. During this time most of the early wooden framed carriages were moved to St John's, where they were lost in a fire in July 1975. The Peel and Ramsey routes and the [[Foxdale]] line were lifted in 1975. The IMR operated services between Douglas and Port Erin after Lord Ailsa took his five-year option, beginning in 1972 through the centenaries of the Peel and Port Erin lines in 1973 and 1974 respectively. In 1975, the Port Erin line operated only from its southwestern terminus to Castletown, but it was found that half a railway made twice the loss. The government sponsored a short extension of the service from Castletown to Ballasalla in 1976, and, after extensive campaigning during the 1976 Tynwald elections, the railway returned to Douglas in 1977, the last year in which the railway was operated by the IMR. Following nationalisation the railway has continued to be operated seasonally, for many years from Easter weekend until the end of September, more recently from around 1 March to early November.\n\n==Ownership==\n[[File:Douglas Railway Station Isle of Man.jpg|thumb|left|Viewed from the steps of the signal box (l-r) No. 13 ''Kissack'', No. 12 ''Hutchinson'' and No. 17 ''Viking'' at [[Douglas railway station]] in July 2006.]]\nFormed in 1870 with the first line following three years later, the Isle of Man Railway Company operated services until 1977 (see below) merging with the Manx Northern Railway and Foxdale Railway in 1905. The railway is now marketed as the ''Steam Railway'' to differentiate it from the [[Manx Electric Railway]], operated by the same department. It was marketed as \"Isle of Man Railway\" until closure in 1965. From 1969 to 1972, it operated as the ''Isle of Mann Victorian Steam Railway Company Limited'', reverting to Isle of Man Railway. When [[nationalised]] in 1978 it fell under the banner of \"Isle of Man Railway'''s'''\", along with the [[Manx Electric Railway]]. Re-branding to ''Isle of Man Passenger Transport'' took place from 1984 but the steam line was not affected, and this reverted to ''Isle of Man Railways'' from 1990, when a re-branding exercise took place with the emphasis on the Victorian origins of the railway. A change in management style occurred in 1999, and trains, trams and buses were presented as ''Isle of Man Transport''. The electric railway was affected more by this change, with a series of non-historical and modern liveries, but in 2007 this was changed and the railway is marketed once more as the ''Isle of Man Railway''. In keeping with the historical aspect, coaches and locomotives carry original names and transfers. The banner heading of all the railways was again changed in 2009 and became collectively known as ''Isle of Man Heritage Railways'', although the \"heritage\" tag has been dropped latterly. Joint timetabling with the Manx Electric Railway sees the line titled as the ''Steam Railway'' in marketing material.\n\n==South Line described==\n[[File:Douglas Terminus. Isle of Man Steam Railway - geograph.org.uk - 783719.jpg|thumb|right|Boarding, Douglas railway station (2008)]]\n[[File:Port St Mary Railway Station 1988.jpg|thumb|right|Entering Port St Mary railway station (1988)]]\nToday's railway is a fraction of its original size: it once served the western town of Peel, the northern town of Ramsey and the small mining village of Foxdale. Since 1969 only the southern line has been operational. Although it is only about half of its former size, [[Douglas railway station]] is still an impressive complex. After crossing the [[River Douglas, Isle of Man|River Douglas]], the line climbs the two-and-a-half-mile-long 1-in-65 Nunnery Bank through a wide rock cutting that brings it through a large estate, and past an industrial estate to the White Hoe, where the island's largest brewery is passed on the left of the train before crossing the first bridge. The train continues to climb to [[Port Soderick]], just before which passengers get the first view of the sea at Keristal, before descending into the railway station. The train then passes through Crogga Woods, under another bridge at Meary Veg (centre for the island's sewage treatment works) and climbs, reaching its summit ({{convert|209|ft|m|1}},<ref>https://www.gov.im/media/1346324/iomsteamrailway_windowgazerguide_aw.pdf Isle of Man Steam Railway Window Gazer Guide</ref> marked by a board visible from the train) close to the site of Ballacostain Halt. The train descends to [[Santon railway station|Santon]], the only intermediate station in substantially original condition. From here the train descends at 1 in 60 to [[Ballasalla railway station]], with interesting sea-cliff views to the east. Regular service trains formerly passed each other here. After Ballasalla the line runs over relatively flat land past the request halt at [[Ronaldsway railway station|Ronaldsway]] to the ancient capital of [[Castletown railway station|Castletown]].\n\nAfter Castletown the railway crosses the Silver Burn and heads northwest across country to the diminutive request stop at [[Ballabeg station|Ballabeg railway station]]. It then turns west for the short run to [[Colby, Isle of Man|Colby]], which is popular with the locals. After a request stop at the Level the train continues to Port St Mary, with views of [[Bradda Head]] and Milner's Tower on this stretch of line to Port Erin. [[Port Erin railway station]] is home to the Whistle Stop Cafe, providing light refreshments, and the [[Isle of Man Railway Museum]], established in 1975 with two locomotives and rolling stock including the Queen's Coach and Governor's Saloon from the opening of the line in 1873.\n\nThe majority of the line runs through countryside, with only small stretches close to built-up areas. Many people start or end their journey in [[Port Erin]], a Victorian seaside resort, or in [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]], the ancient capital. [[Ronaldsway railway station|Ronaldsway Halt]], between [[Ballasalla railway station|Ballasalla]] and [[Castletown railway station|Castletown]], is a few hundred yards' walk from the [[Isle of Man Airport|airport]]. There are several farm crossings and rural request stops, which largely serve adjoining fields and local communities, especially on the southernmost section which passes through agricultural land. The line passes along the southern plain after traversing the more hilly landscape north of Ballasalla.\n\n==Post-nationalisation==\n[[File:Trains pass ballasalla.jpg|thumb|left|No. 10 ''G.H. Wood'' & No. 12 ''Hutchinson'' passing at [[Ballasalla railway station|Ballasalla station]] (1998)]]\n[[File:Steam locomotive at Port Erin Station - geograph.org.uk - 155355.jpg|thumb|left|No. 12 ''Hutchinson'' shunts onto her train at Port Erin (2008)]]\nWhen the railway was [[nationalised]] in 1978 Bill Jackson was appointed the first manager. During his time in office much progress was made, not all liked by the preservationists and supporters: negative developments overshadowing his tenure included the loss of the large railway yard at Douglas and the unpopular rebuild of No. 12 locomotive ''Hutchinson''. Upon his retirement in 1987 he was replaced by Robert Smith, whose style was totally different and who made many changes. Smith masterminded the ''[[Year of Railways]]'' in 1993 and the celebrations that followed. Rolling stock returned to original \"purple lake\" livery and No.s 10, 15 and 1 (in that order) were returned to service. When he resigned in 1999 he was replaced by David Howard, with previous bus experience at various UK operators and rail experience from his time at [[Tyne and Wear Metro]]. He was more inclined to a corporate approach and the railway had to follow suit. His time in office, finishing in 2006, will be remembered for the thrust on [[health and safety]] issues, such as high-visibility clothing and warning signs, as part of a Government-wide drive. \n\nThe government commissioned a [[Observational study|study]] to see if it would be worthwhile to operate commuter services to help relieve the road [[traffic congestion]] in and around [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], and although experimental services were implemented in 2007, these operate only during T.T. race periods. The study recommended against such development. Nevertheless, almost all the line was relaid in the first few years of this century as part of the Department of Transport's IRIS sewerage scheme, with all but one of the numerous [[level crossings]] converted from manual to automatic operation, saving the cost of employing crossing keepers.\n\nAfter Howard resigned, the [[Department of Tourism and Leisure]]'s Director of Leisure, Mike Ball, stepped in as acting director of public transport, and in early 2007 the leisure and public transport divisions of the department combined into \"service delivery\", Ball becoming \"Director of service delivery\" under the minister [[Adrian Earnshaw]] appointed in November 2006. [[Ian Longworth]] was appointed Director of Public Transport in 2009 and since then the railway has become part of the Department of Community, Culture and Leisure.  A number of new services have been introduced since the arrival of the new director, including evening excursion trains, a ''Rush Hour'' event at the start of each season, and family-oriented events including a \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\" and \"Fathers' Day\" specials. A restoration programme for the unique collection of rolling stock and locomotives is ongoing; this has seen most recently two saloon-type coaches completely rebuilt and back in traffic; at least three more coaches are to be restored, one of which has been out of traffic for nearly half a century.\n\n==Locomotives==\n{{main|Isle of Man Railway locomotives}}\n[[File:IOMR kissack 2006.jpg|thumb|right|No. 13 ''Kissack'' (1910)<br>[[Douglas railway station|Douglas station]] (2009)]]\nAll but one of the railway's distinctive locomotives were built by [[Beyer, Peacock and Company]] of Manchester between 1873 and 1926, with 16 steam locomotives in total.  As of March 2020 there are nominally{{clarifyme|date=October 2018}} three{{Fix|text=five?}} locomotives in traffic: No. 8 ''Fenella'', No. 13 ''Kissack'' and  No. 15 ''Caledonia''. In addition, No. 11 ''Maitland'' is{{when|date=June 2018}} undergoing a long-term rebuild, whilst No. 4 ''Loch'' and No. 10 ''G. H. Wood'' are both undergoing overhaul. The [[Isle of Man Railway Museum]] is home to No. 1 \u2018\u2019Sutherland\u2019\u2019 of 1873 and No. 6 ''Peveril'' of 1875, with other locomotives at various locations. Only No. 2 ''Derby'' has been lost, with only the frames of No. 7 ''Tynwald'' in existence, privately owned off-island. The railway also possesses two diesel locomotives: No. 17 ''Viking'' which was withdrawn in 2010 and No. 21 ''Vignoles'', a diesel electric locomotive delivered in December 2013. A number of smaller shunting locomotives and people carriers for departmental use also exist.\n\n==Carriages==\n{{main||Isle of Man Railway rolling stock}}\n[[File:Reversing at Douglas 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Typical rolling stock<br>[[Douglas railway station|Douglas station]] (2010)]]\nAbout 30 carriages remain on the railway, of which 18 are in service, two in the [[Isle of Man Railway Museum]], and the rest in storage. Several vehicles were sold off-island in 1975 for preservation, and at least one has been preserved privately on the island. Over 12 out-of-use carriages were lost in a fire that engulfed the large carriage shed at St John's in 1975, and more were damaged beyond economic repair, including most of the remaining Manx Northern six-wheelers. There is an ongoing{{when|date=June 2018}} maintenance programme for returning coaches to traffic, which saw two saloon coaches completely rebuilt and returned to traffic in 2011, with a further two in 2012. In the winter of 2013, a replica of ''Empress Van'' F.27 was built on a steel underframe as a kitchen to work with the saloons as a dining train. Significant work was also done on the ''Cardinal's Coach'' F.35, which is used as the bar carriage, and the other saloons have being converted recently to dining cars seating 66 in total, giving the six saloon set as of 2015.\n\n==Operation==\n{{Isle of Man Railway RDT}}\nThe IMR has always had a marked seasonal pattern in traffic. Services evolved around two main considerations: the need to connect with ferries to and from the UK and Ireland, and to transport day trippers out of the major termini. The railway never evolved appreciable commuter traffic, so local traffic tended to revolve around shopping, attending markets, and trips to \"Town\".\n\nWhen the Isle of Man and Manx Northern Railways opened between 1873 and 1879, the basic service on all three main routes consisted of four or five trains a day. The first departures were timed to arrive in Douglas just before 08:30 to connect with the morning ferries to the UK. The trains returned from Douglas shortly after 09:00, crossing the second inbound trains of the day en route.  All three routes then had a late morning/lunchtime, and late afternoon trains in both the up and down directions, with the day's service ending with an early evening departure from Douglas. The February 1878 timetable shows departures from Douglas to Peel at 09:00, 11:00, 14:15, 17:15 and 19:40, and to Port Erin at 08:30, 10:10, 14:10, 17:00, and 19:35. From Peel to Douglas trains departed at 07:40, 10:05, 13:00, 16:00, and 18:30, and from Port Erin at 07:20, 09:50, 12:30, 15:40, and 18:20.  This rather basic service tended to increase until after World War Two: seven trains each way on the three main routes was the usual winter timetable in the 1920s and 30s.  From 1886 to 1940, the Foxdale branch was served by up to four round trips on weekdays from St John's.\n\nAdditional trains were added to the basic service at Easter and again at Whitsun. The high season timetable usually came into effect on the first Monday of July, or immediately following Tynwald Day (July 5). This often stretched the railway's resources to the limit. At its height in the 1920s, the railway was carrying well over a million passengers a year. In this timetable there were up to 15 round trips on the Peel and Port Erin lines, and up to 14 on the Ramsey line, with even Foxdale seeing a half dozen trains each day. In 1927, during the \"Bus War\", the IMR boasted that it ran \"100 trains a day at pre-war prices.\"\n\n===1930s and WW2===\nIn the 1930s, following the integration of train and bus services, the summer train service was trimmed to about a dozen trains each way on all three main routes. This intensive service ran on an entirely single-track system controlled by staff and ticket safeworking, with limited semaphore signalling. As the UK's 1889 Railways Act did not apply on the island, there were no signal interlockings except at Douglas and St John's, though limited interlocking in the form of slot detectors was fitted at passing loops from 1927 onwards. Continuous vacuum brakes were not fitted until 1925\u201327. In spite of this the railway has seen very few serious accidents (see below).\n\nDuring World War II, the usual winter timetable of seven or eight trains each way a day on all three main routes between 07:00 and 20:00 ran throughout.  However, as the number of servicemen on the island increased, additional late trains were run on Fridays and Saturdays: the last arrivals in Port Erin, Peel, and Ramsey were often around midnight. Military requirements led to a large number of special trains being run, some of them in the small hours of the morning, which led to some minor mishaps. Foxdale passenger services ceased in 1940, but the branch was heavily used for spoil trains during the construction of Jurby and Ronaldsway aerodromes.\n===Post war===\nTraffic levels remained very high in the late 1940s due to{{Fix|text=petrol?}} rationing, but the 1948 Howden Report foresaw the eventual closure of both the Ramsey and Peel lines, with goods services transferred to road transport. The brief post-war resurgence of the Manx tourist industry kept the trains well filled into the mid-1950s, and postponed the day when significant economies and modernisation would be required. From 1955 onwards usage declined sharply; a million passengers were carried for the last time in 1957. By then the high season schedule had been reduced to seven round trips to Port Erin, and five each on the Peel and Ramsey lines. However individual trains, such as the boat trains, and the 10:35 to Port Erin could load very heavily: 9 carriages and almost 500 passengers on a single train was common in high season. The last re-boilering before the 1965 closure took place in 1959; by then the active fleet had been reduced to 11 locomotives from the 16 of 1939 by the withdrawal of No.s 7, 2, 9, 4, and 3. Locos 1, 6, 13, 14 and 16 were known to have limited lives left on their existing boilers, so the future looked grim. Although the railway was still intensively used in summer, winter train services had been reduced to morning and afternoon round trips to Port Erin and Peel, and a solitary working to Ramsey. These trains operated mainly for parcels traffic, and were run at a considerable loss. Winter trains usually consisted of a locomotive and one or two carriages. The St John's - Peel section closed for the winter of 1960, reopening the following Easter, whilst in 1961-65 the St John's to Ramsey service was withdrawn for the winter months, after the long-established Kirk Michael to Ramsey school trains were replaced by buses. From 1962 the ex-County Donegal railcars handled most of the winter service; they were used between Douglas and Peel in the summer.\n\nThe last two summer timetables reflect the tourism of the mid-1960s. These show six round trips on the Port Erin line, three to five on the Peel line, and two to Ramsey. Except for the Port Erin-Douglas boat train July and August, all trains operated between 09:30 and 17:30: quite a contrast with the 15 or 16 hours-a-day operation of the 1920s and 1930s. Almost the whole of the Peel line service was handled by the ex-Donegal Railcars, allowing the remaining steam locomotives to be divided between the South Line and the service to Ramsey.\n\nIn June 1967 Ailsa issued an ambitious summer timetable that pushed a reduced locomotive fleet to its limit,<ref>Hendry and Hendry, 1977</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2018}} leaving no contingency in the event of failure, as by now only five Beyer Peacock steam locomotives and the railcars were available for service. The timetable was modified by mid-August to four round trips to Castletown (unchanged), three to Peel (down from 7) and two to Ramsey. This pattern carried over to the 1968 season, except that the Ramsey service was reduced to one train thrice-weekly by the end of the season.\n===Closure of Peel and Ramsey lines===\nSince the closure of the Peel and Ramsey lines, the basic service has generally been four trains a day between Douglas and Port Erin and return, at roughly two-hour intervals between 10:00 and 16:.00. In most seasons an extra train has operated from Douglas around 10:45 during July and August, returning from Port Erin at about 15.30. A brief 1990s experiment of six trains each way in high season was abandoned on grounds of cost. In the 2012, 2013, and 2014 seasons, a six train service has again been run in high season.  The service in 2012 followed the conventional pattern of a third locomotive and third set of carriages providing additional departures at 10:50 and 14:50 from Douglas, and 12:50 and 16:50 from Port Erin; but in 2013, a third locomotive was used to shorten turn around times at Douglas, and trains departed at 90-minute intervals through the day. This allowed the use of only two rakes of carriages for the scheduled service, allowing the saloons to be reserved for excursion and charter trains.\n\nIn the period 1945\u20131965 most trains consisted of two and three-carriage sets hauled by a single locomotive. Each three-car set consisted of a brake third or brake-composite, a first-third composite, and a luggage-brake-third, with two car sets omitting the either the brake-composite, or the luggage-brake-third. Three car sets had seats for 120 third class, 12 first class; two car sets carried up to 60 third and 12 first class passengers. Additional carriages - usually older stock such as \"the Pairs\" and \"small Fs\" - were added when loadings increased in mid-summer. The official maximum loading for a single locomotive was seven carriages until 1977, when it was reduced to six (SRN Spring 1978). However, during locomotive shortages a single Medium Boiler locomotive sometimes handled eight or nine carriages on Port Erin trains, banked as far as Keristal by the Douglas station pilot. Peel and Ramsey trains were usually combined between Douglas and St John's. These trains were often double-headed, usually to balance locomotive workings rather than on account of loading.\n\nApart from the Ramsey Cattle Mart specials and the transport of materials for projects such as the completion of an airfield in the north of the island, freight trains rarely operated. Most freight was conveyed by attaching freight wagons, loose coupled, to the rear of passenger trains. This practice was contrary to UK regulations, but legal on the Isle of Man. The consequent shunting often delayed passenger trains at intermediate stations, but was cost effective for the railway. A miscommunication while detaching a van from a Douglas train at Union Mills was a contributory factor to the 22 August 1925 accident at Douglas.\n\nFreight traffic ceased in the 1960s, as road transport was much more effective over the island's short distances. Ailsa's manager, Sir Philip Wombwell, did try to bring container traffic to the railway in 1967/8<ref>Hendry and Hendry, 1977</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2018}} and stripped 12 carriages from the F50-75 series of the bodies to act as container flats. The experiment proved unsuccessful as clearance issues prevented containers being carried north of Douglas, and the double transshipment of containers at Castletown - from ship to lorry and from lorry to train - made the traffic uneconomic.  Some of the underframes from this project eventually found their way to the [[Ffestiniog Railway]], where they were placed on two foot gauge bogies and used as the basis for some of the \"Barn\" carriages running on the FR. Far more successful was a contract to haul oil between Peel and Milntown (near Ramsey) for the Electricity Board. Three 'M' series wagons were fitted with tanks, and the oil was worked as tail traffic until passenger trains ceased in September. The service continued through the winter of 1968/9, but was abandoned in May 1969 following the decision to close the Peel and Ramsey lines.\n\n==Timetabling==\n[[File:Isle-of-mann-timetable1972.jpg|thumb|Summer 1972 timetable]]\n\n===1873\u20131966===\n\nThe railway operated a modest local train service throughout the year, which was considerably augmented during the summer months to accommodate tourist traffic.  Traffic was driven by three requirements: the need to connect with the ferries to and from Britain and Ireland, on-island transportation for tourists, and local passenger traffic.  It was common for three or four timetables to be produced each year reflecting seasonal trends, and these would be published in the local newspapers.  Winter traffic declined sharply after the 1920s, but it was not until 1960 that the railway was effectively \"closed\" for spells during the winter, with services only operating on certain days mainly for parcels traffic. This continued until November 1965 when the railway was closed ''\"for essential maintenance to take place\"''.  No trains ran in 1966 but the following year it reopened on a seasonal basis as a tourist attraction as detailed above.\n\n===1967\u20131968===\n\nThe entire network was leased by [[Archibald Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa]] and the lines reopened on 3 June 1967 operating an intensive service, especially on the Peel Line, until September; the following year saw a reduced timetable of operation but proved to be the final year of the lines serving Peel and Ramsey.  This has become known as the ''Ailsa Period'' known for the change of livery to spring green carried by the locomotives.  The timetables utilised the Peel and Port Erin lines heavily whilst there was no service to Ramsey on certain days, and then only a limited service ran.\n\n===1969\u20131972===\n\nFrom 1969 only the southern route to Port Erin was operated.  Services generally operated from May to September thereafter still under the auspices of Lord Ailsa; the former lines remained in situ but disused, save for occasional stock movements to the carriage shed at St John's for the winter storage of rolling stock.  A limited oil tanker service operated only in 1969.  At this time the now traditional pattern of four trains each way per day was adopted and it is this pattern of operation that broadly speaking remains in place today.\n\n===1973\u20131974===\n\nLord Ailsa took his five-year option on a 21-year lease and relinquished duties to operate trains from the close of the 1972 season and the Railway Company again took over services with subsidy from the Isle of Man Tourist Board.  The centenaries of the Peel and Port Erin lines were commemorated with special trains on the anniversary days in these two years.  Services continued to operate on the four each way per day pattern with additional services at peak times in the summer months to coincide with island events.\n\n===1975\u20131977===\n\nIn a cost-cutting measure, trains only operated between Port Erin and Castletown in 1975, and Port Erin and Ballasalla in 1976.  The line to Douglas was still maintained as locomotives and rolling stock returned there to receive maintenance.  There was much political controversy over the short-line workings and services were ultimately restored in 1977 although rails were lifted on the closed sections during this time.  1977 proved to be the final year of Railway Company operation of the line, again on a familiar seasonal basis with four trains each way per day between May and September.\n\n===1978\u20131986===\n\nVarious timetables were experimented with in the early period of nationalisation;  Notable in this period were the Friday only ''Winter Shoppers'' trains which ran during the 1981-1982 and 1983-1983 winter periods, with only one train from Port Erin and return each day.  Generally trains operated for Easter Week and the full season began at the end of May to coincide with the annual T.T. race period and ran until the last weekend of September.  Aside from the popular ''Santa Trains'', which have operated since 1985 the line remained closed in the winter months.  Also of note are the shuttle services which operated between Douglas and the country park at Lough Ned (mid-way to Port Soderick), these ran in peak season and often utilised the railcars; a platform was provided for this service which saw the last regular use of the railcars in passenger service.\n\n===1987\u20131999===\n\nTrains operated for Easter Week with the main season running from mid-May each year; from 1987 trains ran seven days a week in this period (previously there had been no Saturday service for several years) and many additional and extra timetables ran for the ''[[Year of Railways]]'' in 1993, the ''[[International Railway Festival]]'' in 1995 and ''[[Steam 125]]'' event in 1998.  Certain years also saw skeleton services operating in October and November in conjunction with various off-season attractions on the island, although the pattern of passing trains at Ballasalla was adhered to.  A familiar pattern during this period was the operation of an additional train on Mondays-Thursdays in July and August which left Douglas mid morning (10:50) and returned from Port Erin at 17:30, utilising the long-closed station at Port Soderick to pass the regular service trains.  It was common for a shuttle service to link Port Erin and Castletown during the closure of the Billown Circuit for racing during this time.\n\n===2000\u20132009===\n\nThe season was extended so that a daily service also operated during October half term with a three-week closure from the end of September.  During this time certain seasons saw trains passing at Castletown rather than the more traditional Ballasalla.  There was major disruption to services from 2000 when a sewer pipe was laid beneath the railway seeing short line workings from Douglas to Santon, and various shuttles between Port Erin, Port St Mary and Castletown over three seasons before the full line was reinstated.  A courtesy coach for passenger bridging the gap of the closed sections was laid on during this period.  The extra peak season train was dropped during this period and only four departures from either termini was the standard operational procedure.  From 2007 a commuter service operated during the T.T. period, in the first two years this also ran for Manx Grand Prix week.\n\n===2010\u20132014===\n\nThe season now extends until the first weekend of November to tie in with the ''Ride The Rocket'' Bonfire Night service and schools' half term.  Various timetables that operate at different times of the season, with the peak version seeing three train sets in service and six departures from each termini, the last one at approximately 19:00 from Douglas, returning from Port Erin at 21:00 - depending on the operating pattern.  Special event days often see bespoke timetables with additional services often providing shuttle services to intermediate stations, usually Ballasalla and Castletown, although Port St Mary has also been served by these shuttles.  On peak days such as the annual ''Rush Hour'' event, the service intensity is reminiscent of the Edwardian era with up to eleven trains each way operating over the 16 mile route.\n\n===2015 onwards===\n\nFrom the start of the 2015 season on 12 February, the [[passing loop]] was moved from Ballasalla to Castletown. The railway's new dining train often operates out of season, commonly travelling only as far as Santon, Ballasalla or Castletown before returning to Douglas. There are two basic timetables, the traditional four each way per day for the bulk of the season, with a six train service in peak season. In addition, evening trains operate on Thursdays in July and August, and commuter services continue to operate for the T.T. race period. A new initiative also sees the ''Commuter Club'' train which runs on the first Friday of each operating month departing Port Erin at 07:45 and returning from Douglas at 17:45 using the railway's dining train. The 2016 timetable followed a similar pattern to the previous year, the notable alteration being the ex-Port Erin services departing five minutes earlier than previously scheduled, commencing on 5 March and running until early November. The 2017 season commenced on 18 March with a timetable broadly following the pattern of the previous season with the addition of a schedule operating on Sundays in August to accommodate regular dining services.\n\n==Use in film==\nThe earliest use of the railway as a backdrop for filming purposes appears to have been in 1946 when ''[[I See a Dark Stranger|I See A Dark Stranger]]'' used Union Mills station in the opening scenes, doubling as a station in Ireland.  The Isle of Man was one of the locations for the movie ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'' when Castletown station became ''Shining Time station'' while the goods shed at Port Erin became Burnett Stone's workshop, containing a replica of ''Lady'', although the trains themselves were not used during production. Other locations were used to represent the entrance to Burnett's workshop (an old lead mine) and the entry to the Magic Railroad (near the old lead mine), and a workshop in Port Erin was used to store properties, presumably including the Lady replica. The railway has also been used during the filming of ''[[The Brylcreem Boys]]'' using on-board views and Douglas station, ''[[Five Children and It (film)|Five Children & It]]'' for which Castletown station was fitted with a temporary canopy and given period set dressing, Channel 4's production of ''[[Cinderella (2000 film)|Cinderella]]'' that saw Santon station used heavily, the BBC adaptation of ''[[The Ginger Tree]]'' in which it doubled for communist Russia using the carriage shed at Douglas, lineside scenes and Castletown station (No. 11 ''Maitland'' was painted matte black for this production and remained in this guide for the remainder of the 1989 season) as well as being the subject of a 1988 BBC documentary as part of the ''Train Now Departing...'' series in an episode called \"Steam in the Isle Of Man\".  Other television credits include an adaptation of ''[[Tamworth Two|The Legend Of The Tamworth Two]]'', the television movie ''[[Stiff Upper Lips]]'' and the long-running travelogue show ''[[Wish You Were Here...?]]'' which featured [[Sir Norman Wisdom]].\n\n==Events==\nOne-off and special events have been expanded from 2009 with further expansion in 2010 to include several now-annual initiatives, with the focus on the local market and families rather than the less lucrative enthusiasts' market which has tailed off since the expansive events beginning with the 1993 ''Year of Railways'' and beyond. Past and present special events are summarised as follows:\n\n[[File:Santas halt santon.jpg|thumb|right|No. 4 ''Loch'', Santon station<br>The ''Santa Express'']]\n[[File:Port Erin station. - geograph.org.uk - 784720.jpg|thumb|right|No. 13 ''Kissack'', Port Erin<br>National Week Train]]\n[[File:Castletown Water Tower.JPG|thumb|right|No. 4 ''Loch'', Castletown<br>''Nationwide Express'']]\n* '''Valentine's Love Train''' (commonly several services on and around 14 February with dining train options)\n* '''Storytelling Trains''' (children's themed event on the dining trains, started in February 2015)\n* '''Winter Photography''' (at the end of February or beginning of March around the opening of each season since 2011)\n* '''A Night At The Opera''' (black-tie event serving an evening's entertainment at the Erin Arts Centre)\n* '''Commuter Club''' (since 2015, an early morning and early evening service with the on-board bar open)\n* '''Rush Hour''' (an enthusiasts' event held over the Easter weekend annually since 2010)\n* '''Thanks, Mum''' (Mothers' Day special offers using the railway's dining train, several services)\n* '''Southern Belle''' (dining train excursions themed around an historical service on the railway)\n* '''Island At War''' (annual wartime-themed trains and events usually held mid-August)\n* '''The Darjeeling Limited''' (themed cuisine night with an evening service to Port Erin and return)\n* '''The Queenie Express''' (train services to tie in with the [[Queen scallop|Queenie]] Festival in Port St Mary)\n* '''Dining Trains Of The World''' (a series of dining trains with menus themed around worldwide cuisine)\n* '''Trans-Siberian Express''' (themed cuisine night with an evening service to Port Erin and return)\n* '''Rail Ale Tour''' (bar train service to Port Erin tie in with the beer festival at the former Falcon's Nest Hotel)\n* '''Southern 100 Shuttle''' (occasional road closure replacement service between Port Erin and Castletown)\n* '''Manx Heritage Transport Festival''' (the main summer festival, usually at end of July or start of August)\n* '''Teddy Bears' Picnic''' (various themed events centring on Ballasalla, usually early September)\n* '''The Curry Club''' (themed dining service operating on commuter train days only)\n* '''Night At The Museum''' (Thursday evenings with late opening of the railway museum in Port Erin)\n* '''Shoebox Special''' (a special service for ''Operation Christmas Child'' charity, usually November)\n* '''Le Train Bleu''' (themed cuisine night with an evening service to Port Erin and return)\n* '''Family Fun Weekend''' (weekend in late August featuring bouncy castles, face-painting, etc.)\n* '''A Musical Gala''' (tie in with the Erin Arts Centre for an evening of old-time musical hall)\n* '''Manx National Week Trains''' (trains carry commemorative headboards in the first week of July)\n* '''[[Hop-tu-Naa]] Express''' (since 2010, themed ghost train event at Hallowe'en with dining trains)\n* '''The Emporia's Banquet''' (themed cuisine night with an evening service to Port Erin and return)\n* '''Ride The Rocket''' (the end of season train serving the fireworks and bonfire in Port Erin)\n* '''The Santa Express''' (visiting Santa in his grotto at various locations, Castletown or Santon)\n* '''Christmas Shopping Express''' (a direct shopping service to Douglas from Port Erin in December)\n* '''Blow Away The Cobwebs Train''' (out of season one-off special services prior to the New Year)\n\n==Accidents==\n\n* On 22 August 1925 a train hauled by No. 3 [[Isle of Man Railway locomotives|''Pender'']] ran into Douglas station with insufficient braking power as a misunderstanding had resulted in the Guard and Brakesman being left behind at Union Mills, resulting in there being no-one on board the forward and rear brake vans to apply the train handbrakes. The Fireman of the train was killed but the Driver, William Costain, escaped unhurt. [[Vacuum brake]]s were introduced as a result of the accident.<ref name=Manx>{{cite book | first = Edward| last = Gray| year = 1998| title = Manx Railways & Tramways| publisher =Sutton Publishing Ltd | location = Stroud| isbn = 0-7509-1827-6| page = 23}}</ref>\n* J.I.C.

The line is {{RailGauge|3ft |lk=on|allk=}} [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] and {{convert|15.3|mi|km|1}} long. It is the remainder of what was a much larger network (over {{convert|46|mi|km|0}}) that also served the western town of [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], the northern town of [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] and the small [[Pit village|mining village]] of [[Foxdale]]. Now in [[government]] ownership, it uses original rolling stock and locomotives and there are few concessions to modernity.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Railway-osm-iom stream-bike.png|thumb|Isle Of Man Railway<br>Port Erin line (highlighted)]]\n[[File:Isle of Man Railway 1875.jpg|thumb|Share certificate of the Isle of Man Railway Company Ltd, issued 16 September 1875]]\nThe {{convert|15.3|mi|km|adj=on}} line from Douglas to Port Erin is the last remaining line of the former Isle of Man Railway Company, formed in 1870. Its first line, from [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] to [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], opened on 1 July 1873, followed by the Port Erin line on 1 August 1874. Initially the Port Erin line had been planned to terminate at [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]], but the construction of deep water docks at Port Erin caused an extension to the line. A few years after completion, the dock was destroyed by heavy seas and the idea of deep water vessels abandoned there. The remains of the breakwater are still visible at low tide.\n\nA third line was built in 1878\u20131879 by the [[Manx Northern Railway]], from [[St John's, Isle of Man|St John's]] (on the Douglas to Peel line) to [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]]. A further short line was constructed from St John's to Foxdale in 1885 to serve the lead mines there. Although it was built by the nominally independent [[Foxdale Railway]], it was leased to and operated by the Manx Northern. The loss of the mineral traffic from Foxdale and competition for the Douglas-Ramsey passenger traffic from the [[Manx Electric Railway]] placed the Manx Northern Railway in financial difficulties. It was taken over by the IMR in 1904.\n\nDuring the mid-1920s the IMR formed a bus subsidiary that operated most of the island's bus services, and helped the railway to remain profitable into the 1960s. The first serious examination of the long term viability of the railway came with the Howden Report in 1949, which recommended the closure of the Ramsey line, which was already losing money; the eventual closure of the Peel line, which was breaking even in the late 1940s; and the retention of the then profitable Port Erin line. Howden also reported that the existing equipment of the railway had an economic life of 10\u201325 years. Economies were made throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. These included the ending of evening and Sunday services, the deferral of track maintenance, and cuts to train mileage as locomotives became unserviceable. To further reduce expenses, there were winter closures of the Peel line (1960-61 only) and the Ramsey line after September 1961, but A. M. Sheard, the then general manager, refused to close the Ramsey line which by this time was losing a considerable amount of money each year.\n\nFollowing the closure of the [[County Donegal Railways Joint Committee|County Donegal Railways]] in 1960, the IMR purchased the CDR's two most modern diesel railcars, which were then largely used on the Peel line in summer, and after 1962 worked the whole of the winter service except when withdrawn for maintenance. The system closed after the 1965 season but was briefly revived when the [[Archibald Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa|Marquess of Ailsa]] obtained a lease and reopened all three routes in 1967.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18192356/isle_of_man_railway_to_reopen/| title=Manx railway may reopen for tourists| newspaper=The Guardian| date=20 February 1967| location=London| page=14| via=Newspapers.com}} {{open access}}</ref> Both the Peel and Ramsey lines shut following the 1968 season, but goods services between Peel and Milntown (just short of Ramsey) continued until mid-1969. Traffic was poor on the two northern lines, especially that to Ramsey, so after the end of the 1968 season, Ailsa decided to concentrate on passenger service on the South Line for three more seasons until he took the option to end his lease at the close of the 1971 season.\n\nThere were occasional empty coaching stock workings between Douglas and St John's in 1970 and 1971 for the retrieval of stored stock between seasons. During this time most of the early wooden framed carriages were moved to St John's, where they were lost in a fire in July 1975. The Peel and Ramsey routes and the [[Foxdale]] line were lifted in 1975. The IMR operated services between Douglas and Port Erin after Lord Ailsa took his five-year option, beginning in 1972 through the centenaries of the Peel and Port Erin lines in 1973 and 1974 respectively. In 1975, the Port Erin line operated only from its southwestern terminus to Castletown, but it was found that half a railway made twice the loss. The government sponsored a short extension of the service from Castletown to Ballasalla in 1976, and, after extensive campaigning during the 1976 Tynwald elections, the railway returned to Douglas in 1977, the last year in which the railway was operated by the IMR. Following nationalisation the railway has continued to be operated seasonally, for many years from Easter weekend until the end of September, more recently from around 1 March to early November.\n\n==Ownership==\n[[File:Douglas Railway Station Isle of Man.jpg|thumb|left|Viewed from the steps of the signal box (l-r) No. 13 ''Kissack'', No. 12 ''Hutchinson'' and No. 17 ''Viking'' at [[Douglas railway station]] in July 2006.]]\nFormed in 1870 with the first line following three years later, the Isle of Man Railway Company operated services until 1977 (see below) merging with the Manx Northern Railway and Foxdale Railway in 1905. The railway is now marketed as the ''Steam Railway'' to differentiate it from the [[Manx Electric Railway]], operated by the same department. It was marketed as \"Isle of Man Railway\" until closure in 1965. From 1969 to 1972, it operated as the ''Isle of Mann Victorian Steam Railway Company Limited'', reverting to Isle of Man Railway. When [[nationalised]] in 1978 it fell under the banner of \"Isle of Man Railway'''s'''\", along with the [[Manx Electric Railway]]. Re-branding to ''Isle of Man Passenger Transport'' took place from 1984 but the steam line was not affected, and this reverted to ''Isle of Man Railways'' from 1990, when a re-branding exercise took place with the emphasis on the Victorian origins of the railway. A change in management style occurred in 1999, and trains, trams and buses were presented as ''Isle of Man Transport''. The electric railway was affected more by this change, with a series of non-historical and modern liveries, but in 2007 this was changed and the railway is marketed once more as the ''Isle of Man Railway''. In keeping with the historical aspect, coaches and locomotives carry original names and transfers. The banner heading of all the railways was again changed in 2009 and became collectively known as ''Isle of Man Heritage Railways'', although the \"heritage\" tag has been dropped latterly. Joint timetabling with the Manx Electric Railway sees the line titled as the ''Steam Railway'' in marketing material.\n\n==South Line described==\n[[File:Douglas Terminus. Isle of Man Steam Railway - geograph.org.uk - 783719.jpg|thumb|right|Boarding, Douglas railway station (2008)]]\n[[File:Port St Mary Railway Station 1988.jpg|thumb|right|Entering Port St Mary railway station (1988)]]\nToday's railway is a fraction of its original size: it once served the western town of Peel, the northern town of Ramsey and the small mining village of Foxdale. Since 1969 only the southern line has been operational. Although it is only about half of its former size, [[Douglas railway station]] is still an impressive complex. After crossing the [[River Douglas, Isle of Man|River Douglas]], the line climbs the two-and-a-half-mile-long 1-in-65 Nunnery Bank through a wide rock cutting that brings it through a large estate, and past an industrial estate to the White Hoe, where the island's largest brewery is passed on the left of the train before crossing the first bridge. The train continues to climb to [[Port Soderick]], just before which passengers get the first view of the sea at Keristal, before descending into the railway station. The train then passes through Crogga Woods, under another bridge at Meary Veg (centre for the island's sewage treatment works) and climbs, reaching its summit ({{convert|209|ft|m|1}},<ref>https://www.gov.im/media/1346324/iomsteamrailway_windowgazerguide_aw.pdf Isle of Man Steam Railway Window Gazer Guide</ref> marked by a board visible from the train) close to the site of Ballacostain Halt. The train descends to [[Santon railway station|Santon]], the only intermediate station in substantially original condition. From here the train descends at 1 in 60 to [[Ballasalla railway station]], with interesting sea-cliff views to the east. Regular service trains formerly passed each other here. After Ballasalla the line runs over relatively flat land past the request halt at [[Ronaldsway railway station|Ronaldsway]] to the ancient capital of [[Castletown railway station|Castletown]].\n\nAfter Castletown the railway crosses the Silver Burn and heads northwest across country to the diminutive request stop at [[Ballabeg station|Ballabeg railway station]]. It then turns west for the short run to [[Colby, Isle of Man|Colby]], which is popular with the locals. After a request stop at the Level the train continues to Port St Mary, with views of [[Bradda Head]] and Milner's Tower on this stretch of line to Port Erin. [[Port Erin railway station]] is home to the Whistle Stop Cafe, providing light refreshments, and the [[Isle of Man Railway Museum]], established in 1975 with two locomotives and rolling stock including the Queen's Coach and Governor's Saloon from the opening of the line in 1873.\n\nThe majority of the line runs through countryside, with only small stretches close to built-up areas. Many people start or end their journey in [[Port Erin]], a Victorian seaside resort, or in [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]], the ancient capital. [[Ronaldsway railway station|Ronaldsway Halt]], between [[Ballasalla railway station|Ballasalla]] and [[Castletown railway station|Castletown]], is a few hundred yards' walk from the [[Isle of Man Airport|airport]]. There are several farm crossings and rural request stops, which largely serve adjoining fields and local communities, especially on the southernmost section which passes through agricultural land. The line passes along the southern plain after traversing the more hilly landscape north of Ballasalla.\n\n==Post-nationalisation==\n[[File:Trains pass ballasalla.jpg|thumb|left|No. 10 ''G.H. Wood'' & No. 12 ''Hutchinson'' passing at [[Ballasalla railway station|Ballasalla station]] (1998)]]\n[[File:Steam locomotive at Port Erin Station - geograph.org.uk - 155355.jpg|thumb|left|No. 12 ''Hutchinson'' shunts onto her train at Port Erin (2008)]]\nWhen the railway was [[nationalised]] in 1978 Bill Jackson was appointed the first manager. During his time in office much progress was made, not all liked by the preservationists and supporters: negative developments overshadowing his tenure included the loss of the large railway yard at Douglas and the unpopular rebuild of No. 12 locomotive ''Hutchinson''. Upon his retirement in 1987 he was replaced by Robert Smith, whose style was totally different and who made many changes. Smith masterminded the ''[[Year of Railways]]'' in 1993 and the celebrations that followed. Rolling stock returned to original \"purple lake\" livery and No.s 10, 15 and 1 (in that order) were returned to service. When he resigned in 1999 he was replaced by David Howard, with previous bus experience at various UK operators and rail experience from his time at [[Tyne and Wear Metro]]. He was more inclined to a corporate approach and the railway had to follow suit. His time in office, finishing in 2006, will be remembered for the thrust on [[health and safety]] issues, such as high-visibility clothing and warning signs, as part of a Government-wide drive. \n\nThe government commissioned a [[Observational study|study]] to see if it would be worthwhile to operate commuter services to help relieve the road [[traffic congestion]] in and around [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], and although experimental services were implemented in 2007, these operate only during T.T. race periods. The study recommended against such development. Nevertheless, almost all the line was relaid in the first few years of this century as part of the Department of Transport's IRIS sewerage scheme, with all but one of the numerous [[level crossings]] converted from manual to automatic operation, saving the cost of employing crossing keepers.\n\nAfter Howard resigned, the [[Department of Tourism and Leisure]]'s Director of Leisure, Mike Ball, stepped in as acting director of public transport, and in early 2007 the leisure and public transport divisions of the department combined into \"service delivery\", Ball becoming \"Director of service delivery\" under the minister [[Adrian Earnshaw]] appointed in November 2006. [[Ian Longworth]] was appointed Director of Public Transport in 2009 and since then the railway has become part of the Department of Community, Culture and Leisure.  A number of new services have been introduced since the arrival of the new director, including evening excursion trains, a ''Rush Hour'' event at the start of each season, and family-oriented events including a \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\" and \"Fathers' Day\" specials. A restoration programme for the unique collection of rolling stock and locomotives is ongoing; this has seen most recently two saloon-type coaches completely rebuilt and back in traffic; at least three more coaches are to be restored, one of which has been out of traffic for nearly half a century.\n\n==Locomotives==\n{{main|Isle of Man Railway locomotives}}\n[[File:IOMR kissack 2006.jpg|thumb|right|No. 13 ''Kissack'' (1910)<br>[[Douglas railway station|Douglas station]] (2009)]]\nAll but one of the railway's distinctive locomotives were built by [[Beyer, Peacock and Company]] of Manchester between 1873 and 1926, with 16 steam locomotives in total.  As of March 2020 there are nominally{{clarifyme|date=October 2018}} three{{Fix|text=five?}} locomotives in traffic: No. 8 ''Fenella'', No. 13 ''Kissack'' and  No. 15 ''Caledonia''. In addition, No. 11 ''Maitland'' is{{when|date=June 2018}} undergoing a long-term rebuild, whilst No. 4 ''Loch'' and No. 10 ''G. H. Wood'' are both undergoing overhaul. The [[Isle of Man Railway Museum]] is home to No. 1 \u2018\u2019Sutherland\u2019\u2019 of 1873 and No. 6 ''Peveril'' of 1875, with other locomotives at various locations. Only No. 2 ''Derby'' has been lost, with only the frames of No. 7 ''Tynwald'' in existence, privately owned off-island. The railway also possesses two diesel locomotives: No. 17 ''Viking'' which was withdrawn in 2010 and No. 21 ''Vignoles'', a diesel electric locomotive delivered in December 2013. A number of smaller shunting locomotives and people carriers for departmental use also exist.\n\n==Carriages==\n{{main||Isle of Man Railway rolling stock}}\n[[File:Reversing at Douglas 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Typical rolling stock<br>[[Douglas railway station|Douglas station]] (2010)]]\nAbout 30 carriages remain on the railway, of which 18 are in service, two in the [[Isle of Man Railway Museum]], and the rest in storage. Several vehicles were sold off-island in 1975 for preservation, and at least one has been preserved privately on the island. Over 12 out-of-use carriages were lost in a fire that engulfed the large carriage shed at St John's in 1975, and more were damaged beyond economic repair, including most of the remaining Manx Northern six-wheelers. There is an ongoing{{when|date=June 2018}} maintenance programme for returning coaches to traffic, which saw two saloon coaches completely rebuilt and returned to traffic in 2011, with a further two in 2012. In the winter of 2013, a replica of ''Empress Van'' F.27 was built on a steel underframe as a kitchen to work with the saloons as a dining train. Significant work was also done on the ''Cardinal's Coach'' F.35, which is used as the bar carriage, and the other saloons have being converted recently to dining cars seating 66 in total, giving the six saloon set as of 2015.\n\n==Operation==\n{{Isle of Man Railway RDT}}\nThe IMR has always had a marked seasonal pattern in traffic. Services evolved around two main considerations: the need to connect with ferries to and from the UK and Ireland, and to transport day trippers out of the major termini. The railway never evolved appreciable commuter traffic, so local traffic tended to revolve around shopping, attending markets, and trips to \"Town\".\n\nWhen the Isle of Man and Manx Northern Railways opened between 1873 and 1879, the basic service on all three main routes consisted of four or five trains a day. The first departures were timed to arrive in Douglas just before 08:30 to connect with the morning ferries to the UK. The trains returned from Douglas shortly after 09:00, crossing the second inbound trains of the day en route.  All three routes then had a late morning/lunchtime, and late afternoon trains in both the up and down directions, with the day's service ending with an early evening departure from Douglas. The February 1878 timetable shows departures from Douglas to Peel at 09:00, 11:00, 14:15, 17:15 and 19:40, and to Port Erin at 08:30, 10:10, 14:10, 17:00, and 19:35. From Peel to Douglas trains departed at 07:40, 10:05, 13:00, 16:00, and 18:30, and from Port Erin at 07:20, 09:50, 12:30, 15:40, and 18:20.  This rather basic service tended to increase until after World War Two: seven trains each way on the three main routes was the usual winter timetable in the 1920s and 30s.  From 1886 to 1940, the Foxdale branch was served by up to four round trips on weekdays from St John's.\n\nAdditional trains were added to the basic service at Easter and again at Whitsun. The high season timetable usually came into effect on the first Monday of July, or immediately following Tynwald Day (July 5). This often stretched the railway's resources to the limit. At its height in the 1920s, the railway was carrying well over a million passengers a year. In this timetable there were up to 15 round trips on the Peel and Port Erin lines, and up to 14 on the Ramsey line, with even Foxdale seeing a half dozen trains each day. In 1927, during the \"Bus War\", the IMR boasted that it ran \"100 trains a day at pre-war prices.\"\n\n===1930s and WW2===\nIn the 1930s, following the integration of train and bus services, the summer train service was trimmed to about a dozen trains each way on all three main routes. This intensive service ran on an entirely single-track system controlled by staff and ticket safeworking, with limited semaphore signalling. As the UK's 1889 Railways Act did not apply on the island, there were no signal interlockings except at Douglas and St John's, though limited interlocking in the form of slot detectors was fitted at passing loops from 1927 onwards. Continuous vacuum brakes were not fitted until 1925\u201327. In spite of this the railway has seen very few serious accidents (see below).\n\nDuring World War II, the usual winter timetable of seven or eight trains each way a day on all three main routes between 07:00 and 20:00 ran throughout.  However, as the number of servicemen on the island increased, additional late trains were run on Fridays and Saturdays: the last arrivals in Port Erin, Peel, and Ramsey were often around midnight. Military requirements led to a large number of special trains being run, some of them in the small hours of the morning, which led to some minor mishaps. Foxdale passenger services ceased in 1940, but the branch was heavily used for spoil trains during the construction of Jurby and Ronaldsway aerodromes.\n===Post war===\nTraffic levels remained very high in the late 1940s due to{{Fix|text=petrol?}} rationing, but the 1948 Howden Report foresaw the eventual closure of both the Ramsey and Peel lines, with goods services transferred to road transport. The brief post-war resurgence of the Manx tourist industry kept the trains well filled into the mid-1950s, and postponed the day when significant economies and modernisation would be required. From 1955 onwards usage declined sharply; a million passengers were carried for the last time in 1957. By then the high season schedule had been reduced to seven round trips to Port Erin, and five each on the Peel and Ramsey lines. However individual trains, such as the boat trains, and the 10:35 to Port Erin could load very heavily: 9 carriages and almost 500 passengers on a single train was common in high season. The last re-boilering before the 1965 closure took place in 1959; by then the active fleet had been reduced to 11 locomotives from the 16 of 1939 by the withdrawal of No.s 7, 2, 9, 4, and 3. Locos 1, 6, 13, 14 and 16 were known to have limited lives left on their existing boilers, so the future looked grim. Although the railway was still intensively used in summer, winter train services had been reduced to morning and afternoon round trips to Port Erin and Peel, and a solitary working to Ramsey. These trains operated mainly for parcels traffic, and were run at a considerable loss. Winter trains usually consisted of a locomotive and one or two carriages. The St John's - Peel section closed for the winter of 1960, reopening the following Easter, whilst in 1961-65 the St John's to Ramsey service was withdrawn for the winter months, after the long-established Kirk Michael to Ramsey school trains were replaced by buses. From 1962 the ex-County Donegal railcars handled most of the winter service; they were used between Douglas and Peel in the summer.\n\nThe last two summer timetables reflect the tourism of the mid-1960s. These show six round trips on the Port Erin line, three to five on the Peel line, and two to Ramsey. Except for the Port Erin-Douglas boat train July and August, all trains operated between 09:30 and 17:30: quite a contrast with the 15 or 16 hours-a-day operation of the 1920s and 1930s. Almost the whole of the Peel line service was handled by the ex-Donegal Railcars, allowing the remaining steam locomotives to be divided between the South Line and the service to Ramsey.\n\nIn June 1967 Ailsa issued an ambitious summer timetable that pushed a reduced locomotive fleet to its limit,<ref>Hendry and Hendry, 1977</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2018}} leaving no contingency in the event of failure, as by now only five Beyer Peacock steam locomotives and the railcars were available for service. The timetable was modified by mid-August to four round trips to Castletown (unchanged), three to Peel (down from 7) and two to Ramsey. This pattern carried over to the 1968 season, except that the Ramsey service was reduced to one train thrice-weekly by the end of the season.\n===Closure of Peel and Ramsey lines===\nSince the closure of the Peel and Ramsey lines, the basic service has generally been four trains a day between Douglas and Port Erin and return, at roughly two-hour intervals between 10:00 and 16:.00. In most seasons an extra train has operated from Douglas around 10:45 during July and August, returning from Port Erin at about 15.30. A brief 1990s experiment of six trains each way in high season was abandoned on grounds of cost. In the 2012, 2013, and 2014 seasons, a six train service has again been run in high season.  The service in 2012 followed the conventional pattern of a third locomotive and third set of carriages providing additional departures at 10:50 and 14:50 from Douglas, and 12:50 and 16:50 from Port Erin; but in 2013, a third locomotive was used to shorten turn around times at Douglas, and trains departed at 90-minute intervals through the day. This allowed the use of only two rakes of carriages for the scheduled service, allowing the saloons to be reserved for excursion and charter trains.\n\nIn the period 1945\u20131965 most trains consisted of two and three-carriage sets hauled by a single locomotive. Each three-car set consisted of a brake third or brake-composite, a first-third composite, and a luggage-brake-third, with two car sets omitting the either the brake-composite, or the luggage-brake-third. Three car sets had seats for 120 third class, 12 first class; two car sets carried up to 60 third and 12 first class passengers. Additional carriages - usually older stock such as \"the Pairs\" and \"small Fs\" - were added when loadings increased in mid-summer. The official maximum loading for a single locomotive was seven carriages until 1977, when it was reduced to six (SRN Spring 1978). However, during locomotive shortages a single Medium Boiler locomotive sometimes handled eight or nine carriages on Port Erin trains, banked as far as Keristal by the Douglas station pilot. Peel and Ramsey trains were usually combined between Douglas and St John's. These trains were often double-headed, usually to balance locomotive workings rather than on account of loading.\n\nApart from the Ramsey Cattle Mart specials and the transport of materials for projects such as the completion of an airfield in the north of the island, freight trains rarely operated. Most freight was conveyed by attaching freight wagons, loose coupled, to the rear of passenger trains. This practice was contrary to UK regulations, but legal on the Isle of Man. The consequent shunting often delayed passenger trains at intermediate stations, but was cost effective for the railway. A miscommunication while detaching a van from a Douglas train at Union Mills was a contributory factor to the 22 August 1925 accident at Douglas.\n\nFreight traffic ceased in the 1960s, as road transport was much more effective over the island's short distances. Ailsa's manager, Sir Philip Wombwell, did try to bring container traffic to the railway in 1967/8<ref>Hendry and Hendry, 1977</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2018}} and stripped 12 carriages from the F50-75 series of the bodies to act as container flats. The experiment proved unsuccessful as clearance issues prevented containers being carried north of Douglas, and the double transshipment of containers at Castletown - from ship to lorry and from lorry to train - made the traffic uneconomic.  Some of the underframes from this project eventually found their way to the [[Ffestiniog Railway]], where they were placed on two foot gauge bogies and used as the basis for some of the \"Barn\" carriages running on the FR. Far more successful was a contract to haul oil between Peel and Milntown (near Ramsey) for the Electricity Board. Three 'M' series wagons were fitted with tanks, and the oil was worked as tail traffic until passenger trains ceased in September. The service continued through the winter of 1968/9, but was abandoned in May 1969 following the decision to close the Peel and Ramsey lines.\n\n==Timetabling==\n[[File:Isle-of-mann-timetable1972.jpg|thumb|Summer 1972 timetable]]\n\n===1873\u20131966===\n\nThe railway operated a modest local train service throughout the year, which was considerably augmented during the summer months to accommodate tourist traffic.  Traffic was driven by three requirements: the need to connect with the ferries to and from Britain and Ireland, on-island transportation for tourists, and local passenger traffic.  It was common for three or four timetables to be produced each year reflecting seasonal trends, and these would be published in the local newspapers.  Winter traffic declined sharply after the 1920s, but it was not until 1960 that the railway was effectively \"closed\" for spells during the winter, with services only operating on certain days mainly for parcels traffic. This continued until November 1965 when the railway was closed ''\"for essential maintenance to take place\"''.  No trains ran in 1966 but the following year it reopened on a seasonal basis as a tourist attraction as detailed above.\n\n===1967\u20131968===\n\nThe entire network was leased by [[Archibald Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa]] and the lines reopened on 3 June 1967 operating an intensive service, especially on the Peel Line, until September; the following year saw a reduced timetable of operation but proved to be the final year of the lines serving Peel and Ramsey.  This has become known as the ''Ailsa Period'' known for the change of livery to spring green carried by the locomotives.  The timetables utilised the Peel and Port Erin lines heavily whilst there was no service to Ramsey on certain days, and then only a limited service ran.\n\n===1969\u20131972===\n\nFrom 1969 only the southern route to Port Erin was operated.  Services generally operated from May to September thereafter still under the auspices of Lord Ailsa; the former lines remained in situ but disused, save for occasional stock movements to the carriage shed at St John's for the winter storage of rolling stock.  A limited oil tanker service operated only in 1969.  At this time the now traditional pattern of four trains each way per day was adopted and it is this pattern of operation that broadly speaking remains in place today.\n\n===1973\u20131974===\n\nLord Ailsa took his five-year option on a 21-year lease and relinquished duties to operate trains from the close of the 1972 season and the Railway Company again took over services with subsidy from the Isle of Man Tourist Board.  The centenaries of the Peel and Port Erin lines were commemorated with special trains on the anniversary days in these two years.  Services continued to operate on the four each way per day pattern with additional services at peak times in the summer months to coincide with island events.\n\n===1975\u20131977===\n\nIn a cost-cutting measure, trains only operated between Port Erin and Castletown in 1975, and Port Erin and Ballasalla in 1976.  The line to Douglas was still maintained as locomotives and rolling stock returned there to receive maintenance.  There was much political controversy over the short-line workings and services were ultimately restored in 1977 although rails were lifted on the closed sections during this time.  1977 proved to be the final year of Railway Company operation of the line, again on a familiar seasonal basis with four trains each way per day between May and September.\n\n===1978\u20131986===\n\nVarious timetables were experimented with in the early period of nationalisation;  Notable in this period were the Friday only ''Winter Shoppers'' trains which ran during the 1981-1982 and 1983-1983 winter periods, with only one train from Port Erin and return each day.  Generally trains operated for Easter Week and the full season began at the end of May to coincide with the annual T.T. race period and ran until the last weekend of September.  Aside from the popular ''Santa Trains'', which have operated since 1985 the line remained closed in the winter months.  Also of note are the shuttle services which operated between Douglas and the country park at Lough Ned (mid-way to Port Soderick), these ran in peak season and often utilised the railcars; a platform was provided for this service which saw the last regular use of the railcars in passenger service.\n\n===1987\u20131999===\n\nTrains operated for Easter Week with the main season running from mid-May each year; from 1987 trains ran seven days a week in this period (previously there had been no Saturday service for several years) and many additional and extra timetables ran for the ''[[Year of Railways]]'' in 1993, the ''[[International Railway Festival]]'' in 1995 and ''[[Steam 125]]'' event in 1998.  Certain years also saw skeleton services operating in October and November in conjunction with various off-season attractions on the island, although the pattern of passing trains at Ballasalla was adhered to.  A familiar pattern during this period was the operation of an additional train on Mondays-Thursdays in July and August which left Douglas mid morning (10:50) and returned from Port Erin at 17:30, utilising the long-closed station at Port Soderick to pass the regular service trains.  It was common for a shuttle service to link Port Erin and Castletown during the closure of the Billown Circuit for racing during this time.\n\n===2000\u20132009===\n\nThe season was extended so that a daily service also operated during October half term with a three-week closure from the end of September.  During this time certain seasons saw trains passing at Castletown rather than the more traditional Ballasalla.  There was major disruption to services from 2000 when a sewer pipe was laid beneath the railway seeing short line workings from Douglas to Santon, and various shuttles between Port Erin, Port St Mary and Castletown over three seasons before the full line was reinstated.  A courtesy coach for passenger bridging the gap of the closed sections was laid on during this period.  The extra peak season train was dropped during this period and only four departures from either termini was the standard operational procedure.  From 2007 a commuter service operated during the T.T. period, in the first two years this also ran for Manx Grand Prix week.\n\n===2010\u20132014===\n\nThe season now extends until the first weekend of November to tie in with the ''Ride The Rocket'' Bonfire Night service and schools' half term.  Various timetables that operate at different times of the season, with the peak version seeing three train sets in service and six departures from each termini, the last one at approximately 19:00 from Douglas, returning from Port Erin at 21:00 - depending on the operating pattern.  Special event days often see bespoke timetables with additional services often providing shuttle services to intermediate stations, usually Ballasalla and Castletown, although Port St Mary has also been served by these shuttles.  On peak days such as the annual ''Rush Hour'' event, the service intensity is reminiscent of the Edwardian era with up to eleven trains each way operating over the 16 mile route.\n\n===2015 onwards===\n\nFrom the start of the 2015 season on 12 February, the [[passing loop]] was moved from Ballasalla to Castletown. The railway's new dining train often operates out of season, commonly travelling only as far as Santon, Ballasalla or Castletown before returning to Douglas. There are two basic timetables, the traditional four each way per day for the bulk of the season, with a six train service in peak season. In addition, evening trains operate on Thursdays in July and August, and commuter services continue to operate for the T.T. race period. A new initiative also sees the ''Commuter Club'' train which runs on the first Friday of each operating month departing Port Erin at 07:45 and returning from Douglas at 17:45 using the railway's dining train. The 2016 timetable followed a similar pattern to the previous year, the notable alteration being the ex-Port Erin services departing five minutes earlier than previously scheduled, commencing on 5 March and running until early November. The 2017 season commenced on 18 March with a timetable broadly following the pattern of the previous season with the addition of a schedule operating on Sundays in August to accommodate regular dining services.\n\n==Use in film==\nThe earliest use of the railway as a backdrop for filming purposes appears to have been in 1946 when ''[[I See a Dark Stranger|I See A Dark Stranger]]'' used Union Mills station in the opening scenes, doubling as a station in Ireland.  The Isle of Man was one of the locations for the movie ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'' when Castletown station became ''Shining Time station'' while the goods shed at Port Erin became Burnett Stone's workshop, containing a replica of ''Lady'', although the trains themselves were not used during production. Other locations were used to represent the entrance to Burnett's workshop (an old lead mine) and the entry to the Magic Railroad (near the old lead mine), and a workshop in Port Erin was used to store properties, presumably including the Lady replica. The railway has also been used during the filming of ''[[The Brylcreem Boys]]'' using on-board views and Douglas station, ''[[Five Children and It (film)|Five Children & It]]'' for which Castletown station was fitted with a temporary canopy and given period set dressing, Channel 4's production of ''[[Cinderella (2000 film)|Cinderella]]'' that saw Santon station used heavily, the BBC adaptation of ''[[The Ginger Tree]]'' in which it doubled for communist Russia using the carriage shed at Douglas, lineside scenes and Castletown station (No. 11 ''Maitland'' was painted matte black for this production and remained in this guide for the remainder of the 1989 season) as well as being the subject of a 1988 BBC documentary as part of the ''Train Now Departing...'' series in an episode called \"Steam in the Isle Of Man\".  Other television credits include an adaptation of ''[[Tamworth Two|The Legend Of The Tamworth Two]]'', the television movie ''[[Stiff Upper Lips]]'' and the long-running travelogue show ''[[Wish You Were Here...?]]'' which featured [[Sir Norman Wisdom]].\n\n==Events==\nOne-off and special events have been expanded from 2009 with further expansion in 2010 to include several now-annual initiatives, with the focus on the local market and families rather than the less lucrative enthusiasts' market which has tailed off since the expansive events beginning with the 1993 ''Year of Railways'' and beyond. Past and present special events are summarised as follows:\n\n[[File:Santas halt santon.jpg|thumb|right|No. 4 ''Loch'', Santon station<br>The ''Santa Express'']]\n[[File:Port Erin station. - geograph.org.uk - 784720.jpg|thumb|right|No. 13 ''Kissack'', Port Erin<br>National Week Train]]\n[[File:Castletown Water Tower.JPG|thumb|right|No. 4 ''Loch'', Castletown<br>''Nationwide Express'']]\n* '''Valentine's Love Train''' (commonly several services on and around 14 February with dining train options)\n* '''Storytelling Trains''' (children's themed event on the dining trains, started in February 2015)\n* '''Winter Photography''' (at the end of February or beginning of March around the opening of each season since 2011)\n* '''A Night At The Opera''' (black-tie event serving an evening's entertainment at the Erin Arts Centre)\n* '''Commuter Club''' (since 2015, an early morning and early evening service with the on-board bar open)\n* '''Rush Hour''' (an enthusiasts' event held over the Easter weekend annually since 2010)\n* '''Thanks, Mum''' (Mothers' Day special offers using the railway's dining train, several services)\n* '''Southern Belle''' (dining train excursions themed around an historical service on the railway)\n* '''Island At War''' (annual wartime-themed trains and events usually held mid-August)\n* '''The Darjeeling Limited''' (themed cuisine night with an evening service to Port Erin and return)\n* '''The Queenie Express''' (train services to tie in with the [[Queen scallop|Queenie]] Festival in Port St Mary)\n* '''Dining Trains Of The World''' (a series of dining trains with menus themed around worldwide cuisine)\n* '''Trans-Siberian Express''' (themed cuisine night with an evening service to Port Erin and return)\n* '''Rail Ale Tour''' (bar train service to Port Erin tie in with the beer festival at the former Falcon's Nest Hotel)\n* '''Southern 100 Shuttle''' (occasional road closure replacement service between Port Erin and Castletown)\n* '''Manx Heritage Transport Festival''' (the main summer festival, usually at end of July or start of August)\n* '''Teddy Bears' Picnic''' (various themed events centring on Ballasalla, usually early September)\n* '''The Curry Club''' (themed dining service operating on commuter train days only)\n* '''Night At The Museum''' (Thursday evenings with late opening of the railway museum in Port Erin)\n* '''Shoebox Special''' (a special service for ''Operation Christmas Child'' charity, usually November)\n* '''Le Train Bleu''' (themed cuisine night with an evening service to Port Erin and return)\n* '''Family Fun Weekend''' (weekend in late August featuring bouncy castles, face-painting, etc.)\n* '''A Musical Gala''' (tie in with the Erin Arts Centre for an evening of old-time musical hall)\n* '''Manx National Week Trains''' (trains carry commemorative headboards in the first week of July)\n* '''[[Hop-tu-Naa]] Express''' (since 2010, themed ghost train event at Hallowe'en with dining trains)\n* '''The Emporia's Banquet''' (themed cuisine night with an evening service to Port Erin and return)\n* '''Ride The Rocket''' (the end of season train serving the fireworks and bonfire in Port Erin)\n* '''The Santa Express''' (visiting Santa in his grotto at various locations, Castletown or Santon)\n* '''Christmas Shopping Express''' (a direct shopping service to Douglas from Port Erin in December)\n* '''Blow Away The Cobwebs Train''' (out of season one-off special services prior to the New Year)\n\n==Accidents==\n\n* On 22 August 1925 a train hauled by No. 3 [[Isle of Man Railway locomotives|''Pender'']] ran into Douglas station with insufficient braking power as a misunderstanding had resulted in the Guard and Brakesman being left behind at Union Mills, resulting in there being no-one on board the forward and rear brake vans to apply the train handbrakes. The Fireman of the train was killed but the Driver, William Costain, escaped unhurt.

The team competes in the [[Bulgarian First League|First League]], the top division of the [[Bulgarian football league system]]. The club was founded on May 24, 1914, as a football department of Sport Club Levski by a group of students and is named after [[Vasil Levski]], a Bulgarian [[revolutionary]] renowned as the [[Hero|national hero]] of the country.\n\nLevski have participated in more seasons of the [[Football in Bulgaria|Bulgarian football]] championship than any other team and are the only Bulgarian team to have [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|never been relegated]]. They have won 26 [[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group|A Group]] titles,  25 [[Bulgarian Cup]]s and 3 [[Bulgarian Supercup|Super Cups]], which include a record 13 [[Double (association football)|Doubles]] and 4 [[The Treble|Trebles]]. On an international basis, Levski have reached five [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] and [[UEFA Cup]] quarterfinals, two [[Balkans Cup]] finals, and in [[2006 in football (soccer)|2006]], they became the first Bulgarian club to reach the group stages of the [[UEFA Champions League]]. \n\nThe team's regular kit colour is [[Blue|all-blue]].

The club's name was chosen in honour of the Bulgarian revolutionary [[Vasil Levski]], and the club was officially registered on May 24, 1914.\n\nIn 1914 Levski lost its first official match against FC 13 Sofia 0\u20132. Between 1914\u201320, football wasn't a popular sport in Bulgaria, and no additional information about the club exists. In the summer of 1921, the Sofia Sports League was established, which united 10 clubs from Sofia and marked the beginning of organized football competitions in the city. The Blues won the first match in the championship for the season 1921\u201322, held on September 18, 1921, against Athletic Sofia with the score of 3\u20131. Levski captured first place in the league in 1923 after a dramatic 3\u20132 win over bitter rival [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]] and successfully defended the title the following season.\n\nThe first [[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group|National Championship]] was held in 1924 with Levski representing Sofia. The team went on to win the title in 1933, 1937 and 1942, and established itself as the most popular football club in Bulgaria. Levski also became the holder for all times of the Ulpia Serdica Cup by virtue of winning it for the third time in a row in 1933.\nIn 1929 Levski became the first semi-professional football club in Bulgaria, after 12 players staged a boycott of the team in demand of financial remuneration and insurance benefits. The same year Levski met its first international opponents, losing to Gallipoli Istanbul 0\u20131 and winning against Kuban Istanbul 6\u20130.\n[[File:Georgi Asparuhov 1969.jpg|right|thumb|190px|[[Georgi Asparuhov|Georgi Asparuhov \u2013 \"Gundi\"]]]]\n\n{{Football kit box\n| align     = right\n| pattern_b = _collarwhite\n| leftarm   = FFFFFF\n| body      = 4169E1\n| rightarm  = FFFFFF\n| shorts    = 4169E1\n| socks     = 4169E1\n| title     = Levski kit during a large part of the 40s\u201360s <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfunion.bg/bg/181 |title=Bulgarian Football Union History |author= |date= |website= |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAfter World War II, Levski became one of the two top clubs in Bulgaria. After winning the championship in 1946, 1947, 1949 (as part of [[List of unbeaten football club seasons#Europe|Unbeaten]] [[Double (association football)|Double]] making Levski Sofia the only Bulgarian team with such an achievement), 1950 and 1953 Levski would not capture the domestic title again until the mid-1960s. In 1949, the authorities changed the club's name to Dinamo following the Soviet traditions, but after the [[destalinization]] of Bulgaria, it was reverted in 1957. The 1960s were marked with return to success both on the domestic and on the international stage. Levski's academy would become the most successful in national youth competitions for the years to come, and the results were first seen in the likes of [[Georgi Asparuhov]], [[Georgi Sokolov]], [[Biser Mihaylov]], [[Kiril Ivkov]], [[Ivan Vutsov]], [[Stefan Aladzhov]] and [[Aleksandar Kostov]], assisted by experienced veterans like [[Stefan Abadzhiev]], Dimo Pechenikov and [[Hristo Iliev (footballer)|Hristo Iliev]], who celebrated winning the championship in 1965, 1968 and 1970, and the 7\u20132 triumph over new bitter rival CSKA in 1968. The tie against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1965 remained memorable for the [[Eus\u00e9bio]] versus [[Georgi Asparuhov]] clash, and the recognition that the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] great gave to his Bulgarian counterpart.\n\n===Levski-Spartak (1969\u20131985)===\nIn January 1969 Levski was merged with [[Spartak Sofia]] by [[Bulgarian Communist Party|BCP]], and put under the auspice of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry. The name of the club was once again changed, this time to Levski-Spartak.\n\nA new crop of youngsters in the likes of [[Kiril Milanov]], [[Dobromir Zhechev]], [[Pavel Panov]],  [[Todor Barzov]], [[Voyn Voynov]], Ivan Tishanski, [[Georgi Tsvetkov]], [[Plamen Nikolov (footballer born 1957)|Plamen Nikolov]], and [[Rusi Gochev]] not only found their place in the first team, but brought new titles in 1974, 1977, 1979, 1984 and 1985. On the international stage the quarter-final appearances in the [[Cup Winners Cup]] in 1970 (eliminating [[Swiss Cup]] winners [[FC St. Gallen]] and beat future European CWC Runners-up [[Gornik Zabrze]] 3\u20132 in the 1st leg of the quarterfinal) and 1977 (eliminating [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal|Portugal Cup]] winners [[Boavista FC]] and beat [[1975\u201376 Copa del Rey]] holders [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] 2\u20131 in the 1st leg of the quarterfinal, after which [[Kiril Milanov]] became the [[List of UEFA Cup Winners' Cup top scorers|Top goalscorer of the tournament]] with 13 goals), and in the [[UEFA Cup]] in 1976 (eliminating [[1974\u201375 1.Lig|1974\u201375 Turkish championship]] Bronze medalists [[Eski\u015fehirspor]] 7\u20131 on aggregate, [[1974\u201375 DFB-Pokal|1974\u201375 German Cup]] Finalist [[MSV Duisburg]], European hegemon [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]], before played a historic quarterfinal with Barcelona). In [[1977\u201378 European Cup]] The Blues knocked out Polish champions [[\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw]] after a 3\u20130 win in Sofia. In [[1978\u201379 UEFA Cup]] season Levski eliminated Greek club [[Olympiacos FC]] and made a 1\u20131 draw with the Italian colos [[AC Milan]] in the next round, and in [[1980\u201381 UEFA Cup]] The Blue Avalanche eliminated one of the top European clubs [[Dynamo Kyiv]]. Levski has also achieved the milestone of being the only European team to [[1975\u201376 UEFA Cup#Quarter\u2013finals|have scored 5 goals in a single UEFA competition match]] against giants [[FC Barcelona]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://levskisofia.info/match/15640108-levski-sofia-barselona-barselona-5-4/|publisher=levskisofia.info|title=Levski Sofia 5:4 Barcelona}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/match/64676--levski-vs-barcelona/|publisher=uefa.com|title=Levski-Barcelona 1975 History}} </ref> and the only Bulgarian team to eliminate the German champions - [[VfB Stuttgart]] in [[1984-85 European Cup|1984]].\n\n===Vitosha Sofia (1985\u20131989)===\nThe name of the team was changed to Vitosha by the authorities following the disruptions during and after the [[Bulgarian Cup]] final in 1985. The game ran on high emotions fueled by the streak of consecutive victories of Levski over CSKA in the 2 years prior to the game (though CSKA won the [[Bulgarian Cup]] game 2\u20131). The controversial decisions of the referee led to confrontations both on the field and on the stands. By decree of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] some of the leading players both of the Blues and the Reds were suspended from the sport for life. The championship title of the club for 1985 was suspended. However, the suspensions were lifted shortly after. Other Bulgarian Cup and national league titles were won in 1986 and 1988 respectively. The fourth European quarterfinal came in [[1986\u201387 European Cup Winners' Cup|1987]], when the Sofia's Blue knocked out [[Danish Cup]] winners [[Boldklubben 1903]] and [[1985\u201386 Yugoslav Cup]] holders [[ FK Vele\u017e Mostar]], before lose to [[1985\u201386 Copa del Rey]] champions [[Real Zaragoza]].\n\n===Levski Sofia (1989\u20132009)===\nAfter the 1989\u201390 season, the club regained its original name. The team composed of the newcomers [[Plamen Nikolov (footballer born 1961)|Plamen Nikolov]], [[Petar Hubchev]], [[Tsanko Tsvetanov]], [[Emil Kremenliev]], [[Zlatko Yankov]], [[Georgi Slavchev]], [[Ilian Iliev]], [[Daniel Borimirov]], [[Stanimir Stoilov]] and [[Velko Yotov]] and the return of the veterans [[Plamen Getov]], [[Nikolay Todorov (footballer, born 1964)|Nikolay Todorov]] and Nasko Sirakov, dictated the game in the domestic championship by winning the title in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Memorable wins by big margins over challengers [[PFC Lokomotiv Sofia|Lokomotiv Sofia]]&nbsp;\u2013 8\u20130, CSKA&nbsp;\u2013 7\u20131 and [[PFC Botev Plovdiv|Botev Plovdiv]]&nbsp;\u2013 6\u20131, clearly demonstrated Levski's complete superiority. Home games in European Competitions against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Werder Bremen]] turned into true holidays for supporters.

In the next round Levski played against [[Kalmar FF]]. The first match ended 1\u20131 in Sweden. In the return leg in [[Sofia]] Levski won 5\u20132. In between The Blues defeated their archrival [[CSKA Sofia]] in the [[Eternal derby of Bulgarian football]] with 1\u20130. Their next match in the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] saw them play [[AIK Fotboll]], from [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The first match ended with a draw, 0\u20130 and after the game AIK-hooligans attacked the Levski players and staff. The second match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Levski. Goals scored by [[Daniel Mladenov]] and [[Garra Demb\u00e9l\u00e9]] put Levski in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] group stage. Levski was drawn in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League group stage#Group C|Group C]], facing [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]], [[Lille OSC|Lille]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]].

Followed by another loss against [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. In Sofia Levski played very well against [[Lille OSC|Lille]] and was leading 2\u20131 until Ivo Ivanov scored an own goal to make it 2\u20132. In the last match of the Group C, Levski take a win against [[Sporting CP]] with 1\u20130, the winning goal was scored by [[Daniel Mladenov]].\n[[File:Football ultras.jpg|333px|thumb|right|'''Levski Sofia''' Ultras during a [[List of association football club rivalries in Europe|derby]] match]]\nIn the following 2011\u201312 season in the Third Qualifying Round of the Europa League, Levski were surprisingly eliminated by [[Spartak Trnava]] of Slovakia, following a late-minute 2\u20131 win in Sofia, and a loss of the same scoreline in Trnava. The penalty shoot-out cost Levski a place in the Play-off round. This caused an upset with the fans and players, the team barely clinching the fourth position at the winter break in the \"A\" PFG. Albeit only three points from the leaders Ludogoretz, the acting manager Georgi Ivanov was sacked from the position, but remained in the club as a sporting director. [[Nikolay Kostov]] was appointed as the new manager of the club, giving the supporters a sense of optimism, which, however faded after a cup knock-out in the hands of [[Lokomotiv Plovdiv]] and a surprise loss at home to [[Minyor Pernik]]. Kostov shockingly handed in his resignation, leaving the managerial post once again vacant. Sporting Director Georgi Ivanov once again stepped up to help his club, and accepted being manager until the summer break, when a new one will be appointed.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012 ex-player [[Ilian Iliev]] was appointed as the new manager of Levski Sofia. Under his management the club was shockingly knocked out from the [[Europa League]] by Bosnian side [[FK Sarajevo]]. Iliev led the team to 13 victories in [[A PFG]] and to the semi-finals of the [[Bulgarian Cup]] after eliminating [[Cherno More Varna]] and [[Litex Lovech]] on the away goal rule. Iliev however was fired after a 1\u20131 away draw against [[PFC Pirin Gotse Delchev|Pirin Gotse Delchev]]. Assistant coach [[Nikolay Mitov]] took in charge the team until the end of the season. Under his management Levski won the derby clashes against Litex, [[CSKA Sofia|CSKA]] and [[Ludogorets Razgrad|Ludogorets]] but failed to win the title after a surprising 1\u20131 home draw against [[Slavia Sofia]]. Levski also reached their first Bulgarian Cup final since 2007 but lost on penalties against [[Beroe Stara Zagora]]. Despite the missed opportunity of winning a trophy Mitov's contract was renewed for the 2013\u201314 season. However, the team made another disappointing performance in [[Europa League]], being eliminated by Kazakh side [[FC Irtysh Pavlodar|Irtysh Pavlodar]]. This resulted the resignation of Nikolay Mitov as manager.\n\nIn July 2013 [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]] was appointed as the new manager of the team. Despite losing only 2 matches in 12 games Jokanovic was released in October 2013. [[Ivaylo Petev]] was announced as his successor but during his introduction a few Levski supporters interrupted it and threw him away, stating that they would not accept his appointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24468656|publisher=bbc.com|title=Levski Sofia fans humiliate new coach by removing his shirt|accessdate=2013-10-09}}</ref> On the next day Petev refused to take charge of the team and [[Antoni Zdravkov]] was named as the new manager. Under his reign the team suffered a heavy 0\u20133 loss against rivals CSKA, but managed to knock them out from the Bulgarian Cup in December 2013 after penalties. Due to the difficult financial situation during the winter break key players such as [[Antonio Vutov]] and [[Garry Rodrigues]] were sold to [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] and [[Elche CF|Elche]] respectively. This reflected on the team's performance and Levski finished 5th and got knocked out at the Quarterfinals of the Bulgarian Cup by [[Botev Plovdiv]]. [[Antoni Zdravkov]] was sacked in March 2014 and club legend [[Elin Topuzakov]] took charge as a caretaker until the end of season. For the first time since 1990\u201391 the club did not participate in European competitions.\n\nDespite the disappointing season on 23 May the club supporters organized a friendly game against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] marking the 100th anniversary of the club. Club icons like [[Georgi Ivanov (footballer born 1976)|Georgi Ivanov]], [[Dimitar Ivankov]], [[Aleksandar Aleksandrov (footballer born 1975)|Aleksandar Aleksandrov]], [[Hristo Yovov]], [[Elin Topuzakov]] and many other ex-players and celebrities took participation in both the friendly game and with money grants for the celebrations around the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportal.bg/news.php?news=489199|publisher=sportal.bg|title=\u0417\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438!

Initially in the size of a square with a blue background, it was intentionally written in a stylised letter \"\u041b\" (Bulgarian letter \"L\"; shortened for Levski). The inner space of the letter was filled vertically equally in yellow and red colours. In a later period of time, the Cyrillic letters \"\u0421\" (Sport) and \"\u041a\" (club) were added at the top of the square, while the bottom side was inscribed with the name \"Sofia\". This badge was used by the club until 1949, when it was renamed to Dinamo.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1956, the emblem of the club was an irregular hexagon filled with vertical red, white, blue and yellow colours, with an inscribed handwritten Cyrillic letter \"\u0414\", alongside a five-pointed red star above it and the word \"Sofia\" underneath.\nFrom 1957 to 1968 the original logo of the club was restored, however the letters C\" and \"\u041a\" were replaced with \"\u0424\" (Athletic) and \"\u0414\" (union).\n\nAfter the merger with Spartak Sofia in 1969, the club crest has been a shield in blue and white with a horizontal red bar above. The shield spawned the letters \"\u041b\" and \"C\", an abbreviation of the new name Levski-Spartak. The football club used this crest until 1985, when it was renamed Vitosha. Vitosha's crest was in the form of a stylised letter \"C\" surrounding the football in the upper curve of the letter, coloured in blue and white.\n\nIn January 1990, the club restored its original name and original logo, and the letters \"C\" and \"K\" in the upper corner of the blue square were replaced with the initials \"\u0424\" (football) and \"K\" (club). However, due to legal issues with the ownership of the rights to the historic crest, the club was forced to change it in 1998, when a brand new shield logo was introduced, entirely in blue. At its centre, an inscription of the letter \"\u041b\" was introduced, alongside the year of establishment&nbsp;\u2013 1914. The dome of the shield was labelled \"PFC Levski\".\n\nAfter winning the legal dispute for the rights to the historic emblem in 2006, the club decided to use the two different logos simultaneously for a brief period of time. Later that year, the shield crest was completely removed and the classic square emblem has been used since.\n\n==Players==\n\n===First team===\n''{{As of|2020|2|28}}''\n<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n -- Do ''not'' add new players before their signing is officially announced by the club.\n -- Do not add clubnumber until it's official.\n -- This is Wikipedia, not a football gazette.\n&nbsp;\u2013 Thanks in advance.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|nat=MNE|name=[[Milan Mijatovi\u0107]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat=BUL|name=[[Ivan Goranov]]|pos=DF|other=[[Captain (association football)|3rd captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat=ISL|name=[[H\u00f3lmar \u00d6rn Eyj\u00f3lfsson]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=BUL|name=[[Ivaylo Naydenov]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=BRA|name=[[Paulinho (footballer, born May 1993)|Paulinho]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat=BUL|name=[[Simeon Slavchev]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=AUT|name=[[Deni Alar]]|pos=FW|other=<small>on loan from [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=ARG|name=[[Franco Mazurek]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=BUL|name=[[Zdravko Dimitrov]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=BUL|name=Petar Ivanov|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=BUL|name=[[Nikolay Mihaylov]]|pos=GK|other=[[Captain (association football)|vice-captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=POR|name=[[Filipe Nascimento]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=CUW|name=[[Nigel Robertha]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=GHA|name=[[Nasiru Mohammed]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=GRE|name=[[Giannis Kargas]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=BUL|name=[[Zhivko Milanov]]|pos=DF|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=POR|name=[[Nuno Reis]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=SEN|name=[[Khaly Thiam]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=BUL|name=[[Deyan Lozev]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=BUL|name=[[Georgi Georgiev (footballer, born 1988)|Georgi Georgiev]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=29|nat=BUL|name=[[Stanislav Kostov]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=40|nat=NED|name=[[Stijn Spierings]]|pos=MF}} \n{{Fs player|no=70|nat=BUL|name=[[Martin Raynov]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=77|nat=BUL|name=[[Iliya Yurukov]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=79|nat=BUL|name=[[Martin Petkov (footballer, born 2002)|Martin D.

In 1924, the Sofia Municipality provided the club with the rights to an empty field on what were then the outskirts of the city, and a decade later the stadium named [[Levski Field]] was finally completed. It provided for 10,000 spectators and was regarded as the finest sport facility in the city.\n\nIn 1949, the stadium was nationalized and later the [[Vasil Levski National Stadium]] was built on the site. The team played in various locations (including the nearby [[Yunak Stadium]]) before moving to the \"Dinamo\" ground, which was located at the site of the modern Spartak swimming complex. In 1961 after districting the team moved to \"Suhata Reka\" neighborhood. There a [[Georgi Asparuhov Stadium|new stadium]] was completed in 1963, renamed in 1990 in honor of Levski's most beloved former player [[Georgi Asparuhov]].\n\nIn 1999, the stadium emerged from serious reconstruction for 29,000 spectators. The field measures 105 x 68 meters. However, the team plays most of its important games versus foreign teams on the national stadium \"Vasil Levski\".\nOn one occasion the former club president Todor Batkov had demanded that Levski should receive \"Rakovski\" stadium on loan. The demand was on grounds that the first club stadium was nationalized and Levski had never been repaid.\n\nIn October, 2012, it was announced that Levski is rebuilding its stadium. The first phase of the planned reconstruction was to be completed in 2014, on the centennial of the club's foundation. As of 2013, the capacity was reduced to 19,000 due to the undergoing reconstruction of the main stand. On 5 July 2013, the first step was made in the construction of the main stand, which has a capacity of 6000 spectators and meets all the requirements of UEFA for the convenience of fans. Contractor of the \"blue\" building is the leading Bulgarian company in the construction of road infrastructure and other important rehabilitation projects, \u201cAvtomagistrali&nbsp;\u2013 Tcherno more\u201d AD. The main stand of [[Georgi Asparuhov Stadium]] also known as ''Sector A'' was officially opened on 23 April 2016 at a special ceremony.\n\n==Supporters==\n[[File:Levski Werder1.jpg|thumb|260px|'''Sector B''']]\n\nHistorically, Levski Sofia fans gathered in the south stand of the stadium. This tradition is believed to have its roots in the Sofia Derby when Levski fans met before the games at the area close to the south end of the Vasil Levski National Stadium. Due to the orientation of the stadium and the naming conventions of stands at most Bulgarian stadiums, Sector B became synonymous with Levski fans. More recently the fans in Sector B are seen as part of the [[Ultras]] movement popular in the [[Balkans]]. Today Sector B initiates most of the songs, choreography and pyrotechnic displays at Levski games.\nLevski supporters are organized by fanclubs, most notably the National Supporters Club which helps and coordinates fans from all around Bulgaria and supports the organization of events. There are also notable groups from Sofia (Sofia-West, South Division, Blue Junta, HD Boys, LSL and many more) and other cities across [[Bulgaria]] and [[Bulgarian diaspora|around the World]] (such as Ultra Varna, Blue Huns Pernik, OCB Veliko Tarnovo, Torcida Kyustendil, Ultras Vidin, Iron Pazardzhik, Youth Brigade 034 Pazardzik, Blue Warriors Plovdiv, Blue Boys Blagoevgrad, Blue Lads Sliven, Vandals Pleven, Levski Club Dobrich, Ultras Radomir, Ultras Burgas, Levski 1914 Karlovo, Yambol Boys, Levski UK, Levski Chicago and many more) Ultras Levski have a very strong long-standing friendship with [[S.S. Lazio fans|SS Lazio fans]]. According to a study performed for [[UEFA]], Levski is the most popular Bulgarian club and share the sixth position in Europe with [[Juventus FC|Juventus]], by percentage of support in its own country (31%). <ref name=\"UEFA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.org/MultimediaFiles/Download/Tech/uefaorg/General/02/09/18/26/2091826_DOWNLOAD.pdf#page=41 |title=Concentration of people supporting the most popular club (page 41)}}</ref>\n\n==UEFA & IFFHS rankings==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Club coefficients===\nThis is the current 2019\u201320 [[UEFA coefficient]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/index.html |title=UEFA Club Rankings |publisher=UEFA.com |date=2019-12-13 |accessdate=2020-01-15}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

The team competes in the [[Bulgarian First League|First League]], the top division of the [[Bulgarian football league system]]. The club was founded on May 24, 1914, as a football department of Sport Club Levski by a group of students and is named after [[Vasil Levski]], a Bulgarian [[revolutionary]] renowned as the [[Hero|national hero]] of the country.\n\nLevski have participated in more seasons of the [[Football in Bulgaria|Bulgarian football]] championship than any other team and are the only Bulgarian team to have [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|never been relegated]].

The club's name was chosen in honour of the Bulgarian revolutionary [[Vasil Levski]], and the club was officially registered on May 24, 1914.\n\nIn 1914 Levski lost its first official match against FC 13 Sofia 0\u20132. Between 1914\u201320, football wasn't a popular sport in Bulgaria, and no additional information about the club exists. In the summer of 1921, the Sofia Sports League was established, which united 10 clubs from Sofia and marked the beginning of organized football competitions in the city. The Blues won the first match in the championship for the season 1921\u201322, held on September 18, 1921, against Athletic Sofia with the score of 3\u20131. Levski captured first place in the league in 1923 after a dramatic 3\u20132 win over bitter rival [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]] and successfully defended the title the following season.\n\nThe first [[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group|National Championship]] was held in 1924 with Levski representing Sofia. The team went on to win the title in 1933, 1937 and 1942, and established itself as the most popular football club in Bulgaria. Levski also became the holder for all times of the Ulpia Serdica Cup by virtue of winning it for the third time in a row in 1933.\nIn 1929 Levski became the first semi-professional football club in Bulgaria, after 12 players staged a boycott of the team in demand of financial remuneration and insurance benefits. The same year Levski met its first international opponents, losing to Gallipoli Istanbul 0\u20131 and winning against Kuban Istanbul 6\u20130.\n[[File:Georgi Asparuhov 1969.jpg|right|thumb|190px|[[Georgi Asparuhov|Georgi Asparuhov \u2013 \"Gundi\"]]]]\n\n{{Football kit box\n| align     = right\n| pattern_b = _collarwhite\n| leftarm   = FFFFFF\n| body      = 4169E1\n| rightarm  = FFFFFF\n| shorts    = 4169E1\n| socks     = 4169E1\n| title     = Levski kit during a large part of the 40s\u201360s <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfunion.bg/bg/181 |title=Bulgarian Football Union History |author= |date= |website= |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAfter World War II, Levski became one of the two top clubs in Bulgaria. After winning the championship in 1946, 1947, 1949 (as part of [[List of unbeaten football club seasons#Europe|Unbeaten]] [[Double (association football)|Double]] making Levski Sofia the only Bulgarian team with such an achievement), 1950 and 1953 Levski would not capture the domestic title again until the mid-1960s. In 1949, the authorities changed the club's name to Dinamo following the Soviet traditions, but after the [[destalinization]] of Bulgaria, it was reverted in 1957. The 1960s were marked with return to success both on the domestic and on the international stage. Levski's academy would become the most successful in national youth competitions for the years to come, and the results were first seen in the likes of [[Georgi Asparuhov]], [[Georgi Sokolov]], [[Biser Mihaylov]], [[Kiril Ivkov]], [[Ivan Vutsov]], [[Stefan Aladzhov]] and [[Aleksandar Kostov]], assisted by experienced veterans like [[Stefan Abadzhiev]], Dimo Pechenikov and [[Hristo Iliev (footballer)|Hristo Iliev]], who celebrated winning the championship in 1965, 1968 and 1970, and the 7\u20132 triumph over new bitter rival CSKA in 1968. The tie against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1965 remained memorable for the [[Eus\u00e9bio]] versus [[Georgi Asparuhov]] clash, and the recognition that the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] great gave to his Bulgarian counterpart.\n\n===Levski-Spartak (1969\u20131985)===\nIn January 1969 Levski was merged with [[Spartak Sofia]] by [[Bulgarian Communist Party|BCP]], and put under the auspice of the Bulgarian Interior Ministry. The name of the club was once again changed, this time to Levski-Spartak.\n\nA new crop of youngsters in the likes of [[Kiril Milanov]], [[Dobromir Zhechev]], [[Pavel Panov]],  [[Todor Barzov]], [[Voyn Voynov]], Ivan Tishanski, [[Georgi Tsvetkov]], [[Plamen Nikolov (footballer born 1957)|Plamen Nikolov]], and [[Rusi Gochev]] not only found their place in the first team, but brought new titles in 1974, 1977, 1979, 1984 and 1985. On the international stage the quarter-final appearances in the [[Cup Winners Cup]] in 1970 (eliminating [[Swiss Cup]] winners [[FC St. Gallen]] and beat future European CWC Runners-up [[Gornik Zabrze]] 3\u20132 in the 1st leg of the quarterfinal) and 1977 (eliminating [[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal|Portugal Cup]] winners [[Boavista FC]] and beat [[1975\u201376 Copa del Rey]] holders [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] 2\u20131 in the 1st leg of the quarterfinal, after which [[Kiril Milanov]] became the [[List of UEFA Cup Winners' Cup top scorers|Top goalscorer of the tournament]] with 13 goals), and in the [[UEFA Cup]] in 1976 (eliminating [[1974\u201375 1.Lig|1974\u201375 Turkish championship]] Bronze medalists [[Eski\u015fehirspor]] 7\u20131 on aggregate, [[1974\u201375 DFB-Pokal|1974\u201375 German Cup]] Finalist [[MSV Duisburg]], European hegemon [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]], before played a historic quarterfinal with Barcelona). In [[1977\u201378 European Cup]] The Blues knocked out Polish champions [[\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw]] after a 3\u20130 win in Sofia. In [[1978\u201379 UEFA Cup]] season Levski eliminated Greek club [[Olympiacos FC]] and made a 1\u20131 draw with the Italian colos [[AC Milan]] in the next round, and in [[1980\u201381 UEFA Cup]] The Blue Avalanche eliminated one of the top European clubs [[Dynamo Kyiv]]. Levski has also achieved the milestone of being the only European team to [[1975\u201376 UEFA Cup#Quarter\u2013finals|have scored 5 goals in a single UEFA competition match]] against giants [[FC Barcelona]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://levskisofia.info/match/15640108-levski-sofia-barselona-barselona-5-4/|publisher=levskisofia.info|title=Levski Sofia 5:4 Barcelona}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/match/64676--levski-vs-barcelona/|publisher=uefa.com|title=Levski-Barcelona 1975 History}} </ref> and the only Bulgarian team with elimination of German champions ([[VfB Stuttgart]] in [[1984-85 European Cup|1984]]), a records staying till nowdays.\n\n===Vitosha Sofia (1985\u20131989)===\nThe name of the team was changed to Vitosha by the authorities following the disruptions during and after the [[Bulgarian Cup]] final in 1985. The game ran on high emotions fueled by the streak of consecutive victories of Levski over CSKA in the 2 years prior to the game (though CSKA won the [[Bulgarian Cup]] game 2\u20131). The controversial decisions of the referee led to confrontations both on the field and on the stands. By decree of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] some of the leading players both of the Blues and the Reds were suspended from the sport for life. The championship title of the club for 1985 was suspended. However, the suspensions were lifted shortly after. Other Bulgarian Cup and national league titles were won in 1986 and 1988 respectively. The fourth European quarterfinal came in [[1986\u201387 European Cup Winners' Cup|1987]], when the Sofia's Blue knocked out [[Danish Cup]] winners [[Boldklubben 1903]] and [[1985\u201386 Yugoslav Cup]] holders [[ FK Vele\u017e Mostar]], before lose to [[1985\u201386 Copa del Rey]] champions [[Real Zaragoza]].\n\n===Levski Sofia (1989\u20132009)===\nAfter the 1989\u201390 season, the club regained its original name. The team composed of the newcomers [[Plamen Nikolov (footballer born 1961)|Plamen Nikolov]], [[Petar Hubchev]], [[Tsanko Tsvetanov]], [[Emil Kremenliev]], [[Zlatko Yankov]], [[Georgi Slavchev]], [[Ilian Iliev]], [[Daniel Borimirov]], [[Stanimir Stoilov]] and [[Velko Yotov]] and the return of the veterans [[Plamen Getov]], [[Nikolay Todorov (footballer, born 1964)|Nikolay Todorov]] and Nasko Sirakov, dictated the game in the domestic championship by winning the title in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Memorable wins by big margins over challengers [[PFC Lokomotiv Sofia|Lokomotiv Sofia]]&nbsp;\u2013 8\u20130, CSKA&nbsp;\u2013 7\u20131 and [[PFC Botev Plovdiv|Botev Plovdiv]]&nbsp;\u2013 6\u20131, clearly demonstrated Levski's complete superiority. Home games in European Competitions against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Werder Bremen]] turned into true holidays for supporters. Levski contributed with [[1994_FIFA_World_Cup_squads#Bulgaria|the most players]] \u2013 9 ([[Petar Hubchev]], [[Tsanko Tsvetanov]], [[Emil Kremenliev]], [[Zlatko Yankov]], [[Nasko Sirakov]], [[Plamen Nikolov (footballer born 1961)|Plamen Nikolov]], [[Petar Aleksandrov]] and [[Daniel Borimirov]]) to the [[Bulgaria national football team]] that ended on fourth place in the unforgettable American summer of the [[World Cup 1994]].\n\nAnother relatively successful period lasted until 2005. Then the young new manager and former player [[Stanimir Stoilov]] organized a team of Levski's academy products [[Zhivko Milanov]], [[Milan Koprivarov]] and [[Valeri Domovchiyski]], the experienced [[Elin Topuzakov]], [[Georgi Petkov (footballer, born 1976)|Georgi Petkov]], [[Stanislav Angelov]] and [[Dimitar Telkiyski]], the fans' favorites [[Hristo Yovov]], [[Daniel Borimirov]] and [[Georgi Ivanov (footballer, born 1976)|Georgi Ivanov]], who came back after spending time abroad, reached the quarter-final stage of the UEFA Cup, knocking out [[2004\u201305 Coupe de France]] champions [[AJ Auxerre]], wins against [[Olympique de Marseille]], [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] and finishing ahead of the reigning title holder [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] in the group stage, triumphing over [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] participants [[FC Petr\u017ealka akad\u00e9mia|Artmedia Bratislava]] and [[Udinese Calcio]], before being knocked out by [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in a controversial tie.\n\n[[File:Levski Werder2.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Levski against [[Werder Bremen]] at the [[Vasil Levski National Stadium|National Stadium]] in the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]]]\n\nLevski, as the champions of Bulgaria, started their [[UEFA Champions League 2006\u201307]] participation from the second qualiftying round, where they eliminated [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] champions [[FC Sioni Bolnisi|Sioni Bolnisi]], defeating them 2\u20130 both home and away.

In the next round Levski played against [[Kalmar FF]]. The first match ended 1\u20131 in Sweden. In the return leg in [[Sofia]] Levski won 5\u20132. In between The Blues defeated their archrival [[CSKA Sofia]] in the [[Eternal derby of Bulgarian football]] with 1\u20130. Their next match in the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] saw them play [[AIK Fotboll]], from [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The first match ended with a draw, 0\u20130 and after the game AIK-hooligans attacked the Levski players and staff. The second match ended in a 2\u20131 home win for Levski. Goals scored by [[Daniel Mladenov]] and [[Garra Demb\u00e9l\u00e9]] put Levski in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] group stage. Levski was drawn in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Europa League group stage#Group C|Group C]], facing [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]], [[Lille OSC|Lille]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]]. The first match was against [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]]. Levski won the match in a 3\u20132 home win. The winning goal was scored by [[Serginho Greene]]. With this win Levski recorded 8 games in-a-row without losing in European competitions. After that Levski lost catastrophically from [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]] with 5\u20130. Followed by another loss against [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. In Sofia Levski played very well against [[Lille OSC|Lille]] and was leading 2\u20131 until Ivo Ivanov scored an own goal to make it 2\u20132. In the last match of the Group C, Levski take a win against [[Sporting CP]] with 1\u20130, the winning goal was scored by [[Daniel Mladenov]].\n[[File:Football ultras.jpg|333px|thumb|right|'''Levski Sofia''' Ultras during a [[List of association football club rivalries in Europe|derby]] match]]\nIn the following 2011\u201312 season in the Third Qualifying Round of the Europa League, Levski were surprisingly eliminated by [[Spartak Trnava]] of Slovakia, following a late-minute 2\u20131 win in Sofia, and a loss of the same scoreline in Trnava. The penalty shoot-out cost Levski a place in the Play-off round. This caused an upset with the fans and players, the team barely clinching the fourth position at the winter break in the \"A\" PFG. Albeit only three points from the leaders Ludogoretz, the acting manager Georgi Ivanov was sacked from the position, but remained in the club as a sporting director. [[Nikolay Kostov]] was appointed as the new manager of the club, giving the supporters a sense of optimism, which, however faded after a cup knock-out in the hands of [[Lokomotiv Plovdiv]] and a surprise loss at home to [[Minyor Pernik]]. Kostov shockingly handed in his resignation, leaving the managerial post once again vacant. Sporting Director Georgi Ivanov once again stepped up to help his club, and accepted being manager until the summer break, when a new one will be appointed.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012 ex-player [[Ilian Iliev]] was appointed as the new manager of Levski Sofia. Under his management the club was shockingly knocked out from the [[Europa League]] by Bosnian side [[FK Sarajevo]]. Iliev led the team to 13 victories in [[A PFG]] and to the semi-finals of the [[Bulgarian Cup]] after eliminating [[Cherno More Varna]] and [[Litex Lovech]] on the away goal rule. Iliev however was fired after a 1\u20131 away draw against [[PFC Pirin Gotse Delchev|Pirin Gotse Delchev]]. Assistant coach [[Nikolay Mitov]] took in charge the team until the end of the season. Under his management Levski won the derby clashes against Litex, [[CSKA Sofia|CSKA]] and [[Ludogorets Razgrad|Ludogorets]] but failed to win the title after a surprising 1\u20131 home draw against [[Slavia Sofia]]. Levski also reached their first Bulgarian Cup final since 2007 but lost on penalties against [[Beroe Stara Zagora]]. Despite the missed opportunity of winning a trophy Mitov's contract was renewed for the 2013\u201314 season. However, the team made another disappointing performance in [[Europa League]], being eliminated by Kazakh side [[FC Irtysh Pavlodar|Irtysh Pavlodar]]. This resulted the resignation of Nikolay Mitov as manager.\n\nIn July 2013 [[Slavi\u0161a Jokanovi\u0107]] was appointed as the new manager of the team. Despite losing only 2 matches in 12 games Jokanovic was released in October 2013. [[Ivaylo Petev]] was announced as his successor but during his introduction a few Levski supporters interrupted it and threw him away, stating that they would not accept his appointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/24468656|publisher=bbc.com|title=Levski Sofia fans humiliate new coach by removing his shirt|accessdate=2013-10-09}}</ref> On the next day Petev refused to take charge of the team and [[Antoni Zdravkov]] was named as the new manager. Under his reign the team suffered a heavy 0\u20133 loss against rivals CSKA, but managed to knock them out from the Bulgarian Cup in December 2013 after penalties. Due to the difficult financial situation during the winter break key players such as [[Antonio Vutov]] and [[Garry Rodrigues]] were sold to [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] and [[Elche CF|Elche]] respectively. This reflected on the team's performance and Levski finished 5th and got knocked out at the Quarterfinals of the Bulgarian Cup by [[Botev Plovdiv]]. [[Antoni Zdravkov]] was sacked in March 2014 and club legend [[Elin Topuzakov]] took charge as a caretaker until the end of season. For the first time since 1990\u201391 the club did not participate in European competitions.\n\nDespite the disappointing season on 23 May the club supporters organized a friendly game against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] marking the 100th anniversary of the club. Club icons like [[Georgi Ivanov (footballer born 1976)|Georgi Ivanov]], [[Dimitar Ivankov]], [[Aleksandar Aleksandrov (footballer born 1975)|Aleksandar Aleksandrov]], [[Hristo Yovov]], [[Elin Topuzakov]] and many other ex-players and celebrities took participation in both the friendly game and with money grants for the celebrations around the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportal.bg/news.php?news=489199|publisher=sportal.bg|title=\u0417\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438!

Initially in the size of a square with a blue background, it was intentionally written in a stylised letter \"\u041b\" (Bulgarian letter \"L\"; shortened for Levski). The inner space of the letter was filled vertically equally in yellow and red colours. In a later period of time, the Cyrillic letters \"\u0421\" (Sport) and \"\u041a\" (club) were added at the top of the square, while the bottom side was inscribed with the name \"Sofia\". This badge was used by the club until 1949, when it was renamed to Dinamo.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1956, the emblem of the club was an irregular hexagon filled with vertical red, white, blue and yellow colours, with an inscribed handwritten Cyrillic letter \"\u0414\", alongside a five-pointed red star above it and the word \"Sofia\" underneath.\nFrom 1957 to 1968 the original logo of the club was restored, however the letters C\" and \"\u041a\" were replaced with \"\u0424\" (Athletic) and \"\u0414\" (union).\n\nAfter the merger with Spartak Sofia in 1969, the club crest has been a shield in blue and white with a horizontal red bar above. The shield spawned the letters \"\u041b\" and \"C\", an abbreviation of the new name Levski-Spartak. The football club used this crest until 1985, when it was renamed Vitosha. Vitosha's crest was in the form of a stylised letter \"C\" surrounding the football in the upper curve of the letter, coloured in blue and white.\n\nIn January 1990, the club restored its original name and original logo, and the letters \"C\" and \"K\" in the upper corner of the blue square were replaced with the initials \"\u0424\" (football) and \"K\" (club). However, due to legal issues with the ownership of the rights to the historic crest, the club was forced to change it in 1998, when a brand new shield logo was introduced, entirely in blue. At its centre, an inscription of the letter \"\u041b\" was introduced, alongside the year of establishment&nbsp;\u2013 1914. The dome of the shield was labelled \"PFC Levski\".\n\nAfter winning the legal dispute for the rights to the historic emblem in 2006, the club decided to use the two different logos simultaneously for a brief period of time. Later that year, the shield crest was completely removed and the classic square emblem has been used since.\n\n==Players==\n\n===First team===\n''{{As of|2020|2|28}}''\n<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n -- Do ''not'' add new players before their signing is officially announced by the club.\n -- Do not add clubnumber until it's official.\n -- This is Wikipedia, not a football gazette.\n&nbsp;\u2013 Thanks in advance.\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|nat=MNE|name=[[Milan Mijatovi\u0107]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|nat=BUL|name=[[Ivan Goranov]]|pos=DF|other=[[Captain (association football)|3rd captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|nat=ISL|name=[[H\u00f3lmar \u00d6rn Eyj\u00f3lfsson]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|nat=BUL|name=[[Ivaylo Naydenov]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|nat=BRA|name=[[Paulinho (footballer, born May 1993)|Paulinho]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|nat=BUL|name=[[Simeon Slavchev]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|nat=AUT|name=[[Deni Alar]]|pos=FW|other=<small>on loan from [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]]</small>}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=ARG|name=[[Franco Mazurek]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=BUL|name=[[Zdravko Dimitrov]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=BUL|name=Petar Ivanov|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=BUL|name=[[Nikolay Mihaylov]]|pos=GK|other=[[Captain (association football)|vice-captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=POR|name=[[Filipe Nascimento]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=CUW|name=[[Nigel Robertha]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=GHA|name=[[Nasiru Mohammed]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=GRE|name=[[Giannis Kargas]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=BUL|name=[[Zhivko Milanov]]|pos=DF|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=POR|name=[[Nuno Reis]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=SEN|name=[[Khaly Thiam]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=BUL|name=[[Deyan Lozev]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=BUL|name=[[Georgi Georgiev (footballer, born 1988)|Georgi Georgiev]]|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=29|nat=BUL|name=[[Stanislav Kostov]]|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=40|nat=NED|name=[[Stijn Spierings]]|pos=MF}} \n{{Fs player|no=70|nat=BUL|name=[[Martin Raynov]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=77|nat=BUL|name=[[Iliya Yurukov]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=79|nat=BUL|name=[[Martin Petkov (footballer, born 2002)|Martin D.

In 1924, the Sofia Municipality provided the club with the rights to an empty field on what were then the outskirts of the city, and a decade later the stadium named [[Levski Field]] was finally completed. It provided for 10,000 spectators and was regarded as the finest sport facility in the city.\n\nIn 1949, the stadium was nationalized and later the [[Vasil Levski National Stadium]] was built on the site. The team played in various locations (including the nearby [[Yunak Stadium]]) before moving to the \"Dinamo\" ground, which was located at the site of the modern Spartak swimming complex. In 1961 after districting the team moved to \"Suhata Reka\" neighborhood. There a [[Georgi Asparuhov Stadium|new stadium]] was completed in 1963, renamed in 1990 in honor of Levski's most beloved former player [[Georgi Asparuhov]].\n\nIn 1999, the stadium emerged from serious reconstruction for 29,000 spectators. The field measures 105 x 68 meters. However, the team plays most of its important games versus foreign teams on the national stadium \"Vasil Levski\".\nOn one occasion the former club president Todor Batkov had demanded that Levski should receive \"Rakovski\" stadium on loan. The demand was on grounds that the first club stadium was nationalized and Levski had never been repaid.\n\nIn October, 2012, it was announced that Levski is rebuilding its stadium. The first phase of the planned reconstruction was to be completed in 2014, on the centennial of the club's foundation. As of 2013, the capacity was reduced to 19,000 due to the undergoing reconstruction of the main stand. On 5 July 2013, the first step was made in the construction of the main stand, which has a capacity of 6000 spectators and meets all the requirements of UEFA for the convenience of fans. Contractor of the \"blue\" building is the leading Bulgarian company in the construction of road infrastructure and other important rehabilitation projects, \u201cAvtomagistrali&nbsp;\u2013 Tcherno more\u201d AD. The main stand of [[Georgi Asparuhov Stadium]] also known as ''Sector A'' was officially opened on 23 April 2016 at a special ceremony.\n\n==Supporters==\n[[File:Levski Werder1.jpg|thumb|260px|'''Sector B''']]\n\nHistorically, Levski Sofia fans gathered in the south stand of the stadium. This tradition is believed to have its roots in the Sofia Derby when Levski fans met before the games at the area close to the south end of the Vasil Levski National Stadium. Due to the orientation of the stadium and the naming conventions of stands at most Bulgarian stadiums, Sector B became synonymous with Levski fans. More recently the fans in Sector B are seen as part of the [[Ultras]] movement popular in the [[Balkans]]. Today Sector B initiates most of the songs, choreography and pyrotechnic displays at Levski games.\nLevski supporters are organized by fanclubs, most notably the National Supporters Club which helps and coordinates fans from all around Bulgaria and supports the organization of events. There are also notable groups from Sofia (Sofia-West, South Division, Blue Junta, HD Boys, LSL and many more) and other cities across [[Bulgaria]] and [[Bulgarian diaspora|around the World]] (such as Ultra Varna, Blue Huns Pernik, OCB Veliko Tarnovo, Torcida Kyustendil, Ultras Vidin, Iron Pazardzhik, Youth Brigade 034 Pazardzik, Blue Warriors Plovdiv, Blue Boys Blagoevgrad, Blue Lads Sliven, Vandals Pleven, Levski Club Dobrich, Ultras Radomir, Ultras Burgas, Levski 1914 Karlovo, Yambol Boys, Levski UK, Levski Chicago and many more) Ultras Levski have a very strong long-standing friendship with [[S.S. Lazio fans|SS Lazio fans]]. According to a study performed for [[UEFA]], Levski is the most popular Bulgarian club and share the sixth position in Europe with [[Juventus FC|Juventus]], by percentage of support in its own country (31%). <ref name=\"UEFA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.org/MultimediaFiles/Download/Tech/uefaorg/General/02/09/18/26/2091826_DOWNLOAD.pdf#page=41 |title=Concentration of people supporting the most popular club (page 41)}}</ref>\n\n==UEFA & IFFHS rankings==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Club coefficients===\nThis is the current 2019\u201320 [[UEFA coefficient]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/club/index.html |title=UEFA Club Rankings |publisher=UEFA.com |date=2019-12-13 |accessdate=2020-01-15}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

The series follows Photon, a boy that possesses superhuman strength, but is extremely simple-minded. He engages in heroic adventures of different varieties. He accidentally marries a rebel space pilot named Keyne, and becomes involved in fighting an evil wannabe galactic emperor and his \"bumbling henchmen\". Photon's marriage to Keyne is a bit odd, as Keyne is well more matured than Photon. Yet Photon only see's Keyne as more like Aun's sister (who used to be Aun and Photon's guardian - whom he cared for extremely).  \n\nThe ending song, \"Pinch!\", is performed by [[Yui Horie]]. A manga based on the anime was written by Hiroshi Kanno.\n\n==Main characters==\n* '''{{visible anchor|Photon Earth}}''' ({{Voiced by|[[Junko Takeuchi]]|Scott Cargle}}): The protagonist, he is extremely strong and fights using a [[quarterstaff]] made of black [[crystal]]. Has the word \"baka\" (idiot) scribbled across his forehead by Aun in black ink as he was trying to lead her back home. His strength is tremendous coming to a point where he was able to crack a crystal barrier with his bare hands. He's also able to withstand even the strongest blasts of Aho energy, even when it is focused directly on him. It was later revealed that he was the source of the un-Aho, which is the reason why Aun's stasis field has no effect on him. Since he was angry at Aun for writing the word idiot in permanent ink, he inscribed the same word on Keyne's forehead, inadvertently marrying her in the process. Though he is simple-minded, he is very trustworthy and loyal to those he promises to protect.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Aun Freya}}''' ({{Voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]|[[Tara Sands]]}}): Photon's spoiled, high-strung, flighty childhood friend, she has the ability to create [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] fields. Humorously, she isn't immune to her own stasis fields and can paradoxically trap herself (and everything around her) in a [[perpetual motion|perpetual]] stasis field. Photon is the only one who is immune to her stasis field and also is the only one who can get her and keep her out of such messes. In order to cancel out her stasis fields, he has to knock her on the head with his staff. Aun has a tendency of falling in love with every handsome man she encounters, which always ends up in disappointment for her when they turn her down. She also behaves in a tsundere-like manner towards Photon hinting that she may have feelings for him.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Keyne Aqua}}''' ({{Voiced by|Yumi Kuroda|Suzy Prue}}): The rebel space pilot who came to Sandy Planet. Photon inadvertently married her when he wrote the word \"baka\" in [[katakana]] on her forehead in black marker. However, she readily accepts the marriage out of fear of being alone and eventually admits her love for Photon.  It is eventually revealed that she and Princess Lashara were switched soon after birth by the Emperor, meaning that she is the real princess.  Near the end of the series, the spirit of her late mother, whom she bears a strong resemblance to, manifests for one last goodbye.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Princess Lashara Moon}}''' ({{Voiced by|[[Yuri Amano]]|Carolee Goodgold}}):  Known as the \"Flower of the Galaxy\" due to her beauty, she's the daughter of the Galactic Emperor. She's madly smitten with Papacha, but what she didn't know is Papacha was really going to use her marriage to increase his [[harem]]. Although after learning the truth she is extremely heart-broken and depressed after merging with Pochi #1 (after her Pochi #1's journey with Photon) she falls in love with Photon.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Sir Papacharino Nanadan|Papacha}}''' (or '''Papacha''') ({{Voiced by|[[K\u014dichi Yamadera]]|Tristan Goddard}}): The bumbling antagonist. Also quite perverted when it comes to women. He has an obsession with Keyne and will stop at nothing to have her, but is always foiled by Photon's intervening. He's also quite egotistical and has grand delusions of conquest.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Pochi #1}}''' ({{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Asakawa]]|P.M. Lewis}}):Pochi #1 acts as a leader figure to the others and is the most prominent of the Pochis, having more appearance and influence on the story such as her close relationship with Lashara. After failing to help Papacha defeat Photon she is thrown away by him and rescued by Photon in which she joins his party and soon falls in love with him.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Pochis}}''' ({{Voiced by|Y\u016b Asakawa|P.M. Lewis}}): Papacha's cute doll-like henchmen. Excluding Pochi #1 (who acts as a leader figure to the others), there are 28 of them, who refer to each other by their number. Though Papacha believes they're all male, in truth, all the Pochis are really female. They temporarily attached to Papacha by their master Princess Lashara as a gift.\n* '''{{visible anchor|Bulan}}''' ({{Voiced by|[[Akiko Hiramatsu]]|Mina Sands}}):  The mysterious servant woman to Lashara, donning a strange-looking hat (with feminine lips) and skintight purple attire. Usually moves by hovering on a golden platform and arrives with the princess to Sandy Planet to search out the \"Singularity Point\". However, she seems to know more about Lashara than she really lets on...\n\n==Episodes==\n#1997-11-21 Aun is an IDIOT!
