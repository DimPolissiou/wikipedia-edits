Chapman was convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend [[Alex Vause]] ([[Laura Prepon]]), an international [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggler]]. The offense had occurred 10 years before the start of the series and in that time Chapman had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's [[upper middle class]]. Her sudden and unexpected indictment disrupts her relationships with her fianc\u00e9, family and friends. In prison, Chapman is reunited with Vause (who named Chapman in her trial, resulting in Chapman's arrest), and they re-examine their relationship. Simultaneously, Chapman, along with the other inmates, attempt to grapple with prison's numerous, inherent struggles. Episodes often feature [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of significant events from various inmates' and prison guards' pasts. These flashbacks typically depict how an inmate came to be in prison or develop a character's backstory. The prison is initially operated by the \"Federal Department of Corrections\" (a fictional version of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]), and was in a later season acquired by the Management & Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company.\n\nThe fifth season shows the prisoners revolting against the guards, wardens and the system after MCC's failed handling of an inmate's death at the hands of a guard in the fourth season. The inmate death had followed a peaceful protest and subsequent instigation of an inmate fight by another guard. Fueled by the conditions the inmates are forced to tolerate, as well as grudges against the prison guards, a three-day riot ensues. During the riot, some inmates attempt to negotiate better living conditions and seek justice for the death of the inmate, while others pursue their own interests and entertainment, and a few seek no involvement. At the emergence of the riot, the guard who incited the fight in the prior season is critically wounded by an inmate who took the gun the guard illegally brought into the prison. At the end of the season, [[SWAT]] raids the prison to end the riot and remove all inmates from the facility. During this raid, a correctional officer is fatally wounded by a corrupt \"strike team\", which then conspires to blame the guard's death on inmates who hid in an underground bunker and had taken the guard hostage. All inmates are transported to other prisons.\n\nThe consequences of the riot are shown in the sixth season. A number of the inmates, including Chapman and Vause, are transported to Litchfield Maximum Security. Most of these inmates are interrogated, and several of them charged and sentenced for their involvement in the riot. In max, new inmates are introduced, alliances are made, and a gang-like war emerges between two prison blocks, spearheaded by a longstanding feud between two sisters and a grudge harbored by them toward a former maximum-security inmate who returned as a consequence of the riot (she had been moved to the minimum security prison). Inmates who arrived from the minimum security prison are either caught up or willingly participate in the war between prison blocks. The season portrays further corruption and guard brutality.\n\nThe seventh season provides an ending to various inmate's stories. Chapman and Vause continue their on/off again relationship. The season shows how some prisoners are able to move beyond their time in prison while others are captured by the system and through their own flaws and/or systemic problems in the structure of US society and its \u201cjustice\u201d system are unable to progress. In addition to the established setting of Litchfield Max, a significant portion of the season takes place in a newly created [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] detention centre for detained presumed illegal immigrants, showing their struggles and lack of access to outside help in large part because of complete or extreme disregard of the law. \n\nThroughout the series, it is shown how various forms of corruption, funding cuts by the corporate owner to increase profit by millions, [[private prison|privatization of prison]], overcrowding, guard brutality and racial discrimination (among other issues), affect the prisoners' safety, health and well-being; the correctional officers\u2019 lives; and the prison's basic inability to fulfill its fundamental legal responsibilities and ethical obligations as a corrections institution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Terry|first=April|date=July 2016|title=Surveying Issues That Arise in Women's Prisons: A Content Critique of Orange Is the New Black: OITNB: Women's Prisons|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=10|issue=7|pages=553\u2013566|doi=10.1111/soc4.12388}}</ref> One of the show's key conflicts involves the minimum-security prison's Director of Human Activities (aka the warden, under privatization nomenclature), Joe Caputo, whose efforts and aims as a [[Prison warden|warden]] constantly conflict with the corporate interests of MCC, which acquired the facility when it was about to be shut down. This theme is continued when a new forward-thinking & caring warden is hired at the maximum security prison, and unlike Caputo actually institutes educational programs and positive changes.

Chapman was convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend [[Alex Vause]] ([[Laura Prepon]]), an international [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggler]]. The offense had occurred 10 years before the start of the series and in that time Chapman had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's [[upper middle class]]. Her sudden and unexpected indictment disrupts her relationships with her fianc\u00e9, family and friends. In prison, Chapman is reunited with Vause (who named Chapman in her trial, resulting in Chapman's arrest), and they re-examine their relationship. Simultaneously, Chapman, along with the other inmates, attempt to grapple with prison's numerous, inherent struggles. Episodes often feature [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of significant events from various inmates' and prison guards' pasts. These flashbacks typically depict how an inmate came to be in prison or develop a character's backstory. The prison is initially operated by the \"Federal Department of Corrections\" (a fictional version of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]), and was in a later season acquired by the Management & Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company.\n\nThe fifth season shows the prisoners revolting against the guards, wardens and the system after MCC's failed handling of an inmate's death at the hands of a guard in the fourth season. The inmate death had followed a peaceful protest and subsequent instigation of an inmate fight by another guard. Fueled by the conditions the inmates are forced to tolerate, as well as grudges against the prison guards, a three-day riot ensues. During the riot, some inmates attempt to negotiate better living conditions and seek justice for the death of the inmate, while others pursue their own interests and entertainment, and a few seek no involvement. At the emergence of the riot, the guard who incited the fight in the prior season is critically wounded by an inmate who took the gun the guard illegally brought into the prison. At the end of the season, [[SWAT]] raids the prison to end the riot and remove all inmates from the facility. During this raid, a correctional officer is fatally wounded by a corrupt \"strike team\", which then conspires to blame the guard's death on inmates who hid in an underground bunker and had taken the guard hostage. All inmates are transported to other prisons.\n\nThe consequences of the riot are shown in the sixth season. A number of the inmates, including Chapman and Vause, are transported to Litchfield Maximum Security. Most of these inmates are interrogated, and several of them charged and sentenced for their involvement in the riot. In max, new inmates are introduced, alliances are made, and a gang-like war emerges between two prison blocks, spearheaded by a longstanding feud between two sisters and a grudge harbored by them toward a former maximum-security inmate who returned as a consequence of the riot (she had been moved to the minimum security prison). Inmates who arrived from the minimum security prison are either caught up or willingly participate in the war between prison blocks. The season portrays further corruption and guard brutality.\n\nThe seventh season provides an ending to various inmate\u2019s stories. Chapman and Vause continue their on/off again relationship. The season shows how some prisoners are able to move beyond their time in prison while others are captured by the system and through their own flaws and/or systemic problems in the structure of US society and its \u201cjustice\u201d system are unable to progress. In addition to the established setting of Litchfield Max, a significant portion of the season takes place in a newly created [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] detention centre for detained presumed illegal immigrants, showing their struggles and lack of access to outside help in large part because of complete or extreme disregard of the law. \n\nThroughout the series, it is shown how various forms of corruption, funding cuts by the corporate owner to increase profit by millions, [[private prison|privatization of prison]], overcrowding, guard brutality and racial discrimination (among other issues), affect the prisoners' safety, health and well-being; the correctional officers\u2019 lives; and the prison's basic inability to fulfill its fundamental legal responsibilities and ethical obligations as a corrections institution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Terry|first=April|date=July 2016|title=Surveying Issues That Arise in Women's Prisons: A Content Critique of Orange Is the New Black: OITNB: Women's Prisons|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=10|issue=7|pages=553\u2013566|doi=10.1111/soc4.12388}}</ref> One of the show's key conflicts involves the minimum-security prison's Director of Human Activities (aka the warden, under privatization nomenclature), Joe Caputo, whose efforts and aims as a [[Prison warden|warden]] constantly conflict with the corporate interests of MCC, which acquired the facility when it was about to be shut down. This theme is continued when a new forward-thinking & caring warden is hired at the maximum security prison, and unlike Caputo actually institutes educational programs and positive changes.

Interested viewers had to search and second-guess, playing parlor games to suss out a character's sexuality. [[Cagney & Lacey|Cagney and Lacey]]? Jo on \"[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|Facts of Life]]\"? [[Xena]] and [[Gabrielle (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Gabrielle]]? Showtime's decision in January 2004 to air ''The L Word'', which follows the lives of a group of fashionable Los Angeles gays, was akin to ending a drought with a monsoon. Women who had rarely seen themselves on the small screen were suddenly able to watch gay characters not only living complex, exciting lives, but also making love in restaurant bathrooms and in swimming pools. There was no tentative audience courtship. Instead there was sex, raw and unbridled in that my-goodness way that only cable allows.\n\nCo-creator and executive producer [[Ilene Chaiken]] had some issues with the reaction:<ref name=\"nyt2005\"/>\n:I do want to move people on some deep level. But I won't take on the mantle of social responsibility. That's not compatible with entertainment. I rail against the idea that pop television is a political medium. I am political in my life. But I am making serialized [[melodrama]]. I'm not a cultural missionary.\n\nBy the time the sixth and final season began, however, reviews had become far more negative. ''The New York Times'' called the show a \"[[History of lesbianism|Sapphic]] ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]]\" that has \"shown little interest in variegating portrayals of gay experience. Instead it has seemed to work almost single-mindedly to counter the notion of \"[[lesbian bed death]]\" and repeatedly remind the viewer of the \"limits and tortures of monogamy\" while \"never align[ing] itself with the traditionalist ambitions [for [[same-sex marriage]]] of a large faction of the gay rights movement\".<ref name=\"nyt2009\">{{cite news| title=So Many Temptations to Succumb to, So Many Wandering Eyes to Track| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/arts/television/16word.html?fta=y| author=Ginia Bellafante| accessdate=2009-03-16| work=The New York Times | date=2009-01-16|author-link = Ginia Bellafante}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nUnlike its network predecessor ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', praised critically for its ground-breaking material that was both well-written and well-acted, there were complaints from critics regarding ''The L Word'''s watered-down, unrealistically glamorous characters and melodrama, and some reviewers and fans were put off by the theme song (introduced in the second season) and the \"graceless, clunky dialogue\".<ref>Heather Havrilesky, \"[https://www.salon.com/2007/01/14/iltw_4/ I Like to Watch]\" salon.com, January 14, 2007</ref>\n\nWhile the show is seen as fulfilling gay characters' \"obvious and modest representational need\"<ref>Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, \"Foreword: The Letter L.\" ''Reading the L Word'', edited by Kim Akass and Janet McCabe.

Interested viewers had to search and second-guess, playing parlor games to suss out a character's sexuality. [[Cagney & Lacey|Cagney and Lacey]]? Jo on \"[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|Facts of Life]]\"? [[Xena]] and [[Gabrielle (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Gabrielle]]? Showtime's decision in January 2004 to air ''The L Word'', which follows the lives of a group of fashionable Los Angeles gays, was akin to ending a drought with a monsoon. Women who had rarely seen themselves on the small screen were suddenly able to watch gay characters not only living complex, exciting lives, but also making love in restaurant bathrooms and in swimming pools. There was no tentative audience courtship. Instead there was sex, raw and unbridled in that my-goodness way that only cable allows.\n\nCo-creator and executive producer [[Ilene Chaiken]] had some issues with the reaction:<ref name=\"nyt2005\"/>\n:I do want to move people on some deep level. But I won't take on the mantle of social responsibility. That's not compatible with entertainment. I rail against the idea that pop television is a political medium. I am political in my life. But I am making serialized [[melodrama]]. I'm not a cultural missionary.\n\nBy the time the sixth and final season began, however, reviews had become far more negative. ''The New York Times'' called the show a \"[[History of lesbianism|Sapphic]] ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]]\" that has \"shown little interest in variegating portrayals of gay experience. Instead it has seemed to work almost single-mindedly to counter the notion of \"[[lesbian bed death]]\" and repeatedly remind the viewer of the \"limits and tortures of monogamy\" while \"never align[ing] itself with the traditionalist ambitions [for [[same-sex marriage]]] of a large faction of the gay rights movement\".<ref name=\"nyt2009\">{{cite news| title=So Many Temptations to Succumb to, So Many Wandering Eyes to Track| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/arts/television/16word.html?fta=y| author=Ginia Bellafante| accessdate=2009-03-16| work=The New York Times | date=2009-01-16|author-link = Ginia Bellafante}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nUnlike its network predecessor ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', praised critically for its ground-breaking material that was both well-written and well-acted, there were complaints from critics regarding ''The L Word'''s watered-down, unrealistically glamorous characters and melodrama, and some reviewers and fans were put off by the theme song (introduced in the second season) and the \"graceless, clunky dialogue\".<ref>Heather Havrilesky, \"[https://www.salon.com/2007/01/14/iltw_4/ I Like to Watch]\" salon.com, January 14, 2007</ref>\n\nWhile the show is seen as fulfilling gay characters' \"obvious and modest representational need\"<ref>Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, \"Foreword: The Letter L.\" ''Reading the L Word'', edited by Kim Akass and Janet McCabe.

Boccaro indicates that he loaned the gun to Ashley's killer, who is now going to kill Janet. Janet and Bianca learn the killer was someone genetically male but outwardly female and suspect Heather, whose nephew Janet sent to jail on an apparently false rape charge. Richard represents Heather at her bail hearing. DNA morphology reveals the culprit to be Peta, whose husband committed suicide after Janet refused to prosecute a historic child abuse charge. Peta traps Janet's children at the bottom of a lift shaft but Bianca stops her sending the lift down by shooting her in the leg.

Janet gets Pearl into a sports scholarship but Bianca breaks up with her, realising she'll never be her priority. Darren and Shannon are arrested after an attempt to abduct Richard but Owen has ASIO agents shut down the NCC interrogation; Darren is needed to monitor international terrorist organisations radicalising Australian youths, with NCC only allowed to confiscate the profits from the betting scams and money laundering.

Fuller started the band in 1970 and McGrail named it after a fictional 19th century [[Temperance movement|temperance union]] featured in the 1939 [[Errol Flynn]] cowboy film ''[[Dodge City (1939 film)|Dodge City]]''. Pure Prairie League scored five consecutive Top 40 LPs in the 1970s and added a sixth in the 1980s. The band has had a long run, active from the early 1970s through the late 1980s. The band was revived in 1998 and again in 2004 and as of 2019 continues to perform over 100 concerts a year in venues across the nation. Concerts for 2020 have already been booked. \n\n==History==\nAlthough the band has its roots in Waverly, it was actually formed in [[Columbus, Ohio]], and had its first success in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]. Craig Fuller, Tom McGrail, Jim Caughlan and John David Call had played together in various bands since high school, notably the Vikings, the Omars, the Sacred Turnips and the Swiss Navy.\n\nIn 1970 the first solid Pure Prairie League lineup was Fuller, McGrail, singer/songwriter/guitarist George Ed Powell (a popular Cincinnati folk singer), Phil Stokes (bassist in Columbus bands Sanhedrin Move and [[J.D. Blackfoot]]) and Robin Suskind (a popular guitar teacher in the [[University of Cincinnati]] neighborhood) on guitar and [[mandola]], with John David Call joining the band later that year. Call's steel guitar added country credibility to the band's playlist and sparked guitar duels with Fuller that created the signature sound of the band. They rose to popularity as the house band at New Dilly's Pub in the Mt. Adams section of Cincinnati.\n\nIn mid-1971 McGrail and Stokes left the band to rehearse with Bill Bartlett (Lemon Pipers, Beechwood Farm, RamJam), but were unable to put a viable band together. Jim Caughlan, who had played guitar and drums with Fuller, Call and McGrail in earlier bands, took over on drums and Jim Lanham from California, formerly of Country Funk, replaced Stokes on bass.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=984}}</ref>\n\nEarly on, the Pure Prairie League was looking for national artist representation and they made contact with a well-known Cleveland-based rock and roll promoter, Roger Abramson. At the behest of the group's roadie (who had also roadied for the James Gang) Jim \"Westy\" Westermeyer, Abramson saw the band at New Dilly's Pub and later signed them to a management contract. Abramson was able to land a contract with [[RCA Records]]. He then placed Pure Prairie League as an opening act with many of the concerts he produced at that time.\n\nTheir eponymous first album used a [[Norman Rockwell]] ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' cover showing a trail-worn cowboy, named Luke, who would appear on the cover of every Pure Prairie League recording thereafter.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After releasing their debut album (recorded in New York City) in March 1972 and embarking on a nationwide tour, Call, Caughlan and Lanham all left the band.\n\nAt that point, Pure Prairie League owed RCA another album and Craig Fuller agreed to record the second record in RCA's [[Toronto]] studio with the help of George Ed Powell and Bob Ringe (who had also produced the first album). Al Brisco played Pedal Steel Guitar on the session. ''Bustin' Out'' (begun in the summer of 1972) was produced by Ringe and featured the songs of Fuller and Powell.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Billy Hinds from Cincinnati (drums, percussion) joined the band and Hinds's friend, Michael Connor, played [[piano]] on most of the sessions and would become a regular in the Pure Prairie League line-up for years to come. [[Mick Ronson]] added string arrangements to several tracks, most notably \"Boulder Skies\" and \"Call Me Tell Me\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Michael Reilly, who would become the longtime bass player and front man for the band, joined in early September 1972, soon after the record was completed. ''Bustin' Out'' was released in October 1972.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nShortly afterward, the group returned to Ohio and Fuller had to face trial for charges of draft evasion in [[Kentucky]]. Before [[conscientious objector]] (C.O.) status could be arranged, he was sentenced to six months in jail and forced to leave Pure Prairie League in February 1973. At this point, RCA dropped the band and their future looked bleak.\n\nBy August 1973, the band members were in Cincinnati and managed to persuade Call to return. Fuller, though out of prison by now, was working the late shift in a community hospital to satisfy his C.O. requirements and was not inclined to rejoin at that time. (He was eventually given a full pardon by President [[Gerald Ford]].) Reilly took over as the band's leader and brought in his friend Larry Goshorn (vocals, guitars) to replace Fuller in November 1973. Goshorn had played in a popular Ohio band called [[The Sacred Mushroom]].\n\nPure Prairie League hit the road and began playing gigs constantly, mostly in the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast. As a result of their heavy schedule, particularly at colleges, their songs became well known; \"[[Amie (song)|Amie]]\" (Craig Fuller's ode to an on-again/off-again relationship), from the second album, became a particular favorite.\n\n==Success==\nAs \"[[Amie (song)|Amie]]\" grew in popularity, radio stations began receiving requests for it. As a result, RCA re-released ''Bustin' Out'' and issued \"Amie\" as a single. It peaked at No.&nbsp;27 on April 26, 1975, just as a minor bluegrass revival was underway on mid-western college campuses.\n\nRCA re-signed Pure Prairie League and their third album, ''Two Lane Highway'', was released in June 1975.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It featured guest appearances by [[Chet Atkins]], fiddler [[Johnny Gimble]], [[Don Felder]] from [[The Eagles]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], who dueted with the band on the song \"Just Can't Believe It\", which received much airplay on country stations. ''Highway'' was the band's highest 'charter' at No.&nbsp;24 and ''Bustin' Out'' reached gold status. This began a string of five consecutive Top 40 album releases as ''If the Shoe Fits'' (January 1976), ''Dance'' (November 1976), and ''Live, Takin' the Stage'' (September 1977) all made the Top 40.\n\nIn 1977, Call left because of increasing back troubles. Larry Goshorn's brother, Tim, joined in time to record ''Just Fly'' (March 1978). In 1978 there was a mass exodus as the Goshorns left to form their own group, The Goshorn Brothers, and Powell, the last remaining original member, retired from the road to run his pig farm in Ohio. But the group soldiered on as Reilly quickly brought in temporary members, California country rocker Chris Peterson (vocals, guitar) and the group's soundman, Jeff Redefer (guitar), to play a few shows until new, permanent players could be located.\n\nIn September 1978, auditions led to the hiring of [[Vince Gill]] (vocals, guitars, mandolin, banjo, fiddle). Further auditions brought in Steven Patrick Bolin (vocals, guitars, flute, saxophone) in January 1979. This revamped lineup recorded ''[[Can't Hold Back (Pure Prairie League album)|Can't Hold Back]]'' (June 1979), which turned out to be their last for RCA. Sax player Jeff Kirk accompanied the band on some of their dates during the 1979 tour.\n\n[[Casablanca Records]], who at this time was trying to play down its reputation as primarily a [[disco]] label, signed Pure Prairie League and other non-dance acts to its roster in 1980. In January, guitarist Jeff Wilson came in to replace Bolin and the band's next release, ''[[Firin' Up]]'' (February 1980) spawned the hits \"[[Let Me Love You Tonight]]\" and \"I'm Almost Ready\", both sung by Gill, with [[saxophone]] accompaniment by [[David Sanborn]]. A second Casablanca release, ''[[Something in the Night]]'' (February 1981), kept Pure Prairie League on the charts with \"Still Right Here in My Heart\". However, as fate would have it, Casablanca ultimately went bankrupt and was sold to [[Polygram Records]]. Polygram then dropped most of Casablanca's roster, including Pure Prairie League. Both Gill and Wilson left in early 1982 and Gill pursued a successful solo country career.\n\n==Later years==\nDespite the lack of a recording contract, the group still found itself in demand as a live act and played in clubs and at outdoor festivals.\n\nTim Goshorn returned in 1982 and Mike Hamilton (vocals, guitars, from [[Kenny Loggins]]' band) also joined the same year and was there for 6 months (until mid-1982). Al Garth (vocals, woodwinds, fiddle, keyboards), another Loggins alumnus ([[Loggins & Messina]], also [[Poco]] and [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]), joined as well, from 1982 to 1985.\n\nLongtime drummer Billy Hinds retired from the road in 1984. He was first succeeded by Merel Bregante (also ex-Loggins & Messina and Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) and then by Joel Rosenblatt (1985\u20131986) and Steve Speelman (ex-Steele) (1986\u20131988). Sax player Dan Clawson took over for Garth in 1985 and [[Gary Burr]] (vocals, guitars) was there from 1984 to 1985.\n\n1985 also saw the return of the group's co-founder Craig Fuller (who had fronted the groups [[American Flyer (band)|American Flyer]] and Fuller/Kaz in the mid-to-late '70s after he'd returned to music).\n\n''Mementos 1971-1987'', which contained re-recordings of their best known material plus four new songs, was released on the small Rushmore label in December 1987 and was recorded back in Ohio, where the band had returned to their home base. It featured guest appearances from many of the band's alumni, including Gill, Powell, the Goshorns, Call, Burr, Rosenblatt and Mike Hamilton.\n\nIn 1988 the band decided to call it quits. Fuller, who had already joined a reformed [[Little Feat]] in 1987, played with Pure Prairie League for their final shows in the spring of 1988.\n\n==Rebirth==\nA decade later (in 1998), Pure Prairie League was back with a lineup of Fuller, Connor, Reilly, Burr, [[Fats Kaplin]] (pedal steel guitar, mandolin, banjo, fiddle, accordion, washboard) and Rick Schell (vocals, drums, percussion). After two years, Burr was succeeded by [[Curtis Wright]] (vocals, guitars) in June 2000. The group began work on a new album in 2002, yet abandoned the sessions and separated again after Schell became busy with other projects. After a long battle with cancer, Michael Connor died on September 9, 2004.\n\nFollowing Connor's death, the group resumed touring once again with Fuller, Reilly, Schell, Wright and Kaplin (when available) and released ''All in Good Time'' in November 2005. Their first album in 18 years, this release appeared on the small Drifter's Church label.\n\nSince this time, Pure Prairie League has continued to tour, playing a handful of shows every year. Donnie Lee Clark replaced Curtis Wright in late 2006 after Wright joined [[Reba McEntire]]'s band. Mike Reilly was sidelined in 2006 after he was forced to undergo a liver transplant. Jack Sundrud (from [[Poco]]) came in to sub for Reilly. Rick Plant also did a brief stint with them on bass before relocating to Australia in late 2006. Jeff \"Stick\" Davis (from [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]]) sat in on bass for Mike in 2007. In May 2007, Reilly appeared at a few shows and played guitar yet was unable to come back full-time until 2008. John David Call played some concerts in 2006 & 2007, standing in for Kaplin, and returned to the band full-time in June 2010.\n\nAs of May 2011, it was announced, via the Pure Prairie League website, that Fuller would not be appearing at all of the band's shows that year since he decided to take a break from touring. He ended up leaving the group again altogether by 2012. On February 10, 2012, at The Syndicate in [[Newport, Kentucky]], Fuller, his son Patrick, Tommy McGrail, and George Ed Powell (a frequent guest at their Ohio shows in recent years) took to the stage to join the current Pure Prairie League lineup of John David Call, Mike Reilly, Rick Schell and Donnie Lee Clark. In May 2012, Scott Thompson (vocals, drums, percussion) replaced Rick Schell, who departed to continue to grow his real estate business. Former member Tim Goshorn died on April 15, 2017, at age 62 at his home in [[Williamstown, Kentucky]] after a bout with cancer.\n\nThe band endorses a number of charitable efforts, Pittsburgh's ongoing BurghSTOCK Concert Series among them.\n\n==Members==\n===Current===\n* John David Call \u2014 pedal steel guitar, banjo, dobro (1970\u20131972, 1973\u20131977, 2010\u2013present; guest

[[United States|American]] [[country rock]] band whose origins go back to 1965 and [[Waverly, Ohio|Waverly]], [[Ohio]], with singer and guitarist [[Craig Fuller]], drummer Tom McGrail, guitarist and drummer Jim Caughlan and steel guitar artist John David Call. Fuller started the band in 1970 and McGrail named it after a fictional 19th century [[Temperance movement|temperance union]] featured in the 1939 [[Errol Flynn]] cowboy film ''[[Dodge City (1939 film)|Dodge City]]''. Pure Prairie League scored five consecutive Top 40 LPs in the 1970s and added a sixth in the 1980s. The band has had a long run, active from the early 1970s through the late 1980s. The band was revived in 1998 and again in 2004 and as of 2019 continues to perform over 100 concerts a year in venues across the nation. Concerts for 2020 have already been booked. \n\n==History==\nAlthough the band has its roots in Waverly, it was actually formed in [[Columbus, Ohio]], and had its first success in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]]. Craig Fuller, Tom McGrail, Jim Caughlan and John David Call had played together in various bands since high school, notably the Vikings, the Omars, the Sacred Turnips and the Swiss Navy.\n\nIn 1970 the first solid Pure Prairie League lineup was Fuller, McGrail, singer/songwriter/guitarist George Ed Powell (a popular Cincinnati folk singer), Phil Stokes (bassist in Columbus bands Sanhedrin Move and [[J.D. Blackfoot]]) and Robin Suskind (a popular guitar teacher in the [[University of Cincinnati]] neighborhood) on guitar and [[mandola]], with John David Call joining the band later that year. Call's steel guitar added country credibility to the band's playlist and sparked guitar duels with Fuller that created the signature sound of the band. They rose to popularity as the house band at New Dilly's Pub in the Mt. Adams section of Cincinnati.\n\nIn mid-1971 McGrail and Stokes left the band to rehearse with Bill Bartlett (Lemon Pipers, Beechwood Farm, RamJam), but were unable to put a viable band together. Jim Caughlan, who had played guitar and drums with Fuller, Call and McGrail in earlier bands, took over on drums and Jim Lanham from California, formerly of Country Funk, replaced Stokes on bass.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=984}}</ref>\n\nEarly on, the Pure Prairie League was looking for national artist representation and they made contact with a well-known Cleveland-based rock and roll promoter, Roger Abramson. At the behest of the group's roadie (who had also roadied for the James Gang) Jim \"Westy\" Westermeyer, Abramson saw the band at New Dilly's Pub and later signed them to a management contract. Abramson was able to land a contract with [[RCA Records]]. He then placed Pure Prairie League as an opening act with many of the concerts he produced at that time.\n\nTheir eponymous first album used a [[Norman Rockwell]] ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' cover showing a trail-worn cowboy, named Luke, who would appear on the cover of every Pure Prairie League recording thereafter.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After releasing their debut album (recorded in New York City) in March 1972 and embarking on a nationwide tour, Call, Caughlan and Lanham all left the band.\n\nAt that point, Pure Prairie League owed RCA another album and Craig Fuller agreed to record the second record in RCA's [[Toronto]] studio with the help of George Ed Powell and Bob Ringe (who had also produced the first album). ''Bustin' Out'' (begun in the summer of 1972) was produced by Ringe and featured the songs of Fuller and Powell.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Billy Hinds from Cincinnati (drums, percussion) joined the band and Hinds's friend, Michael Connor, played [[piano]] on most of the sessions and would become a regular in the Pure Prairie League line-up for years to come. [[Mick Ronson]] added string arrangements to several tracks, most notably \"Boulder Skies\" and \"Call Me Tell Me\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Michael Reilly, who would become the longtime bass player and front man for the band, joined in early September 1972, soon after the record was completed. ''Bustin' Out'' was released in October 1972.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nShortly afterward, the group returned to Ohio and Fuller had to face trial for charges of draft evasion in [[Kentucky]]. Before [[conscientious objector]] (C.O.) status could be arranged, he was sentenced to six months in jail and forced to leave Pure Prairie League in February 1973. At this point, RCA dropped the band and their future looked bleak.\n\nBy August 1973, the band members were in Cincinnati and managed to persuade Call to return. Fuller, though out of prison by now, was working the late shift in a community hospital to satisfy his C.O. requirements and was not inclined to rejoin at that time. (He was eventually given a full pardon by President [[Gerald Ford]].) Reilly took over as the band's leader and brought in his friend Larry Goshorn (vocals, guitars) to replace Fuller in November 1973. Goshorn had played in a popular Ohio band called [[The Sacred Mushroom]].\n\nPure Prairie League hit the road and began playing gigs constantly, mostly in the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast. As a result of their heavy schedule, particularly at colleges, their songs became well known; \"[[Amie (song)|Amie]]\" (Craig Fuller's ode to an on-again/off-again relationship), from the second album, became a particular favorite.\n\n==Success==\nAs \"[[Amie (song)|Amie]]\" grew in popularity, radio stations began receiving requests for it. As a result, RCA re-released ''Bustin' Out'' and issued \"Amie\" as a single. It peaked at No.&nbsp;27 on April 26, 1975, just as a minor bluegrass revival was underway on mid-western college campuses.\n\nRCA re-signed Pure Prairie League and their third album, ''Two Lane Highway'', was released in June 1975.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It featured guest appearances by [[Chet Atkins]], fiddler [[Johnny Gimble]], [[Don Felder]] from [[The Eagles]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], who dueted with the band on the song \"Just Can't Believe It\", which received much airplay on country stations. ''Highway'' was the band's highest 'charter' at No.&nbsp;24 and ''Bustin' Out'' reached gold status. This began a string of five consecutive Top 40 album releases as ''If the Shoe Fits'' (January 1976), ''Dance'' (November 1976), and ''Live, Takin' the Stage'' (September 1977) all made the Top 40.\n\nIn 1977, Call left because of increasing back troubles. Larry Goshorn's brother, Tim, joined in time to record ''Just Fly'' (March 1978). In 1978 there was a mass exodus as the Goshorns left to form their own group, The Goshorn Brothers, and Powell, the last remaining original member, retired from the road to run his pig farm in Ohio. But the group soldiered on as Reilly quickly brought in temporary members, California country rocker Chris Peterson (vocals, guitar) and the group's soundman, Jeff Redefer (guitar), to play a few shows until new, permanent players could be located.\n\nIn September 1978, auditions led to the hiring of [[Vince Gill]] (vocals, guitars, mandolin, banjo, fiddle). Further auditions brought in Steven Patrick Bolin (vocals, guitars, flute, saxophone) in January 1979. This revamped lineup recorded ''[[Can't Hold Back (Pure Prairie League album)|Can't Hold Back]]'' (June 1979), which turned out to be their last for RCA. Sax player Jeff Kirk accompanied the band on some of their dates during the 1979 tour.\n\n[[Casablanca Records]], who at this time was trying to play down its reputation as primarily a [[disco]] label, signed Pure Prairie League and other non-dance acts to its roster in 1980. In January, guitarist Jeff Wilson came in to replace Bolin and the band's next release, ''[[Firin' Up]]'' (February 1980) spawned the hits \"[[Let Me Love You Tonight]]\" and \"I'm Almost Ready\", both sung by Gill, with [[saxophone]] accompaniment by [[David Sanborn]]. A second Casablanca release, ''[[Something in the Night]]'' (February 1981), kept Pure Prairie League on the charts with \"Still Right Here in My Heart\". However, as fate would have it, Casablanca ultimately went bankrupt and was sold to [[Polygram Records]]. Polygram then dropped most of Casablanca's roster, including Pure Prairie League. Both Gill and Wilson left in early 1982 and Gill pursued a successful solo country career.\n\n==Later years==\nDespite the lack of a recording contract, the group still found itself in demand as a live act and played in clubs and at outdoor festivals.\n\nTim Goshorn returned in 1982 and Mike Hamilton (vocals, guitars, from [[Kenny Loggins]]' band) also joined the same year and was there for 6 months (until mid-1982). Al Garth (vocals, woodwinds, fiddle, keyboards), another Loggins alumnus ([[Loggins & Messina]], also [[Poco]] and [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]), joined as well, from 1982 to 1985.\n\nLongtime drummer Billy Hinds retired from the road in 1984. He was first succeeded by Merel Bregante (also ex-Loggins & Messina and Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) and then by Joel Rosenblatt (1985\u20131986) and Steve Speelman (ex-Steele) (1986\u20131988). Sax player Dan Clawson took over for Garth in 1985 and [[Gary Burr]] (vocals, guitars) was there from 1984 to 1985.\n\n1985 also saw the return of the group's co-founder Craig Fuller (who had fronted the groups [[American Flyer (band)|American Flyer]] and Fuller/Kaz in the mid-to-late '70s after he'd returned to music).\n\n''Mementos 1971-1987'', which contained re-recordings of their best known material plus four new songs, was released on the small Rushmore label in December 1987 and was recorded back in Ohio, where the band had returned to their home base. It featured guest appearances from many of the band's alumni, including Gill, Powell, the Goshorns, Call, Burr, Rosenblatt and Mike Hamilton.\n\nIn 1988 the band decided to call it quits. Fuller, who had already joined a reformed [[Little Feat]] in 1987, played with Pure Prairie League for their final shows in the spring of 1988.\n\n==Rebirth==\nA decade later (in 1998), Pure Prairie League was back with a lineup of Fuller, Connor, Reilly, Burr, [[Fats Kaplin]] (pedal steel guitar, mandolin, banjo, fiddle, accordion, washboard) and Rick Schell (vocals, drums, percussion). After two years, Burr was succeeded by [[Curtis Wright]] (vocals, guitars) in June 2000. The group began work on a new album in 2002, yet abandoned the sessions and separated again after Schell became busy with other projects. After a long battle with cancer, Michael Connor died on September 9, 2004.\n\nFollowing Connor's death, the group resumed touring once again with Fuller, Reilly, Schell, Wright and Kaplin (when available) and released ''All in Good Time'' in November 2005. Their first album in 18 years, this release appeared on the small Drifter's Church label.\n\nSince this time, Pure Prairie League has continued to tour, playing a handful of shows every year. Donnie Lee Clark replaced Curtis Wright in late 2006 after Wright joined [[Reba McEntire]]'s band. Mike Reilly was sidelined in 2006 after he was forced to undergo a liver transplant. Jack Sundrud (from [[Poco]]) came in to sub for Reilly. Rick Plant also did a brief stint with them on bass before relocating to Australia in late 2006. Jeff \"Stick\" Davis (from [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]]) sat in on bass for Mike in 2007. In May 2007, Reilly appeared at a few shows and played guitar yet was unable to come back full-time until 2008. John David Call played some concerts in 2006 & 2007, standing in for Kaplin, and returned to the band full-time in June 2010.\n\nAs of May 2011, it was announced, via the Pure Prairie League website, that Fuller would not be appearing at all of the band's shows that year since he decided to take a break from touring. He ended up leaving the group again altogether by 2012. On February 10, 2012, at The Syndicate in [[Newport, Kentucky]], Fuller, his son Patrick, Tommy McGrail, and George Ed Powell (a frequent guest at their Ohio shows in recent years) took to the stage to join the current Pure Prairie League lineup of John David Call, Mike Reilly, Rick Schell and Donnie Lee Clark. In May 2012, Scott Thompson (vocals, drums, percussion) replaced Rick Schell, who departed to continue to grow his real estate business. Former member Tim Goshorn died on April 15, 2017, at age 62 at his home in [[Williamstown, Kentucky]] after a bout with cancer.\n\nThe band endorses a number of charitable efforts, Pittsburgh's ongoing BurghSTOCK Concert Series among them.\n\n==Members==\n===Current===\n* John David Call \u2014 pedal steel guitar, banjo, dobro (1970\u20131972, 1973\u20131977, 2010\u2013present; guest

They had no construction numbers or USAF tail numbers.\n\nThe C-133 had large tail doors and side doors and a large, open cargo area. The C-133A carried many large and heavy loads, including Atlas and Titan. While the C-133 was not designed specifically to transport ICBMs. It may, indeed, have been the reverse. The C-133 design was frozen by 1955 in order to build the airplanes that first flew in April 1956. The designs of both the Atlas and Titan were not firm until after 1955, when their contracts were signed. With the C-133B, the rear cargo doors were modified to open to the side (petal doors), making ICBM loading much easier. Air transporting the [[ballistic missile]]s such as the [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]],<ref name=\"USAF Museum\"/> [[Titan (missile)|Titan]] and [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman]] was much less expensive, safer and faster than road transport. Several hundred Minuteman and other [[ICBM]]s were airlifted to and from their operational bases by C-133s. The C-133 also transported Atlas, [[Saturn (rocket)|Saturn]] and Titan rockets to [[Cape Canaveral]] for use as launch boosters in the Gemini, Mercury and Apollo space programs. After the Apollo capsules splashed down, they were airlifted in C-133s from [[Naval Station Norfolk]], Virginia, or [[Hickam AFB]], Hawaii, to [[Ellington AFB]], Texas, or to California.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Douglas C-133A Cargomaster USAF.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved C-133A]]\n[[File:Douglas C-133B N77152 FAR Tucson 12.10.73 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|C-133B Cargomaster ''N77152'' of the Foundation for Airborne Relief at [[Tucson Airport]] Arizona in 1973 still wearing MAC markings]]\n\nThe C-133 was for many years the only USAF aircraft capable of hauling very large or very heavy cargo. Despite the [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II]]'s capabilities, there was much cargo that it could not carry because of its configuration with a cargo deck 13&nbsp;ft (4&nbsp;m) off the ground and its lower, though substantial, engine power. The C-133 continued in service after the formation of the USAFs [[Military Airlift Command]] on 1 January 1966.\n\nBy 1971, shortly before the introduction of the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], the Cargomaster was obsolete as well as being worn out, and all were withdrawn from service. The C-133 had a 10,000-hour airframe that was life-extended to 19,000 hours. Severe vibration caused critical stress corrosion of the airframes to the point that the aircraft were beyond economical operation. The Air Force managed to keep as many of the C-133 fleet in service as possible until the C-5 entered squadron service.\n\nC-133s set a number of unofficial records, including records for military transport aircraft on trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes. Among the longest were non-stop flights from [[Tachikawa Airfield]], Japan, to [[Travis Air Force Base]], California (17:20 hours on 22 May 1959, 5,150&nbsp;mi/8,288&nbsp;km, 297.2&nbsp;mph/478.3&nbsp;km/h) and [[Hickam Air Force Base]], Hawaii to [[Dover Air Force Base]], Delaware in about 16 hours (4,850&nbsp;mi/7,805&nbsp;km 303.1&nbsp;mph/487.8&nbsp;km/h). The only [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|FAI]] officially sanctioned record was in December 1958, when C-133A 62008 lifted a payload of 117,900&nbsp;lb (53,480&nbsp;kg) to an altitude of 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,048&nbsp;m) at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.\n\n==Operators==\n''Data from:''C-133 units,<ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Cal|title=C-133 Units|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/c133bcargomaster/c133bunits.html|website=www.angelfire.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref> C-133 Tail Numbers<ref name=\"C-133 Tail Numbers\">{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Cal|title=C-133 Tail numbers |url=http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/c133bcargomaster/c133btailnumbers.html |website=www.angelfire.com |accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n;{{USA}}\n'''[[United States Air Force]]'''\n\n[[Military Air Transport Service]]/[[Military Airlift Command]]\n*[[1501st Air Transport Wing]]/[[60th Military Airlift Wing]] \u2013 [[Travis AFB]], [[California]]\n::1st Air Transport Squadron/Military Airlift Squadron, 1960\u201371\n*[[1607th Air Transport Wing]]/[[436th Military Airlift Wing]] \u2013 [[Dover AFB]], [[Delaware]]\n::39th Air Transport Squadron/Military Airlift Squadron, 1957\u201371\n::84th Air Transport Squadron/Military Airlift Squadron, 1957\u201371\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nEarly in its life-cycle the airplane developed a reputation of crashing. Crew members referred to it as a \"widowmaker\". Some would not fly in the C-133, since the cause of the crashes was unknown.  Several issues were discovered after crash investigations. The first issue was with the auto-pitch controller on the propellers. A time delay was added to relieve stress on the nose casing. The second issue was that the stall characteristics gave little warning to the crew. The left wing was found to stall before the right wing. The fix was simple, [[Stall strips|a small strip of metal was attached to the right wing]] causing it to stall simultaneously with the left wing. As the aircraft neared the end of its 10,000-hour life-cycle the last C-133B crash occurred on 6 February 1970. It was determined the airframe split at the cargo door. The final fix was a band around the airframe to strengthen; the end of the C-133 was near. The C-5A Galaxy debuted in 1971 and marked the end of the C-133. Of 50 aircraft built, nine were lost in crashes and one was destroyed in a ground fire.<ref name=\"C-133 Tail Numbers\"/><ref>{{Cite magazine |title=The Curse of the Cargomaster |author=John Sotham |date=September 2010 |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/the-curse-of-the-cargomaster-2241392/?no-ist=&c=y&page=1 |magazine=[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]]}}</ref>\n\n;13 April 1958:AF Serial No. 54-0146, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 13 April 1958, crashed {{cvt|26|mi|nmi km}} south of [[Dover AFB]], Delaware in [[Ellendale, Delaware]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A Cargomaster 54-0146 Georgetown, DE|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19580413-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;10 June 1961:AF Serial No. 57-1614, 1501 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 10 June 1961, crashed into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off [[Japan]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A-35-DL Cargomaster 57-1614 Tachikawa AB, Japan|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19610610-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;27 May 1962:AF Serial No. 57-1611, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 27 May 1962, crashed into water near Shad Intersection (37\u00b0 43' N 73\u00b0 W),<ref name=SHAD>{{cite book |title=The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |year=1961 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG45AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA225|page=225}}</ref> east of Dover AFB, Delaware.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A-35-DL Cargomaster 57-1611 Dover AFB, DE, USA|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19620527-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;10 April 1963:AF Serial No. 59-0523, 1501 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 10 April 1963, crashed while in traffic pattern, [[Travis AFB]], California<ref>{{cite web |website=Check-Six.com |title=The Crash of the C-133B near Travis AFB, CA |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/C-133b_crash_site.htm |accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133B-DL Cargomaster 59-0523 Fairfield-Travis AFB, CA (SUU)|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19630410-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;13 July 1963:AF Serial No. 56-2005, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 13 July 1963 during refuelling ground fire, Dover AFB, Delaware.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A Cargomaster 56-2005 Dover AFB, DE (DOV)|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19630731-1|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;22 September 1963:AF Serial No. 56-2002, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 22 September 1963, crashed into Atlantic Ocean near Shad Intersection (37\u00b0 43' N 73\u00b0 W),<ref name=SHAD/> southeast of Dover AFB, Delaware; aircraft apparently stalled near top of climb to cruising altitude.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A Cargomaster 56-2002 Cape May, NJ, USA|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19630922-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;7 November 1964:AF Serial No. 56-2014, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 7 November 1964 in crash on takeoff at [[CFB Goose Bay]], Labrador.

The C-133 was then retired and most airplanes were cut up within months of being delivered to [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]], Tucson, Arizona, after their final flights in 1971.\n\nFifty aircraft (35 C-133A and 15 C-133B) were constructed and put into service with the USAF.<ref name=\"USAF Museum\">{{cite web|title=Douglas C-133A Cargo Master|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/198055/douglas-c-133a-cargo-master/|website=National Museum of the US Air Force\u2122|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref> A single C-133A and a C-133B were built and kept at Douglas Long Beach as \"test articles\". They had no construction numbers or USAF tail numbers.\n\nThe C-133 had large tail doors and side doors and a large, open cargo area. The C-133A carried many large and heavy loads, including Atlas and Titan. While the C-133 was not designed specifically to transport ICBMs. It may, indeed, have been the reverse. The C-133 design was frozen by 1955 in order to build the airplanes that first flew in April 1956. The designs of both the Atlas and Titan were not firm until after 1955, when their contracts were signed. With the C-133B, the rear cargo doors were modified to open to the side (petal doors), making ICBM loading much easier. Air transporting the [[ballistic missile]]s such as the [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]],<ref name=\"USAF Museum\"/> [[Titan (missile)|Titan]] and [[Minuteman (missile)|Minuteman]] was much less expensive, safer and faster than road transport. Several hundred Minuteman and other [[ICBM]]s were airlifted to and from their operational bases by C-133s. The C-133 also transported Atlas, [[Saturn (rocket)|Saturn]] and Titan rockets to [[Cape Canaveral]] for use as launch boosters in the Gemini, Mercury and Apollo space programs. After the Apollo capsules splashed down, they were airlifted in C-133s from [[Naval Station Norfolk]], Virginia, or [[Hickam AFB]], Hawaii, to [[Ellington AFB]], Texas, or to California.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Douglas C-133A Cargomaster USAF.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved C-133A]]\n[[File:Douglas C-133B N77152 FAR Tucson 12.10.73 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|C-133B Cargomaster ''N77152'' of the Foundation for Airborne Relief at [[Tucson Airport]] Arizona in 1973 still wearing MAC markings]]\n\nThe C-133 was for many years the only USAF aircraft capable of hauling very large or very heavy cargo. Despite the [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II]]'s capabilities, there was much cargo that it could not carry because of its configuration with a cargo deck 13&nbsp;ft (4&nbsp;m) off the ground and its lower, though substantial, engine power. The C-133 continued in service after the formation of the USAFs [[Military Airlift Command]] on 1 January 1966.\n\nBy 1971, shortly before the introduction of the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], the Cargomaster was obsolete as well as being worn out, and all were withdrawn from service. The C-133 had a 10,000-hour airframe that was life-extended to 19,000 hours. Severe vibration caused critical stress corrosion of the airframes to the point that the aircraft were beyond economical operation. The Air Force managed to keep as many of the C-133 fleet in service as possible until the C-5 entered squadron service.\n\nC-133s set a number of unofficial records, including records for military transport aircraft on trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes. Among the longest were non-stop flights from [[Tachikawa Airfield]], Japan, to [[Travis Air Force Base]], California (17:20 hours on 22 May 1959, 5,150&nbsp;mi/8,288&nbsp;km, 297.2&nbsp;mph/478.3&nbsp;km/h) and [[Hickam Air Force Base]], Hawaii to [[Dover Air Force Base]], Delaware in about 16 hours (4,850&nbsp;mi/7,805&nbsp;km 303.1&nbsp;mph/487.8&nbsp;km/h). The only [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale|FAI]] officially sanctioned record was in December 1958, when C-133A 62008 lifted a payload of 117,900&nbsp;lb (53,480&nbsp;kg) to an altitude of 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,048&nbsp;m) at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.\n\n==Operators==\n''Data from:''C-133 units,<ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Cal|title=C-133 Units|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/c133bcargomaster/c133bunits.html|website=www.angelfire.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref> C-133 Tail Numbers<ref name=\"C-133 Tail Numbers\">{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Cal|title=C-133 Tail numbers |url=http://www.angelfire.com/wa2/c133bcargomaster/c133btailnumbers.html |website=www.angelfire.com |accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n;{{USA}}\n*[[United States Air Force]]\n**[[Military Air Transport Service]]/[[Military Airlift Command]]\n***[[1501st Air Transport Wing]]/[[60th Military Airlift Wing]] \u2013 [[Travis AFB]], [[California]]\n****1st Air Transport Squadron/Military Airlift Squadron, 1960\u201371\n***[[1607th Air Transport Wing]]/[[436th Military Airlift Wing]] \u2013 [[Dover AFB]], [[Delaware]]\n****39th Air Transport Squadron/Military Airlift Squadron, 1957\u201371\n****84th Air Transport Squadron/Military Airlift Squadron, 1957\u201371\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nEarly in its life-cycle the airplane developed a reputation of crashing. Crew members referred to it as a \"widowmaker\". Some would not fly in the C-133, since the cause of the crashes was unknown.  Several issues were discovered after crash investigations. The first issue was with the auto-pitch controller on the propellers. A time delay was added to relieve stress on the nose casing. The second issue was that the stall characteristics gave little warning to the crew. The left wing was found to stall before the right wing. The fix was simple, [[Stall strips|a small strip of metal was attached to the right wing]] causing it to stall simultaneously with the left wing. As the aircraft neared the end of its 10,000-hour life-cycle the last C-133B crash occurred on 6 February 1970. It was determined the airframe split at the cargo door. The final fix was a band around the airframe to strengthen; the end of the C-133 was near. The C-5A Galaxy debuted in 1971 and marked the end of the C-133. Of 50 aircraft built, nine were lost in crashes and one was destroyed in a ground fire.<ref name=\"C-133 Tail Numbers\"/><ref>{{Cite magazine |title=The Curse of the Cargomaster |author=John Sotham |date=September 2010 |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/the-curse-of-the-cargomaster-2241392/?no-ist=&c=y&page=1 |magazine=[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]]}}</ref>\n\n;13 April 1958:AF Serial No. 54-0146, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 13 April 1958, crashed {{cvt|26|mi|nmi km}} south of [[Dover AFB]], Delaware in [[Ellendale, Delaware]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A Cargomaster 54-0146 Georgetown, DE|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19580413-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;10 June 1961:AF Serial No. 57-1614, 1501 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 10 June 1961, crashed into the [[Pacific Ocean]] off [[Japan]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A-35-DL Cargomaster 57-1614 Tachikawa AB, Japan|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19610610-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;27 May 1962:AF Serial No. 57-1611, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 27 May 1962, crashed into water near Shad Intersection (37\u00b0 43' N 73\u00b0 W),<ref name=SHAD>{{cite book |title=The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |year=1961 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG45AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA225|page=225}}</ref> east of Dover AFB, Delaware.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A-35-DL Cargomaster 57-1611 Dover AFB, DE, USA|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19620527-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;10 April 1963:AF Serial No. 59-0523, 1501 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 10 April 1963, crashed while in traffic pattern, [[Travis AFB]], California<ref>{{cite web |website=Check-Six.com |title=The Crash of the C-133B near Travis AFB, CA |url=http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/C-133b_crash_site.htm |accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133B-DL Cargomaster 59-0523 Fairfield-Travis AFB, CA (SUU)|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19630410-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;13 July 1963:AF Serial No. 56-2005, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 13 July 1963 during refuelling ground fire, Dover AFB, Delaware.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A Cargomaster 56-2005 Dover AFB, DE (DOV)|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19630731-1|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;22 September 1963:AF Serial No. 56-2002, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 22 September 1963, crashed into Atlantic Ocean near Shad Intersection (37\u00b0 43' N 73\u00b0 W),<ref name=SHAD/> southeast of Dover AFB, Delaware; aircraft apparently stalled near top of climb to cruising altitude.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ranter|first1=Harro|title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-133A Cargomaster 56-2002 Cape May, NJ, USA|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19630922-0|website=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n;7 November 1964:AF Serial No. 56-2014, 1607 ATW&nbsp;\u2014 Destroyed 7 November 1964 in crash on takeoff at [[CFB Goose Bay]], Labrador.

One night, while walking her dog, Murphy stumbles across what she believes to be Tyson's corpse, but when a police investigation turns up nothing, she spirals into depression, culminating in her getting caught cheating with a married man, Bryant, and losing her cane. When she returns to Tyson's old corner, she meets Darnell, Tyson's cousin and supplier, who tells her he's still alive. Bryant's wife, Gayle, rescinds a donation she made to Murphy's parents, driving a wedge between her and her mother Joy, who has given up trying to help her. Out of guilt, Murphy agrees to take a receptionist's job in her family's seeing dog school until she can pay them back. Incensed that no one believes her about Tyson, Murphy takes it upon herself to find him and has his phone's GPS tracked so she can find it.

Murphy agrees to watch Chloe while Dean and Chelsea go on a date, and then takes her to the mall to meet a boy named Billy, unaware that Nia has paid Wesley's bail and provided him with her name. Murphy pays for Chloe to get a full makeover, boosting her confidence enough that she manages to overcome her shyness and get Billy to talk to her.

Ignoring all warnings not to do so, Murphy reports Wesley to the police and picks him out of a vocal line-up. Hank asks Felix to discreetly procure him some [[marijuana|weed]]; in turn, he asks Jess to accompany him. Murphy agrees to watch Chloe while Dean and Chelsea go on a date, and then takes her to the mall to meet a boy named Billy, unaware that Nia has paid Wesley's bail and provided him with her name. Murphy pays for Chloe to get a full makeover, boosting her confidence enough that she manages to overcome her shyness and get Billy to talk to her. Wesley then abducts them and confiscates their phones, but Murphy uses a message written in lipstick to get a bystander to call 911, forcing him to ditch them and flee. Darnell, Max, and Jess track down Wesley, who gets run over by a truck while trying to escape, traumatizing Jess. A furious Dean forbids Murphy from seeing Chloe or him ever again. While smoking with Hank, Felix cuts a check to buy Guiding Hope after learning that the school is completely broke. Jules learns from the medical examiner that Wesley shot Tyson, but only after he was already dead.   \n |LineColor       = 006161\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Jessica Rabbit\n |DirectedBy      = [[Kyra Sedgwick]]\n |WrittenBy       = Eric Randall\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|5|23}}\n |Viewers         = 0.60<ref name=\"1.08\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-may-23-2019/|title='This Is Farah Fawcett,' 'Elementary,' all others hold: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=May 24, 2019|accessdate=May 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524204802/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-may-23-2019/|archive-date=May 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Max insists that Murphy spend the night at his apartment, and Dean tries to reconnect with her after his fury settles. The man who struck Wesley identifies Jess as having witnessed his death to the police; Darnell and Max agree to help her by cleaning her car of Wesley's DNA, but worry that Jess' trauma and poor ability to lie will expose them. Felix assumes ownership of the school despite Joy refusing to sign on to the deal. Jess, feeling that Vanessa does not understand or appreciate her feelings, turns away from her. Darnell advises Jess to use emotional manipulation to throw off the cops, which allows her to pass questioning unscathed. When Vanessa fails to show up for a makeup date, however, she winds up cheating on her with a girl at the bar and decides to hide it.

Felix informs Murphy that from now on, she'll be expected to work like everyone else. He also shows off a new watch--the same watch Wesley owned and that Murphy tried to dispose of.
