A strong speaker, he became popular in trade union circles for his denunciation of capitalism as unethical and his promise of a socialist utopia.  He was the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], a position he held in 1924 and again between 1929 and 1931. He broke with Labour policy in 1931, and was expelled from the party and excoriated as a [[turncoat]], as the Party was overwhelmingly crushed that year by the [[National Government (1931)|National Government]] coalition that Snowden supported. He was succeeded as Chancellor by [[Neville Chamberlain]].\n\n==Early life: 1864\u20131906==\nSnowden was born in [[Cowling, Craven|Cowling]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. His father John Snowden had been a weaver and a supporter of [[Chartism]], and later a [[Gladstonian liberalism|Gladstonian liberal]]. Snowden later wrote in his autobiography: \"I was brought up in this [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|Radical]] atmosphere, and it was then that I imbibed the political and social principles which I have held fundamentally ever since\".<ref>Philip, Viscount Snowden, ''An Autobiography. Volume One. 1864-1919'' (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, 1934), p. 19.</ref> Although his parents and sisters were involved in weaving at the Ickornshaw Mill, he did not join them; after attending a local board school (where he received additional lessons in French and Latin from the schoolmaster) he stayed on as a pupil-teacher.<ref name=\"obit\" /> When he was 15 he became an insurance office clerk in Burnley.<ref name=\"obit\" /> During his seven years as a clerk, he studied and then passed the civil service entry examination; in 1886, he was appointed to a junior position at the [[HM Excise|Excise Office]] in Liverpool.<ref name=\"obit\" /> Snowden moved on to other posts around Scotland and then to [[Devon]].<ref name=\"obit\" />\n\nIn August 1891, when he was aged 27, Snowden severely injured his back in a cycling accident in Devon and was paralyzed from the waist down.<ref name=\"obit\">\"Lord Snowden.\" Times [London, England] 17 May 1937: 15.

In 1893, in the aftermath of the formation of the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) in neighboring [[Bradford]], he was asked to give a speech for the Cowling Liberal Club on the dangers of socialism. Whilst researching the subject, Snowden instead became convinced by the ideology. He eventually joined the executive committee of the [[Keighley]] ILP in 1899, and went on to chair the ILP from 1903 to 1906. He became a prominent speaker for the party, and wrote a popular [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] pamphlet with [[Keir Hardie]] in 1903, entitled ''The Christ that is to Be''. His strident rhetoric, well-laced with statistics and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] themes, contrasted the evil conditions under capitalism with the moral and economic utopia of future socialism. He condemned as \"bloodsuckers and parasites\" local textile company executives. In 1898, he launched the ''Keighley Labour Journal'', using it to denounce waste, pettiness, and corruption. However, he ignored the concerns of the trade unions, which he judged to be conservative and fixated on wages.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> By 1902, he had moved his base to [[Leeds]] and toured Britain as a lecturer on politics and corruption, with his own syndicated column and short essays in numerous working class outlets. By the time he was elected [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn]] in 1906, he had become a well-known socialist figure, standing at the national level alongside both Keir Hardie, [[Arnold Lupton|Professor Arnold Lupton]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" /><ref>Millman, Brock, ''Domestic Dissent in First World War Britain'', 2000, page 186.</ref>\n\nSnowden married [[Ethel Snowden|Ethel Annakin]], a campaigner for [[women's suffrage]], in 1905.

He even devised his own \"Socialist budget\" to rival [[David Lloyd George]]'s 1909 \"[[People's Budget]]\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nSnowden was in Australia on a worldwide lecture tour when the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in August 1914; he did not return to Britain until February 1915. He was not a pacifist; however, he did not support recruiting for the armed forces, and he campaigned against conscription. His stance was unpopular with the public and he lost his seat in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. In 1922, he was elected to represent [[Colne Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Colne Valley]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1924==\nUpon Ramsay MacDonald's appointment as Prime Minister in January 1924, Snowden was appointed as the Labour Party's first ever [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32901 |date=25 January 1924 |page=770 }}</ref> and sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32901 |date=25 January 1924 |page=769 }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=13992 |date=29 January 1924 |page=147 |city=e }}</ref>\n\nIn his budget, Snowden lowered the duties on tea, coffee, cocoa, chicory and sugar; reduced spending on armaments; and provided money for council housing. However, he did not implement the [[capital levy]]. Snowden claimed that because of the lowering of duties on foodstuffs consumed by the working class, the budget went \"far to realize the cherished radical idea of a [[free breakfast table]]\".<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,718325-1,00.html ''Time'', Labor's Budget, 12 May 1924]</ref> He profoundly believed in the morality of the balanced budget, with rigorous economy and not a penny wasted. He grasped how serious unemployment was becoming, but differed with the rising belief in [[deficit spending]] as a way to combat it. [[A. J. P. Taylor]] said his budget \"would have delighted the heart of Gladstone\".<ref>Taylor, ''English History, 1914-1945'', p. 212.</ref>\n\nIn his first budget, Snowden earmarked \u00a338 million for the reduction of food taxes, the introduction of pensions for widows, and a reduction in the pensionable age to 65. However, only the first of these measures was realized during the first Labour Government's time in office.<ref>''Foundations of the Welfare State'', 2nd Edition by [[Pat Thane]], published 1996</ref>\n\n==Opposition: 1924\u20131929==\nAlthough he had chaired the ILP for a second time, from 1917 to 1920, Snowden resigned from the party in 1927 because he believed it was \"drifting more and more away from...evolutionary socialism into revolutionary socialism\". He was also opposed to the new [[Keynesian]] economic ideas which provided a rationale for deficit spending, and criticized their expression in the Liberals' manifesto for the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 election]], titled ''We can Conquer Unemployment''.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1929\u20131931==\nSnowden was again appointed Chancellor after Labour formed a government in 1929, after emerging as the largest party in the general election.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33508 |date=21 June 1929 |page=4106 }}</ref> His economic philosophy was one of strict Gladstonian Liberalism rather than socialism. His official biographer wrote, \"He was raised in an atmosphere which regarded borrowing as an evil and [[free trade]] as an essential ingredient of prosperity\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Keith Laybourn|title=Philip Snowden: a biography : 1864-1937|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UakgAAAAMAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Temple Smith|page=97}}</ref>\n\nHe was considered by many at the time and later as being the principal opponent to the government following any radical economic policy to tackle the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] as well as blocking proposals to introduce [[Protectionism|protectionist]] tariffs. The government eventually collapsed over arguments about a budget deficit amidst refusals by a significant minority of ministers to enact cuts in unemployment benefit.<ref>Robert Skidelsky, ''Politicians and the Slump: The Labour Government of 1929-1931'' (1967)</ref>\n\nSnowden retained the position of Chancellor during the [[National Government (1931)|National Government]] of 1931. As a consequence he was expelled from the party, along with MacDonald and [[J. H. Thomas|Jimmy Thomas]]. In a BBC radio broadcast on 16 October 1931, he called Labour's policies \"Bolshevism run mad\" and contrasted them unfavorably with his own \"sane and evolutionary Socialism\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Kevin Jeffreys|title=Leading Labour: From Keir Hardie to Tony Blair|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCuC-mrnjZsC&pg=PA33|year=1999|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=33}}</ref> Snowden decided not to stand for parliament in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|election of November 1931]]. At that election, Labour's number of seats declined catastrophically from 288 to 52. It was during that year he had [[prostate gland]] surgery, following which his health and mobility declined.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nSkidelsky is representative of the Keynesians who have charged that Snowden and MacDonald were blinded by their economic philosophy that required balanced budgets, sound money, the gold standard and free trade, regardless of the damage that Keynesians thought it would do to the economy and the people.<ref>Skidelsky, ''Politicians and the Slump: The Labour Government of 1929-1931'' (1967)</ref> However, with the decline of Keynesianism as a model after 1968, historians have reevaluated Snowden in a more favorable light. McKibbin argues that the Labour government had very limited room to manoeuvre in 1929\u201331, and it did as well as could be expected; and that it handled the British economy better than most foreign governments handled theirs, and the [[Great Depression]] was less severe in Britain than elsewhere.<ref>Ross McKibbin, \"The Economic Policy of the Second Labour Government 1929-1931,\" ''Past & Present'' (1975) #68 pp. 95-123 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650274 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Later life: 1931\u20131937==\n[[File:Vera & Chaim Weizmann, Herbert Samuel, Lloyd George, Ethel Snowden, Philip Snowden.jpeg|thumb|210px|[[Vera Weizmann]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], [[Herbert Samuel]], [[Lloyd George]], [[Ethel Snowden]], and Philip Snowden]]\nIn the [[1931 Dissolution Honours]] he was raised to the peerage as '''Viscount Snowden''' of Ickornshaw, in the West Riding of the County of York,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33775 |date=27 November 1931 |page=7658 }}</ref> and served as [[Lord Privy Seal]] in the National government from 1931<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33772 |date=17 November 1931 |page=7409 }}</ref> to 1932, when he resigned in protest at the enactment of a full scheme of [[Imperial Preference]] and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] tariffs. That year, Snowden said there was never a greater mistake than to say that [[Cobdenism]] was dead: \"Cobdenism was never more alive throughout the world than it was to-day...To-day the ideas of Cobden were in revolt against selfish nationalism. The need for the breaking down of trade restrictions, which took various forms, was universally recognized even by those who were unable to throw off those shackles\".<ref>''The Times'' (8 July 1932), p. 9.</ref>\n\nHe subsequently wrote his ''Autobiography'' in which he strongly attacked MacDonald. In the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], Snowden supported the Keynesian economic program  proposed by Lloyd George (\"Lloyd George's New Deal\"), despite it being a complete repudiation of Snowden's own classical liberal fiscal policies. Snowden claimed that he was returning to long-held economic views, but that these had been \"temporarily inadvisable\" during the crisis of 1931, when \"national necessity\" demanded cutting public expenditure.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nLord Snowden died of a [[heart attack]] at his home, Eden Lodge, [[Tilford]], [[Surrey]] on 15 May 1937, aged 72. After cremation at [[Woking Crematorium]] his ashes were scattered on [[Cowling Moor]] near Ickornshaw.

A strong speaker, he became popular in trade union circles for his denunciation of capitalism as unethical and his promise of a socialist utopia.  He was the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], a position he held in 1924 and again between 1929 and 1931. He broke with Labour policy in 1931, and was expelled from the party and excoriated as a [[turncoat]], as the Party was overwhelmingly crushed that year by the [[National Government (1931)|National Government]] coalition that Snowden supported. He was succeeded as Chancellor by [[Neville Chamberlain]].\n\n==Early life: 1864\u20131906==\nSnowden was born in [[Cowling, Craven|Cowling]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. His father John Snowden had been a weaver and a supporter of [[Chartism]], and later a [[Gladstonian liberalism|Gladstonian liberal]]. Snowden later wrote in his autobiography: \"I was brought up in this [[Radicalism (historical)#United Kingdom|Radical]] atmosphere, and it was then that I imbibed the political and social principles which I have held fundamentally ever since\".<ref>Philip, Viscount Snowden, ''An Autobiography. Volume One. 1864-1919'' (London: Ivor Nicholson and Watson, 1934), p. 19.</ref> Although his parents and sisters were involved in weaving at the Ickornshaw Mill, he did not join them; after attending a local board school (where he received additional lessons in French and Latin from the schoolmaster) he stayed on as a pupil-teacher.<ref name=\"obit\" /> When he was 15 he became an insurance office clerk in Burnley.<ref name=\"obit\" /> During his seven years as a clerk, he studied and then passed the civil service entry examination; in 1886, he was appointed to a junior position at the [[HM Excise|Excise Office]] in Liverpool.<ref name=\"obit\" /> Snowden moved on to other posts around Scotland and then to [[Devon]].<ref name=\"obit\" />\n\nIn August 1891, when he was aged 27, Snowden severely injured his back in a cycling accident in Devon and was paralyzed from the waist down.<ref name=\"obit\">\"Lord Snowden.\" Times [London, England] 17 May 1937: 15.

In 1893, in the aftermath of the formation of the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) in neighboring [[Bradford]], he was asked to give a speech for the Cowling Liberal Club on the dangers of socialism. Whilst researching the subject, Snowden instead became convinced by the ideology. He eventually joined the executive committee of the [[Keighley]] ILP in 1899, and went on to chair the ILP from 1903 to 1906. He became a prominent speaker for the party, and wrote a popular [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] pamphlet with [[Keir Hardie]] in 1903, entitled ''The Christ that is to Be''. His strident rhetoric, well-laced with statistics and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] themes, contrasted the evil conditions under capitalism with the moral and economic utopia of future socialism. He condemned as \"bloodsuckers and parasites\" local textile company executives. In 1898, he launched the ''Keighley Labour Journal'', using it to denounce waste, pettiness, and corruption. However, he ignored the concerns of the trade unions, which he judged to be conservative and fixated on wages.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> By 1902, he had moved his base to [[Leeds]] and toured Britain as a lecturer on politics and corruption, with his own syndicated column and short essays in numerous working class outlets. By the time he was elected [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn]] in 1906, he had become a well-known socialist figure, standing at the national level alongside both Keir Hardie, [[Arnold Lupton|Professor Arnold Lupton]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" /><ref>Millman, Brock, ''Domestic Dissent in First World War Britain'', 2000, page 186.</ref>\n\nSnowden married [[Ethel Snowden|Ethel Annakin]], a campaigner for [[women's suffrage]], in 1905.

He even devised his own \"Socialist budget\" to rival [[David Lloyd George]]'s 1909 \"[[People's Budget]]\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nSnowden was in Australia on a worldwide lecture tour when the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in August 1914; he did not return to Britain until February 1915. He was not a pacifist; however, he did not support recruiting for the armed forces, and he campaigned against conscription. His stance was unpopular with the public and he lost his seat in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]]. In 1922, he was elected to represent [[Colne Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Colne Valley]].<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1924==\nUpon Ramsay MacDonald's appointment as Prime Minister in January 1924, Snowden was appointed as the Labour Party's first ever [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32901 |date=25 January 1924 |page=770 }}</ref> and sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32901 |date=25 January 1924 |page=769 }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=13992 |date=29 January 1924 |page=147 |city=e }}</ref>\n\nIn his budget, Snowden lowered the duties on tea, coffee, cocoa, chicory and sugar; reduced spending on armaments; and provided money for council housing. However, he did not implement the [[capital levy]]. Snowden claimed that because of the lowering of duties on foodstuffs consumed by the working class, the budget went \"far to realize the cherished radical idea of a [[free breakfast table]]\".<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,718325-1,00.html ''Time'', Labor's Budget, 12 May 1924]</ref> He profoundly believed in the morality of the balanced budget, with rigorous economy and not a penny wasted. He grasped how serious unemployment was becoming, but differed with the rising belief in [[deficit spending]] as a way to combat it. [[A. J. P. Taylor]] said his budget \"would have delighted the heart of Gladstone\".<ref>Taylor, ''English History, 1914-1945'', p. 212.</ref>\n\nIn his first budget, Snowden earmarked \u00a338 million for the reduction of food taxes, the introduction of pensions for widows, and a reduction in the pensionable age to 65. However, only the first of these measures was realized during the first Labour Government's time in office.<ref>''Foundations of the Welfare State'', 2nd Edition by [[Pat Thane]], published 1996</ref>\n\n==Opposition: 1924\u20131929==\nAlthough he had chaired the ILP for a second time, from 1917 to 1920, Snowden resigned from the party in 1927 because he believed it was \"drifting more and more away from...evolutionary socialism into revolutionary socialism\". He was also opposed to the new [[Keynesian]] economic ideas which provided a rationale for deficit spending, and criticized their expression in the Liberals' manifesto for the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 election]], titled ''We can Conquer Unemployment''.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\n==Chancellor of the Exchequer: 1929\u20131931==\nSnowden was again appointed Chancellor after Labour formed a government in 1929, after emerging as the largest party in the general election.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33508 |date=21 June 1929 |page=4106 }}</ref> His economic philosophy was one of strict Gladstonian Liberalism rather than socialism. His official biographer wrote, \"He was raised in an atmosphere which regarded borrowing as an evil and [[free trade]] as an essential ingredient of prosperity\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Keith Laybourn|title=Philip Snowden: a biography : 1864-1937|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UakgAAAAMAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Temple Smith|page=97}}</ref>\n\nHe was considered by many at the time and later as being the principal opponent to the government following any radical economic policy to tackle the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]] as well as blocking proposals to introduce [[Protectionism|protectionist]] tariffs. The government eventually collapsed over arguments about a budget deficit amidst refusals by a significant minority of ministers to enact cuts in unemployment benefit.<ref>Robert Skidelsky, ''Politicians and the Slump: The Labour Government of 1929-1931'' (1967)</ref>\n\nSnowden retained the position of Chancellor during the [[National Government (1931)|National Government]] of 1931. As a consequence he was expelled from the party, along with MacDonald and [[J. H. Thomas|Jimmy Thomas]]. In a BBC radio broadcast on 16 October 1931, he called Labour's policies \"Bolshevism run mad\" and contrasted them unfavorably with his own \"sane and evolutionary Socialism\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Kevin Jeffreys|title=Leading Labour: From Keir Hardie to Tony Blair|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCuC-mrnjZsC&pg=PA33|year=1999|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=33}}</ref> Snowden decided not to stand for parliament in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|election of November 1931]]. At that election, Labour's number of seats declined catastrophically from 288 to 52. It was during that year he had [[prostate gland]] surgery, following which his health and mobility declined.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nSkidelsky is representative of the Keynesians who have charged that Snowden and MacDonald were blinded by their economic philosophy that required balanced budgets, sound money, the gold standard and free trade, regardless of the damage that Keynesians thought it would do to the economy and the people.<ref>Skidelsky, ''Politicians and the Slump: The Labour Government of 1929-1931'' (1967)</ref> However, with the decline of Keynesianism as a model after 1968, historians have reevaluated Snowden in a more favorable light. McKibbin argues that the Labour government had very limited room to manoeuvre in 1929-31, and it did as well as could be expected; and that it handled the British economy better than most foreign governments handled theirs, and the [[Great Depression]] was less severe in Britain than elsewhere.<ref>Ross McKibbin, \"The Economic Policy of the Second Labour Government 1929-1931,\" ''Past & Present'' (1975) #68 pp. 95-123 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/650274 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Later life: 1931\u20131937==\n[[File:Vera & Chaim Weizmann, Herbert Samuel, Lloyd George, Ethel Snowden, Philip Snowden.jpeg|thumb|210px|[[Vera Weizmann]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], [[Herbert Samuel]], [[Lloyd George]], [[Ethel Snowden]], and Philip Snowden]]\nIn the [[1931 Dissolution Honours]] he was raised to the peerage as '''Viscount Snowden''' of Ickornshaw, in the West Riding of the County of York,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33775 |date=27 November 1931 |page=7658 }}</ref> and served as [[Lord Privy Seal]] in the National government from 1931<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33772 |date=17 November 1931 |page=7409 }}</ref> to 1932, when he resigned in protest at the enactment of a full scheme of [[Imperial Preference]] and [[Protectionism|protectionist]] tariffs. That year, Snowden said there was never a greater mistake than to say that [[Cobdenism]] was dead: \"Cobdenism was never more alive throughout the world than it was to-day...To-day the ideas of Cobden were in revolt against selfish nationalism. The need for the breaking down of trade restrictions, which took various forms, was universally recognized even by those who were unable to throw off those shackles\".<ref>''The Times'' (8 July 1932), p. 9.</ref>\n\nHe subsequently wrote his ''Autobiography'' in which he strongly attacked MacDonald. In the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], Snowden supported the Keynesian economic program  proposed by Lloyd George (\"Lloyd George's New Deal\"), despite it being a complete repudiation of Snowden's own classical liberal fiscal policies. Snowden claimed that he was returning to long-held economic views, but that these had been \"temporarily inadvisable\" during the crisis of 1931, when \"national necessity\" demanded cutting public expenditure.<ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nLord Snowden died of a [[heart attack]] at his home, Eden Lodge, [[Tilford]], [[Surrey]] on 15 May 1937, aged 72. After cremation at [[Woking Crematorium]] his ashes were scattered on [[Cowling Moor]] near Ickornshaw.

E. Smith''', was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician and barrister who attained high office in the early 20th century, in particular as [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]]. He was a skilled [[orator]], noted for his staunch opposition to [[Irish nationalism]], his wit, pugnacious views, and hard living and drinking. He is perhaps best remembered today as [[Winston Churchill]]'s greatest personal and political friend until Birkenhead's death aged 58 from pneumonia caused by cirrhosis of the liver.\n\n==Early life and schooling==\nSmith was born at 38 Pilgrim Street, [[Birkenhead]] in [[Cheshire]], the eldest son and second of five surviving children of Frederick Smith (1845-1888) and Elizabeth (1842\u20131928), daughter of Edwin Taylor a rate collector, of Birkenhead.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.001.0001/odnb-9780192683120-e-36137</ref><ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Schuster |first=Claud |authorlink=Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster |year= |title=The Post Victorians: Lord Birkenhead |place= |publisher= |page=85}}{{clarify |reason=Who published this book, where and when? |date=March 2018}}</ref> His father had joined the family business as an estate agent, later becoming a barrister and local Tory politician.

He was the dominant figure of a group of Wadham contemporaries including the athlete [[C. B. Fry]], the future Liberal politician [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]], and the Liberal economist [[Francis Hirst]]. Between them they dominated both the rugby field and the [[Oxford Union Society]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref>\n\nSmith was already active in national politics as a Tory speaker in the [[1892 United Kingdom general election|July 1892 general election]]. Announced initially as his father's son, he spoke all over Lancashire, stirring up Orange opinion against the Liberal policy of [[Irish home rule]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref>\n\nHe obtained a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second Class]] in [[Honour Moderations|Classical Mods]] before switching to Law. He often debated against [[Hilaire Belloc]] at the Oxford Union, where a bust of him now stands, and became [[List of presidents of the Oxford Union|President]] in Trinity (summer) term 1894. By massive last-minute cramming he graduated with a first class BA degree in law in 1895.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref>\n\nTo his disappointment, he only obtained a Second in his [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] degree. In 1896 he won the [[Vinerian Scholarship|Vinerian law scholarship]] and was elected a fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] (1896\u20139), and also a lecturership at [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].<ref name=compeerage>{{cite book |title=The Complete Peerage, Volume XIII, Peerage Creations 1901\u20131938 |year=1940 |place= |publisher=St Catherine's Press |page=293}}</ref><ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref> The F.E.

A detachment of the [[Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch]] had been drafted in to reinforce the small [[Oxford City Police]] force against a large demonstration of University undergraduates. The Metropolitan police, who were unused to boisterous Oxford undergraduates, attacked them with batons, causing several serious injuries. The crowd unhorsed and trampled one policeman.<ref name=Rose>{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Geoff |year=1979 |title=A Pictorial History of the Oxford City Police |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford Publishing Co |isbn=0-86093-094-7 |page=5}}</ref> Smith took no part in the disorder, but was arrested when he tried to rescue his college servant, who was being manhandled by the police. Smith became the first prisoner in the police station in the new Town Hall. Before being locked in, Smith raised his hands for silence and declared \"I have great pleasure in declaring this cell open\". He was tried for obstructing the police in the lawful execution of their duty, but was found not guilty after defending himself in court.<ref name=\"Rose\" />\n\n==Career as a barrister==\nHaving eaten his dinners at [[Gray's Inn]] and passed his bar finals with distinction in the summer of 1899, Smith was [[called to the Bar]] and finally left [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and quickly built up a brilliant and lucrative practice on the [[Northern Circuit]], initially basing himself in [[Liverpool]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref>\n\nSmith married Margaret Eleanor Furneaux, daughter of classical scholar [[Henry Furneaux]], in April 1901 and they had three children, [[Eleanor Smith (writer)|Eleanor Smith]], [[Frederick Winston Furneaux-Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead|Frederick]] and [[Pamela Smith]].\n\nSmith rapidly acquired a reputation as a formidable [[advocate]], first in Liverpool and then, after his election to Parliament in 1906, in [[London]]. In 1907 he was asked to give an opinion on a proposed [[libel]] action by the [[Lever Brothers]] against newspapers owned by [[Lord Northcliffe]] concerning the latter's allegations of a conspiracy to raise the price of soap by means of a 'soap trust'. He checked into the [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]] and, after working all night reading a pile of papers nearly four feet thick and consuming a bottle of champagne and two dozen oysters, Smith wrote a one-sentence opinion: \"There is no [[defense (legal)|answer]] to this action in libel, and the damages must be enormous\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Johnson (writer) |title=The age of stout hearts, sharp swords \u2014 and fun |journal=The Spectator |place=London |date=15 March 2006 |url= http://www.spectator.co.uk/2006/04/the-age-of-stout-hearts-sharp-swords-and-fun/}}</ref><ref>Judgment in ''Cox v.

His spending was commensurate with this income even after he took less well-paid government positions in later years, something of which he would bitterly complain.\n\nIn one of the best-known cases in which Smith was involved he successfully defended [[Ethel le Neve]], mistress of [[Hawley Harvey Crippen]] (\"Dr Crippen\") against a charge of murder. Le Neve was accused of killing Crippen's wife. Crippen was tried separately and convicted.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\n[[File:Birkenhead by Spy0002.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>\"A Successful First Speech (\"[[Psalm 108|Moab is my Washpot]]\")\"<br>FE Smith MP depicted in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', January 1907</center>]]\nAmbitious to enter [[British House of Commons|Parliament]], Smith cultivated the local Tory [[Political boss|boss]] [[Archibald Salvidge]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref> He stood unsuccessfully in Liverpool, for [[Liverpool Scotland (UK Parliament constituency)|Scotland division]] in a by-election in 1903.<ref name=compeerage/><ref name=EB1922>{{Cite EB1922 |wstitle=Birkenhead, Frederick Edwin Smith, 1st Viscount |volume=30 |page=457}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Smith gave a dazzling speech in Liverpool in support of [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who was campaigning for [[Tariff Reform]]. On the strength of this, he was selected three months later as candidate for the working-class constituency of [[Liverpool Walton (UK Parliament constituency)|Walton division]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref> He stood, again unsuccessfully, for Walton in another by-election in 1905.<ref name=compeerage/><ref name=EB1922>{{Cite EB1922 |wstitle=Birkenhead, Frederick Edwin Smith, 1st Viscount |volume=30 |page=457}}</ref> He campaigned as the champion of hard-drinking, patriotic working men (Liberals tended to favour temperance and more pacific foreign policy) and in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 election]] he narrowly held the seat despite the national Liberal landslide. He held the seat until the redrawing of boundaries in 1918.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref>\n\nHe attracted attention by a brilliant [[maiden speech]], \"[[I warn the Government]]...\" After this speech, [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]], the Irish Nationalist, a master of parliamentary invective, sent Smith a note, \"I am old, and you are young, but you have beaten me at my own game.\" In his maiden speech he argued that advocating tariffs had not hurt the Tories at the recent election.<ref>Harris 2013, p.244</ref> Smith also opposed the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]] arguing that intimidatory picketing should not be allowed. The Conservative leadership, unwilling to antagonise organised labour, did not oppose the Act very hard.<ref>Harris 2013, p.244</ref>\n\nSmith did not support restriction on the powers of the [[House of Lords]], fearing that tyranny could result from an unchecked [[unicameral]] parliament.\n\nHe was soon a prominent leader of the [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionist]] wing of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], especially in the planned [[Ulster]] resistance to [[Irish Home Rule]]. He attended the Blenheim Palace rally on 27 July 1912, at which Bonar Law advocated forcible resistance. From the signing of the [[Ulster Covenant]] in September 1912 onwards, he was often on [[Edward Carson]]\u2019s side on horseback, hence the derisive nickname \u201cGalloper Smith\u201d.<ref>Harris 2013, pp.255-6</ref>\n\nA vociferous opponent of the [[Disestablishmentarianism|Disestablishment]] of the [[Church in Wales|Welsh part of the Church of England]], he called the [[Welsh Church Act 1914|Welsh Disestablishment Bill]] \"a bill which has shocked the conscience of every Christian community in Europe\". This prompted [[G. K. Chesterton]] to write a satirical poem, [[s:Antichrist, or the Reunion of Christendom: An Ode|''\u201cAntichrist, Or the Reunion of Christendom: An Ode\u201d'']], which asked if [[Brittany|Breton]] sailors, Russian peasants and Christians evicted by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] would know or care of what happened to the [[Church in Wales|Anglican Church of Wales]], and answered the question with the line \"Chuck it, Smith\". The bill was approved by Parliament under the provisions of the [[Parliament Act 1911]], but its implementation delayed by the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. When it was finally implemented in 1920, Smith was part of the [[Lloyd George Coalition Government|Lloyd George Coalition]] that did so.\n\n==First World War==\nSmith had joined the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] by commission into the [[Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars]], in which Churchill was already an officer, in 1913,<ref name=compeerage/> and was a [[Captain (British Army)|captain]] in the regiment<ref name=\"kelly\">{{cite book |title=Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes, 1930 |place= |publisher=Kelly's |page=239}}</ref> before the outbreak of the First World War. On its outbreak he was placed in charge of the Government's Press Bureau, with rank of full colonel and responsibility for newspaper censorship. He was not very successful in this role, and in 1914\u20131915 served in France as a staff officer with the [[Indian Corps]] with ultimate temporary rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]].<ref name=\"kelly\"/> He and his successor as 'recording officer' (a [[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]] Merewether) later collaborated on an official history entitled ''The Indian Corps in France'' (published 1917).<ref name=compeerage2>{{cite book |title=The Complete Peerage, Volume XIII |place= |publisher= |page=294}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1915, he was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] by [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.

Smith, newly created [[Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]], on his appointment as [[Lord Chancellor]]]]\nIn 1919, he was created '''Baron Birkenhead''', of Birkenhead in the County of Cheshire following his appointment as [[Lord Chancellor]] by [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31201|page=2735|date=25 February 1919}}</ref> At the age of 47, he was the youngest Lord Chancellor since [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Judge Jeffreys]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The ''[[Morning Post]]'' dismissed his appointment as \"carrying a joke beyond the limits of pleasantry\", while the [[George V|King]] urged Lloyd George to reconsider.{{sfn|Campbell|1991|p=460}} Birkenhead proved an excellent Lord Chancellor, but tales of his drunkenness begin from this time, very likely as he grew bored with the job and as it dawned on him that he had probably ruled himself out from the premiership by accepting a peerage.{{sfn|Harris|2013|pp=277-81}}\n\nThat year, in the House of Lords debate on the [[Amritsar Massacre]], he courageously denounced Tories who declared [[Reginald Dyer|General Dyer]] (the responsible officer) a hero.<ref name=odnb3>{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |volume=51 |page=117}}</ref> He played a key role in the passage of several key legal reforms, including the reform of English land law which was to come to fruition in [[Law of Property Act 1925|the mid-1920s]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} He also unsuccessfully championed a reform of the divorce laws, which he judged caused great misery and which favoured the wealthy.\n\nDespite his Unionist background, Smith played an important role in the negotiations that led to the signature of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1921, which led to the formation of the [[Irish Free State]] the following year.{{sfn|Harris|2013|pp=275}} Much of the treaty was drafted by Smith. His support for this, and his warm relations with the Irish nationalist leaders [[Arthur Griffith]] and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], angered some of his former Unionist associates, notably Sir Edward Carson. Upon signing the Treaty he remarked to Collins, \"I may have just signed my political death warrant\", to which Collins dryly and with prescient accuracy replied, \"I have just signed my actual death warrant\". Collins was killed by opponents of the treaty eight months after the signing, during the [[Irish Civil War]].{{sfn|Aitken|1963|pp=96\u2013123}}\n\nAlso in 1921, he was responsible for the [[House of Lords]] rejecting a proposal, put forward by [[Frederick Alexander Macquisten]], MP for [[Argyllshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Argyllshire]], to criminalise lesbianism. During the debate, Birkenhead argued that 999 women out of a thousand had \"never even heard a whisper of these practices\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Doan |first=Laura |title=Fashioning Sapphism: The Origins of a Modern English Lesbian Culture |url=https://archive.org/details/fashioningsapphi00doan |url-access=registration |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2001 |place=New York |isbn=0-231-11007-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fashioningsapphi00doan/page/56 56\u201360]}}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=UK |title=Commons Amdendment, HL Deb 15 August 1921 vol 43 cc567-77 |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1921/aug/15/commons-amendment-2#S5LV0043P0_19210815_HOL_114 |house=House of Lords |date=15 August 1921 |column=574 |speaker=The Lord Chancellor |position=574}}</ref>\n\nSmith was created '''Viscount Birkenhead''', of Birkenhead in the [[County of Chester]], in the [[1921 Birthday Honours]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32346 |date=4 June 1921 |page=4529 |supp=y}}</ref> then '''Viscount Furneaux''', of [[Charlton, Northamptonshire|Charlton]] in the [[County of Northampton]], and '''Earl of Birkenhead''' in 1922. By 1922 Birkenhead and Churchill had become the leading figures of the [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] Coalition. The [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the attempt to go to war with [[Turkey]] over [[Chanak Crisis|Chanak]] (which was later vetoed by the governments of the Dominions) and a general whiff of moral and financial corruption which had come to surround the Coalition were all hallmarks of his tenure in office.\n\nA scandal erupted in 1922 when it became known that Lloyd George, through the agency of [[Maundy Gregory]],<ref name=camp/> had awarded honours and titles such as a baronetcy to rich businessmen in return for cash in the range of \u00a310,000 and more.<ref>{{cite book |first=Travis L |last=Crosby |title=The Unknown David Lloyd George: A Statesman in Conflict |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MIW9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA330 |year=2014 |place= |publisher=IB Tauris |page=330 |isbn=978-1-78076-485-6}}</ref> At an earlier meeting before Parliament broke up for the summer, and more famously at the [[Carlton Club]] meeting in October 1922, Birkenhead's hectoring of the junior ministers and backbenchers was one of the factors leading to the withdrawal of support from the Coalition.{{sfn|Aitken|1963|pp=200\u2013203}}\n\n==Out of office: 1922-24==\nLike many of the senior members of the Coalition, Birkenhead did not hold office in the [[Bonar Law]] and Baldwin governments of 1922\u201324. Unlike the others Birkenhead was rude and open in his contempt for the new governments. He bore no grudge against Bonar Law but criticised [[Leslie Wilson (politician)|Leslie Wilson]] and Lord Curzon. He sneered that Wilson and Sir [[George Younger, 1st Viscount Younger of Leckie|George Younger]] were \"the cabin boys\" who had taken over the ship, he referred to [[James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury|Lords Salisbury]] and [[Lord Selborne|Selborne]] as \"the [[Dolly Sisters]]\" after two starlets of the era and remarked that the new Cabinet was one of \"second-class brains\", to which came the reply from [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]]<ref>the quote is also sometimes attributed to Stanley Baldwin</ref> that this was better than \"second-class characters\". He remarked that he had lost the Woolsack but was still \u201ccaptain of [his] own soul\u201d to which a wag retorted that this was \u201ca small command of which no-one will want to deprive him\u201d.<ref>Harris 2013 pp.286-7</ref>\n\nIn the House of Lords he accused the Foreign Secretary [[Lord Curzon]] (who had deserted the Coalition in its final hours and thus retained his office under [[Bonar Law]]) of making unauthorised promises of support to [[Greece]] in her [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|war against Turkey]]; he was forced to apologise when Curzon produced the key documents which he had circulated to the Cabinet, and which Birkenhead had initialled as read. [[Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston|Lady Curzon]] retaliated by [[Cut (etiquette)|cutting]] Birkenhead at a ball, but as she remarked to her husband in a letter, he was \"too drunk to notice\" the snub.\n\nIn May 1923, [[Stanley Baldwin]] succeeded Bonar Law as Prime Minister. He remarked to his new Cabinet, referring to Birkenhead's exclusion, that they were \u201ca Cabinet of faithful husbands\u201d \u2013 this referred to Birkenhead's general character rather than simply his marital infidelities.<ref>Lloyd George and Robert Horne were also notorious womanisers - see their articles for details</ref><ref>Charmley 1993, p. 203</ref>\n\nEven a famous speech, the Rectorial Address to [[Glasgow University]] on 7 November 1923,<ref>\"Idealism in International Politics.\" Reprinted in: ''The Speeches of Lord Birkenhead.'' London, 1929. p. 204-217. According to Paul Johnson (''Heroes: From Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar to Churchill and de Gaulle.'' New York, 2007. p. 207), \"The speech was, in its own way, as sensational as his maiden, and required the same kind of courage.\"</ref> in which Birkenhead told undergraduates that the world still offered \"glittering prizes\" to those with \"stout hearts and sharp swords\", now seemed out of kilter with the less aggressive and more self-consciously moral style of politics advocated by the new generation of Conservative politicians such as Stanley Baldwin and [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Edward Wood]], the future Lord Halifax. Birkenhead regarded the [[League of Nations]] as idealistic nonsense, and thought that international relations should be guided by \u201cself-interest\u201d, lest Britain decline like [[Spanish Empire|Imperial Spain]].<ref>Charmley 1993, pp203-4</ref> Rather, he believed that the power of nations would still be determined by their military strength.<ref>Haris 2013, p.332</ref>\n\nBy this time Birkenhead was regarded with distaste by much of the grassroots Conservative Party. [[J. C. C. Davidson|J.C.C. Davidson]] reported back to [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|Central Office]] (18 November 1923) on his recent re-adoption as candidate for [[Hemel Hempstead (UK Parliament constituency)|Hemel Hempstead]] that many members were unwilling to support him without an assurance that he would not support Birkenhead's return to the Cabinet, lest this cost local votes at [[1923 United Kingdom general election|the upcoming election]]. He commented that this was proof that Puritanism was deep in the English blood, and not just in that of Nonconformist chapel-goers. [[Neville Chamberlain]] recorded in his diary (18 November 1923) that Birkenhead had \u201cso often and so deeply shocked the moral sense of the country by his drunkenness and loose living character that our Govt which rests largely on public confidence in our character would be seriously tarnished by association with such a man\u201d.<ref>Charmley 1993, pp203-4 </ref>\n\n==Secretary of State for India: 1924-28==\nAfter the December 1923 General Election, at which Baldwin lost his majority and a hung Parliament was returned, Birkenhead briefly intrigued for another Lloyd George coalition government. In order to discourage them from associating with Lloyd George, Baldwin quickly invited former coalitionists Austen Chamberlain, Birkenhead and Balfour to join the Shadow Cabinet.<ref>Harris 2013, pp.301-2</ref> Birkenhead persuaded his friend Churchill to stand (unsuccessfully, as an independent \u201cConstitutionalist\u201d) in the March [[1924 Westminster Abbey by-election]]. This was part of Churchill's move back towards rejoining the Conservative Party.<ref>Harris 2013, p.303</ref>.\n\nA 1924 entry in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s diary states that an English High Court judge, presiding in a [[sodomy]] case, sought advice on sentencing from Lord Birkenhead. \"Could you tell me,\" he asked, \"what do you think one ought to give a man who allows himself to be buggered?\" Birkenhead replied without hesitation, \"Oh, thirty shillings or two pounds; whatever you happen to have on you.\"<ref>Cited in ''[[The Times]]'' 23 May 2006, Law supplement p.7</ref>\n\nDespite winning a large majority at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]], Baldwin formed a broad new (second) government by appointing former coalitionists such as Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain and former Liberal Winston Churchill to senior Cabinet posts; this was to discourage them from associating with Lloyd George to revive the 1916-22 Coalition.<ref>Charmley 1993, pp. 202-3</ref> Birkenhead and Chamberlain lobbied Baldwin to reappoint another former coalitionist, [[Robert Horne, 1st Viscount Horne of Slamannan|Robert Horne]], to the Exchequer, but Baldwin refused and appointed Churchill instead.<ref>Charmley 1993, p. 200</ref> \n\nFrom 1924 to 1928 Birkenhead served as [[Secretary of State for India]]. His views on pre-partition India's independence movement were gloomy. He thought India's Hindu-Muslim religious divide insurmountable and sought to block advances in native participation in provincial governments that had been granted by the 1919 [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]]. His parliamentary private secretary recalled much time ostensibly on India Office business seemed to be spent playing [[golf]].<ref name=odnb2>{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |volume=51 |page=118}}</ref>\n\nBirkenhead endorsed his old political opponent [[H.H. Asquith]], rather than his Cabinet colleague [[George Cave, 1st Viscount Cave|Lord Cave]], in the [[1925 University of Oxford Chancellor election]]. He wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' on 19 May, describing Asquith as the \u201cgreatest living Oxonian\u201d, but his support may have done more harm than good, because of his association with the discredited Lloyd George Coalition, and because of his open scepticism both of religion and of the League of Nations. It was quipped that Asquith was \u201ca [[Bed warmer|warming-pan]]\u201d for Birkenhead's views (a learned Oxford joke, referring to the legend that the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]] had been an impostor baby rather than a rightful heir to the throne). Lord Cave was elected.<ref>Koss 1985, pp. 274-275</ref>\n\nHe was engaged outside the office in negotiating for the government with the [[Trades Union Congress]] to try to avert the [[1926 General Strike]] and he strongly supported the 1927 [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927|Trades Disputes Act]] which required union members to contract into the political levies.<ref name=odnb2/> It was in his government role that in October 1927 he unveiled the [[Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial]] to Indian Army soldiers of no known grave killed on the Western Front in the 1914\u201318 War.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/144000/NEUVE%20CHAPELLE%20MEMORIAL |title=Neuve-Chapelle Memorial |publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|CWGC]] |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nLord Cave resigned as Lord Chancellor early in 1928. Birkenhead apparently did not want to return to his old job, but neither did Baldwin offer it to him. According to Neville Chamberlain's diary (28 March 1928), this was because \u201che might be seen drunk in the street\u201d ([[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Lord Hailsham]] was appointed instead).<ref>Charmley 1993, pp. 232-3</ref> Birkenhead retired from the Cabinet in October 1928 to make money in business.<ref>Charmley p.234</ref>\n\n==Later life and assessments==\nBirkenhead's increasingly pompous oratory caused [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] to caricature him in the 1920s as \"Lord Burstinghead\".<ref name=odnb3/> After retiring from politics, he became Rector of the [[University of Aberdeen]], a director of [[Tate & Lyle]],{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} a director of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]],<ref name=camp/> and [[High Steward (academia)|High Steward]] of the [[University of Oxford]]. In a 1983 biography review, William Camp \u2014 who had written a 1960 biography of the man \u2014 opined that \"F.E. was the quintessential male chauvinist who, almost with his dying breath, dragged himself to the Lords in July 1930 to attack the right of peeresses to take their seats.\"<ref name=camp>{{cite news |url= http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/26th-november-1983/26/that-crooked-charmer-smith |title=That crooked charmer, Smith |newspaper=The Spectator |date=26 Nov 1983 |page=26}}</ref>\n\nBirkenhead wrote a series of articles (later republished in ''Last Essays'': 1930) about \"the peril to India\", in which he criticised the Indian Nationalist leaders as \"a collection ... of very inferior [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerenskis]]\" and asserted that it was widely accepted that without British rule India would collapse into anarchy. He attacked the [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Irwin Declaration]] as \"so ambiguous that it is impossible to select from it any clear and unambiguous proposal\".<ref>Charmley 1993, p.245</ref>\n\nIn the opinion of [[Winston Churchill]], who was a friend: \"He had all the canine virtues in a remarkable degree \u2013 courage, fidelity, vigilance, love of chase.\" As for [[Margot Asquith]], who was not a friend, she thought: \"F. E. Smith is very clever, but sometimes his brains go to his head.\" Of Birkenhead's loyalty, Churchill added: \"If he was with you on Monday, he would be the same on Tuesday. And on Thursday, when things looked blue, he would still be marching forward with strong reinforcements.\"\n\n[[Gilbert Frankau]] recalled in his own autobiography ''Self Portrait'', that in 1928 [[Thomas Horder, 1st Baron Horder|Sir Thomas Horder]] confided: \"Birkenhead's pure eighteenth-century. He belongs to the days of [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] and [[William Pitt the younger|Pitt]]. Physically, he has all the strength of our best yeoman stock. Mentally, he's a colossus. But he'll tear himself to pieces by the time he's sixty.\"<ref name=frankau>{{cite book |last=Frankau |first=Gilbert |title=Self Portrait, A Novel of His Own Life |year=1941 |place= |publisher=The Book Club |pages=262\u2013263}}</ref>\n\nBirkenhead died in London aged 58 from [[pneumonia]] caused by [[cirrhosis of the liver]]. After cremation at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], his ashes were buried in the parish churchyard at [[Charlton, Northamptonshire]].<ref name=\"odnb2\"/>\n\n===Commemoration===\nAs \"Lord Birkenhead\", he is dramatised in the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', as an official of the [[British Olympic Committee]].

E. Smith''', was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician and barrister who attained high office in the early 20th century, in particular as [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain]]. He was a skilled [[orator]], noted for his staunch opposition to [[Irish nationalism]], his wit, pugnacious views, and hard living and drinking. He is perhaps best remembered today as [[Winston Churchill]]'s greatest personal and political friend until Birkenhead's death aged 58 from pneumonia caused by cirrhosis of the liver.\n\n==Early life and schooling==\nSmith was born at 38 Pilgrim Street, [[Birkenhead]] in [[Cheshire]], the eldest son and second of five surviving children of Frederick Smith (1845-1888) and Elizabeth (1842\u20131928), daughter of Edwin Taylor a rate collector, of Birkenhead.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/odnb/9780192683120.001.0001/odnb-9780192683120-e-36137</ref><ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Schuster |first=Claud |authorlink=Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster |year= |title=The Post Victorians: Lord Birkenhead |place= |publisher= |page=85}}{{clarify |reason=Who published this book, where and when? |date=March 2018}}</ref> His father had joined the family business as an estate agent, later becoming a barrister and local Tory politician.

He was the dominant figure of a group of Wadham contemporaries including the athlete [[C. B.

A detachment of the [[Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch]] had been drafted in to reinforce the small [[Oxford City Police]] force against a large demonstration of University undergraduates. The Metropolitan police, who were unused to boisterous Oxford undergraduates, attacked them with batons, causing several serious injuries. The crowd unhorsed and trampled one policeman.<ref name=Rose>{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Geoff |year=1979 |title=A Pictorial History of the Oxford City Police |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford Publishing Co |isbn=0-86093-094-7 |page=5}}</ref> Smith took no part in the disorder, but was arrested when he tried to rescue his college servant, who was being manhandled by the police. Smith became the first prisoner in the police station in the new Town Hall. Before being locked in, Smith raised his hands for silence and declared \"I have great pleasure in declaring this cell open\". He was tried for obstructing the police in the lawful execution of their duty, but was found not guilty after defending himself in court.<ref name=\"Rose\" />\n\n==Career as a barrister==\nHaving eaten his dinners at [[Gray's Inn]] and passed his bar finals with distinction in the summer of 1899, Smith was [[called to the Bar]] and finally left [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and quickly built up a brilliant and lucrative practice on the [[Northern Circuit]], initially basing himself in [[Liverpool]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref>\n\nSmith married Margaret Eleanor Furneaux, daughter of classical scholar [[Henry Furneaux]], in April 1901 and they had three children, [[Eleanor Smith (writer)|Eleanor Smith]], [[Frederick Winston Furneaux-Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead|Frederick]] and [[Pamela Smith]].\n\nSmith rapidly acquired a reputation as a formidable [[advocate]], first in Liverpool and then, after his election to Parliament in 1906, in [[London]]. In 1907 he was asked to give an opinion on a proposed [[libel]] action by the [[Lever Brothers]] against newspapers owned by [[Lord Northcliffe]] concerning the latter's allegations of a conspiracy to raise the price of soap by means of a 'soap trust'. He checked into the [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]] and, after working all night reading a pile of papers nearly four feet thick and consuming a bottle of champagne and two dozen oysters, Smith wrote a one-sentence opinion: \"There is no [[defense (legal)|answer]] to this action in libel, and the damages must be enormous\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Johnson (writer) |title=The age of stout hearts, sharp swords \u2014 and fun |journal=The Spectator |place=London |date=15 March 2006 |url= http://www.spectator.co.uk/2006/04/the-age-of-stout-hearts-sharp-swords-and-fun/}}</ref><ref>Judgment in ''Cox v.

His spending was commensurate with this income even after he took less well-paid government positions in later years, something of which he would bitterly complain.\n\nIn one of the best-known cases in which Smith was involved he successfully defended [[Ethel le Neve]], mistress of [[Hawley Harvey Crippen]] (\"Dr Crippen\") against a charge of murder. Le Neve was accused of killing Crippen's wife. Crippen was tried separately and convicted.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\n[[File:Birkenhead by Spy0002.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>\"A Successful First Speech (\"[[Psalm 108|Moab is my Washpot]]\")\"<br>FE Smith MP depicted in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', January 1907</center>]]\nAmbitious to enter [[British House of Commons|Parliament]], Smith cultivated the local Tory [[Political boss|boss]] [[Archibald Salvidge]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id = 36137|title = Smith, Frederick Edwin, first earl of Birkenhead (1872\u20131930)|first = John|last = Campbell|authorlink = John Campbell (biographer)}}</ref> He stood unsuccessfully in Liverpool, for [[Liverpool Scotland (UK Parliament constituency)|Scotland division]] in a by-election in 1903.<ref name=compeerage/><ref name=EB1922>{{Cite EB1922 |wstitle=Birkenhead, Frederick Edwin Smith, 1st Viscount |volume=30 |page=457}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Smith gave a dazzling speech in Liverpool in support of [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who was campaigning for [[Tariff Reform]].

The Conservative leadership, unwilling to antagonise organised labour, did not oppose the Act very hard.<ref>Harris 2013, p.244</ref>\n\nSmith did not support restriction on the powers of the [[House of Lords]], fearing that tyranny could result from an unchecked [[unicameral]] parliament.\n\nHe was soon a prominent leader of the [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionist]] wing of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], especially in the planned [[Ulster]] resistance to [[Irish Home Rule]]. He attended the Blenheim Palace rally on 27 July 1912, at which Bonar Law advocated forcible resistance. From the signing of the [[Ulster Covenant]] in September 1912 onwards, he was often on [[Edward Carson]]\u2019s side on horseback, hence the derisive nickname \u201cGalloper Smith\u201d.<ref>Harris 2013, pp.255-6</ref>\n\nA vociferous opponent of the [[Disestablishmentarianism|Disestablishment]] of the [[Church in Wales|Welsh part of the Church of England]], he called the [[Welsh Church Act 1914|Welsh Disestablishment Bill]] \"a bill which has shocked the conscience of every Christian community in Europe\". This prompted [[G. K. Chesterton]] to write a satirical poem, [[s:Antichrist, or the Reunion of Christendom: An Ode|''\u201cAntichrist, Or the Reunion of Christendom: An Ode\u201d'']], which asked if [[Brittany|Breton]] sailors, Russian peasants and Christians evicted by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] would know or care of what happened to the [[Church in Wales|Anglican Church of Wales]], and answered the question with the line \"Chuck it, Smith\". The bill was approved by Parliament under the provisions of the [[Parliament Act 1911]], but its implementation delayed by the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. When it was finally implemented in 1920, Smith was part of the [[Lloyd George Coalition Government|Lloyd George Coalition]] that did so.\n\n==First World War==\nSmith had joined the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] by commission into the [[Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars]], in which Churchill was already an officer, in 1913,<ref name=compeerage/> and was a [[Captain (British Army)|captain]] in the regiment<ref name=\"kelly\">{{cite book |title=Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes, 1930 |place= |publisher=Kelly's |page=239}}</ref> before the outbreak of the First World War. On its outbreak he was placed in charge of the Government's Press Bureau, with rank of full colonel and responsibility for newspaper censorship. He was not very successful in this role, and in 1914\u20131915 served in France as a staff officer with the [[Indian Corps]] with ultimate temporary rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-colonel]].<ref name=\"kelly\"/> He and his successor as 'recording officer' (a [[Colonel (British Army)|Colonel]] Merewether) later collaborated on an official history entitled ''The Indian Corps in France'' (published 1917).<ref name=compeerage2>{{cite book |title=The Complete Peerage, Volume XIII |place= |publisher= |page=294}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1915, he was appointed [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] by [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.

His support for this, and his warm relations with the Irish nationalist leaders [[Arthur Griffith]] and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], angered some of his former Unionist associates, notably Sir Edward Carson. Upon signing the Treaty he remarked to Collins, \"I may have just signed my political death warrant\", to which Collins dryly and with prescient accuracy replied, \"I have just signed my actual death warrant\".

He sneered that Wilson and Sir [[George Younger, 1st Viscount Younger of Leckie|George Younger]] were \"the cabin boys\" who had taken over the ship, he referred to [[James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury|Lords Salisbury]] and [[Lord Selborne|Selborne]] as \"the [[Dolly Sisters]]\" after two starlets of the era and remarked that the new Cabinet was one of \"second-class brains\", to which came the reply from [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]]<ref>the quote is also sometimes attributed to Stanley Baldwin</ref> that this was better than \"second-class characters\". He remarked that he had lost the Woolsack but was still \u201ccaptain of [his] own soul\u201d to which a wag retorted that this was \u201ca small command of which no-one will want to deprive him\u201d.<ref>Harris 2013 pp.286-7</ref>\n\nIn the House of Lords he accused the Foreign Secretary [[Lord Curzon]] (who had deserted the Coalition in its final hours and thus retained his office under [[Bonar Law]]) of making unauthorised promises of support to [[Greece]] in her [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|war against Turkey]]; he was forced to apologise when Curzon produced the key documents which he had circulated to the Cabinet, and which Birkenhead had initialled as read. [[Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston|Lady Curzon]] retaliated by [[Cut (etiquette)|cutting]] Birkenhead at a ball, but as she remarked to her husband in a letter, he was \"too drunk to notice\" the snub.\n\nIn May 1923, [[Stanley Baldwin]] succeeded Bonar Law as Prime Minister. He remarked to his new Cabinet, referring to Birkenhead\u2019s exclusion, that they were \u201ca Cabinet of faithful husbands\u201d \u2013 this referred to Birkenhead\u2019s general character rather than simply his marital infidelities.<ref>Lloyd George and Robert Horne were also notorious womanisers - see their articles for details</ref><ref>Charmley 1993, p. 203</ref>\n\nEven a famous speech, the Rectorial Address to [[Glasgow University]] on 7 November 1923,<ref>\"Idealism in International Politics.\" Reprinted in: ''The Speeches of Lord Birkenhead.'' London, 1929. p. 204-217. According to Paul Johnson (''Heroes: From Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar to Churchill and de Gaulle.'' New York, 2007. p. 207), \"The speech was, in its own way, as sensational as his maiden, and required the same kind of courage.\"</ref> in which Birkenhead told undergraduates that the world still offered \"glittering prizes\" to those with \"stout hearts and sharp swords\", now seemed out of kilter with the less aggressive and more self-consciously moral style of politics advocated by the new generation of Conservative politicians such as Stanley Baldwin and [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Edward Wood]], the future Lord Halifax. Birkenhead regarded the [[League of Nations]] as idealistic nonsense, and thought that international relations should be guided by \u201cself-interest\u201d, lest Britain decline like [[Spanish Empire|Imperial Spain]].<ref>Charmley 1993, pp203-4</ref> Rather, he believed that the power of nations would still be determined by their military strength.<ref>Haris 2013, p.332</ref>\n\nBy this time Birkenhead was regarded with distaste by much of the grassroots Conservative Party. [[J. C. C. Davidson|J.C.C. Davidson]] reported back to [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters|Central Office]] (18 November 1923) on his recent re-adoption as candidate for [[Hemel Hempstead (UK Parliament constituency)|Hemel Hempstead]] that many members were unwilling to support him without an assurance that he would not support Birkenhead\u2019s return to the Cabinet, lest this cost local votes at [[1923 United Kingdom general election|the upcoming election]]. He commented that this was proof that Puritanism was deep in the English blood, and not just in that of Nonconformist chapel-goers. [[Neville Chamberlain]] recorded in his diary (18 November 1923) that Birkenhead had \u201cso often and so deeply shocked the moral sense of the country by his drunkenness and loose living character that our Govt which rests largely on public confidence in our character would be seriously tarnished by association with such a man\u201d.<ref>Charmley 1993, pp203-4 </ref>\n\n==Secretary of State for India: 1924-28==\nAfter the December 1923 General Election, at which Baldwin lost his majority and a hung Parliament was returned, Birkenhead briefly intrigued for another Lloyd George coalition government. In order to discourage them from associating with Lloyd George, Baldwin quickly invited former coalitionists Austen Chamberlain, Birkenhead and Balfour to join the Shadow Cabinet.<ref>Harris 2013, pp.301-2</ref> Birkenhead persuaded his friend Churchill to stand (unsuccessfully, as an independent \u201cConstitutionalist\u201d) in the March [[1924 Westminster Abbey by-election]]. This was part of Churchill's move back towards rejoining the Conservative Party.<ref>Harris 2013, p.303</ref>.\n\nA 1924 entry in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s diary states that an English High Court judge, presiding in a [[sodomy]] case, sought advice on sentencing from Lord Birkenhead. \"Could you tell me,\" he asked, \"what do you think one ought to give a man who allows himself to be buggered?\" Birkenhead replied without hesitation, \"Oh, thirty shillings or two pounds; whatever you happen to have on you.\"<ref>Cited in ''[[The Times]]'' 23 May 2006, Law supplement p.7</ref>\n\nDespite winning a large majority at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]], Baldwin formed a broad new (second) government by appointing former coalitionists such as Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain and former Liberal Winston Churchill to senior Cabinet posts; this was to discourage them from associating with Lloyd George to revive the 1916-22 Coalition.<ref>Charmley 1993, pp. 202-3</ref> Birkenhead and Chamberlain lobbied Baldwin to reappoint another former coalitionist, [[Robert Horne, 1st Viscount Horne of Slamannan|Robert Horne]], to the Exchequer, but Baldwin refused and appointed Churchill instead.<ref>Charmley 1993, p. 200</ref> \n\nFrom 1924 to 1928 Birkenhead served as [[Secretary of State for India]]. His views on pre-partition India's independence movement were gloomy. He thought India's Hindu-Muslim religious divide insurmountable and sought to block advances in native participation in provincial governments that had been granted by the 1919 [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]]. His parliamentary private secretary recalled much time ostensibly on India Office business seemed to be spent playing [[golf]].<ref name=odnb2>{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |volume=51 |page=118}}</ref>\n\nBirkenhead endorsed his old political opponent [[H.H. Asquith]], rather than his Cabinet colleague [[George Cave, 1st Viscount Cave|Lord Cave]], in the [[1925 University of Oxford Chancellor election]]. He wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' on 19 May, describing Asquith as the \u201cgreatest living Oxonian\u201d, but his support may have done more harm than good, because of his association with the discredited Lloyd George Coalition, and because of his open scepticism both of religion and of the League of Nations. It was quipped that Asquith was \u201ca [[Bed warmer|warming-pan]]\u201d for Birkenhead\u2019s views (a learned Oxford joke, referring to the legend that the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]] had been an impostor baby rather than a rightful heir to the throne). Lord Cave was elected.<ref>Koss 1985, pp. 274-275</ref>\n\nHe was engaged outside the office in negotiating for the government with the [[Trades Union Congress]] to try to avert the [[1926 General Strike]] and he strongly supported the 1927 [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927|Trades Disputes Act]] which required union members to contract into the political levies.<ref name=odnb2/> It was in his government role that in October 1927 he unveiled the [[Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial]] to Indian Army soldiers of no known grave killed on the Western Front in the 1914\u201318 War.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/144000/NEUVE%20CHAPELLE%20MEMORIAL |title=Neuve-Chapelle Memorial |publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission|CWGC]] |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nLord Cave resigned as Lord Chancellor early in 1928. Birkenhead apparently did not want to return to his old job, but neither did Baldwin offer it to him. According to Neville Chamberlain\u2019s diary (28 March 1928), this was because \u201che might be seen drunk in the street\u201d ([[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Lord Hailsham]] was appointed instead).<ref>Charmley 1993, pp. 232-3</ref> Birkenhead retired from the Cabinet in October 1928 to make money in business.<ref>Charmley p.234</ref>\n\n==Later life and assessments==\nBirkenhead's increasingly pompous oratory caused [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] to caricature him in the 1920s as \"Lord Burstinghead\".<ref name=odnb3/> After retiring from politics, he became Rector of the [[University of Aberdeen]], a director of [[Tate & Lyle]],{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} a director of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]],<ref name=camp/> and [[High Steward (academia)|High Steward]] of the [[University of Oxford]]. In a 1983 biography review, William Camp \u2014 who had written a 1960 biography of the man \u2014 opined that \"F.E. was the quintessential male chauvinist who, almost with his dying breath, dragged himself to the Lords in July 1930 to attack the right of peeresses to take their seats.\"<ref name=camp>{{cite news |url= http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/26th-november-1983/26/that-crooked-charmer-smith |title=That crooked charmer, Smith |newspaper=The Spectator |date=26 Nov 1983 |page=26}}</ref>\n\nBirkenhead wrote a series of articles (later republished in ''Last Essays'': 1930) about \"the peril to India\", in which he criticised the Indian Nationalist leaders as \"a collection ... of very inferior [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerenskis]]\" and asserted that it was widely accepted that without British rule India would collapse into anarchy. He attacked the [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Irwin Declaration]] as \"so ambiguous that it is impossible to select from it any clear and unambiguous proposal\".<ref>Charmley 1993, p.245</ref>\n\nIn the opinion of [[Winston Churchill]], who was a friend: \"He had all the canine virtues in a remarkable degree \u2013 courage, fidelity, vigilance, love of chase.\" As for [[Margot Asquith]], who was not a friend, she thought: \"F. E. Smith is very clever, but sometimes his brains go to his head.\" Of Birkenhead's loyalty, Churchill added: \"If he was with you on Monday, he would be the same on Tuesday. And on Thursday, when things looked blue, he would still be marching forward with strong reinforcements.\"\n\n[[Gilbert Frankau]] recalled in his own autobiography ''Self Portrait'', that in 1928 [[Thomas Horder, 1st Baron Horder|Sir Thomas Horder]] confided: \"Birkenhead's pure eighteenth-century. He belongs to the days of [[Charles James Fox|Fox]] and [[William Pitt the younger|Pitt]]. Physically, he has all the strength of our best yeoman stock. Mentally, he's a colossus. But he'll tear himself to pieces by the time he's sixty.\"<ref name=frankau>{{cite book |last=Frankau |first=Gilbert |title=Self Portrait, A Novel of His Own Life |year=1941 |place= |publisher=The Book Club |pages=262\u2013263}}</ref>\n\nBirkenhead died in London aged 58 from [[pneumonia]] caused by [[cirrhosis of the liver]]. After cremation at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], his ashes were buried in the parish churchyard at [[Charlton, Northamptonshire]].<ref name=\"odnb2\"/>\n\n===Commemoration===\nAs \"Lord Birkenhead\", he is dramatised in the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', as an official of the [[British Olympic Committee]].

One apparent attempt to liquidate him in Poland was on the grounds of a \"death sentence\" to be carried out on the alleged orders of general [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].

On his return to London, he spent some time in the [[Dorchester Hotel]] in London's [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] recovering from his ordeal of the trip, which left him lame in one leg for the rest of his life, possibly due to the [[Polyneuritis]] brought on by the poison.

{"title_page": "Barnacle Geese Myth", "text_new": "[[File:From Topographia Hibernica British Library MS 13 B VIII.jpg|thumb|From Topographia Hibernica British Library MS 13 B VIII]] \nA [[myth]] about the origins of  the [[Barnacle goose]] is that the Barnacle Geese emerge fully formed from the common [[Barnacle]] (Cirripedia).<ref> Not to be confused with the [[Goose Barnacle]]</ref> The migration patterns of may birds including the Barnacle Geese were not fully known until the late 19th or early 20th centuries. <ref>There are three patterns of migration known. 1. Breeding in eastern [[Greenland]], wintering on the [[Hebrides]] of western [[Scotland]] and in western [[Ireland]], population about 40,000. 2. Breeding on [[Svalbard]],  wintering on the [[Solway Firth]] on the England/Scotland border,     population about 24,000. 3. Breeding on [[Novaya Zemlya]], wintering in the Netherlands, population about 130,000\n\nResearch published in  2019 suggests that due to climatic conditions, the migration patterns are changing. (See, Tombre, I M;\u00a0 Oudman, T;\u00a0 Shimmings, P; Griffin, L. 2019. 'Northward range expansion in spring staging barnacle geese is a response to climatic change \u2026\u2026', Global Change Biology: 1-14.) This may result on fewer geese wintering in Scotland.  It is not possible to estimate how many geese would have migrated to  Scotland in the sixteenth century.</ref> Early medieval accounts of migration often drew on popular myths to explain why some birds seemed to disappear and then reappear during the year. <ref>A similar situation arose with the common eel. (''Anguilla anguilla'') It is still unknown for certain these how eels breed.  It is assumed that they do so in the Sargasso Sea. Myths regarding eels have been part of the Irish tradition since the time of Gerald of Wales who is largely responsible for the propagation of the Barnacle Geese myth. See. McCarthy, T. Kieran. 2014.

He spent several months travelling around Britain. and recorded these travels in his book entitled \"''de Europa''\". A short section of the book is devoted to Scotland and Ireland.  He described James as \u201c ''\u2026 a sickly man weighed down by a fat punch ..''\u201d.

Bedesmen  were often given coal or peat to heat the rooms in their Hospital accommodation.  </ref> Continuing in this vein, he records the following story:\n\n''\" \u2026I \u2026 heard that in Scotland there was once a tree growing on the bank of a river which produced fruits shaped like ducks. <ref> There are differences in the original sources for this story.

Pirlo was usually deployed as a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying playmaker]] in [[Midfielder|midfield]] for both his club and national teams and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever exponents of this position due to his vision, ball control, technique, creativity and passing ability, as well as for being a [[Direct free kick|free-kick]] specialist.<ref name=\"Soccerlens.com\">{{cite web |url=http://soccerlens.com/born-again-how-the-deep-lying-midfielder-position-is-reviving-careers/32421/ |title=Born Again: How the Deep-Lying Midfielder Position is Reviving Careers |website=Soccerlens |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Andrea Pirlo Player Profile - ESPN FC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/11888/andrea-pirlo |title=Andrea Pirlo: Player Profile |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"A.C.

His promising performances led to a move to [[Inter Milan]] in 1998, but he struggled to gain playing time at his new club, and was sent on loan in 1999. Despite successful spells with [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] and a return to Brescia, Pirlo was still unable to break into Inter's starting line-up and was sold to cross-city rivals [[A.C. Milan]] in 2001. At Milan, manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] decided to transition Pirlo into a deep-lying playmaker to orchestrate the team's attacks. Pirlo excelled in his new role and soon developed into a world-class midfielder, and won a plethora of trophies, including two [[UEFA Champions League]]s, two [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, two [[Serie A]] titles, a [[FIFA Club World Cup]], a [[Supercoppa Italiana]], and a [[Coppa Italia]].<ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Andrea Pirlo\"/> After joining [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on a free transfer in 2011, who had gone trophyless since 2003, he added four more Serie A titles, which he won consecutively, as well as two Supercoppa Italiana titles, and a Coppa Italia. After playing in Italy for over 20 seasons, Pirlo joined [[Major League Soccer]] franchise [[New York City FC|New York City]] in 2015, helping the team to reach the playoffs in his second and third seasons before retiring in 2017.\n\nAt international level, Pirlo is the [[Italy national football team records#Appearances|fifth-most]] [[Cap (sports)|capped]] player in the history of the Italian national team with [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|116 caps]] between 2002 and 2015. He played for the Italian youth teams at [[Italy national under-15 football team|U15]], [[Italy national under-18 football team|U18]] and [[Italy national under-21 football team|U21]] level, [[Captain (association football)|captaining]] and leading the latter to victory in the [[2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] as the Golden Player and Top Scorer of the tournament. He joined the Italian senior team in September 2002 and captained the Olympic team to a bronze medal in the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2004 Olympics]]. Later, he was instrumental in the senior team's victory in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. He was named [[Man of the Match]] three times, including the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], more than any other player in the tournament, and ultimately won the Bronze Ball (awarded to the third best player of the tournament) also being elected to the [[FIFA World Cup 2006#All-star team|Team of the Tournament]]. He was also elected as part of the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA European Championship Teams of the Tournament#Poland and Ukraine 2012|Team of the Tournament]] after leading Italy to the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|final]], winning three Man of the Match awards in the process, the most of any player along with [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]]. He has also represented the Italian senior team at the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]] [[UEFA European Championships]], the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s and the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup|2009]] and [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013]] [[FIFA Confederations Cup]]s, finishing third in the latter edition in Brazil, where he was also elected to the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup#Awards|Team of the Tournament]].\n\nPirlo came in third, second, fourth and third twice more in the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics]] [[IFFHS World's Best Playmaker|World Playmaker of the Year]] awards in 2006, 2007, 2012, 2013 and 2015, respectively.<ref name=\"iffhs.de\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iffhs.de/?d847e4a95e99a54f84d85fe8f55005fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeecf8a3e12 |title=IFFHS |publisher=International Federation of Football History & Statistics |author=Ingo Faulhaber |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> He placed fourth in the [[UEFA Best Player in Europe Award#2011.E2.80.9312|2012 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award]]<ref name=\"uefa.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/uefa-best-player-award/news/newsid=1842518.html |title=Iniesta, Messi, Ronaldo up for Best Player Award |publisher=UEFA |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> and seventh in the [[UEFA Best Player in Europe Award#2014.E2.80.9315|2015]] edition.<ref name=\"Best Player in Europe\">{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2270699.html |title=Best Player in Europe: Messi, Ronaldo or Su\u00e1rez |publisher=UEFA |date=12 August 2015 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref> He placed seventh in the [[2007 FIFA World Player of the Year|2007 FIFA World Player]], fifth in the [[2007 Ballon d'Or]] and seventh in the [[2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or]] award.

Pirlo was usually deployed as a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying playmaker]] in [[Midfielder|midfield]] for both his club and national teams and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever exponents of this position due to his vision, ball control, technique, creativity and passing ability, as well as for being a [[Direct free kick|free-kick]] specialist.<ref name=\"Soccerlens.com\">{{cite web |url=http://soccerlens.com/born-again-how-the-deep-lying-midfielder-position-is-reviving-careers/32421/ |title=Born Again: How the Deep-Lying Midfielder Position is Reviving Careers |website=Soccerlens |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Andrea Pirlo Player Profile - ESPN FC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/11888/andrea-pirlo |title=Andrea Pirlo: Player Profile |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"A.C.

His promising performances led to a move to [[Inter Milan]] in 1998, but he struggled to gain playing time at his new club, and was sent on loan in 1999. Despite successful spells with [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] and a return to Brescia, Pirlo was still unable to break into Inter's starting line-up and was sold to cross-city rivals [[A.C. Milan]] in 2001. At Milan, manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] decided to transition Pirlo into a deep-lying playmaker to orchestrate the team's attacks. Pirlo excelled in his new role and soon developed into a world-class midfielder, and won a plethora of trophies, including two [[UEFA Champions League]]s, two [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, two [[Serie A]] titles, a [[FIFA Club World Cup]], a [[Supercoppa Italiana]], and a [[Coppa Italia]].<ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Andrea Pirlo\"/> After joining [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on a free transfer in 2011, who had gone trophyless since 2003, he added four more Serie A titles, which he won consecutively, as well as two Supercoppa Italiana titles, and a Coppa Italia. After playing in Italy for over 20 seasons, Pirlo joined [[Major League Soccer]] franchise [[New York City FC|New York City]] in 2015, helping the team to reach the playoffs in his second and third seasons before retiring in 2017.\n\nAt international level, Pirlo is the [[Italy national football team records#Appearances|fifth-most]] [[Cap (sports)|capped]] player in the history of the Italian national team with [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|116 caps]] between 2002 and 2015. He played for the Italian youth teams at [[Italy national under-15 football team|U15]], [[Italy national under-18 football team|U18]] and [[Italy national under-21 football team|U21]] level, [[Captain (association football)|captaining]] and leading the latter to victory in the [[2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] as the Golden Player and Top Scorer of the tournament. He joined the Italian senior team in September 2002 and captained the Olympic team to a bronze medal in the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2004 Olympics]]. Later, he was instrumental in the senior team's victory in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. He was named [[Man of the Match]] three times, including the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], more than any other player in the tournament, and ultimately won the Bronze Ball (awarded to the third best player of the tournament) also being elected to the [[FIFA World Cup 2006#All-star team|Team of the Tournament]]. He was also elected as part of the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA European Championship Teams of the Tournament#Poland and Ukraine 2012|Team of the Tournament]] after leading Italy to the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|final]], winning three Man of the Match awards in the process, the most of any player along with [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]].

Although Pirlo was able to set up some goal scoring opportunities and did test the opposition goalkeepers with some dangerous free kicks in the final two group games, his performances were stifled by the defensive pressure of the opposition, and he was much less dominant than he had been in the opening match against England.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> Although he had previously communicated his intention to retire after the World Cup, he stated, upon his return to Italy, that he would still be available to play for the national team.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lastampa.it/2014/06/26/multimedia/sport/speciali/mondiali-di-calcio-2014/pirlo-se-nuovo-ct-vuole-resto-in-azzurro-p4ngsgr3LEONR7gDzvmyyH/pagina.html |title=Pirlo: Se il nuovo ct vuole resto in azzurro |newspaper=La Stampa |language=Italian |date=26 June 2014 |accessdate=26 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627045930/http://lastampa.it/2014/06/26/multimedia/sport/speciali/mondiali-di-calcio-2014/pirlo-se-nuovo-ct-vuole-resto-in-azzurro-p4ngsgr3LEONR7gDzvmyyH/pagina.html |archive-date=27 June 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Euro 2016===\n[[File:20150616 - Portugal - Italie - Gen\u00e8ve - Andra Pirlo.jpg|thumb|right|Pirlo playing for Italy in 2015]]\n\nDespite previously announcing his international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Conte, Pirlo returned to the Italian squad.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2222260-andrea-pirlo-returns-to-italy-squad-following-giacomo-bonaventuras-injury |title=Andrea Pirlo Returns to Italy Squad Following Giacomo Bonaventura's Injury |date=6 October 2014 |website=Bleacher Report |publisher=Turner |accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016 qualifying match]], which ended in a 2\u20131 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://it.sports.yahoo.com/notizie/qualificazioni-euro-2016-pirlo-supera-zoff-113-presenze-192340449--sow.html |title=Qualificazioni Euro 2016 \u2013 Pirlo supera Zoff: 113 presenze in Nazionale |publisher=Eurosport |language=Italian |date=10 October 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119234823/https://it.sports.yahoo.com/notizie/qualificazioni-euro-2016-pirlo-supera-zoff-113-presenze-192340449--sow.html |archivedate=19 November 2015}}</ref> Pirlo assisted [[Giorgio Chiellini|Chiellini's]] first goal of the match from a corner kick.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2014/10/10/5173062/pirlo-shows-he-is-too-good-to-retire-as-chiellini-rescues |title=Pirlo shows he is too good to retire as Chiellini rescues Italy |website=Goal.com |date=10 October 2014 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1\u20130 home victory over [[Malta national football team|Malta]] on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.football-italia.net/72474/verratti-and-pirlo-against-malta |title=Verratti and Pirlo against Malta? |website=Football Italia |publisher=Tiro Media |date=2 September 2015 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/italy-keep-pace-euro-qualification-lackluster-win-malta-1-0-graziano-pelle-match-report-090315 |title=Italy keep pace in Euro Qualifying after lackluster win over Malta |publisher=Fox Sports |date=3 September 2015 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> this was his final international appearance.<ref name=\"Nazionale in Cifre - FIGC: Pirlo, Andrea\"/> In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] on 10 October in a 3\u20131 win over Azerbaijan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/italy-beats-azerbaijan-to-qualify-for-euro-2016/ |title=Italy beats Azerbaijan to qualify for Euro 2016 |publisher=Sportsnet |date=10 October 2015 |accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref> On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad.

He was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[North Sligo (UK Parliament constituency)|North Sligo]] from 1909 to 1918, as a member of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nSon of Thomas Scanlan, a farmer, he was born at [[Drumcliff]]e, [[County Sligo]], and educated at [[Summerhill College]] in [[Sligo]] and at the [[University of St Andrews]], [[Scotland]]. In 1905 he married Mary Helen Mullen of [[Glasgow]], daughter of John Mullen.\n\nHe began his career as a journalist on the ''Glasgow Observer''.  Later he became a solicitor and eventually was called to the [[English Bar]] and became prominently identified with the Irish movement in [[London]].\n\n== Political career ==\nScanlan was elected unopposed for North Sligo at a [[1909 North Sligo by-election|by-election in August 1909]] after the death of [[Patrick Aloysius McHugh|Patrick McHugh]] MP.<ref name=\"walker-1801-1922\">Walker (1978), p.171</ref> and was unopposed in the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January]] and [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 general elections]].<ref>Walker (1978), pp.372\u2013373</ref> At one time he served as a secretary of the Irish Parliamentary Party.

Clancy]] of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], by a margin of more than two to one.<ref>Walker (1978), p.190</ref>\n\nScanlan introduced the [[Sligo Corporation Act 1918]] to use the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) for elections to [[Sligo Corporation]], and to enhance the corporation's power to set [[Rates (tax)|rates]]. STV had been introduced in [[university constituencies]] by the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], and was envisaged for the [[Home Rule]] assembly of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]] which never [[coming into force|came into force]]. STV's success in Sligo saw it extended to all Ireland for the [[1920 Irish local elections|1920 local elections]].\n\n== Legal career ==\nAs a barrister, Scanlan represented the [[National Sailors' and Firemen's Union]] at the inquiry into the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] in 1912. In the event the government paid the Union's costs, and on this account Scanlan was criticised in some quarters for accepting a government brief, although he had accepted the brief before he knew that the government would pay.<ref>Maume (1999), p. 128</ref> He was also criticised for living in England.<ref>Maume (1999), pp. 101, 132</ref>  After his parliamentary defeat he was a [[London Metropolitan Police]] [[Magistrate]] from 1924 to 1927,<ref>Who Was Who says 1925 to 1927, the ''Irish Independent'' 1924 to 1928</ref> resigning due to ill-health.

He was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[North Sligo (UK Parliament constituency)|North Sligo]] from 1909 to 1918, as a member of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nSon of Thomas Scanlan, a farmer, he was born at [[Drumcliff]]e, [[County Sligo]], and educated at [[Summerhill College]] in [[Sligo]] and at the [[University of St Andrews]], [[Scotland]]. In 1905 he married Mary Helen Mullen of [[Glasgow]], daughter of John Mullen.\n\nHe began his career as a journalist on the ''Glasgow Observer''.  Later he became a solicitor and eventually was called to the [[English Bar]] and became prominently identified with the Irish movement in [[London]].\n\n== Political career ==\nScanlan was elected unopposed for North Sligo at a [[1909 North Sligo by-election|by-election in August 1909]] after the death of [[Patrick Aloysius McHugh|Patrick McHugh]] MP.<ref name=\"walker-1801-1922\">Walker (1978), p.171</ref> and was unopposed in the [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January]] and [[December 1910 United Kingdom general election|December 1910 general elections]].<ref>Walker (1978), pp.372\u2013373</ref> At one time he served as a secretary of the Irish Parliamentary Party. In 1918 he lost his seat to [[J. J. Clancy (Sinn F\u00e9in politician)|J. J. Clancy]] of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], by a margin of more than two to one.<ref>Walker (1978), p.190</ref>\n\nScanlan introduced the [[Sligo Corporation Act 1918]] to use the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) for elections to [[Sligo Corporation]], and to enhance the corporation's power to set [[Rates (tax)|rates]]. STV had been introduced in [[university constituencies]] by the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], and was envisaged for the [[Home Rule]] assembly of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]] which never [[coming into force|came into force]]. STV's success in Sligo saw it extended to all Ireland for the [[1920 Irish local elections|1920 local elections]].\n\n== Legal career ==\nAs a barrister, Scanlan represented the [[National Sailors' and Firemen's Union]] at the inquiry into the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] in 1912. In the event the government paid the Union's costs, and on this account Scanlan was criticised in some quarters for accepting a government brief, although he had accepted the brief before he knew that the government would pay.<ref>Maume (1999), p. 128</ref> He was also criticised for living in England.<ref>Maume (1999), pp. 101, 132</ref>  After his parliamentary defeat he was a [[London Metropolitan Police]] [[Magistrate]] from 1924 to 1927,<ref>Who Was Who says 1925 to 1927, the ''Irish Independent'' 1924 to 1928</ref> resigning due to ill-health.  Afterwards he resumed his practice at the Bar.\n\nDuring his career he was a close friend of [[Thomas Power O'Connor|T. P.

He chronicled his Kafiristan experience in the book ''[[The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush]]''. Some have suggested that Robertson's year-long expedition and subsequent book (originally published in 1896) provided background and inspiration for [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story ''\"[[The Man Who Would Be King]]\"''. However, Kipling's work was originally published in 1888, predating Robertson's travels to the region.\n\n==Travels to Kafiristan==\nRobertson was born in London and received his education at the Westminster Hospital Medical School (now Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London).  In 1878 he entered the Indian Medical Service and served throughout the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878\u201380.  In 1888, he was attached to the Indian Foreign Office and assigned as agency surgeon in [[Gilgit]], in northern India, now [[Pakistan]].  According to his book it was around this time, during the war and while in Gilgit, that Robertson became interested in the land and way of life of the Kafir people. He asked the Government of [[British Raj|India]] for permission to journey to Kafiristan, and by October 1889 was on his way, departing from [[Chitral]] in what is now northwest Pakistan in the company of several Kafir headmen of the Kam tribe.  His journey lasted just over a year, ending in 1891, and providing Robertson with first-hand experience of what to him were the strange customs and colorful people of Kafiristan.\n\nHe was made a [[Companion of the Order of the Star of India]] in 1892.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 26291|date= 25 May 1892|page=3138|supp= y|city= London}}</ref>\n\n==Siege of Chitral==\nIn 1893, after his travels in Kafiristan, Surgeon Major Robertson was reassigned to the then-independent [[State of Chitral]], this time as a political agent.
