(North Carolina Maritime History Council).</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina became one of the English [[Thirteen Colonies]] and with the territory of [[South Carolina]] was originally known as the [[Province of North-Carolina]]. The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture, the colony lacked cities or towns. [[Piracy|Pirates]] menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[Quaker]], [[English American|English]] and [[German American|German]] [[immigrants]]. A majority of the colonists generally supported the [[American Revolution]], and a smaller number of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] than in some other colonies such as Georgia, South Carolina, Delaware, New York.\n\nDuring colonial times, [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]] served as the state capital beginning in 1722, and [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] was selected as the capital in 1766. Construction of [[Governor's Palace, New Bern|Tryon Palace]], which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor [[William Tryon]], began in 1767 and was completed in 1771. In 1788 [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] was chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks. Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], sponsor of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], the \"lost colony\" on [[Roanoke Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |title=Capitol History |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |author=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200430/http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania plus immigrants from abroad.<ref>Wiki Article Historical Demography of the United States.</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina made the smallest per-capita contribution to the war of any state, as only 7,800 men joined the [[Continental Army]] under General [[George Washington]]; an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>Milton Ready, ''The Tar Heel State: A History of North Carolina'' (U. of South Carolina Press, 2005), pp. 116, 120.</ref> There was some military action, especially in 1780\u201381. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] (later known as [[Tennessee]]), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands. It ceded them to the national government so the [[Northwest Territory]] could be organized and managed nationally.\n\nAfter 1800, cotton and [[tobacco]] became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]] region, developed a slave society based on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] system and [[slavery|slave]] labor. Many [[free people of color]] migrated to the frontier along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than ten thousand. The western areas were dominated by white families, especially Scots-Irish, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]], with a strong [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] presence, especially in the West. After [[Nat Turner]]'s slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835 the legislature withdrew their right to vote.\n\nOn May 20, 1861, North Carolina was the last of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to declare [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], 13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession. Some 125,000 North Carolinians served in the military; 20,000 were killed in battle, the most of any state in the Confederacy, and 21,000 died of disease. The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and the state was the scene of only small battles.\n\nWith the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, the [[Reconstruction Era]] began. The United States abolished slavery without compensation to slaveholders or reparations to [[freedmen]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] coalition of black freedmen, northern [[carpetbagger]]s and local [[scalawag]]s controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by [[Ku Klux Klan]] violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.\n\nPost civil war-debt cycles pushed people to switch from subsistence agriculture to commodity agriculture. Among this time the notorious Crop-Lien system developed and was financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to high amounts of usury. Also due to the push for commodity agriculture, the free range was ended. Prior to this time people fenced in their crops and had their livestock feeding on the free range areas. After the ending of the free range people now fenced their animals and had their crops in the open.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDemocrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office, but the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] attracted voters displeased with them. In 1896 a biracial, Populist-Republican Fusionist coalition gained the governor's office and passed laws that would extend the voting franchise to blacks and poor whites. The Democrats regained control of the legislature in 1896 and passed laws to impose [[Jim Crow]] and [[racial segregation]] of public facilities. Voters of North Carolina's 2nd congressional district elected a total of four African-American [[United States Congress|congressmen]] through these years of the late 19th century.\n\nPolitical tensions ran so high that a small group of white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] government if their candidates were not elected. In the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]], more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people and elected [[Alfred M. Waddell]] as mayor, in the only [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in United States history.<ref>[http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf \"Chapter 5\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321002041/http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf |date=March 21, 2009 }}, ''1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report'', North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with requirements for [[tax per head|poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]]s for voter registration which [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most black Americans in the state.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

It was not until 1992 that another [[African American]] was elected as a U.S. Representative from North Carolina.\n\nAs in the rest of the former Confederacy, North Carolina had become a one-party state, dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Impoverished by the Civil War and vicious debt cycles, the state continued with an economy based on [[tobacco]], cotton textiles and commodity agriculture. Towns and cities remained few in the east. A major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the counties of the [[Piedmont Triad]], based on cotton mills established at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, by the [[Wright brothers]], near [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]] on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas.\n\nNorth Carolina was hard hit by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the [[New Deal]] programs of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the [[Research Triangle]], a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. In the 1990s, Charlotte became a major regional and national banking center. Tourism has also been a boon for the North Carolina economy as people flock to the Outer Banks coastal area and the Appalachian Mountains anchored by [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]].\n\nBy the 1970s, spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally. The [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro Sit-ins]] played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks.\n\n===Native Americans, lost colonies, and permanent settlement===\n\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States|Joara|Roanoke Island|Fort Raleigh National Historic Site}}\n[[File:The Carte of all the Coast of Virginia by Theodor de Bry 1585 1586.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the coast of [[Virginia]] and North Carolina, drawn 1585\u20131586 by [[Theodor de Bry]], based on map by [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] of the [[Roanoke Colony]]]]\n\nNorth Carolina was inhabited for at least ten thousand years by succeeding [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures.

Succeeding peoples, including those of the ancient [[Mississippian culture]] established by 1000 AD in the Piedmont, continued to build or add on to such mounds. In the 500\u2013700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was [[Cahokia]], located in present-day Illinois near the Mississippi River.\n\nHistorically documented tribes in the North Carolina region include the [[Carolina Algonquian]]-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the [[Chowanoke]], [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]], [[Pamlico]], [[Machapunga]], [[Coree]], and [[Cape Fear Indians]], who were the first encountered by the English; the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Meherrin]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] of the interior; and Southeastern [[Siouan]] tribes, such as the [[Cheraw (tribe)|Cheraw]], [[Waxhaws|Waxhaw]], [[Saponi]], [[Waccamaw Siouan|Waccamaw]], and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]].\n\nSpanish [[explorer]]s traveling inland in the 16th century met [[Mississippian culture]] people at [[Joara]], a regional [[chiefdom]] near present-day [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]]. Records of [[Hernando de Soto]] attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567 Captain [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed ''Cuenca''. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to [[Mission Santa Elena|Santa Elena]] on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], then a center of [[Spanish Florida]]. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and [[archaeological]] findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.<ref name=richards/><ref>{{cite web|author1=Patrick Gibbs |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |first2=David G. |last2=Moore |first3=Robin A. |last3=Beck Jr. |first4=Christopher B. |last4=Rodning |title=Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world |volume=78 |issue=229 |publisher=Antiquity.ac.uk |date=March 2004 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171011/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Croatoan.jpg|thumb|right|[[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] returns to find the colony abandoned]]\n\nIn 1584, [[Elizabeth I]] granted a charter to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of [[Virginia]]).<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Randinelli\n|first=Tracey\n|title=Tanglewood Park\n|publisher=Harcourt\n|location=Orlando, Florida\n|page=16\n|url=\n|id=\n|isbn=978-0-15-333476-4 }}</ref> It was the second American territory which the English attempted to colonize.

The English, Welsh, Scots-Irish, and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain.\n\nMost of the English colonists had arrived as [[indentured servant]]s, hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage. In the early years the line between indentured servants and African [[slave]]s or laborers was fluid. Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong status. Most of the [[free people of color|free colored]] families formed in North Carolina before the Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men.

The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted primarily to the production of tobacco.\n\nOn April 12, 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the [[Continental Congress]] to vote for independence from the British Crown, through the [[Halifax Resolves]] passed by the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]]. The date of this event is memorialized on the [[Flag of North Carolina|state flag]] and [[Seal of North Carolina|state seal]]. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce [[guerrilla warfare]] erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries. A major American victory in the war took place at [[King's Mountain]] along the North Carolina\u2013South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of [[Tennessee]]) and [[southwest Virginia]] overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major [[Patrick Ferguson]]. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called \"Tories\" or Loyalists). The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.\n[[File:Battle of Guiliford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|left|1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the [[Battle of Guilford]]]]\n\nThe road to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] and America's independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led through North Carolina. As the [[British Army]] moved north from victories in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Camden, South Carolina]], the Southern Division of the [[Continental Army]] and local militia prepared to meet them. Following General [[Daniel Morgan]]'s victory over the British Cavalry Commander [[Banastre Tarleton]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781, southern commander [[Nathanael Greene]] led British Lord [[Charles Cornwallis]] across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina.

Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]] in present-day [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] on March 15, 1781. Although the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the [[Royal Navy]] to protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence.\n\n===Antebellum period===\n\n{{Main|Constitutional Convention (United States)|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nOn November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In 1840, it completed the [[North Carolina State Capitol|state capitol]] building in Raleigh, still standing today. Most of North Carolina's slave owners and large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] were located in the eastern portion of the state. Although North Carolina's plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than that of [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], or [[South Carolina]], significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as suburban planters around the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] in the Piedmont. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina, which was a slave society. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding \"yeoman\" farmers of western North Carolina. In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a {{convert|129|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} wooden plank road, known as a \"farmer's railroad\", from [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] in the east to [[Bethania, North Carolina|Bethania]] (northwest of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n[[File:Map North Carolina roads and railroads 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Map]] of the roads and railroads of North Carolina, 1854]]\n\nBesides slaves, there were a number of [[free people of color]] in the state.

Two additional Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state, which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines, where they became essentially free.\n\nConfederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at [[Battle of Bentonville|Bentonville]], which was a futile attempt by Confederate General [[Joseph E.

At the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in [[Pickett's Charge|Pickett/Pettigrew's Charge]] and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment.

In order to earn back its rights, the state had to make concessions to Washington, one of which was the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] that was followed through by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] on December 4, 1865. Congressional Republicans during the Reconstruction, commonly referred to as \"[[radical Republicans]]\", constantly pushed for new constitutions for each of the Southern states that emphasized on equal rights for African-Americans. In 1868, a constitutional convention restored the state government of North Carolina. Though the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was also adopted that same year, it remained [[Jim Crow laws|in most cases]] ineffective for almost a century\u2014not to mention paramilitary groups and their [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] with impunity.\n\nThe elections in April 1868 following the constitutional convention led to a narrow victory for a Republican-dominated government, with 19 African-Americans holding positions in the [[North Carolina State Legislature]].

The coastal plain consists of more specifically-defined areas known as the [[Outer Banks]], a string of sandy, narrow [[barrier islands]] separated from the mainland by sounds or inlets, including [[Albemarle Sound]] and [[Pamlico Sound]], the [[Tidewater (geographic term)|tidewater]] region, the native home of the [[venus flytrap]], and the inner coastal plain, where [[longleaf pine]] trees are native.\n\nSo many ships have been lost off [[Cape Hatteras]] that the area is known as the \"[[Graveyard of the Atlantic]]\"; more than a thousand ships have sunk in these waters since records began in 1526. The most famous of these is the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' (flagship of the pirate [[Blackbeard]]), which went aground in Beaufort Inlet in 1718.<ref>{{cite web| title=Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge Coming Back to Beaufort| website=Beach Carolina Magazine| date=March 30, 2011| url=http://beachcarolina.com/2011/03/30/blackbeards-queen-annes-revenge-coming-back-to-beaufort/| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221030139/http://beachcarolina.com/2011/03/30/blackbeards-queen-annes-revenge-coming-back-to-beaufort/| archivedate=February 21, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]], the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers.

Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state. Western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains, which tend to break up storms as they try to cross over; the storms will often re-form farther east.

Before the Civil War, the Baptists split into regional associations of the North and South, over the issue of slavery.\n\nBy the late 19th century, the largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina was the [[Baptist]], when both whites and blacks were considered, but the latter people had set up their own organizations. After [[emancipation]], black Baptists quickly set up their own independent congregations in North Carolina and other states of the South, as they wanted to be free of white supervision.<ref name=\"brooks\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEKdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Evolution of the Negro Baptist Church|last=Brooks|first=Walter Henderson (1851\u20131945)|journal=Journal of Negro History|volume=7|number=1|date=January 1922|pages=11\u201322|access-date=19 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830234438/https://books.google.com/books?id=FEKdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live|doi=10.2307/2713578|jstor=2713578}}</ref><ref name=\"raboteau\"/><ref>Wilson Fallin Jr., ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007) pp. 52\u201353</ref> Black Baptists developed their own state and national associations, such as the [[National Baptist Convention USA, Inc.]].<ref name=\"raboteau\">Albert J.

The third was the Roman Catholic Church, with 428,000 members in 190 congregations.

[[Presbyterians]], historically Scots-Irish, have had a strong presence in [[Charlotte]] and in [[Scotland County, North Carolina|Scotland County]].\n\nCurrently, the rapid influx of [[Northern United States|northerners]] and immigrants from Latin America is steadily increasing ethnic and religious diversity: the number of [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Judaism|Jews]] in the state has increased, as well as general religious diversity. The second-largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina after Baptist traditions is [[Methodism]], which is strong in the northern Piedmont, especially in populous [[Guilford County]].

According to one estimate, one-half of North Carolina's 100 counties have lost population since 2010, primarily due to the poor economy in many of North Carolina's rural areas.

These consist of the [[North Carolina Council of State|Council of State]] (led by the [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]]), the [[bicameral]] legislature (called the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]]), and the state court system (headed by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]]). The [[Constitution of North Carolina|state constitution]] delineates the structure and function of the state government. North Carolina has 13 seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[U.S. Senate]].\n\nNorth Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw [[Tar Heel]] voters elect a bicameral [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican]] majority legislature for the first time in more than a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern [[swing state]] in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]]'s comfortable victory in the state [[1976 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1976]], the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat [[Barack Obama]] narrowly won the state [[2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 2008]]. In the 1990s, Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] came within a point of winning the state [[1992 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1992]] and also only narrowly lost the state [[1996 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1996]]. In the early 2000s, Republican [[George W. Bush]] easily won the state by more than 12 points.\n\nBy 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in densely populated areas such as the [[Research Triangle]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In [[2012 United States presidential election in North Carolina|2012]], North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] in Charlotte. However, Republican [[Mitt Romney]] ultimately eked out a two-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with [[2012 United States presidential election in Indiana|Indiana]]) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the state elected a Republican Governor ([[Pat McCrory]]) and Lieutenant Governor ([[Dan Forest]]) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n! colspan = 6 | North Carolina registered voters {{as of|2019|November|16|lc=y|df=US}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegStat/Stats?Date=11/16/2019&CountyName=Totals|title=Voter Registration Statistics|publisher=[[North Carolina State Board of Elections]]}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture, the colony lacked cities or towns. [[Piracy|Pirates]] menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[Quaker]], [[English American|English]] and [[German American|German]] [[immigrants]]. A majority of the colonists generally supported the [[American Revolution]], and a smaller number of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] than in some other colonies such as Georgia, South Carolina, Delaware, New York.\n\nDuring colonial times, [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]] served as the state capital beginning in 1722, and [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] was selected as the capital in 1766. Construction of [[Governor's Palace, New Bern|Tryon Palace]], which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor [[William Tryon]], began in 1767 and was completed in 1771. In 1788 [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] was chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks. Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], sponsor of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], the \"lost colony\" on [[Roanoke Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |title=Capitol History |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |author=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200430/http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania plus immigrants from abroad.<ref>Wiki Article Historical Demography of the United States.</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina made the smallest per-capita contribution to the war of any state, as only 7,800 men joined the [[Continental Army]] under General [[George Washington]]; an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>Milton Ready, ''The Tar Heel State: A History of North Carolina'' (U. of South Carolina Press, 2005), pp. 116, 120.</ref> There was some military action, especially in 1780\u201381. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] (later known as [[Tennessee]]), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands. It ceded them to the national government so the [[Northwest Territory]] could be organized and managed nationally.\n\nAfter 1800, cotton and [[tobacco]] became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]] region, developed a slave society based on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] system and [[slavery|slave]] labor. Many [[free people of color]] migrated to the frontier along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than ten thousand. The western areas were dominated by white families, especially Scots-Irish, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]], with a strong [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] presence, especially in the West. After [[Nat Turner]]'s slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835 the legislature withdrew their right to vote.\n\nOn May 20, 1861, North Carolina was the last of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to declare [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], 13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession. Some 125,000 North Carolinians served in the military; 20,000 were killed in battle, the most of any state in the Confederacy, and 21,000 died of disease. The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and the state was the scene of only small battles.\n\nWith the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, the [[Reconstruction Era]] began. The United States abolished slavery without compensation to slaveholders or reparations to [[freedmen]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] coalition of black freedmen, northern [[carpetbagger]]s and local [[scalawag]]s controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by [[Ku Klux Klan]] violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.\n\nPost civil war-debt cycles pushed people to switch from subsistence agriculture to commodity agriculture. Among this time the notorious Crop-Lien system developed and was financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to high amounts of usury. Also due to the push for commodity agriculture, the free range was ended. Prior to this time people fenced in their crops and had their livestock feeding on the free range areas. After the ending of the free range people now fenced their animals and had their crops in the open.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDemocrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office, but the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] attracted voters displeased with them. In 1896 a biracial, Populist-Republican Fusionist coalition gained the governor's office and passed laws that would extend the voting franchise to blacks and poor whites. The Democrats regained control of the legislature in 1896 and passed laws to impose [[Jim Crow]] and [[racial segregation]] of public facilities. Voters of North Carolina's 2nd congressional district elected a total of four African-American [[United States Congress|congressmen]] through these years of the late 19th century.\n\nPolitical tensions ran so high that a small group of white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] government if their candidates were not elected. In the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]], more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people and elected [[Alfred M. Waddell]] as mayor, in the only [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in United States history.<ref>[http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf \"Chapter 5\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321002041/http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf |date=March 21, 2009 }}, ''1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report'', North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with requirements for [[tax per head|poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]]s for voter registration which [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most black Americans in the state.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

It was not until 1992 that another [[African American]] was elected as a U.S. Representative from North Carolina.\n\nAs in the rest of the former Confederacy, North Carolina had become a one-party state, dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Impoverished by the Civil War and vicious debt cycles, the state continued with an economy based on [[tobacco]], cotton textiles and commodity agriculture. Towns and cities remained few in the east. A major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the counties of the [[Piedmont Triad]], based on cotton mills established at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, by the [[Wright brothers]], near [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]] on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas.\n\nNorth Carolina was hard hit by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the [[New Deal]] programs of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the [[Research Triangle]], a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. In the 1990s, Charlotte became a major regional and national banking center. Tourism has also been a boon for the North Carolina economy as people flock to the Outer Banks coastal area and the Appalachian Mountains anchored by [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]].\n\nBy the 1970s, spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally. The [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro Sit-ins]] played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks.\n\n===Native Americans, lost colonies, and permanent settlement===\n\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States|Joara|Roanoke Island|Fort Raleigh National Historic Site}}\n[[File:The Carte of all the Coast of Virginia by Theodor de Bry 1585 1586.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the coast of [[Virginia]] and North Carolina, drawn 1585\u20131586 by [[Theodor de Bry]], based on map by [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] of the [[Roanoke Colony]]]]\n\nNorth Carolina was inhabited for at least ten thousand years by succeeding [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures. The [[Hardaway Site]] saw major periods of occupation as far back as 10,000 years. Before 200 AD, they were building [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork mounds]], which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the ancient [[Mississippian culture]] established by 1000 AD in the Piedmont, continued to build or add on to such mounds. In the 500\u2013700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was [[Cahokia]], located in present-day Illinois near the Mississippi River.\n\nHistorically documented tribes in the North Carolina region include the [[Carolina Algonquian]]-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the [[Chowanoke]], [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]], [[Pamlico]], [[Machapunga]], [[Coree]], and [[Cape Fear Indians]], who were the first encountered by the English; the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Meherrin]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] of the interior; and Southeastern [[Siouan]] tribes, such as the [[Cheraw (tribe)|Cheraw]], [[Waxhaws|Waxhaw]], [[Saponi]], [[Waccamaw Siouan|Waccamaw]], and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]].\n\nSpanish [[explorer]]s traveling inland in the 16th century met [[Mississippian culture]] people at [[Joara]], a regional [[chiefdom]] near present-day [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]]. Records of [[Hernando de Soto]] attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567 Captain [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed ''Cuenca''. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to [[Mission Santa Elena|Santa Elena]] on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], then a center of [[Spanish Florida]]. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and [[archaeological]] findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.<ref name=richards/><ref>{{cite web|author1=Patrick Gibbs |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |first2=David G. |last2=Moore |first3=Robin A. |last3=Beck Jr. |first4=Christopher B. |last4=Rodning |title=Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world |volume=78 |issue=229 |publisher=Antiquity.ac.uk |date=March 2004 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171011/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Croatoan.jpg|thumb|right|[[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] returns to find the colony abandoned]]\n\nIn 1584, [[Elizabeth I]] granted a charter to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of [[Virginia]]).<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Randinelli\n|first=Tracey\n|title=Tanglewood Park\n|publisher=Harcourt\n|location=Orlando, Florida\n|page=16\n|url=\n|id=\n|isbn=978-0-15-333476-4 }}</ref> It was the second American territory which the English attempted to colonize.

The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted primarily to the production of tobacco.\n\nOn April 12, 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the [[Continental Congress]] to vote for independence from the British Crown, through the [[Halifax Resolves]] passed by the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]]. The date of this event is memorialized on the [[Flag of North Carolina|state flag]] and [[Seal of North Carolina|state seal]]. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce [[guerrilla warfare]] erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries. A major American victory in the war took place at [[King's Mountain]] along the North Carolina\u2013South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of [[Tennessee]]) and [[southwest Virginia]] overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major [[Patrick Ferguson]]. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called \"Tories\" or Loyalists). The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.\n[[File:Battle of Guiliford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|left|1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the [[Battle of Guilford]]]]\n\nThe road to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] and America's independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led through North Carolina. As the [[British Army]] moved north from victories in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Camden, South Carolina]], the Southern Division of the [[Continental Army]] and local militia prepared to meet them. Following General [[Daniel Morgan]]'s victory over the British Cavalry Commander [[Banastre Tarleton]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781, southern commander [[Nathanael Greene]] led British Lord [[Charles Cornwallis]] across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina. This campaign is known as \"The Race to the Dan\" or \"The Race for the River\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Cowan's Ford]], Cornwallis met resistance along the banks of the [[Catawba River]] at Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781, in an attempt to engage General Morgan's forces during a tactical withdrawal.<ref>Stonestreet, Ottis C.

Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]] in present-day [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] on March 15, 1781. Although the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the [[Royal Navy]] to protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence.\n\n===Antebellum period===\n\n{{Main|Constitutional Convention (United States)|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nOn November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In 1840, it completed the [[North Carolina State Capitol|state capitol]] building in Raleigh, still standing today. Most of North Carolina's slave owners and large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] were located in the eastern portion of the state. Although North Carolina's plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than that of [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], or [[South Carolina]], significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as suburban planters around the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] in the Piedmont. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina, which was a slave society. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding \"yeoman\" farmers of western North Carolina. In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a {{convert|129|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} wooden plank road, known as a \"farmer's railroad\", from [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] in the east to [[Bethania, North Carolina|Bethania]] (northwest of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n[[File:Map North Carolina roads and railroads 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Map]] of the roads and railroads of North Carolina, 1854]]\n\nBesides slaves, there were a number of [[free people of color]] in the state.

During the Civil War, the Wilmington-to-Raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the Confederate war effort; supplies shipped into Wilmington would be moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]].\n\nDuring the antebellum period, North Carolina was an overwhelmingly rural state, even by Southern standards. In 1860 only one North Carolina town, the port city of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], had a population of more than 10,000. [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], the state capital, had barely more than 5,000 residents.\n\nWhile slaveholding was slightly less concentrated than in some Southern states, according to the 1860 census, more than 330,000 people, or 33% of the population of 992,622, were enslaved African Americans.<ref name=census>{{cite web|title=Historical Census Browser:Census Data for Year 1860 |date=2004 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |website=University of Virginia Library |url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |archivedate=October 11, 2014 |df= }}</ref> They lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the eastern [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]].

Some of the yeoman farmers in the state's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War, while some covertly supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause during the conflict. Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the [[Union Army]] and fought for the North in the war. Two additional Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state, which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines, where they became essentially free.\n\nConfederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at [[Battle of Bentonville|Bentonville]], which was a futile attempt by Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston|Joseph Johnston]] to slow Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> In April 1865, after losing the [[Battle of Morrisville]], Johnston surrendered to Sherman at [[Bennett Place]], in what is today [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]. North Carolina's port city of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union, in February 1865, after the Union won the nearby [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher]], its major defense downriver.\n[[File:2008-08-16 Bennett Place historic site.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bennett Place]] historic site in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]]]\n\nThe first Confederate soldier to be killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt from North Carolina, in the [[Battle of Big Bethel]] in June 1861. At the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in [[Pickett's Charge|Pickett/Pettigrew's Charge]] and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment. During the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield. At [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] in Virginia in April 1865, the 75th North Carolina Regiment, a cavalry unit, fired the last shots of the Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]] in the Civil War. For many years, North Carolinians proudly boasted that they had been \"First at Bethel, Farthest at Gettysburg and Chickamauga, and Last at Appomattox\".\n\n===Reconstruction===\n\n{{Main|Reconstruction era}}\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Confederacy in 1865, North Carolina, along with the rest of the former Confederate States, was put under direct control by the [[U.S. military]] and was relieved of its [[Constitution of North Carolina|constitutional government]] and representation within the [[United States Congress]] in what is now referred to as the [[Reconstruction era]]. In order to earn back its rights, the state had to make concessions to Washington, one of which was the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] that was followed through by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] on December 4, 1865. Congressional Republicans during the Reconstruction, commonly referred to as \"[[radical Republicans]]\", constantly pushed for new constitutions for each of the Southern states that emphasized on equal rights for African-Americans. In 1868, a constitutional convention restored the state government of North Carolina. Though the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was also adopted that same year, it remained [[Jim Crow laws|in most cases]] ineffective for almost a century\u2014not to mention paramilitary groups and their [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] with impunity.\n\nThe elections in April 1868 following the constitutional convention led to a narrow victory for a Republican-dominated government, with 19 African-Americans holding positions in the [[North Carolina State Legislature]]. In attempt to put the reforms into effect, the new Republican Governor [[William W.

While North Carolina's urban areas have enjoyed a prosperous economy with steady job growth, low unemployment, and rising wages, many of the state's rural counties have suffered from job loss, rising levels of poverty, and population loss as their manufacturing base has declined. According to one estimate, one-half of North Carolina's 100 counties have lost population since 2010, primarily due to the poor economy in many of North Carolina's rural areas.

These consist of the [[North Carolina Council of State|Council of State]] (led by the [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]]), the [[bicameral]] legislature (called the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]]), and the state court system (headed by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]]). The [[Constitution of North Carolina|state constitution]] delineates the structure and function of the state government. North Carolina has 13 seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[U.S. Senate]].\n\nNorth Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw [[Tar Heel]] voters elect a bicameral [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican]] majority legislature for the first time in more than a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern [[swing state]] in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]]'s comfortable victory in the state [[1976 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1976]], the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat [[Barack Obama]] narrowly won the state [[2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 2008]]. In the 1990s, Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] came within a point of winning the state [[1992 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1992]] and also only narrowly lost the state [[1996 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1996]]. In the early 2000s, Republican [[George W. Bush]] easily won the state by more than 12 points.\n\nBy 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in densely populated areas such as the [[Research Triangle]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In [[2012 United States presidential election in North Carolina|2012]], North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] in Charlotte. However, Republican [[Mitt Romney]] ultimately eked out a two-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with [[2012 United States presidential election in Indiana|Indiana]]) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the state elected a Republican Governor ([[Pat McCrory]]) and Lieutenant Governor ([[Dan Forest]]) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n! colspan = 6 | North Carolina registered voters {{as of|2019|November|16|lc=y|df=US}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegStat/Stats?Date=11/16/2019&CountyName=Totals|title=Voter Registration Statistics|publisher=[[North Carolina State Board of Elections]]}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

There are strong regional differences and rivalries over the sauces and methods used in making the barbecue. The common trend across Western North Carolina is the use of premium grade [[Boston butt]]. Western North Carolina pork barbecue uses a tomato-based sauce, and only the pork shoulder (dark meat) is used. Western North Carolina barbecue is commonly referred to as Lexington barbecue after the [[Piedmont Triad]] town of [[Lexington, North Carolina|Lexington]], home of the [[Lexington Barbecue Festival]], which attracts more than 100,000 visitors each October.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bob Garner's Guide to North Carolina Barbecue | last = Garner | first = Bob | url = https://books.google.com/?id=PswNCQWI9RsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=north+carolina+barbecue | publisher=John F.

[[Pepsi-Cola]] was first produced in 1898 in New Bern. A regional [[soft drink]], [[Cheerwine]], was created and is still based in the city of Salisbury. Despite its name, the hot sauce [[Texas Pete]] was created in North Carolina; its headquarters are also in Winston-Salem. The [[Hardee's]] fast-food chain was started in [[Rocky Mount, North Carolina|Rocky Mount]]. Another fast-food chain, [[Bojangles']], was started in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], and has its corporate headquarters there. A popular North Carolina restaurant chain is [[Golden Corral]]. Started in 1973, the chain was founded in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], with headquarters located in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]. Popular [[Pickled cucumber|pickle]] brand [[Mount Olive Pickle Company]] was founded in [[Mount Olive, North Carolina|Mount Olive]] in 1926. Fast casual burger chain [[Hwy 55 Burgers, Shakes & Fries]] also makes its home in [[Mount Olive, North Carolina|Mount Olive]]. [[Cook Out (restaurant)|Cook Out]], a popular fast-food chain featuring burgers, hot dogs, and milkshakes in a wide variety of flavors, was founded in Greensboro in 1989 and has begun expanding outside of North Carolina. In 2013, Southern Living named Durham\u2013Chapel Hill the South's \"Tastiest City\".\n\nOver the last decade, North Carolina has become a cultural epicenter and haven for internationally prize-winning wine (Noni Bacca Winery), internationally prized cheeses (Ashe County), \"L'institut International aux Arts Gastronomiques: Conquerront Les Yanks les Truffes, January 15, 2010\" international hub for truffles (Garland Truffles), and beer making, as tobacco land has been converted to grape orchards while state laws regulating alcohol content in beer allowed a jump in ABV from 6% to 15%. The Yadkin Valley in particular has become a strengthening market for grape production, while [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] recently won the recognition of being named 'Beer City USA'. [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] boasts the largest [[North Carolina breweries#Breweries|breweries]] per capita of any city in the United States. Recognized and marketed brands of beer in North Carolina include Highland Brewing, Duck Rabbit Brewery, Mother Earth Brewery, Weeping Radish Brewery, Big Boss Brewing, Foothills Brewing, Carolina Brewing Company, Lonerider Brewing, and White Rabbit Brewing Company.\n\nNorth Carolina has large grazing areas for beef and dairy cattle. Truck farms can be found in North Carolina. A truck farm is a small farm where fruits and vegetables are grown to be sold at local markets. The state's shipping, commercial fishing, and lumber industries are important to its economy. Service industries, including education, health care, private research, and retail trade, are also important. Research Triangle Park, a large industrial complex located in the Raleigh-Durham area, is one of the major centers in the country for electronics and medical research.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[Tobacco]] was one of the first major industries to develop after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many farmers grew some tobacco, and the invention of the cigarette made the product especially popular. Winston-Salem is the birthplace of [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] (RJR), founded by [[R. J. Reynolds]] in 1874 as one of 16 tobacco companies in the town. By 1914 it was selling 425 million packs of Camels a year. Today it is the second-largest tobacco company in the U.S. (behind [[Altria Group]]). RJR is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc., which in turn is 42% owned by [[British American Tobacco]].<ref>Nannie M. Tilley, ''The R.J.

publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in [[Rome]] (a think thank of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link]. Specifically the Order of Battle after the 1986 reform was used, which was then corrected and expanded with the Italian Army's website information.\n\n== Graphic of the Italian Army in 1989 ==\n\n[[File:Italy Army - 1989.png|thumb|center|1200px|Structure of the Italian Army in 1989 (click image to enlarge)]]\n\n== Army General Staff ==\nThe Army General Staff in Rome oversaw all Italian Army units.

The number of walking legs is usually eight (four pairs), but species with five and six pairs exist. Pycnogonids do not require a traditional [[respiratory system]]. Instead, gasses are absorbed by the legs and trasferred through the body by [[diffusion]]. A [[proboscis]] allows them to suck nutrients from soft-bodied [[invertebrates]], and their digestive tract has [[diverticulum (mollusc)|diverticula]] extending into the legs.\n\n[[File:Nymphon-leptocheles.jpg|right|thumb|Pycnogonid grazing on a [[hydroid (zoology)|hydroid]]]]\nCertain pycnogonids are so small that each of their tiny [[muscle]]s consists of only one single cell, surrounded by [[connective tissue]]. The anterior region consists of the proboscis, which has fairly limited dorsoventral and lateral movement, and three to four [[appendages]] including the [[oviger]]s, which are used in caring for young and cleaning as well as [[courtship]]. In some species, the chelifores, palps and ovigers can be reduced or missing in adults. In those species that lack [[Chelicerae|chelifores]] and [[palp]]s, the [[proboscis]] is well developed and more mobile and flexible, often equipped with numerous sensory bristles and strong rasping ridges around the mouth. The last segment includes the [[anus]] and tubercle, which projects dorsally.\n\nIn total, pycnogonids have four to six pairs of legs for walking as well as other appendages which often resemble legs. A [[cephalothorax]] and much smaller [[abdomen]] make up the extremely reduced body of the pycnogonid, which has up to two pairs of dorsally located simple eyes on its non-calcareous [[exoskeleton]], though sometimes the eyes can be missing, especially among species living in the deep oceans. The abdomen does not have any appendages, and in most species it is reduced and almost vestigial. The organs of this [[chelicerate]] extend throughout many appendages because its body is too small to accommodate all of them alone.\n\nThe morphology of the sea spider creates an extremely well suited surface-area to volume ratio for any respiration to occur through direct diffusion. Oxygen is absorbed by the legs and is transported via the hemolymph to the rest of the body.<ref name=\"woods2017\"/> The most recent research seems to indicate that waste leaves the body through the digestive tract or is lost during a [[ecdysis|moult]]. The small, long, thin pycnogonid heart beats vigorously at 90 to 180 beats per minute, creating substantial blood pressure. The beating of the sea spider heart drives circulation in the trunk and in the part of the legs closest to the trunk, but is not important for the circulation in the rest of the legs.<ref name=\"woods2017\">{{Cite journal |last=Woods |first=H.

Females possess a pair of ovaries, while males possess a pair of testes located dorsally in relation to the digestive tract. Reproduction involves [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] after \"a brief courtship\". Only males care for laid eggs and young.\n\nThe larva has a blind gut and the body consists of a head and its three pairs of cephalic appendages only: the chelifores, palps and ovigers. The abdomen and the thorax with its thoracic appendages develop later. One theory is that this reflects how a common ancestor of all arthropods evolved; starting its life as a small animal with a pair of appendages used for feeding and two pairs used for locomotion, while new segments and segmental appendages were gradually added as it was growing.\n\nAt least four types of larvae have been described: the typical protonymphon larva, the encysted larva, the atypical protonymphon larva, and the attaching larva. The typical protonymphon larva is most common, is free living and gradually turns into an adult. The encysted larva is a parasite that hatches from the egg and finds a host in the shape of a polyp colony where it burrows into and turns into a cyst, and will not leave the host before it has turned into a young juvenile.\n\nLittle is known about the development of the atypical protonymphon larva. The adults are free living, while the larvae and the juveniles are living on or inside temporary hosts such as polychaetes and clams. When the attaching larva hatches it still looks like an embryo, and immediately attaches itself to the ovigerous legs of the father, where it will stay until it has turned into a small and young juvenile with two or three pairs of walking legs ready for a free-living existence.\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\n[[File:Pycnogonid.jpg|thumb|A pycnogonid in its natural habitat]]\nThese small animals live in many different parts of the world, from [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Pacific]] coast of the [[United States]], to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]], to the north and south poles. They are most common in shallow waters, but can be found as deep as {{convert|7000|m}}, and live in both marine and estuarine habitats. Pycnogonids are well camouflaged beneath the rocks and among the [[algae]] that are found along shorelines.\n\nSea spiders either walk along the bottom with their stilt-like legs or swim just above it using an umbrella pulsing motion.<ref>[http://deepseanews.blogspot.com/2006/08/sea-spiders.html Deep-Sea News: Sea Spiders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sea spiders are mostly [[carnivorous]] [[predator]]s or [[scavenger]]s that feed on [[cnidarian]]s, [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[polychaete]]s, and [[bryozoa]]ns. Although they can feed by inserting their [[proboscis]] into [[sea anemone]]s, which are much larger, most sea anemones survive this ordeal, making the sea spider a [[parasite]] rather than a predator of anemones.\n\n==Classification==\nThe class Pycnogonida comprises over 1,300 species, which are normally split into eighty-six genera. The correct taxonomy within the group is uncertain, and it appears that no agreed list of [[order (biology)|orders]] exists. Accordingly, [[family (biology)|families]] are listed in the [[Wikipedia:How to read a taxobox|taxobox]], all considered part of the single order Pantopoda.\n\nSea spiders have long been considered to belong to the [[Chelicerata]], together with [[horseshoe crab]]s, and the [[Arachnida]], which includes [[spider]]s, [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[harvestmen]], among other, lesser known orders.<ref name=\"Margulis & Schwartz\">{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author-link=Lynn Margulis |last2=Schwartz |first2=Karlene |author2-link= |title=Five Kingdoms, An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth |publisher=W.H.

This theory contends that the sea spider's chelifores, which are unique among extant arthropods, are not in any way homologous to the chelicerae in real chelicerates, as was previously supposed. Instead of developing from the [[deutocerebrum]], they can be traced to the [[protocerebrum]], the anterior part of the [[arthropod brain]] and found in the first head segment that in all other arthropods give rise to the eyes only. This is not found anywhere else among arthropods, except in some fossil forms like ''[[Anomalocaris]]'', indicating that the Pycnogonida may be a sister group to all other living arthropods, the latter having evolved from some ancestor that had lost the protocerebral appendages. If this is confirmed, it would mean the sea spiders are the last surviving (and highly modified) members of an ancient stem group of arthropods that lived in [[Cambrian]] oceans.<ref name=\"Maxmen\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature03984 |pmid=16237442 |title=Neuroanatomy of sea spiders implies an appendicular origin of the protocerebral segment |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7062 |pages=1144\u20138 |year=2005 |last1=Maxmen |first1=Amy |last2=Browne |first2=William E. |last3=Martindale |first3=Mark Q. |last4=Giribet |first4=Gonzalo |bibcode=2005Natur.437.1144M }}</ref> However, a subsequent study using [[Hox gene]] expression patterns consistent with a developmental homology between chelicerates and chelifores, with chelifores innervated from a deuterocerebrum that has been rotated forwards; thus, the protocerebral Great Appendage clade does not include the Pycnogonida.<ref name=\"Jager\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04591 |pmid=16724066 |title=Homology of arthropod anterior appendages revealed by Hox gene expression in a sea spider |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=506\u20138 |year=2006 |last1=Jager |first1=Muriel |last2=Murienne |first2=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |last3=Clabaut |first3=C\u00e9line |last4=Deutsch |first4=Jean |last5=Guyader |first5=Herv\u00e9 Le |last6=Manuel |first6=Micha\u00ebl |bibcode=2006Natur.441..506J }}</ref><ref name=\"PZ Myers\">[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/05/26/chelifores-chelicerae-and-inve Pharyngula] {{self-published inline|date=March 2015}}</ref>\n\nRecent work places the Pycnogonida outside the [[Arachnomorpha]] as basal [[Euarthropoda]], or inside [[Chelicerata]] (based on the [[chelifore]]-[[chelicera]] putative [[Homology (biology)|homology]]).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2004.00284.x |title=Pycnogonid affinities: A review |journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research |volume=43 |pages=8\u201321 |year=2005 |last1=Dunlop |first1=J.

The number of walking legs is usually eight (four pairs), but species with five and six pairs exist. Pycnogonids do not require a traditional [[respiratory system]]. Instead, gasses are absorbed by the legs and trasferred through the body by [[diffusion]]. A [[proboscis]] allows them to suck nutrients from soft-bodied [[invertebrates]], and their digestive tract has [[diverticulum (mollusc)|diverticula]] extending into the legs.\n\n[[File:Nymphon-leptocheles.jpg|right|thumb|Pycnogonid grazing on a [[hydroid (zoology)|hydroid]]]]\nCertain pycnogonids are so small that each of their tiny [[muscle]]s consists of only one single cell, surrounded by [[connective tissue]]. The anterior region consists of the proboscis, which has fairly limited dorsoventral and lateral movement, and three to four [[appendages]] including the [[oviger]]s, which are used in caring for young and cleaning as well as [[courtship]]. In some species, the chelifores, palps and ovigers can be reduced or missing in adults. In those species that lack [[Chelicerae|chelifores]] and [[palp]]s, the [[proboscis]] is well developed and more mobile and flexible, often equipped with numerous sensory bristles and strong rasping ridges around the mouth. The last segment includes the [[anus]] and tubercle, which projects dorsally.\n\nIn total, pycnogonids have four to six pairs of legs for walking as well as other appendages which often resemble legs. A [[cephalothorax]] and much smaller [[abdomen]] make up the extremely reduced body of the pycnogonid, which has up to two pairs of dorsally located simple eyes on its non-calcareous [[exoskeleton]], though sometimes the eyes can be missing, especially among species living in the deep oceans. The abdomen does not have any appendages, and in most species it is reduced and almost vestigial. The organs of this [[chelicerate]] extend throughout many appendages because its body is too small to accommodate all of them alone.\n\nThe morphology of the sea spider creates an extremely well suited surface-area to volume ratio for any respiration to occur through direct diffusion. Oxygen is absorbed by the legs and is transported via the hemolymph to the rest of the body.<ref name=\"woods2017\"/> The most recent research seems to indicate that waste leaves the body through the digestive tract or is lost during a [[ecdysis|moult]]. The small, long, thin pycnogonid heart beats vigorously at 90 to 180 beats per minute, creating substantial blood pressure. The beating of the sea spider heart drives circulation in the trunk and in the part of the legs closest to the trunk, but is not important for the circulation in the rest of the legs.<ref name=\"woods2017\">{{Cite journal |last=Woods |first=H.

Females possess a pair of ovaries, while males possess a pair of testes located dorsally in relation to the digestive tract. Reproduction involves [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] after \"a brief courtship\". Only males care for laid eggs and young.\n\nThe larva has a blind gut and the body consists of a head and its three pairs of cephalic appendages only: the chelifores, palps and ovigers. The abdomen and the thorax with its thoracic appendages develop later. One theory is that this reflects how a common ancestor of all arthropods evolved; starting its life as a small animal with a pair of appendages used for feeding and two pairs used for locomotion, while new segments and segmental appendages were gradually added as it was growing.\n\nAt least four types of larvae have been described: the typical protonymphon larva, the encysted larva, the atypical protonymphon larva, and the attaching larva. The typical protonymphon larva is most common, is free living and gradually turns into an adult. The encysted larva is a parasite that hatches from the egg and finds a host in the shape of a polyp colony where it burrows into and turns into a cyst, and will not leave the host before it has turned into a young juvenile.\n\nLittle is known about the development of the atypical protonymphon larva. The adults are free living, while the larvae and the juveniles are living on or inside temporary hosts such as polychaetes and clams. When the attaching larva hatches it still looks like an embryo, and immediately attaches itself to the ovigerous legs of the father, where it will stay until it has turned into a small and young juvenile with two or three pairs of walking legs ready for a free-living existence.\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\n[[File:Pycnogonid.jpg|thumb|A pycnogonid in its natural habitat]]\nThese small animals live in many different parts of the world, from [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Pacific]] coast of the [[United States]], to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]], to the north and south poles. They are most common in shallow waters, but can be found as deep as {{convert|7000|m}}, and live in both marine and estuarine habitats. Pycnogonids are well camouflaged beneath the rocks and among the [[algae]] that are found along shorelines.\n\nSea spiders either walk along the bottom with their stilt-like legs or swim just above it using an umbrella pulsing motion.<ref>[http://deepseanews.blogspot.com/2006/08/sea-spiders.html Deep-Sea News: Sea Spiders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sea spiders are mostly [[carnivorous]] [[predator]]s or [[scavenger]]s that feed on [[cnidarian]]s, [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[polychaete]]s, and [[bryozoa]]ns. Although they can feed by inserting their [[proboscis]] into [[sea anemone]]s, which are much larger, most sea anemones survive this ordeal, making the sea spider a [[parasite]] rather than a predator of anemones.\n\n==Classification==\nThe class Pycnogonida comprises over 1,300 species, which are normally split into eighty-six genera. The correct taxonomy within the group is uncertain, and it appears that no agreed list of [[order (biology)|orders]] exists. Accordingly, [[family (biology)|families]] are listed in the [[Wikipedia:How to read a taxobox|taxobox]], all considered part of the single order Pantopoda.\n\nSea spiders have long been considered to belong to the [[Chelicerata]], together with [[horseshoe crab]]s, and the [[Arachnida]], which includes [[spider]]s, [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[harvestmen]], among other, lesser known orders.<ref name=\"Margulis & Schwartz\">{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author-link=Lynn Margulis |last2=Schwartz |first2=Karlene |author2-link= |title=Five Kingdoms, An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth |publisher=W.H.

This theory contends that the sea spider's chelifores, which are unique among extant arthropods, are not in any way homologous to the chelicerae in real chelicerates, as was previously supposed. Instead of developing from the [[deutocerebrum]], they can be traced to the [[protocerebrum]], the anterior part of the [[arthropod brain]] and found in the first head segment that in all other arthropods give rise to the eyes only. This is not found anywhere else among arthropods, except in some fossil forms like ''[[Anomalocaris]]'', indicating that the Pycnogonida may be a sister group to all other living arthropods, the latter having evolved from some ancestor that had lost the protocerebral appendages. If this is confirmed, it would mean the sea spiders are the last surviving (and highly modified) members of an ancient stem group of arthropods that lived in [[Cambrian]] oceans.<ref name=\"Maxmen\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature03984 |pmid=16237442 |title=Neuroanatomy of sea spiders implies an appendicular origin of the protocerebral segment |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7062 |pages=1144\u20138 |year=2005 |last1=Maxmen |first1=Amy |last2=Browne |first2=William E. |last3=Martindale |first3=Mark Q. |last4=Giribet |first4=Gonzalo |bibcode=2005Natur.437.1144M }}</ref> However, a subsequent study using [[Hox gene]] expression patterns consistent with a developmental homology between chelicerates and chelifores, with chelifores innervated from a deuterocerebrum that has been rotated forwards; thus, the protocerebral Great Appendage clade does not include the Pycnogonida.<ref name=\"Jager\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04591 |pmid=16724066 |title=Homology of arthropod anterior appendages revealed by Hox gene expression in a sea spider |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=506\u20138 |year=2006 |last1=Jager |first1=Muriel |last2=Murienne |first2=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |last3=Clabaut |first3=C\u00e9line |last4=Deutsch |first4=Jean |last5=Guyader |first5=Herv\u00e9 Le |last6=Manuel |first6=Micha\u00ebl |bibcode=2006Natur.441..506J }}</ref><ref name=\"PZ Myers\">[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/05/26/chelifores-chelicerae-and-inve Pharyngula] {{self-published inline|date=March 2015}}</ref>\n\nRecent work places the Pycnogonida outside the [[Arachnomorpha]] as basal [[Euarthropoda]], or inside [[Chelicerata]] (based on the [[chelifore]]-[[chelicera]] putative [[Homology (biology)|homology]]).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2004.00284.x |title=Pycnogonid affinities: A review |journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research |volume=43 |pages=8\u201321 |year=2005 |last1=Dunlop |first1=J.

There had been other camps known as jungles in previous years, but this particular [[shanty town]] drew global media attention during the peak of the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015, when its population grew rapidly. Migrants stayed at the camp while they attempted to enter the [[United Kingdom]], or while they awaited their [[Asylum in France|French asylum claims]] to be processed.\n\nThe camp was located on a former [[landfill]] site to the east of Calais. By July 2015, it had 3,000 inhabitants and continued to grow. Although estimates of the number of migrants differed, a [[Help Refugees]] [[census]] gave a figure of 8,143 people just before the camp's demolition in October 2016. As well as residences, the Jungle contained shops, restaurants, hairdressers, schools, places of worship and a boxing club. \n\nThe [[Government of France]] initially tolerated the camp, later opting to rehouse 1,500 migrants in shipping containers to be used as shelters on the north-eastern side of the site. In February 2016, they evicted the southern sector of the Jungle and there were several arrests. The Jungle received local support and international solidarity from activists, artists, intellectuals and [[grassroots]] [[Aid agency|aid organisations]]. The camp was completely cleared and demolished in October 2016. According to Government plans, 6,400 migrants would be moved to 280 temporary reception centres around France. There were concerns over the fate of 200 [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied children]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] published a report in 2017 stating that up to 1,000 migrants were still living in the Calais region.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Calais2015g.jpg|thumb|Badeldin Shogar, a Sudanese migrant, at the Jungle in October 2015]]\n{{see also|Migrants around Calais}}\n{{see also|Timeline of the European migrant crisis}}\n\nMigrants [[migrants around Calais|based in Calais]] were attempting to enter the United Kingdom via the [[Port of Calais]] or the [[Channel Tunnel]] by [[stowing away]] on lorries, ferries, cars, or trains.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21660581-camp-channels-edge-sideshow-europes-migrant-crisis-it-offers-important|title=Learning from the Jungle|work=The Economist|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=28 December 2015|url-access=subscription|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714000401/https://www.economist.com/europe/2015/08/06/learning-from-the-jungle |archive-date=6 August 2015}}</ref> Some migrants were attempting to return to the United Kingdom having once lived there,<ref name=\"Avoid\" /> whilst others were attempting to enter the British labour market to [[Unreported employment|work illegally]] rather than claim asylum in France.<ref name=\"bbc2\" /><ref name=\"guard3Sept\" /> Some migrants lived in the camp while seeking asylum in France, a choice they made because the French system did not provide for them while their claim was being processed, leaving them [[Homelessness in France|homeless]] for the duration.<ref>Francesca Ansaloni, 'Deterritorialising the Jungle: Understanding the Calais camp through its orderings' in ''Environment and Planning C: Politics and Space'' (25/02/20) doi.org/10.1177/2399654420908597</ref> One migrant from [[Egypt]], a politics graduate, told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that he had \"paid $3,000 (\u00a32,000) to leave Egypt, risked my life on a boat to Italy spending days at sea\" and that in one month he had tried 20 times to reach England; another, an [[Eritrea]]n woman with a one-year-old child, had paid \u20ac2,500 (\u00a31,825) \u2013 and her husband the same \u2013 to sail to [[Italy]], but her husband had [[European migrant crisis#Deaths and incidents|drowned during the journey]].<ref name=\"horror\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/06/at-night-its-like-a-horror-movie-inside-calaiss-official-shanty-town 'At night it's like a horror movie'&nbsp;\u2013 inside Calais's official shantytown.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629210030/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/06/at-night-its-like-a-horror-movie-inside-calaiss-official-shanty-town |date=29 June 2016 }} Angelique Chrisafis, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 April 2015.

[[France]] that existed from January 2015 to October 2016. There had been other camps known as jungles in previous years, but this particular [[shanty town]] drew global media attention during the peak of the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015, when its population grew rapidly. Migrants stayed at the camp while they attempted to enter the [[United Kingdom]], or while they awaited their [[Asylum in France|French asylum claims]] to be processed.\n\nThe camp was located on a former [[landfill]] site to the east of Calais. By July 2015, it had 3,000 inhabitants and continued to grow. Although estimates of the number of migrants differed, a [[Help Refugees]] [[census]] gave a figure of 8,143 people just before the camp's demolition in October 2016. As well as residences, the Jungle contained shops, restaurants, hairdressers, schools, places of worship and a boxing club. \n\nThe [[Government of France]] initially tolerated the camp, later opting to rehouse 1,500 migrants in shipping containers to be used as shelters on the north-eastern side of the site. In February 2016, they evicted the southern sector of the Jungle and there were several arrests. The Jungle received local support and international solidarity from activists, artists, intellectuals and [[grassroots]] [[Aid agency|aid organisations]]. The camp was completely cleared and demolished in October 2016. According to Government plans, 6,400 migrants would be moved to 280 temporary reception centres around France.

The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.\n\nThe HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.<ref name=\"gopro.com\"/> For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's \"most economical\" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).\n\nThe Black Edition<ref>{{cite web|website=InsideHardware.it|url=http://www.insidehardware.it/fotografia/sportcam/3005-gopro-hero-3-black-edition-seconda-solo-a-se-stessa/|access-date=September 28, 2015|date=October 25, 2013|language=it|title=GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition: Seconda solo a se stessa|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035159/http://www.insidehardware.it/fotografia/sportcam/3005-gopro-hero-3-black-edition-seconda-solo-a-se-stessa/|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=September 2015}} has a new 12&nbsp;MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and [[Wide VGA#WVGA (800\u00d7480)|WVGA]] at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.\n\nThe Silver Edition uses the same 11&nbsp;MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5&nbsp;MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.\n\n=====HERO3+=====\n[[File:Timelapse Chicago Bike Ride March 30 2014.webm|thumbnail|right|300px|A timelapse recording one frame every 10 seconds with a GoPro HERO3 camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in [[Chicago]].

The HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called \"SuperView\") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30\u201350% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.\n\nThe Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10 MP stills at up to 10 fps.<ref>[http://gopro.com/cameras/hd-hero3-silver-edition HERO3+ Silver Edition]</ref> In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%\u201350% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.\n\nThe HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]] for its contribution to television.<ref>Nick Kelley. \"[http://www.outsideonline.com/news-from-the-field/GoPro-Wins-an-Emmy.html GoPro Wins an Emmy]\", Outside, January 15, 2014</ref>\n\n====HERO====\nIn September 2014, GoPro released an entry level camera named simply \"HERO\", priced at $130, alongside the HERO4 Black and HERO4 Silver.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/29/6862843/hero4-black-silver-gopro-cameras|title=GoPro introduces a camera with a touchscreen and another that's just $129|work=The Verge|access-date=May 20, 2018}}</ref>\nThe GoPro Hero can capture 5mp still images and has a 5fps burst option.

The HERO7 Silver was intended as the mid-range camera, featuring 4K resolutions for video and time-lapse video resolutions and WDR in its photo mode. Initially, both the HERO7 White and Silver defaulted to a video resolution of 1440p with 1080p only available by cropping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.gopro.com/t5/Cameras/GoPro-Hero-7-White-Resolution-Change/m-p/256828#M74643|title=GoPro Hero 7 White Resolution Change|date=2018-11-01|website=community.gopro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This was met with considerable criticism, of which GoPro responded by releasing software updates to both cameras to allow for change in default resolution to 1080p.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/en/hk/update/hero7-silver|title=HERO7 SILVER|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> In contrast to the HERO7 Black, these cameras lacked most time-lapse photo modes, ProTune, wake-on-voice capabilities, H.265 formats and live-streaming.\n\nBy contrast, the HERO7 Black was introduced at the high-end level and primarily encompasses the features of the HERO6 Black with major improvements.   The HERO7 Black introduced a heavily improved electronic image stabilisation known as \"HyperSmooth\" video stabilization, which GoPro has advertised heavily as \"Gimbal-Like\", as its primary improvement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/what-is-hypersmooth|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This feature has resulted in a new time-lapse video feature known as \"TimeWarp\", essentially a hyperlapse mode, although the original time-lapse video mode continues to remain. The HERO7 Black also introduced a live-streaming feature that would live-stream content, in 720p, directly from the HERO7 Black to the user's social media account, provided the user keeps a nearby internet-connected device.\n\nDuring its release, the HERO7 Black largely competed with rival camera and camera accessory manufacturer [[DJI (company)|DJI]] which released the DJI OSMO Action, which also introduced a similar enhanced stabilization feature. \n\nOn February 28, 2019, GoPro released HERO7 Black in a new \"dusk white\" color. This is a limited edition and it has the same specs as in regular version and differs just in color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techlomedia.in/2019/03/gopro-launches-hero7-black-in-limited-edition-dusk-white-66045/|title=GoPro launches HERO7 Black in Limited Edition Dusk White|date=2019-03-01|website=TechloMedia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Most notably, the \"HyperSmooth\" feature introduced in the HERO7 Black was improved on and named \"HyperSmooth 2.0\", also resulting in an improvement of the TimeWarp feature introduced in the HERO7 Black. The HERO8 Black also improved the image quality, improving the HDR functions of the camera to allow HDR to assist the SuperPhoto function of the camera that automatically chooses what image processing to use such as high dynamic range (HDR). GoPro also reintroduced the field-of-view (FOV) functionality as, \"Digital Lenses\" which retains the original SuperView, Wide, Narrow, Linear FOV settings. Moreover, live-streaming now streams in 1080p instead of the HERO7 Black's 720p and the RAW imaging functionality has now been expanded for all photo modes. \n\nThe HERO8 Black largely introduced several new functions into the camera. Physically, the HERO8 Black now incorporates the connecting prongs that are used to connect accessories, directly onto the camera. Originally, the cameras would only be able to access the prongs if the cameras utilised either the frames (for cameras HERO5 to HERO7) or the protective cases for HERO4 and before. Moreover, the GoPro logo moved under the LCD screen to make way for extra microphones. More additions to the camera most notably were part of the software aspects of the camera. These included an option to switch between various settings presets, including standard, activity, cinematic and action shots and adjusting on-screen shortcuts of the user interface. Most notably as part of software, was the introduction of the night-lapse video, which similar to the time-lapse video mode, automatically stitches the frames captured by the camera at set intervals, however with the addition of improved low-light performance.  \n\nThe HERO8 Black also attempts to address vloggers who may wish to use the GoPro in such a manner. As such, GoPro has also introduced an external accessory known as the \"Media Mod\" which includes a USB Type-C port for supplying power to external microphones and accessories, a micro-HDMI port and a 3.5mm microphone port. Moreover, the accessory includes a mount to connect either external microphones, LEDs or an LCD screen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !!

The available resolutions are 4K60, 2.7K120 and 1080p240 unstabilized or 4K30, 2.7K60 and 1080p120 digitally stabilized.\n\n==Microphone support==\nThe following cameras have official external microphone support: <ref>[https://gopro.com/help/articles/question_answer/External-Microphone-Recommendations]</ref>\n* HERO 8\n* HERO7 Black\n* HERO6 Black\n* HERO5 Black\n* HERO5 Session\n* HERO4 Black\n* HERO3+\n* HERO3\n\nThe following cameras lack official support for an external microphone: \n* HERO (2018)\n* HERO (2014)\n* HERO+\n* HERO+LCD\n* HERO4 Session\n\nCameras up to and including the HERO 4 series can use a simple 3.5mm to Mini-USB adapter to connect external microphones and other audio sources. Starting with the HERO 5 Black, the digital-to-analogue converter is no longer part of the camera itself, and instead relies on an external USB-C Audio Adapter manufactured and sold by GoPro. Although simpler models exist, they do not trigger the required menu item in the camera to enable external sources, and hence do not provide an audio signal. The adapter provides an option to connect audio and power simultaneously. \n\nWhile the adapter still works with HERO 8 cameras, the battery door needs to be removed to expose the USB-C port. This can lead to power loss during operation when the camera is subjected to minor vibrations. Third party doors are available that expose the port while holding the battery firmly in place. GoPro's own Media Mod also provides access to an external audio source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV)\n* [[Egocentric vision]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|GoPro}}\n* {{Official website}}\n*Video [http://www.peachpit.com/promotions/gopro-videos-140450 gallery to show methods and examples] for book, ''GoPro Professional Filmmaking'' (2015 Peachpit Press).\n\n[[Category:2002 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Action cameras]]\n[[Category:Camcorders]]\n[[Category:Photography companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Video surveillance companies]]\n[[Category:2014 initial public offerings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{short description|American technology company}}\n{{about|the company|the song|Ride On (Texas Hippie Coalition album) }}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = GoPro, Inc.hh\n| logo = GoPro logo light.svg\n| former_names = Woodman Labs, Inc.\n| type = [[Public company|Public]]\n| traded_as = {{NASDAQ|GPRO}} (Class A)<br>[[Russell 2000 Index|Russell 2000 Component]]\n| industry = {{flatlist|\n*[[Technology]]\n*[[Videography]]\n*[[Consumer electronics]]\n}}\n| foundation = {{Start date and age|2002}}\n| founder = [[Nick Woodman]]\n| location_city = [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], [[California]]\n| area_served = Worldwide\n| key_people = {{plainlist|\n*[[Nick Woodman]] ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]])\n}}\n| products = {{flatlist|\n*[[Action camera]]\n*[[Video editing software]]\n*[[Mobile app]]\n}}\n| brands = Authentic design logo Andi Nugraha [[alt]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}\n| revenue = {{decrease}} [[United States dollar|US$]]1.18 billion (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\">{{cite web|title=GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results |url=https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/GoPro-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2017-Results/default.aspx |publisher=GoPro |accessdate=April 3, 2018 |location=San Mateo, California |date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n| operating_income = {{decrease}} \u2212US$163.46 million (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| net_income = {{decrease}} \u2212US$182.87 million (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| assets = {{decrease}} US$0.85 billion (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| equity = \n| num_employees = 964 (2019)\n| divisions = \n| subsid = {{plainlist|\n*[[CineForm]]\n*Replay\n*Splice\n}}\n| location_country = [[United States|U.S.]]\n| homepage = {{URL|https://www.gopro.com}}\n}}\n\n'''GoPro, Inc.'''<ref name=\"sec-filing\">{{cite web|title= FORM S-1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT \u2013 GOPRO, INC. |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000119312514204902/d552193ds1.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |access-date= May 21, 2014}}</ref> (marketed as '''GoPro''' and sometimes stylized as '''GoPRO''') is an [[United States|American]] [[technology]] company founded in 2002 by [[Nick Woodman]].

The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations (HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical) means that some accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3, so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 (and mostly for HERO3+, see below). Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations. However, a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations.\n\nThe HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2.<ref name=\"gopro.com\"/> For example, in 720p resolution with 25/30 fps, while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours, HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours, and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours (the Black Edition's \"most economical\" setting is 1080p/30 fps, so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime).\n\nThe Black Edition<ref>{{cite web|website=InsideHardware.it|url=http://www.insidehardware.it/fotografia/sportcam/3005-gopro-hero-3-black-edition-seconda-solo-a-se-stessa/|access-date=September 28, 2015|date=October 25, 2013|language=it|title=GoPro Hero 3 Black Edition: Seconda solo a se stessa|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035159/http://www.insidehardware.it/fotografia/sportcam/3005-gopro-hero-3-black-edition-seconda-solo-a-se-stessa/|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=September 2015}} has a new 12&nbsp;MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps, 2.7K video at 30 fps, 1440p at 48 fps, 1080p at 60 fps, 960p at 100 fps, 720p at 120 fps and [[Wide VGA#WVGA (800\u00d7480)|WVGA]] at 240 fps. The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote. The Black Edition cannot record at 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions. This is a deliberate firmware limitation, as the manufacturer does not expect that this high-end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates.\n\nThe Silver Edition uses the same 11&nbsp;MP sensor as the HERO2, and the White edition uses the same 5&nbsp;MP sensor as the HD HERO Original.\n\n=====HERO3+=====\n[[File:Timelapse Chicago Bike Ride March 30 2014.webm|thumbnail|right|300px|A timelapse recording one frame every 10 seconds with a GoPro HERO3 camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in [[Chicago]].

The HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware (called \"SuperView\") which increases the field of view. It has additional functions, including dynamic low light situation adjustment, higher-quality recording modes (higher bitrates, no white balance applied, etc.) etc. The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote. It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30\u201350% lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1.\n\nThe Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10 MP stills at up to 10 fps.<ref>[http://gopro.com/cameras/hd-hero3-silver-edition HERO3+ Silver Edition]</ref> In contrast to the Black Edition, the Silver Edition can record at 25/30 fps (or higher) in all supported resolutions. HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25%\u201350% longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition (they both use the same batteries).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The difference in runtime depends on the resolution/fps combination, and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording. The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras. The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1.\n\nThe HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]] for its contribution to television.<ref>Nick Kelley. \"[http://www.outsideonline.com/news-from-the-field/GoPro-Wins-an-Emmy.html GoPro Wins an Emmy]\", Outside, January 15, 2014</ref>\n\n====HERO====\nIn September 2014, GoPro released an entry level camera named simply \"HERO\", priced at $130, alongside the HERO4 Black and HERO4 Silver.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/29/6862843/hero4-black-silver-gopro-cameras|title=GoPro introduces a camera with a touchscreen and another that's just $129|work=The Verge|access-date=May 20, 2018}}</ref>\nThe GoPro Hero can capture 5mp still images and has a 5fps burst option.

The HERO7 Silver was intended as the mid-range camera, featuring 4K resolutions for video and time-lapse video resolutions and WDR in its photo mode. Initially, both the HERO7 White and Silver defaulted to a video resolution of 1440p with 1080p only available by cropping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.gopro.com/t5/Cameras/GoPro-Hero-7-White-Resolution-Change/m-p/256828#M74643|title=GoPro Hero 7 White Resolution Change|date=2018-11-01|website=community.gopro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This was met with considerable criticism, of which GoPro responded by releasing software updates to both cameras to allow for change in default resolution to 1080p.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/en/hk/update/hero7-silver|title=HERO7 SILVER|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> In contrast to the HERO7 Black, these cameras lacked most time-lapse photo modes, ProTune, wake-on-voice capabilities, H.265 formats and live-streaming.\n\nBy contrast, the HERO7 Black was introduced at the high-end level and primarily encompasses the features of the HERO6 Black with major improvements.   The HERO7 Black introduced a heavily improved electronic image stabilisation known as \"HyperSmooth\" video stabilization, which GoPro has advertised heavily as \"Gimbal-Like\", as its primary improvement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/what-is-hypersmooth|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This feature has resulted in a new time-lapse video feature known as \"TimeWarp\", essentially a hyperlapse mode, although the original time-lapse video mode continues to remain. The HERO7 Black also introduced a live-streaming feature that would live-stream content, in 720p, directly from the HERO7 Black to the user's social media account, provided the user keeps a nearby internet-connected device.\n\nDuring its release, the HERO7 Black largely competed with rival camera and camera accessory manufacturer [[DJI (company)|DJI]] which released the DJI OSMO Action, which also introduced a similar enhanced stabilization feature. \n\nOn February 28, 2019, GoPro released HERO7 Black in a new \"dusk white\" color. This is a limited edition and it has the same specs as in regular version and differs just in color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techlomedia.in/2019/03/gopro-launches-hero7-black-in-limited-edition-dusk-white-66045/|title=GoPro launches HERO7 Black in Limited Edition Dusk White|date=2019-03-01|website=TechloMedia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Most notably, the \"HyperSmooth\" feature introduced in the HERO7 Black was improved on and named \"HyperSmooth 2.0\", also resulting in an improvement of the TimeWarp feature introduced in the HERO7 Black. The HERO8 Black also improved the image quality, improving the HDR functions of the camera to allow HDR to assist the SuperPhoto function of the camera that automatically chooses what image processing to use such as high dynamic range (HDR). GoPro also reintroduced the field-of-view (FOV) functionality as, \"Digital Lenses\" which retains the original SuperView, Wide, Narrow, Linear FOV settings. Moreover, live-streaming now streams in 1080p instead of the HERO7 Black's 720p and the RAW imaging functionality has now been expanded for all photo modes. \n\nThe HERO8 Black largely introduced several new functions into the camera. Physically, the HERO8 Black now incorporates the connecting prongs that are used to connect accessories, directly onto the camera. Originally, the cameras would only be able to access the prongs if the cameras utilised either the frames (for cameras HERO5 to HERO7) or the protective cases for HERO4 and before. Moreover, the GoPro logo moved under the LCD screen to make way for extra microphones. More additions to the camera most notably were part of the software aspects of the camera. These included an option to switch between various settings presets, including standard, activity, cinematic and action shots and adjusting on-screen shortcuts of the user interface. Most notably as part of software, was the introduction of the night-lapse video, which similar to the time-lapse video mode, automatically stitches the frames captured by the camera at set intervals, however with the addition of improved low-light performance.  \n\nThe HERO8 Black also attempts to address vloggers who may wish to use the GoPro in such a manner. As such, GoPro has also introduced an external accessory known as the \"Media Mod\" which includes a USB Type-C port for supplying power to external microphones and accessories, a micro-HDMI port and a 3.5mm microphone port. Moreover, the accessory includes a mount to connect either external microphones, LEDs or an LCD screen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !!

The available resolutions are 4K60, 2.7K120 and 1080p240 unstabilized or 4K30, 2.7K60 and 1080p120 digitally stabilized.\n\n==Microphone support==\nThe following cameras have official external microphone support: <ref>[https://gopro.com/help/articles/question_answer/External-Microphone-Recommendations]</ref>\n* HERO 8\n* HERO7 Black\n* HERO6 Black\n* HERO5 Black\n* HERO5 Session\n* HERO4 Black\n* HERO3+\n* HERO3\n\nThe following cameras lack official support for an external microphone: \n* HERO (2018)\n* HERO (2014)\n* HERO+\n* HERO+LCD\n* HERO4 Session\n\nCameras up to and including the HERO 4 series can use a simple 3.5mm to Mini-USB adapter to connect external microphones and other audio sources. Starting with the HERO 5 Black, the digital-to-analogue converter is no longer part of the camera itself, and instead relies on an external USB-C Audio Adapter manufactured and sold by GoPro. Although simpler models exist, they do not trigger the required menu item in the camera to enable external sources, and hence do not provide an audio signal. The adapter provides an option to connect audio and power simultaneously. \n\nWhile the adapter still works with HERO 8 cameras, the battery door needs to be removed to expose the USB-C port. This can lead to power loss during operation when the camera is subjected to minor vibrations. Third party doors are available that expose the port while holding the battery firmly in place. GoPro's own Media Mod also provides access to an external audio source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV)\n* [[Egocentric vision]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|GoPro}}\n* {{Official website}}\n*Video [http://www.peachpit.com/promotions/gopro-videos-140450 gallery to show methods and examples] for book, ''GoPro Professional Filmmaking'' (2015 Peachpit Press).\n\n[[Category:2002 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Action cameras]]\n[[Category:Camcorders]]\n[[Category:Photography companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Video surveillance companies]]\n[[Category:2014 initial public offerings]]\n", "name_user": "Sauhard93", "label": "safe", "comment": "added extreme sports enthusiasts as users of GoPro device", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro"}
