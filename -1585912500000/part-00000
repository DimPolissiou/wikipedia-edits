Stewart's sister, [[Margaret Knox|Margaret]], was married to the reformer [[John Knox]].\n\nIn April 1573, James was sent as a \"pledge\" or hostage to England for the security of the English army and artillery sent to the \"Lang Siege\" of [[Edinburgh Castle]], which was held by supporters of [[Mary Queen of Scots]].

Stewart was rewarded as Tutor of Arran, with powers over the earldom of the mentally-ill [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran]], then made Earl of Arran on 22 April 1581.

The remains of the 19th-century Mandale Mine include the ruins of a pumphouse to drain the mines (using a steam Cornish pumping engine installed in 1847). Intensive mining led to underground flooding and the closure of Lathkill Mine. However. in 1825 James Bateman, the mine agent, brought in innovative equipment to overcome the flooding. A pumping engine was installed in a shaft under the building where he lived and known since as Bateman\u2019s House. In 1836 he also erected a large and powerful waterwheel. Nevertheless, the mine became unprofitable and closed in 1842. Mandale Rake eventually closed in 1852 although individual miners continued working it until 1867.<ref name=\"NNR\" /><ref>{{NHLE ||num=1016755|desc=Lathkill Dale and Mandale mines and soughs, Over Haddon |fewer-links=yes|access-date=24 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Access ==\n{{short description|Valley in the Derbyshire Peak District}}\nThere are parking areas near [[Monyash]] at the top end of Lathkill Dale.

They include ruins of engine houses and an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] and are a Scheduled Monument. In 1797 miners started to dig the Mandale Sough into the north side of the valley. The remains of the 19th-century Mandale Mine include the ruins of a pumphouse to drain the mines (using a steam Cornish pumping engine installed in 1847). Intensive mining led to underground flooding and the closure of Lathkill Mine. However. in 1825 James Bateman, the mine agent, brought in innovative equipment to overcome the flooding. A pumping engine was installed in a shaft under the building where he lived and known since as Bateman\u2019s House. In 1836 he also erected a large and powerful waterwheel. Nevertheless, the mine became unprofitable and closed in 1842. Mandale Rake eventually closed in 1852 although individual miners continued working it until 1867.<ref name=\"NNR\" /><ref>{{NHLE ||num=1016755|desc=Lathkill Dale and Mandale mines and soughs, Over Haddon |fewer-links=yes|access-date=24 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Access ==\n{{short description|Valley in the Derbyshire Peak District}}\nThere are parking areas near [[Monyash]] at the top end of Lathkill Dale.

On graduation from Staff College he served as a [[military attach\u00e9]] in [[Brussels]] and [[The Hague]], following which he was promoted to [[Lieutenant-colonel (British Army)|Lieutenant-Colonel]]. He served as a staff officer during the [[Second Boer War]] in [[South Africa]] 1899\u20131901, and was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) during the conflict.<ref name=LG27359>{{London Gazette |issue=27359 |date=27 September 1901 |page=6303}}</ref> \n\nAfter returning from the war, what had appeared to be a promising military career was cut short during a posting to [[Egypt]] in 1902 where Repington re-engaged a romantic affair dating back to the late 1890s with Lady Garstin, the wife of a British official, [[William Edmund Garstin|William Garstin]], which became public. He was reprimanded by senior military authorities, as he had given a written promise \"upon his honour as a soldier and gentleman\" previously to have no further dealings with her. He had given this \"parole\" to [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]] (a friend of Mary Garstin\u2019s late father, who had been asked by her family to get involved) on 9 October 1899. Repington told Wilson \u2013 at Chieveley, near Colenso in South Africa, during the 2nd Boer War campaign in February 1900 \u2013 that he regarded himself as absolved from his promise to give Mary Garstin up after learning that her husband had been spreading rumours of his other infidelities. During the divorce proceedings, it was revealed that Repington had ignored warnings about his behaviour (i.e had \"broken his parole\") and had continued with the affair. Wilson was unable or unwilling to confirm Repington\u2019s claim that he had released him from his parole in South Africa. Repington believed that Wilson had betrayed a fellow soldier in this, but was forced to resign his commission and retire from the British Army in social disgrace with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on 15 January 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval & Military intelligence |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=3 December 1901 |page_number=6 |issue=36628| }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette | issue=27397 | date=14 January 1902 |page=297}}</ref>  In a subsequent career as a journalist, specializing in military matters, he was a strong critic of Wilson whenever the opportunity presented itself.<ref name=\"Reid 2001, 163\"/><ref>Jeffery 2006, pp.49\u201353</ref>\n\n==Military correspondent==\nOn returning to London, he took a position as a military correspondent with the ''[[Morning Post]]'' (1902\u20131904), and ''[[The Times]]'' (1904\u20131918). His reports as a [[war correspondent]] from the scene of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904\u20131905 were later published as a book entitled ''The War in the Far East''. Repington was an advocate of the creation of a larger British Army (at the expense of the then all-powerful, in Edwardian England, [[Royal Navy]]), which brought him into conflict with Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Fisher]]).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/repington.htm |title=Who's Who \u2013 Charles Repington |work=First World War.com |year=2013 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>  He supported the creation of a British Army General Staff pre-World War 1, feared a German \"bolt from the blue\" (i.e. an attack upon the [[British Isles]] by the [[German Empire]] before a declaration of hostilities), and was a \"Westerner\" (i.e., supported during the war the defeat of the German Empire by heavy fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] rather than pursuing an alternative indirect strategy). According to his memoir ''Vestigia'', an unnamed Radical paper once called him \"the gorgeous Wreckington\", but this was a personal attack in reference to his divorce scandal.\n\nDuring [[World War 1]] Repington relied on his personal contacts in the British Army and the [[War Office]] for his information, and his early reporting of the war acquired important material from his personal friendship with the first Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], Sir [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]], via which he was able to visit the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the opening moves of the conflict in late 1914, at a time when most of his rival journalists were prohibited by the British Government from going to the war front. \n\nRepington appears to be the first person to have used the term [[World War I|\"First World War\"]] on 10 September 1918 in a conversation noted in his diary, hoping that title would serve as a reminder and warning that the [[World War II|Second World War]] was a possibility in the future.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===\"Shells Scandal\"===\nIn May 1915 Repington personally witnessed the failed British attack at [[Battle of Aubers Ridge|Aubers Ridge]] in [[Artois]], and was particularly moved by the casualties sustained by his old Corps the Rifle Brigade in the action. He dispatched a telegram to ''The Times'' blaming a lack of artillery ammunition available for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], which, despite being heavily censored, was printed after Sir John French's aide [[Brinsley Fitzgerald]] assured him of French's tacit approval. Repington later emphatically denied that French had spoken to him on the issue, but French had in fact supplied Repington with information for the story.<ref>Repington, ''The First World War 1914\u20131918, Vol.1'', London: Constable, pp.36\u201337</ref><ref>Holmes 2004, p.287</ref> The appearance of this story in ''The Times'' and later in the ''[[The Daily Mail|Daily Mail]]'', resulted in a [[Shell Crisis of 1915|political scandal]] which contributed to the creation of a separate [[Ministry of Munitions]] under the future Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and a reduction in the power of the [[Secretary of State for War|War Secretary]] [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. Such blatant meddling in politics also damaged the authority Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the B.E.F. and contributed to his enforced resignation from the post at the end of 1915. The affair had given Repington substantial influence over military policy via his newspaper reports, but he was personally temporarily prohibited from visiting the Western Front again until March 1916.\n\n===Prosecution under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914===\nHe resigned from ''The Times'' in January 1918 due to a disagreement with its proprietor, [[Lord Northcliffe]], who after the German counterattack at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] had distanced himself from Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig]]'s conduct of the war, and required journalists in his employ to do the same. Repington, unwilling to go along with this editorial policy returned to ''[[The Morning Post]]''.<ref>'The Private Papers of Douglas Haig 1914\u20131919' (1952), edited by Robert Blake (Pub. Eyre & Spottiswoode), P.48.</ref> On 16 February 1918, as part of the power struggle between Lloyd George (now [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General [[William Robertson (field marshal)|Robertson]], Repington along with the ''Morning Post's'' editor [[Howell Arthur Gwynne]] appeared at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] charged with having contravened [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914|DORA]] Regulation 18 by publishing articles (on 11 February 1918) disclosing Lloyd George's attempts to bypass Robertson by setting up [[Supreme War Council|a rival staff]] under [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]] at [[Versailles]]; Lloyd George's plans to re-focus British military effort away from the Western Front towards defeating the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Government's failure to keep the British Army on the Western Front up to required troop strength for offensive operations. Repington claimed that the crowd in attendance was the largest since the trial of [[Hawley Harvey Crippen|Dr Crippen]], and later claimed that Robertson had told him that he could no more afford to be seen with him than either of them \"could afford to be seen walking down Regent Street with a whore\". Repington was found guilty and was fined.<ref>Bonham-Carter 1963, p352-3</ref>\n\nRepington was also a casualty of the [[Maurice Debate]]. On 12 May a two-page editorial in ''[[The Observer]]'' (written by the editor [[James Louis Garvin|JL Garvin]] at the behest of the owner [[Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor|Waldorf Astor]]) attacked him and his reputation never fully recovered.<ref>Grigg 2002, p500</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nAfter the end of the war Repington joined the staff of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', and subsequently published several books. These works included ''The First World War'' (1920), and ''After the War'' (1922), which were bestsellers, but cost Repington friendships for his apparent willingness to report what others considered to have been private conversations.\n\n==Death==\nHe died on 25 May 1925 in his 68th year at Pembroke Lodge in [[Hove]], [[East Sussex]]. His body was buried at Hove Cemetery, Old Shoreham Road.\n\n==Personal life==\nRepington married Melloney Scobell (1860\u20131934) in London on 11 February 1892. The marriage produced three children: Charles (died in infancy in August 1889), Melloney (1891\u20131965), and Violet (died 1898 in her 3rd year). He subsequently married Mary North (formerly Lady Garstin), the marriage producing one daughter, Laetitia (1911\u20132004).<ref>{{cite web |title=Biographical profile of Charles Repington |url=http://www.rippington.me.uk/indiI3820.html |website=Rippington Family |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n* Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG), 29 November 1900.

He had given this \"parole\" to [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]] (a friend of Mary Garstin\u2019s late father, who had been asked by her family to get involved) on 9 October 1899. Repington told Wilson \u2013 at Chieveley, near Colenso in South Africa, during the 2nd Boer War campaign in February 1900 \u2013 that he regarded himself as absolved from his promise to give Mary Garstin up after learning that her husband had been spreading rumours of his other infidelities. During the divorce proceedings, it was revealed that Repington had ignored warnings about his behaviour (i.e had \"broken his parole\") and had continued with the affair. Wilson was unable or unwilling to confirm Repington\u2019s claim that he had released him from his parole in South Africa. Repington believed that Wilson had betrayed a fellow soldier in this, but was forced to resign his commission and retire from the British Army in social disgrace with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel on 15 January 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval & Military intelligence |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=3 December 1901 |page_number=6 |issue=36628| }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette | issue=27397 | date=14 January 1902 |page=297}}</ref>  In a subsequent career as a journalist, specializing in military matters, he was a strong critic of Wilson whenever the opportunity presented itself.<ref name=\"Reid 2001, 163\"/><ref>Jeffery 2006, pp.49\u201353</ref>\n\n==Military correspondent==\nOn returning to London, he took a position as a military correspondent with the ''[[Morning Post]]'' (1902\u20131904), and ''[[The Times]]'' (1904\u20131918). His reports as a [[war correspondent]] from the scene of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904\u20131905 were later published as a book entitled ''The War in the Far East''. Repington was an advocate of the creation of a larger British Army (at the expense of the then all-powerful, in Edwardian England, [[Royal Navy]]), which brought him into conflict with Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Fisher]]).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/repington.htm |title=Who's Who \u2013 Charles Repington |work=First World War.com |year=2013 |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref>  He supported the creation of a British Army General Staff pre-World War 1, feared a German \"bolt from the blue\" (i.e. an attack upon the [[British Isles]] by the [[German Empire]] before a declaration of hostilities), and was a \"Westerner\" (i.e., supported during the war the defeat of the German Empire by heavy fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] rather than pursuing an alternative indirect strategy). According to his memoir ''Vestigia'', an unnamed Radical paper once called him \"the gorgeous Wreckington\", but this was a personal attack in reference to his divorce scandal.\n\nDuring [[World War 1]] Repington relied on his personal contacts in the British Army and the [[War Office]] for his information, and his early reporting of the war acquired important material from his personal friendship with the first Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], Sir [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]], via which he was able to visit the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the opening moves of the conflict in late 1914, at a time when most of his rival journalists were prohibited by the British Government from going to the war front. \n\nRepington appears to be the first person to have used the term [[World War I|\"First World War\"]] on 10 September 1918 in a conversation noted in his diary, hoping that title would serve as a reminder and warning that the [[World War II|Second World War]] was a possibility in the future.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===\"Shells Scandal\"===\nIn May 1915 Repington personally witnessed the failed British attack at [[Battle of Aubers Ridge|Aubers Ridge]] in [[Artois]], and was particularly moved by the casualties sustained by his old Corps the Rifle Brigade in the action. He dispatched a telegram to ''The Times'' blaming a lack of artillery ammunition available for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], which, despite being heavily censored, was printed after Sir John French's aide [[Brinsley Fitzgerald]] assured him of French's tacit approval. Repington later emphatically denied that French had spoken to him on the issue, but French had in fact supplied Repington with information for the story.<ref>Repington, ''The First World War 1914\u20131918, Vol.1'', London: Constable, pp.36\u201337</ref><ref>Holmes 2004, p.287</ref> The appearance of this story in ''The Times'' and later in the ''[[The Daily Mail|Daily Mail]]'', resulted in a [[Shell Crisis of 1915|political scandal]] which contributed to the creation of a separate [[Ministry of Munitions]] under the future Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], and a reduction in the power of the [[Secretary of State for War|War Secretary]] [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]. Such blatant meddling in politics also damaged the authority Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief of the B.E.F. and contributed to his enforced resignation from the post at the end of 1915. The affair had given Repington substantial influence over military policy via his newspaper reports, but he was personally temporarily prohibited from visiting the Western Front again until March 1916.\n\n===Prosecution under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914===\nHe resigned from ''The Times'' in January 1918 due to a disagreement with its proprietor, [[Lord Northcliffe]], who after the German counterattack at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] had distanced himself from Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig]]'s conduct of the war, and required journalists in his employ to do the same. Repington, unwilling to go along with this editorial policy returned to ''[[The Morning Post]]''.<ref>'The Private Papers of Douglas Haig 1914-1919' (1952), edited by Robert Blake (Pub. Eyre & Spottiswoode), P.48.</ref> On 16 February 1918, as part of the power struggle between Lloyd George (now [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General [[William Robertson (field marshal)|Robertson]], Repington along with the ''Morning Post's'' editor [[Howell Arthur Gwynne]] appeared at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] charged with having contravened [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914|DORA]] Regulation 18 by publishing articles (on 11 February 1918) disclosing Lloyd George's attempts to bypass Robertson by setting up [[Supreme War Council|a rival staff]] under [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]] at [[Versailles]]; Lloyd George's plans to re-focus British military effort away from the Western Front towards defeating the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the Government's failure to keep the British Army on the Western Front up to required troop strength for offensive operations. Repington claimed that the crowd in attendance was the largest since the trial of [[Hawley Harvey Crippen|Dr Crippen]], and later claimed that Robertson had told him that he could no more afford to be seen with him than either of them \"could afford to be seen walking down Regent Street with a whore\". Repington was found guilty and was fined.<ref>Bonham-Carter 1963, p352-3</ref>\n\nRepington was also a casualty of the [[Maurice Debate]]. On 12 May a two-page editorial in ''[[The Observer]]'' (written by the editor [[James Louis Garvin|JL Garvin]] at the behest of the owner [[Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor|Waldorf Astor]]) attacked him and his reputation never fully recovered.<ref>Grigg 2002, p500</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nAfter the end of the war Repington joined the staff of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', and subsequently published several books. These works included ''The First World War'' (1920), and ''After the War'' (1922), which were bestsellers, but cost Repington friendships for his apparent willingness to report what others considered to have been private conversations.\n\n==Death==\nHe died on 25 May 1925 in his 68th year at Pembroke Lodge in [[Hove]], [[East Sussex]]. His body was buried at Hove Cemetery, Old Shoreham Road.\n\n==Personal life==\nRepington married Melloney Scobell (1860-1934) in London on 11 February 1892. The marriage produced three children: Charles (died in infancy in August 1889), Melloney (1891-1965), and Violet (died 1898 in her 3rd year). He subsequently married Mary North (formerly Lady Garstin), the marriage producing one daughter, Laetitia (1911-2004).<ref>Biographical profile of Charles Repington, 'Rippington.me.uk' website (2020). http://www.rippington.me.uk/indiI3820.html</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n* Companion of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG), 29 November 1900.

It was a pink [[monster]] with [[tentacle]]-like arms and several eyes (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) who was causing all the commotion. Dexter quickly grabbed his [[raygun]] and started shooting at the monster to no avail, so he grabbed a ray machine that blasted one ray bolt at the monster, but it went right through him. Dexter pulled his final trick by dropping a bomb onto the monster, it didn't work. With no options left, Dexter begins writing a letter to his past self as he is dragged away closer and closer to the monster, but Dexter manages to get the letter to Dee Dee and tells her to get into his time machine. She gets inside and goes into the past as Dexter reminds himself that he's doomed.\n\nDee Dee arrives at 3:00 to see past Dexter writing something, she quickly warns and tells him to read the letter she had brought to him, but past Dexter refuses to believe that he would send his \"idiot sister\" back in time for any reason. Dee Dee starts crying and goes outside to stumble upon past Dee Dee, past Dee Dee comforts Dee Dee and tells her to forget about \"mean old Dexter and his stupid message\". Past Dexter looks outside to find two Dee Dees and quickly runs outside to ask Dee Dee to give him the message, Dee Dee agrees until past Dee Dee tells her what past Dexter had done to her. Dexter tells them that he would do anything to obtain the letter, so the two Dee Dees make a suggestion that Dexter refuses and say that he would do anything except for that, but then the two Dee Dees said in sync, \"It's that or no message from the future.\" as Dexter looks in despair.\n\nThe clock reads 3:45 as we see the two Dee Dees on a stage wearing [[ballet]] [[dance costumes]] as they do a few ballet moves. Dexter moves on stage with a pink and obviously chosen ballet dance costume annoyed and furious, he is then proceeded to be harassed and tormented with several kicks to the face, several slaps to the face, and a [[mallet]] to the head.

Since 1996, the park festival has been based at Preston Park.\n\nPride events have traditionally been an environment for celebrating the diversity of the lesbian and gay community. In 2002 Pride in Brighton & Hove agreed to explicitly include and reference the trans community making that year's Pride for the first time an LGBT event. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gscene.com/news/putting-the-t-in-lgb-at-brighton-pride-2002/|title=Putting the 'T' in LGBT Brighton Pride 2002|work=Gscene.com|date=25 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Brighton Pride became a charity, to develop the event, to advance public education \u2013 by raising awareness of issues affecting LGBT people, and to make grants and donations to other charitable and voluntary organisations in the area.

Since 1996, the park festival has been based at Preston Park.\n\nPride events have traditionally been an environment for celebrating the diversity of the lesbian and gay community. In 2002 Pride in Brighton & Hove agreed to explicitly include and reference the trans community making that year's Pride for the first time an LGBT event. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gscene.com/news/putting-the-t-in-lgb-at-brighton-pride-2002/|title=Putting the 'T' in LGBT Brighton Pride 2002|work=Gscene.com|date=25 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Brighton Pride became a charity, to develop the event, to advance public education \u2013 by raising awareness of issues affecting LGBT people, and to make grants and donations to other charitable and voluntary organisations in the area.  In 2011, organisers controversially introduced an entry fee to the park festival, as the company was in financial ruin and ran up over \u00a3200,000 in debt.<ref>{{cite

It is situated on the Southern Sub-[[Carpathians]], on the banks of the river [[Jiu (river)|Jiu]]. Eight localities are administered by the city: B\u00e2rse\u0219ti, Dr\u0103goieni, Iezureni, Polata, Preajba Mare, Romane\u0219ti, Slobozia and Ursa\u021bi.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Old Jiu Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jiu Bridge]] at the turn of the 20th century.]]\n\nThe city takes its name from the river [[Jiu River|Jiu]], which runs through it. In antiquity, there was a [[Dacians|Dacian]] village  in around the location of today's city surrounded by forests. After the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquests of Oltenia (101-102), military units were stationed around the roads that connected different important routes at the time. During the digging of the T\u00e2rgu Jiu - [[Rovinari]] railroad, mosaics, coins, ceramics and Roman bricks were found in the south-eastern part of the city.<ref>[http://www.cultura.abt.ro/Files/GenericFiles/LMI-2010.pdf  Ministerul Culturii \u015fi Patrimoniului Na\u0163ional, Lista Monumentelor Istorice, 2010] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120610112533/http://www.cultura.abt.ro/Files/GenericFiles/LMI-2010.pdf |date=2012-06-10 }}</ref> This and ancient testimonies support the idea that T\u00e2rgu Jiu was a commercial town (a ''[[vicus]]'') while under the [[Roman Empire]]'s rule. A very important route that connects the Danube to [[Transylvania]] runs through the city, so historians believe that part of the Roman army under [[Trajan]]'s leadership stayed and then passed in the actual location of the city.\n\nAfter the [[Aurelian|271 withdrawal]] of the Roman army, the city remained in the Latin influence zone, mainly because of [[Constantine The Great]]'s involvement in [[Oltenia]] which he sought to bring under imperial rule. The importance of keeping this zone under Rome's control was underlined by Constantine's decision to build a [[Constantine's Bridge (Danube)|second bridge]] over the [[Danube]] between today's [[Corabia]] (then [[Sucidava]]) and the Bulgarian city of [[Gigen]]. It was over 2400 meters long, one of the longest of all time.\n\nThis territory was under [[Litovoi]]'s rule, a [[Vlachs|Vlach]] ([[Romanians|Romanian]]) ''[[voivode]]'' in the 13th century, whose territory comprised northern Oltenia. He is mentioned for the first time in a diploma issued by king [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] (1235\u20131270) on 2 July 1247. In 1277 (or between 1277 and 1280), Litovoi was at war with the Hungarians over lands King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] (1272\u20131290) claimed for the crown, but for which Litovoi refused to pay tribute. Litovoi was killed in battle.\n\nThe first written account of the city appears in a document dating from 23 November 1406 in an order signed by [[Mircea cel Batran]]. Since 1497, the city has been the seat of [[Gorj County]].\n\n[[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], who had lived here as a boy, was commissioned to contribute to a memorial monument to the fighters of [[World War I]], called Calea Eroilor, \"Heroes' Street\", which was finished in 1938. His large sculptures are now the main tourist attractions in T\u00e2rgu Jiu: [[The Table of Silence]], [[Stool Alley]], [[The Gate of the Kiss]], and [[The Endless Column]]. The latter is shown in the middle section of the city's coat of arms.\n\nIn the 1950s the Communist mayor planned to demolish Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i's \"bourgeois\" art. The plan was not carried out.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, coal surface mining contributed to a rapid population growth. Other local industries include wood, machine building, textiles, glassware and construction materials ([[cement]], [[brick]]s and [[tile]]s).\n\nIn 1992, a university was founded and named after Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe Coat of Arms of T\u00e2rgu Jiu consists of a Shield with seven towers. In the centre of the Shield lies the representation of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]'s ''[[Endless Column]]'', a symbol of Romanian art and culture. In the right and left sides of the shield lies a golden lion holding a black sword, \"guarding\" the Column. The Lion is the ancient symbol of [[Oltenia]], thought to be originating from the logo of one Rome's Legions station in this aria, the [[13th Legion]] \"Gemina (Legio XIII Gemina)\". It represents the bravery and combative spirit of the city's inhabitants.\n\n==Population==\n*1889: 4,076\n*1900: 6,634\n*1940: 26,634\n*2002: 96,641\n*2011: 80,548\nAs of 2011 census, 78,553 inhabitants live within the city limits:<ref name=\"INSSER\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gorj.insse.ro/phpfiles/GORJ%20COMUNICAT%20REZULTATE%20PROVIZORII%20RPL%202011.pdf|title=Recensamantul populatiei si Locuintelor 2011|date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2012|publisher=INSSE|language=Romanian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121101301/http://www.gorj.insse.ro/phpfiles/GORJ%20COMUNICAT%20REZULTATE%20PROVIZORII%20RPL%202011.pdf|archivedate=21 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 96,29% were [[Romanians]] (75,640 people), 3,41% [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Romani people|Roma people]]  (2.683 people) and 0,20% others.\n\n==Transport==\n*The public transport system of T\u00e2rgu Jiu consists of 2 [[trolleybus]] lines and 8 bus lines.

It is situated on the Southern Sub-[[Carpathians]], on the banks of the river [[Jiu (river)|Jiu]]. Eight localities are administered by the city: B\u00e2rse\u0219ti, Dr\u0103goieni, Iezureni, Polata, Preajba Mare, Romane\u0219ti, Slobozia and Ursa\u021bi.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Old Jiu Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jiu Bridge]] at the turn of the 20th century.]]\n\nThe city takes its name from the river [[Jiu River|Jiu]], which runs through it. In antiquity, there was a [[Dacians|Dacian]] village  in around the location of today's city surrounded by forests. After the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquests of Oltenia (101-102), military units were stationed around the roads that connected different important routes at the time. During the digging of the T\u00e2rgu Jiu - [[Rovinari]] railroad, mosaics, coins, ceramics and Roman bricks were found in the south-eastern part of the city.<ref>[http://www.cultura.abt.ro/Files/GenericFiles/LMI-2010.pdf  Ministerul Culturii \u015fi Patrimoniului Na\u0163ional, Lista Monumentelor Istorice, 2010] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120610112533/http://www.cultura.abt.ro/Files/GenericFiles/LMI-2010.pdf |date=2012-06-10 }}</ref> This and ancient testimonies support the idea that T\u00e2rgu Jiu was a commercial town (a ''[[vicus]]'') while under the [[Roman Empire]]'s rule. A very important route that connects the Danube to [[Transylvania]] runs through the city, so historians believe that part of the Roman army under [[Trajan]]'s leadership stayed and then passed in the actual location of the city.\n\nAfter the [[Aurelian|271 withdrawal]] of the Roman army, the city remained in the Latin influence zone, mainly because of [[Constantine The Great]]'s involvement in [[Oltenia]] which he sought to bring under imperial rule. The importance of keeping this zone under Rome's control was underlined by Constantine's decision to build a [[Constantine's Bridge (Danube)|second bridge]] over the [[Danube]] between today's [[Corabia]] (then [[Sucidava]]) and the Bulgarian city of [[Gigen]]. It was over 2400 meters long, one of the longest of all time.\n\nThis territory was under [[Litovoi]]'s rule, a [[Vlachs|Vlach]] ([[Romanians|Romanian]]) ''[[voivode]]'' in the 13th century, whose territory comprised northern Oltenia. He is mentioned for the first time in a diploma issued by king [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] (1235\u20131270) on 2 July 1247. In 1277 (or between 1277 and 1280), Litovoi was at war with the Hungarians over lands King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] (1272\u20131290) claimed for the crown, but for which Litovoi refused to pay tribute. Litovoi was killed in battle.\n\nThe first written account of the city appears in a document dating from 23 November 1406 in an order signed by [[Mircea cel Batran]]. Since 1497, the city has been the seat of [[Gorj County]].\n\n[[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], who had lived here as a boy, was commissioned to contribute to a memorial monument to the fighters of [[World War I]], called Calea Eroilor, \"Heroes' Street\", which was finished in 1938. His large sculptures are now the main tourist attractions in T\u00e2rgu Jiu: [[The Table of Silence]], [[Stool Alley]], [[The Gate of the Kiss]], and [[The Endless Column]]. The latter is shown in the middle section of the city's coat of arms.\n\nIn the 1950s the Communist mayor planned to demolish Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i's \"bourgeois\" art. The plan was not carried out.\n\nStarting in the 1960s, coal surface mining contributed to a rapid population growth. Other local industries include wood, machine building, textiles, glassware and construction materials ([[cement]], [[brick]]s and [[tile]]s).\n\nIn 1992, a university was founded and named after Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe Coat of Arms of T\u00e2rgu Jiu consists of a Shield with seven towers. In the centre of the Shield lies the representation of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]'s ''[[Endless Column]]'', a symbol of Romanian art and culture. In the right and left sides of the shield lies a golden lion holding a black sword, \"guarding\" the Column. The Lion is the ancient symbol of [[Oltenia]], thought to be originating from the logo of one Rome's Legions station in this aria, the [[13th Legion]] \"Gemina (Legio XIII Gemina)\". It represents the bravery and combative spirit of the city's inhabitants.\n\n==Population==\n*1889: 4,076\n*1900: 6,634\n*1940: 26,634\n*2002: 96,641\n*2011: 80,548\nAs of 2011 census, 78,553 inhabitants live within the city limits:<ref name=\"INSSER\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gorj.insse.ro/phpfiles/GORJ%20COMUNICAT%20REZULTATE%20PROVIZORII%20RPL%202011.pdf|title=Recensamantul populatiei si Locuintelor 2011|date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2012|publisher=INSSE|language=Romanian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121101301/http://www.gorj.insse.ro/phpfiles/GORJ%20COMUNICAT%20REZULTATE%20PROVIZORII%20RPL%202011.pdf|archivedate=21 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 96,29% were [[Romanians]] (75,640 people), 3,41% [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Romani people|Roma people]]  (2.683 people) and 0,20% others.\n\n==Transport==\n*The public transport system of T\u00e2rgu Jiu consists of 2 [[trolleybus]] lines and 8 bus lines.

The cars are released at one-minute intervals with the larger professional class cars going before the slower cars, in the Mille Miglia, however the smaller displacement slower cars started first. Each car number related to their allocated start time. For example, [[Giuseppe Farina]]\u2019s car had the number 606, he left Brescia at 6:06am, while the first cars had started late in the evening on the previous day.<ref name=\"racingsportscars.com\"/>\n\nThe previous August, Italian racing legend [[Tazio Nuvolari]] died.

After nine and half hours, all the cars were on their way to Rome.<ref name=\"racingsportscars.com\"/><ref name=\"grandprixhistory.org\"/>\n \nThe Lancias took the early lead, with Taruffi's D24 controlling the pace, averaging 108.9&nbsp;mph, on the opening stages into [[Ravenna]], with a lead of 90 seconds, over Ascari and Castellotti. The Ferrari of Maglioli was back in fourth. On the run into [[Rome]], the Lancia of Castellotti developed [[distributor]] problems, and was forced into retirement, moving Maglioli into third. Further trouble hit the Lancia of Taruffi, when his sprung an oil leak and he soon retired. Ascari had taken it easy in the early stages, now assumed the lead.<ref name=\"racingsportscars.com\"/><ref name=\"grandprixhistory.org\"/>\n\nOn the run back to Brescia, Ascari's Lancia suffered a throttle spring return failure, and this was temporarily replaced by a rubber band. This and other problems started to affect the Lancia and by the time Ascari reached [[Florence]], he had enough and wanted to retire from the event. It was only after a long stop for repairs, he was persuaded to continue.

It was the 21st [[Mille Miglia]] and the third race of the [[1954 World Sportscar Championship]]. The race was held on the public roads of [[Italy]] on 2 May 1954 using a route based on a round trip between [[Brescia]] and [[Rome]], with the start and finish in Brescia.<ref name=\"racingsportscars.com\">http://www.racingsportscars.com/race/Mille_Miglia-1954-05-02.html</ref> It was won by [[Alberto Ascari]] driving a [[Lancia D24]].\n\nAs in previous year, the event is not strictly a race against each other, as is a race against the clock. The cars are released at one-minute intervals with the larger professional class cars going before the slower cars, in the Mille Miglia, however the smaller displacement slower cars started first. Each car number related to their allocated start time. For example, [[Giuseppe Farina]]\u2019s car had the number 606, he left Brescia at 6:06am, while the first cars had started late in the evening on the previous day.<ref name=\"racingsportscars.com\"/>\n\nThe previous August, Italian racing legend [[Tazio Nuvolari]] died. As a mark of respect, the route of this race, near it finish would pass through [[Mantua]], where he was a resident.<ref name=\"grandprixhistory.org\">http://www.grandprixhistory.org/mille_miglia_1954.htm</ref>\n\n==Report==\n\n===Entry===\nA total of 483 cars were entered for the event, across nine classes based on engine sizes, ranging from up to 750cc to over 2.0 litre, for Grand Touring Cars, Touring Cars and Sport Cars. Of these, 378 cars started the event.<ref name=\"racingsportscars.com\"/>\n\nFresh from their loss in Florida at the [[1954 12 Hours of Sebring|12 Hours of Sebring]], [[Lancia]] entered in force with four newly revised [[Lancia D24|D24]] cars, these were piloted by [[Piero Taruffi]], [[Alberto Ascari]], [[Eugenio Castellotti]] and [[Gino Valenzano]]. The cars were modified by race car designer [[Vittorio Jano]].

For 1954, the Mille Miglia was a round of the World Sports Car Championship; the home teams faced strong challengers. From Great Britain, came [[Aston Martin]] and [[Austin-Healey]], and West Germany sent [[Porsche]]s.<ref name=\"grandprixhistory.org\"/><ref>http://www.racingsportscars.com/results/Mille_Miglia_1954-05-02.html{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAlso amongst the entry was the four-time winner, [[Clemente Biondetti]], but by the time of the race, he was very sick man, fighting cancer, and only had a few months left to live.<ref name=\"grandprixhistory.org\"/>\n\n===Race===\n\nThe race started at 21:01 on 1 May, when [[Domenico Stragliotto]] and [[Adolfo Montorio]] departed Brescia in their [[Isetta|Iso Isetta]]. The faster car would leave the following morning, when conditions were foggy mixed with little rain. After nine and half hours, all the cars were on their way to Rome.<ref name=\"racingsportscars.com\"/><ref name=\"grandprixhistory.org\"/>\n \nThe Lancias took the early lead, with Taruffi\u2019s D24 controlling the pace, averaging 108.9&nbsp;mph, on the opening stages into [[Ravenna]], with a lead of 90 seconds, over Ascari and Castellotti. The Ferrari of Maglioli was back in fourth. On the run into [[Rome]], the Lancia of Castellotti developed [[distributor]] problems, and was forced into retirement, moving Maglioli into third. Further trouble hit the Lancia of Taruffi, when his sprung an oil leak and he soon retired. Ascari had taken it easy in the early stages, now assumed the lead.<ref name=\"racingsportscars.com\"/><ref name=\"grandprixhistory.org\"/>\n\nOn the run back to Brescia, Ascari\u2019s Lancia suffered a throttle spring return failure, and this was temporarily replaced by a rubber band. This and other problems started to affect the Lancia and by the time Ascari reached [[Florence]], he had enough and wanted to retire from the event. It was only after a long stop for repairs, he was persuaded to continue. By [[Bologna]], all the top [[Scuderia Ferrari]] cars were out, and the path was clear for Ascari to win.<ref name=\"grandprixhistory.org\"/>\n\nFor Ferrari, they had not lost a Mille Miglia since 1947, but this they were sounded thrashed by the team from [[Turin|Torino]], with Ascari, winning in a time of 11hr 26:10mins., averaging a speed of 72.80&nbsp;mph. 33:51mins adrift in second place was [[Ferrari Monza|Ferrari 500 Mondial]] of Vittorio Marzotto, who salvaged some honour for [[Maranello]] marque with second place and a class win. The third different car on the podium was the Maserati of Musso. Another Ferrari came home in fourth, driven by Biondetti, in what was to be his last Mille Miglia; he was lifted exhausted from the car at the finish.<ref name=\"grandprixhistory.org\"/><ref>http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/winners/&race=mm</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.teamdan.com/archive/wsc/1954/54mille.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924121141/http://www.teamdan.com/archive/wsc/1954/54mille.html |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=Venables>David Venables, \u201cThe Classic Motor Racing Circuits of Europe\" (Ian Allan Publishing, {{ISBN|0 7110 3481 8}}, 2010)</ref>\n\nWith the British attack failing to make it back to Brescia, it was left to the Germans to provide some opposition to the Italian teams. Encountering a lowered gate at a railway crossing, the Porsche driver, [[Hans Herrmann]] drove his low [[Porsche 550|550 Spyder]] under it, narrowly missing an express train.

Although it is only known from fragmentary remains, ''Argentinosaurus'' is one of the largest-known land animals of all time, if not the largest, with length estimates ranging from {{convert|30|to|39.7|m|ft}} and weight estimates from {{convert|50|to|100|t|ST}}. It was a member of [[Titanosauria]], the dominant group of sauropods during the Cretaceous.\n\nThe first ''Argentinosaurus'' bone was discovered in 1987 by a farmer on his farm near the city of [[Plaza Huincul]]. A scientific excavation of the site led by the Argentine palaeontologist [[Jos\u00e9 Bonaparte]] was conducted in 1989, yielding several back [[vertebra]]e and parts of a [[sacrum]]\u2014fused vertebrae between the back and tail vertebrae. Additional specimens include a complete [[femur]] (thigh bone) and the shaft of another. ''Argentinosaurus'' was named by Bonaparte and the Argentine palaeontologist [[Rodolfo Coria]] in 1993; it contains a single [[species]], '''''A. huinculensis'''''. The generic name ''Argentinosaurus'' means \"Argentine lizard\", and the specific name ''huinculensis'' refers to its place of discovery, Plaza Huincul.\n\nThe fragmentary nature of ''Argentinosaurus'' remains makes their interpretation difficult. Arguments revolve around the position of the recovered vertebrae within the vertebral column and the presence of accessory articulations between the vertebrae that would have strengthened the spine. A computer model of the skeleton and muscles estimated this dinosaur had a maximum speed of 7&nbsp;km/h (5&nbsp;mph) with a [[Horse gait#Pace|pace]], a gait where the fore and hind limb of the same side of the body move simultaneously. The fossils of ''Argentinosaurus'' were recovered from the [[Huincul Formation]], which was deposited in the [[Cenomanian|middle Cenomanian]] to [[Turonian|early Turonian]] ages (around 96 to 92 [[million years ago]]) and contains a diverse dinosaur fauna including the giant [[theropod]] ''[[Mapusaurus]]''.\n\n==Discovery==\n[[File:Argentinosaurus_9.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Skeletal reconstruction, holotype material in white, referred femoral shaft in green, referred femur in blue, unknown bones in grey|alt=Diagram showing known parts of the skeleton]]\n\nThe first ''Argentinosaurus'' bone, which is now thought to be a [[fibula]] (calf bone), was discovered in 1987 by farmer Guillermo Heredia on his farm \"Las Overas\" about {{cvt|8|km|mi|0}} east of [[Plaza Huincul]], in [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province]], Argentina. Heredia, initially believing he had discovered petrified logs, informed the local museum, the [[Museo Carmen Funes]], whose staff members excavated the bone and stored it in the museum's exhibition room. In early 1989, the Argentine palaeontologist [[Jos\u00e9 F. Bonaparte]] initiated a larger excavation of the site involving palaeontologists of the [[Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales]], yielding a number of additional elements from the same individual.

Another vertebra was interpreted by the three studies as being part of the rear section of the dorsal vertebral column, as the fourth, or as the fifth, respectively. In 1993, two articulated (still connected) vertebrae were thought to be of the rear part of the dorsal column but are interpreted as the sixth and seventh vertebrae in the two later studies.

Although it is only known from fragmentary remains, ''Argentinosaurus'' is one of the largest-known land animals of all time, if not the largest, with length estimates ranging from {{convert|30|to|39.7|m|ft}} and weight estimates from {{convert|50|to|100|t|ST}}. It was a member of [[Titanosauria]], the dominant group of sauropods during the Cretaceous.\n\nThe first ''Argentinosaurus'' bone was discovered in 1987 by a farmer on his farm near the city of [[Plaza Huincul]]. A scientific excavation of the site led by the Argentine palaeontologist [[Jos\u00e9 Bonaparte]] was conducted in 1989, yielding several back [[vertebra]]e and parts of a [[sacrum]]\u2014fused vertebrae between the back and tail vertebrae. Additional specimens include a complete [[femur]] (thigh bone) and the shaft of another. ''Argentinosaurus'' was named by Bonaparte and the Argentine palaeontologist [[Rodolfo Coria]] in 1993; it contains a single [[species]], '''''A. huinculensis'''''. The generic name ''Argentinosaurus'' means \"Argentine lizard\", and the specific name ''huinculensis'' refers to its place of discovery, Plaza Huincul.\n\nThe fragmentary nature of ''Argentinosaurus'' remains makes their interpretation difficult. Arguments revolve around the position of the recovered vertebrae within the vertebral column and the presence of accessory articulations between the vertebrae that would have strengthened the spine. A computer model of the skeleton and muscles estimated this dinosaur had a maximum speed of 7&nbsp;km/h (5&nbsp;mph) with a [[Horse gait#Pace|pace]], a gait where the fore and hind limb of the same side of the body move simultaneously. The fossils of ''Argentinosaurus'' were recovered from the [[Huincul Formation]], which was deposited in the [[Cenomanian|middle Cenomanian]] to [[Turonian|early Turonian]] ages (around 96 to 92 [[million years ago]]) and contains a diverse dinosaur fauna including the giant [[theropod]] ''[[Mapusaurus]]''.\n\n==Discovery==\n[[File:Argentinosaurus_9.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Skeletal reconstruction, holotype material in white, referred femoral shaft in green, referred femur in blue, unknown bones in grey|alt=Diagram showing known parts of the skeleton]]\n\nThe first ''Argentinosaurus'' bone, which is now thought to be a [[fibula]] (calf bone), was discovered in 1987 by farmer Guillermo Heredia on his farm \"Las Overas\" about {{cvt|8|km|mi|0}} east of [[Plaza Huincul]], in [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province]], Argentina. Heredia, initially believing he had discovered petrified logs, informed the local museum, the [[Museo Carmen Funes]], whose staff members excavated the bone and stored it in the museum's exhibition room. In early 1989, the Argentine palaeontologist [[Jos\u00e9 F. Bonaparte]] initiated a larger excavation of the site involving palaeontologists of the [[Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales]], yielding a number of additional elements from the same individual. The individual, which would later become the [[holotype]] of ''Argentinosaurus huinculensis'', is catalogued under the specimen number [[Museo Carmen Funes|MCF]]-PVPH 1.<ref name=\"salgado2010\"/>\n\nSeparating fossils from the very hard rock in which the bones were encased required the use of pneumatic hammers.<ref name=\"Bonaparte1993\"/><ref name=\"lmneuquen\">{{Cite web| author=Montanaro, P. | date= February 3, 2019| title = A 30 a\u00f1os del hallazgo del dino gigante de Huincul| work = Lmneuquen.com| accessdate = November 25, 2019| language=Spanish| url = https://www.lmneuquen.com/a-treinta-anos-del-hallazgo-del-dino-gigante-huincul-n622077}}</ref><ref name=\"prothero2016\">{{Cite book| publisher = Smithsonian Institution| isbn = 978-1-58834-574-5|author=Prothero, D.R.|title=Giants of the Lost World: Dinosaurs and Other Extinct Monsters of South America |date=2016}}</ref>{{rp|35}} The additional material recovered included seven [[dorsal vertebrae]] (vertebrae of the back),<ref name=\"salgado2010\">{{Cite journal| volume = 30| issue = 6| pages = 1760\u20131772| last1 = Salgado| first1 = L.| last2 = Powell| first2 = J.E.| title = Reassessment of the vertebral laminae in some South American titanosaurian sauropods| journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology| date = 2010| doi = 10.1080/02724634.2010.520783| hdl = 11336/73562}}</ref> the underside of the [[sacrum]] (fused vertebrae between the dorsal and tail vertebrae) including the first to fifth {{Dinogloss|sacral vertebrae}} and some sacral ribs, and a part of a dorsal rib (rib from the flank).<ref name=\"Bonaparte1993\"/> These finds were also incorporated into the collection of the Museo Carmen Funes.<ref name=\"Bonaparte1993\"/>\n\nBonaparte presented the new find in 1989 at a scientific conference in [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]].

Another vertebra was interpreted by the three studies as being part of the rear section of the dorsal vertebral column, as the fourth, or as the fifth, respectively. In 1993, two articulated (still connected) vertebrae were thought to be of the rear part of the dorsal column but are interpreted as the sixth and seventh vertebrae in the two later studies.
