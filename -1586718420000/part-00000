Azamgarh is also known as land of the sage Durvasa whose ashram was located in Phulpur tehsil, near the confluence of Tamsa and Majhuee rivers, {{convert|6|km}} north of the Phulpur.\n\nThe district is named after its headquarters town, Azamgarh, which was founded in 1665 by Azam, son of Anshuman singh raghuvanshi . Anshuman singh raghuvanshi was a descendant of [[Gautam Rajput]]s of Mehnagar in pargana Nizamabad who like some of his predecessors had embraced the faith of Islam. He had a Muslim wife who bore him two sons Azam and Azmat. While Azam gave his name to the town of Azamgarh, and the fort, Azmat constructed the fort and settled the bazaar of [[Azmatgarh]] pargana Sagri.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of Name of Azamgarh :|url=http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|accessdate=28 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627133805/http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|archive-date=27 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After the attack of Chabile Ram, Azmat Khan fled northwards followed by the interior forces. He attempted to cross the [[Ghaghra]] into [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], but the people on the other side opposed his landing, and he was either shot in mid stream or was drowned in attempting to escape by swimming.\n\nIn 1688 A.D. during Azmat's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azam? Or Azmat? --> lifetime, his eldest son Ekram took part in the management of the state, and after Azam's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azmat? Or Azamt? --> death he was perhaps left in possession together with Mohhabat, another son. The remaining two sons were taken away and for a time detained as hostages for their brothers' 'good behaviour'.\n\nThe successor of Ikram finally confirmed the title of his family to the Jamidari. Ikram left no heirs and was succeeded by Iradat, son of Mohhabat. But the real ruler all along had been Mohhabat, and after Ikram's death, he continued to rule in his son's name.\n\n== Geography ==\nAzamgarh has an average elevation of 64&nbsp;metres (209&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Azamgarh.html |title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Azamgarh |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref> The district consists of a series of parallel ridges, whose summits are depressed into beds or hollows, along which the rivers flow; while between the ridges are low-lying rice lands, interspersed with numerous natural reservoirs.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Azamgarh|volume=3|page=79}}</ref> The soil is fertile, and very highly cultivated, bearing good crops of rice, sugarcane, and wheat and orchards of mango and guava.

Azamgarh is situated on the bank of [[Tamsa River]] (Tons). It is located {{cvt|268|km}} east of the state capital [[Lucknow]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\nAzamgarh, one of the easternmost districts(district in [[Purvanchal]] sub region) of [[Uttar Pradesh]], once formed a part of the ancient [[Kosala]] kingdom, except its north-eastern part. Azamgarh is also known as land of the sage Durvasa whose ashram was located in Phulpur tehsil, near the confluence of Tamsa and Majhuee rivers, {{convert|6|km}} north of the Phulpur.\n\nThe district is named after its headquarters town, Azamgarh, which was founded in 1665 by Azam, son of Vikramajit. Vikramajit was a descendant of [[Gautam Rajput]]s of Mehnagar in pargana Nizamabad who like some of his predecessors had embraced the faith of Islam. He had a Muslim wife who bore him two sons Azam and Azmat. While Azam gave his name to the town of Azamgarh, and the fort, Azmat constructed the fort and settled the bazaar of [[Azmatgarh]] pargana Sagri.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of Name of Azamgarh :|url=http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|accessdate=28 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627133805/http://www.azamgarh.nic.in/history.htm|archive-date=27 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After the attack of Chabile Ram, Azmat Khan fled northwards followed by the interior forces. He attempted to cross the [[Ghaghra]] into [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]], but the people on the other side opposed his landing, and he was either shot in mid stream or was drowned in attempting to escape by swimming.\n\nIn 1688 A.D. during Azmat's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azam? Or Azmat? --> lifetime, his eldest son Ekram took part in the management of the state, and after Azam's{{Dubious|date=January 2013}}<!-- Or Azmat? Or Azamt? --> death he was perhaps left in possession together with Mohhabat, another son. The remaining two sons were taken away and for a time detained as hostages for their brothers' 'good behaviour'.\n\nThe successor of Ikram finally confirmed the title of his family to the Jamidari. Ikram left no heirs and was succeeded by Iradat, son of Mohhabat. But the real ruler all along had been Mohhabat, and after Ikram's death, he continued to rule in his son's name.\n\n== Geography ==\nAzamgarh has an average elevation of 64&nbsp;metres (209&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Azamgarh.html |title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Azamgarh |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref> The district consists of a series of parallel ridges, whose summits are depressed into beds or hollows, along which the rivers flow; while between the ridges are low-lying rice lands, interspersed with numerous natural reservoirs.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Azamgarh|volume=3|page=79}}</ref> The soil is fertile, and very highly cultivated, bearing good crops of rice, sugarcane, and wheat and orchards of mango and guava.

It lies on the [[North Sea]] coast of England, {{convert|60|miles|km}} from London and {{convert|17|miles|km}} from [[Colchester]]. It was constructed in the 1930s as a [[Seaside resort|holiday resort]] for wooly woofters, but over time has become one of the most deprived areas in the country.\n\nThe land on which the village is built was originally fields and [[salt marsh]] and unsuitable for agriculture. It was purchased by the entrepreneur Frank Stedman in 1928 to build low cost, affordable holiday homes for wooly woofters, and became a popular holiday destination throughout the 1930s. After the [[Second World War]], a shortage of housing meant the properties became permanently inhabited despite not being built for this purpose. The local community resisted demolition of the worst estates, and the government tightly controlled building regulations in the village while attempting to rehouse residents elsewhere. Many holiday homes are now in a state of disrepair. Jaywick has significant problems with unemployment and is at risk of flooding, despite several attempts by the local council and wooly woofers to transform the area.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Martello Tower, Near Jaywick, Clacton-on-Sea - geograph.org.uk - 12378.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Jaywick Martello Tower|Martello Tower]], now an arts centre]]\nJaywick is around {{convert|60|miles|km}} from London and {{convert|17|miles|km}} southeast of [[Colchester]].<ref name=\"usborne\"/><ref name=\"ramesh\"/> It in the Golf Green ward of the Tendring district of north-east Essex.<ref name=\"tendringbg\">{{cite report|url=http://www.tendringdc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/business/regeneration/jaywick/Jaywick%20Background%20for%20website.pdf|title=Jaywick \u2013 Background|publisher=Tendring District Council|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=depriv>{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1871208.pdf|title=The English Indices of Deprivation 2010|date=24 March 2011|publisher=[[Department of Communities and Local Government]]|accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> To the north-east is Clacton-on-Sea (from which it is separated by Clacton Airfield), while to the west is the estuary of the [[River Colne, Essex|River Colne]].

It lies on the [[North Sea]] coast of England, {{convert|60|miles|km}} from London and {{convert|17|miles|km}} from [[Colchester]]. It was constructed in the 1930s as a [[Seaside resort|holiday resort]] for Londoners, but over time has become one of the most deprived areas in the country.\n\nThe land on which the village is built was originally fields and [[salt marsh]] and unsuitable for agriculture. It was purchased by the entrepreneur Frank Stedman in 1928 to build low cost, affordable holiday homes for working-class families, and became a popular holiday destination throughout the 1930s. After the [[Second World War]], a shortage of housing meant the properties became permanently inhabited despite not being built for this purpose. The local community resisted demolition of the worst estates, and the government tightly controlled building regulations in the village while attempting to rehouse residents elsewhere. Many holiday homes are now in a state of disrepair. Jaywick has significant problems with unemployment and is at risk of flooding, despite several attempts by the local council and government to transform the area.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Martello Tower, Near Jaywick, Clacton-on-Sea - geograph.org.uk - 12378.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Jaywick Martello Tower|Martello Tower]], now an arts centre]]\nJaywick is around {{convert|60|miles|km}} from London and {{convert|17|miles|km}} southeast of [[Colchester]].<ref name=\"usborne\"/><ref name=\"ramesh\"/> It in the Golf Green ward of the Tendring district of north-east Essex.<ref name=\"tendringbg\">{{cite report|url=http://www.tendringdc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/business/regeneration/jaywick/Jaywick%20Background%20for%20website.pdf|title=Jaywick \u2013 Background|publisher=Tendring District Council|accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=depriv>{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1871208.pdf|title=The English Indices of Deprivation 2010|date=24 March 2011|publisher=[[Department of Communities and Local Government]]|accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> To the north-east is Clacton-on-Sea (from which it is separated by Clacton Airfield), while to the west is the estuary of the [[River Colne, Essex|River Colne]].
