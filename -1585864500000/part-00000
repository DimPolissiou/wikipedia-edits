It can be found 20 kilometres north of the town of [[Edel\u00e9ny]], 180 metres above sea level in a narrow valley. Its only stream, the \u2018Hunters\u2019 Creek\u2019 (Vad\u00e1szpatak in Hungarian) runs south. Walking through the forest area which starts from the northern end of Irota, one will find the highest peak of the region (the so-called Goat Bank, or Kecskepad) at a height of 340 metres.\n\nThe village was mentioned for the first time in 1320. By 1726, the population consisted both of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] speakers. Most of the inhabitants were shepherds, foresters and small farmers. In the 19th century, a local quarry was used to produce the locally applied bricks and rooftiles.\n\nIn 1851, Irota was home to 36 [[Roman Catholics]], 358 [[Greek Catholics]], 5 [[Calvinists]], 4 [[Evangelicals]] and 8 [[Jews]]. The latest census (2001) mentions 117 inhabitants, of which 38 Roman Catholics, 70 Greek Catholics, 6 Calvinists and 3 belonging to none of these groups.\n\nIrota's only church is Greek Catholic. Roman Catholics go to mass here as well. The current stone building, dating from 1846,  was preceded by several wooden structures. It boasts a beautiful iconostasis. In 1898, the originally whitewashed church interior was embellished with frescoes. Services are generally held on Sunday at 10.30, unless otherwise indicated. A small chapel can be found in the main street. It was built in 1925 and renovated in 1965. It is used for smaller services during the week.\n\nThe mansion (Pet\u0151fi \u00fat 42) which once belonged to the noble F\u00e1y family was used as headquarters for the Party Secretary, public library and consulting room for the visiting GP during the years of [[communism]]. After years of neglect and decay, it has recently been renovated and these days, it serves as a private residence.\n\nThe houses in the village typically have a rectangular shape and consist of three rooms. The houses do not stand in a straight line, since people always made sure to build them in the highest point of their plot to protect them from water damage.\n\nTourists are attracted to Irota because of its unspoilt character, the beautiful surroundings teeming with wildlife, rare plant and bird species and the pleasant village atmosphere. The village has several guest houses and three eco-friendly lodges have been built at its edge. These have been operational since Summer 2016.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.terkepcentrum.hu/index.asp?go=map&tid=5005 Street map] {{in lang|hu}}\n* http://www.parochia.hu/Irota/Irotaitemplom_150eves.htm\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20150319025415/http://www.menet.hu/irota/\n\n{{Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County]]\n\n\n{{Borsod-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n|subdivision_type = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n|subdivision_name       = {{HUN}}\n|timezone=[[Central European Time|CET]]\n|utc_offset=+1\n|timezone_DST=[[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n|utc_offset_DST=+2\n|\nofficial_name=Irota|\nmap=[[Image:BAZMegye.png|center|thumb|275px|Location of Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n county in Hungary]]|\nsubdivision_type1=[[Counties of Hungary|County]]|\nsubdivision_name1=[[Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n]]|\narea_total_km2=12.34|\npopulation_total=108|\npopulation_as_of=2004|\npopulation_density_km2=8.75|\npostal_code_type=[[Postal code]]|\npostal_code=3786|\narea_code=48|\npushpin_map            =Hungary \n|pushpin_label_position = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption    =Location of Irota\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|coordinates            = {{coord|48.39727|20.87608|region:HU|display=inline,title}}\n}}\n'''Irota''' is a village in [[Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n]] county, [[Hungary]].

The latest census (2001) mentions 117 inhabitants, of which 38 Roman Catholics, 70 Greek Catholics, 6 Calvinists and 3 belonging to none of these groups.\n\nIrota's only church is Greek Catholic. Roman Catholics go to mass here as well. The current stone building, dating from 1846,  was preceded by several wooden structures. It boasts a beautiful iconostasis. In 1898, the originally whitewashed church interior was embellished with frescoes. Services are generally held on Sunday at 10.30, unless otherwise indicated. A small chapel can be found in the main street. It was built in 1925 and renovated in 1965. It is used for smaller services during the week.\n\nThe mansion (Pet\u0151fi \u00fat 42) which once belonged to the noble F\u00e1y family was used as headquarters for the Party Secretary, public library and consulting room for the visiting GP during the years of [[communism]]. After years of neglect and decay, it has recently been renovated and these days, it serves as a private residence.\n\nThe houses in the village typically have a rectangular shape and consist of three rooms. The houses do not stand in a straight line, since people always made sure to build them in the highest point of their plot to protect them from water damage.\n\nTourists are attracted to Irota because of its unspoilt character, the beautiful surroundings teeming with wildlife, rare plant and bird species and the pleasant village atmosphere. The village has several guest houses and three eco-friendly lodges have been built at its edge. These have been operational since Summer 2016.\n\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.terkepcentrum.hu/index.asp?go=map&tid=5005 Street map] {{in lang|hu}}\n\nhttp://www.parochia.hu/Irota/Irotaitemplom_150eves.htm\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150319025415/http://www.menet.hu/irota/\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County]]\n\n{{Borsod-geo-stub}}\n\n{{Borsod-Aba\u00faj-Zempl\u00e9n County}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irota"}
