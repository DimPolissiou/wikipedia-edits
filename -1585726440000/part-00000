The Obion County Museum was operated entirely by volunteers for over 40 years. In 2005, Robert E. Kirkland, a local businessman known for cofounding the [[Kirkland's]] chain of home decor stores, approached the Obion County Museum board about the possibility of building a larger facility in Union City. Kirkland and his wife, Jenny D. Kirkland, had recently sold their portion of CBK, Ltd. (the parent company of Kirkland's) in order to concentrate on local philanthropy. Kirkland met secretly with board members Larry Mink, Polly Brasher, and Jack Hudgens at the Obion County Library to discuss the viability of the operation. The secrecy of the meetings was to assure that if the idea proved unfeasible, the general public would not be disappointed.\n\nAfter Kirkland and the board members determined that the idea was viable, Canadian architect [[Douglas Cardinal]] was selected to design the new facility as well as its exhibits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwtntoday.com/2008/10/13/cardinal-discusses-his-vision-for-discovery-park/|title=Cardinal discusses his vision for Discovery Park|website=NWTN Today|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> Kirkland wished for the community to be involved in the project and developed eighteen committees. Thirteen of these committees were responsible for the development of the galleries and exhibits within the museum, while five were responsible for the commercial aspects, such as accounting and marketing. Kirkland chose the name Discovery Park of America for the new facility, and asked his lifelong friend and another local businessman, Jim Rippy, to volunteer and serve as chairman of the newly developed Discovery Park of America board of directors.\n\nAllen Searcy Building Contractors was hired as the principal construction contractor and a groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 1, 2008 in a soybean field on the northwest edge of Union City. At this time, the park was set for completion in 2010. However, on July 8, 2009, Kirkland terminated Douglas Cardinal and construction was halted as the search began for a new architect. In the Spring of 2009, Obion County Museum board-member Polly Brasher, who by then was working as the Discovery Park of America Founding Director, met Kurt Cederquest of Maltbie Exhibit Fabricators at a trade show in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and mentioned the need for an architect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwtntoday.com/2013/05/02/mrs-brasher-living-dream-as-dpa-education-director/|title=Mrs. Brasher living dream as DPA education director|website=NWTN Today|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> Cederquest contacted his colleagues at Verner Johnson Museum Architects of [[Boston]] and Thinc Design of [[New York City]] to persuade them to collaborate with him on the project. The three firms made a joint pitch to Discovery Park of America which resulted in a contract in January 2010, and construction resumed on the project in December. Lou Sirianni of Verner Johnson Museum Architects was selected to design the main building, while Tom Henness of Thinc Design would oversee the design of the exhibits and gallery spaces. Kirkland instructed the teams, \"design a building that will stop traffic at 70mph.\" The building also had to include an observation tower and a grand hall. Construction continued for nearly three years. In addition to the main building, Richie Smith Landscape Architects of [[Memphis, Tennessee]] was hired to design the 50-acre heritage park surrounding the central museum, which includes two small lakes connected by a moat and a terraced series of dams.\n\nIn January 2013, Jim Rippy retired from his position at an insurance company and joined Discovery Park full-time as Chief Executive Officer. Rippy and Kirkland assembled a full staff over the next several months, and donors, sponsors, and long-time supporters were invited for to preview the park on October 15, 2013.

It is considered one of the top [[graduate schools]] for [[international relations]] in the world.{{According to whom|date=April 2020}} The institution is devoted to the study of [[international relations|international affairs]], [[economics]], [[diplomacy]], and [[policy]] research and education.<ref name=\"irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu/|title=Institute for the Theory and Practice of International Relations &#124; Home|website=irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu|date=|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmong the political scientists and economists based here are former [[World Bank]] Chief Economist [[Anne Osborn Krueger|Anne Krueger]]; and military historian and former [[Counselor of the United States Department of State]] [[Eliot Cohen]].

The school has hosted world leaders on a regular basis for public debate in international affairs.\n\n== History ==\nThe Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) was founded in 1943 by [[Paul H. Nitze]] and [[Christian Herter]] as a standalone graduate school and became part of [[The Johns Hopkins University]] in 1950. The school was established during World War II by a group of statesmen who sought new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities that would be thrust upon the United States in the postwar world. Nitze feared the diplomatic and economic expertise developed in World War II might get lost if the nation became isolationist.<ref name=\"Johns Hopkins Magazine\">{{cite magazine|url=https://pages.jh.edu/jhumag/0400web/26.html|title=Pioneers of Advocacy: Not Just a Cold Warrior|last=Cavanaugh Simpson|first=Joanne|magazine=Johns Hopkins Magazine|location=Baltimore, Maryland|date=April 2000|language=en-US|oclc=644322652|access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe founders assembled a faculty of scholars and professionals (often borrowed from other universities) to teach international relations, international economics, and foreign languages to a small group of students. The curriculum was designed to be both scholarly and practical. The natural choice for the location of the school was Washington, D.C., a city where international resources are abundant and where [[American foreign policy]] is shaped and set in motion. When the school opened in 1944, 15 students were enrolled.<ref>Gutner, Tammi L. ''The Story of SAIS''. Washington, D.C.: School of Advanced International Studies, The Johns Hopkins University, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the school created the [[Bologna Center]] in Italy, the first full-time graduate school located in Europe under an American higher-education system. By 1963 Johns Hopkins SAIS outgrew its first quarters on Florida Avenue and moved to one of its present buildings on Massachusetts Avenue. In 1986, the [[Hopkins\u2013Nanjing Center]] was created in [[Nanjing]], China, completing the school's global presence. In January 2019, Johns Hopkins University announced that it had purchased the [[Newseum]] building on [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] NW and will remodel the building to house SAIS and other Washington, D.C.-based programs.<ref>https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/newseum-to-move-as-johns-hopkins-announces-building-purchase/692/</ref> \n\nThe school is a member of the [[Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs]] (APSIA), a group of schools of public policy, public administration, and international studies.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Organization and academic programs ==\n[[File:Johns Hopkins University DC campus.JPG|thumb|200px|Campus building on Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.]]\nJohns Hopkins SAIS is a global school with campuses on three continents. It has nearly 700 full-time students in Washington, D.C.; 190 full-time students in [[Bologna]], Italy; and about 160 full-time students in [[Nanjing]], China. Of these, 60 percent come from the United States and 37 percent from more than 70 other countries.<ref>[http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pressroom/publications/brochure/sais-brochure-2009.pdf SAIS Prepare to Lead Brochure, released Summer 2009]</ref> Around 50% are women and 22% are from U.S. minority groups. SAIS Europe is home to the [[Bologna Center]] and the only full-time [[international relations]] graduate program in Europe that operates under an American higher-education system, and the [[Hopkins\u2013Nanjing Center]], which teaches courses in both [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and English, is jointly administered by Johns Hopkins SAIS and [[Nanjing University]].<ref>See Norton Wheeler, ''Role of American NGOs in China's Modernization: Invited Influence'' (Routledge, 2014)  [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=43437 online review], on the history of the Nanjing Center</ref>\n\nThe school offers multidisciplinary instruction leading to the degrees of [[master of arts]] for early and mid-career professionals, as well as a [[doctor of philosophy]] program. Approximately 300 students graduate from the Washington, D.C., campus each year from the two-year master of arts program in international relations and international economics. Unlike most other international affairs graduate schools that offer professional master's degrees, Johns Hopkins SAIS requires its master of arts candidates to be proficient in another language outside their mother tongue <ref>https://sais.jhu.edu/academics/degree-programs/master-degrees/master-arts-ma</ref> and fulfill the International Ecopass, a one-hour capstone oral examination synthesizing and integrating knowledge from the student's regional or functional concentration and international economics.<ref name='SAIS01'>{{cite web|url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/academics/degrees/ma/requirements.htm|title=Johns Hopkins SAIS Academics &#124; MA Program &#124; Requirements|website=www.sais-jhu.edu|date=|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref> The oral examination and international economics requirements of the master of arts curriculum have been the signature aspects of the school's education.\n\n== Reputation ==\nA study conducted in 2005 examined graduate international relations programs throughout the United States, interviewing over a thousand professionals in the field, with the results subsequently published in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine as \"[[Inside the Ivory Tower#2005 rankings|Inside the Ivory Tower]]\" rankings. 65 percent of respondents named Johns Hopkins University\u2013SAIS as the best terminal master's program in international relations. SAIS received the most votes, followed by Georgetown University's [[School of Foreign Service]], Harvard University's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]], Tufts University's [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], and the [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University|School of International and Public Affairs]] at Columbia University. The latest edition of the study was produced in 2014, with the master's program at SAIS ranking second globally after the School of Foreign Service.\n\nSince 1990, SAIS and the Fletcher School have been the only non-law schools in the United States to participate in the [[Philip Jessup|Philip C. Jessup]] International Law Moot Court Competition. Competing against full-time law students, SAIS generalists have performed very well. SAIS has twice placed second overall out of 12 schools and advanced to the \"final four\" in its region. In head-to-head competitions, SAIS has defeated schools such as [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and the [[University of Virginia School of Law]].\n\nSAIS students have successfully competed in the Sustainable Innovation Summit Challenge hosted by Arizona State University's [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]].

Nitze School of Advanced International Studies''' ('''SAIS''') is a division of [[Johns Hopkins University]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, with campuses in [[Bologna]], Italy, and [[Nanjing]], China. It is considered one of the top [[graduate schools]] for [[international relations]] in the world.{{According to whom|date=April 2020}} The institution is devoted to the study of [[international relations|international affairs]], [[economics]], [[diplomacy]], and [[policy]] research and education.<ref name=\"irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu/|title=Institute for the Theory and Practice of International Relations &#124; Home|website=irtheoryandpractice.wm.edu|date=|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmong the political scientists and economists based here are former [[World Bank]] Chief Economist [[Anne Osborn Krueger|Anne Krueger]]; and military historian and former [[Counselor of the United States Department of State]] [[Eliot Cohen]].

The school has hosted world leaders on a regular basis for public debate in international affairs.\n\n== History ==\nThe Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) was founded in 1943 by [[Paul H. Nitze]] and [[Christian Herter]] as a standalone graduate school and became part of [[The Johns Hopkins University]] in 1950. The school was established during World War II by a group of statesmen who sought new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities that would be thrust upon the United States in the postwar world. Nitze feared the diplomatic and economic expertise developed in World War II might get lost if the nation became isolationist.<ref name=\"Johns Hopkins Magazine\">{{cite magazine|url=https://pages.jh.edu/jhumag/0400web/26.html|title=Pioneers of Advocacy: Not Just a Cold Warrior|last=Cavanaugh Simpson|first=Joanne|magazine=Johns Hopkins Magazine|location=Baltimore, Maryland|date=April 2000|language=en-US|oclc=644322652|access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe founders assembled a faculty of scholars and professionals (often borrowed from other universities) to teach international relations, international economics, and foreign languages to a small group of students. The curriculum was designed to be both scholarly and practical. The natural choice for the location of the school was Washington, D.C., a city where international resources are abundant and where [[American foreign policy]] is shaped and set in motion. When the school opened in 1944, 15 students were enrolled.<ref>Gutner, Tammi L. ''The Story of SAIS''. Washington, D.C.: School of Advanced International Studies, The Johns Hopkins University, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the school created the [[Bologna Center]] in Italy, the first full-time graduate school located in Europe under an American higher-education system. By 1963 Johns Hopkins SAIS outgrew its first quarters on Florida Avenue and moved to one of its present buildings on Massachusetts Avenue. In 1986, the [[Hopkins\u2013Nanjing Center]] was created in [[Nanjing]], China, completing the school's global presence. In January 2019, Johns Hopkins University announced that it had purchased the [[Newseum]] building on [[Pennsylvania Avenue]] NW and will remodel the building to house SAIS and other Washington, D.C.-based programs.<ref>https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/newseum-to-move-as-johns-hopkins-announces-building-purchase/692/</ref> \n\nThe school is a member of the [[Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs]] (APSIA), a group of schools of public policy, public administration, and international studies.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Organization and academic programs ==\n[[File:Johns Hopkins University DC campus.JPG|thumb|200px|Campus building on Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.]]\nJohns Hopkins SAIS is a global school with campuses on three continents. It has nearly 700 full-time students in Washington, D.C.; 190 full-time students in [[Bologna]], Italy; and about 160 full-time students in [[Nanjing]], China. Of these, 60 percent come from the United States and 37 percent from more than 70 other countries.<ref>[http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pressroom/publications/brochure/sais-brochure-2009.pdf SAIS Prepare to Lead Brochure, released Summer 2009]</ref> Around 50% are women and 22% are from U.S. minority groups. SAIS Europe is home to the [[Bologna Center]] and the only full-time [[international relations]] graduate program in Europe that operates under an American higher-education system, and the [[Hopkins\u2013Nanjing Center]], which teaches courses in both [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and English, is jointly administered by Johns Hopkins SAIS and [[Nanjing University]].<ref>See Norton Wheeler, ''Role of American NGOs in China's Modernization: Invited Influence'' (Routledge, 2014)  [http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=43437 online review], on the history of the Nanjing Center</ref>\n\nThe school offers multidisciplinary instruction leading to the degrees of [[master of arts]] for early and mid-career professionals, as well as a [[doctor of philosophy]] program. Approximately 300 students graduate from the Washington, D.C., campus each year from the two-year master of arts program in international relations and international economics. Unlike most other international affairs graduate schools that offer professional master's degrees, Johns Hopkins SAIS requires its master of arts candidates to be proficient in another language outside their mother tongue <ref>https://sais.jhu.edu/academics/degree-programs/master-degrees/master-arts-ma</ref> and fulfill the International Ecopass, a one-hour capstone oral examination synthesizing and integrating knowledge from the student's regional or functional concentration and international economics.<ref name='SAIS01'>{{cite web|url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/academics/degrees/ma/requirements.htm|title=Johns Hopkins SAIS Academics &#124; MA Program &#124; Requirements|website=www.sais-jhu.edu|date=|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref> The oral examination and international economics requirements of the master of arts curriculum have been the signature aspects of the school's education.\n\n== Reputation ==\nA study conducted in 2005 examined graduate international relations programs throughout the United States, interviewing over a thousand professionals in the field, with the results subsequently published in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine as \"[[Inside the Ivory Tower#2005 rankings|Inside the Ivory Tower]]\" rankings. 65 percent of respondents named Johns Hopkins University\u2013SAIS as the best terminal master's program in international relations. SAIS received the most votes, followed by Georgetown University's [[School of Foreign Service]], Harvard University's [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]], Tufts University's [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], and the [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University|School of International and Public Affairs]] at Columbia University. The latest edition of the study was produced in 2014, with the master's program at SAIS ranking second globally after the School of Foreign Service.\n\nSince 1990, SAIS and the Fletcher School have been the only non-law schools in the United States to participate in the [[Philip Jessup|Philip C. Jessup]] International Law Moot Court Competition. Competing against full-time law students, SAIS generalists have performed very well. SAIS has twice placed second overall out of 12 schools and advanced to the \"final four\" in its region. In head-to-head competitions, SAIS has defeated schools such as [[Georgetown University Law Center]] and the [[University of Virginia School of Law]].\n\nSAIS students have successfully competed in the Sustainable Innovation Summit Challenge hosted by Arizona State University's [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]]. Two different SAIS teams won first place in both 2007 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press/press_release/17057-Thunderbird-Names-Sustainable-Innovation-Summit-Winners |title=Thunderbird Names Sustainable Innovation Summit Winners \u2013 Press Releases on|website=csrwire.com|date=2007-11-13|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thunderbird.edu/about_thunderbird/news/more_news_info/2008/_summit_winners_111708.htm|title=Sustainable Innovation Summit winners announced \u2013 Thunderbird School of Global Management|website=www.thunderbird.edu|date=|accessdate=2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nA joint team from SAIS and the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]] received second place in the first \"Global Challenge\" competition, a first-of-its-kind competition that challenged teams of MBA and other graduate students to develop a public\u2013private venture to support development and the tourism industry in Asia.
