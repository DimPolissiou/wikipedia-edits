Though his work ranged from high drama to absurdist farce, Anouilh is best known for his 1944 play ''[[Antigone (Anouilh)|Antigone]]'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' classical drama, that was seen as an attack on [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|Marshal P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]. His plays are less experimental than those of his contemporaries, having clearly organized plot and eloquent dialogue.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Arts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0198691372|location=USA|pages=18}}</ref> One of France's most prolific writers after World War II, much of Anouilh's work deals with themes of maintaining integrity in a world of moral compromise.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life===\nAnouilh was born in C\u00e9risole, a small village on the outskirts of [[Bordeaux]], and had [[Basque people|Basque]] ancestry. His father, Fran\u00e7ois Anouilh, was a tailor, and Anouilh maintained that he inherited from him a pride in conscientious craftmanship. He may owe his artistic bent to his mother, Marie-Magdeleine, a violinist who supplemented the family's meager income by playing summer seasons in the casino orchestra in the nearby seaside resort of [[Arcachon]]. Marie-Magdeleine worked the night shifts in the music-hall orchestras and sometimes accompanied stage presentations, affording Anouilh ample opportunity to absorb the dramatic performances from backstage. He often attended rehearsals and solicited the resident authors to let him read scripts until bedtime. He first tried his hand at playwriting here, at the age of 12, though his earliest works do not survive.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/>\n\n[[Image:lyc\u00e9e chaptal.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Lyc\u00e9e Chaptal]], at the corner of rue de Rome and the boulevard des Batignolles]]\n\nIn 1918 the family moved to Paris where the young Anouilh received his secondary education at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Chaptal]]. [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], later a major French director, was a pupil there at the same time and recalls Anouilh as an intense, rather dandified figure who hardly noticed a boy some two years younger than himself. He earned acceptance into the law school at the [[Sorbonne]] but, unable to support himself financially, he left after just 18 months to seek work as a copywriter at the advertising agency Publicit\u00e9 Damour. He liked the work, and spoke more than once with wry approval of the lessons in the classical virtues of brevity and precision of language he learned while drafting advertising copy.<ref name=\"Liukkonen\"/>\n\nAnouilh's financial troubles continued after he was called up to military service in 1929.  Supported by only his meager conscription salary, Anouilh married the actress Monelle Valentin in 1931. Though Valentin starred in many of his plays, Anouilh's daughter Caroline (from his second marriage), claims that the marriage was not a happy one. Anouilh's youngest daughter Colombe even claims that there was never an official marriage between Anouilh and Valentin. She allegedly had multiple extramarital affairs, which caused Anouilh much pain and suffering.  The infidelity weighed heavily on the dramatist as a result of the uncertainty about his own parentage. According to Caroline, Anouilh had learned that his mother had had a lover at the theatre in Arcachon who was actually his biological father. In spite of this, Anouilh and Valentin had a daughter, Catherine, in 1934 who followed the pair into theatre work at an early age. Anouilh's growing family placed further strain on his already limited finances. Determined to break into writing full-time, he began to write comic scenes for the cinema to supplement their income.<ref name=\"AnouilhCaroline\"/>\n\n===Theatre work===\nAt the age of 25, Anouilh found work as a secretary to the French actor and director [[Louis Jouvet]] at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Though Anouilh's boss had happily lent him some of the set furniture left over from the production of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s  play ''Siegfried'' to furnish his modest home, the director was not interested in encouraging his assistant's attempts at playwriting.<ref name=\"Falb\"/> Jouvet had risen to fame in the early 1930s through his collaborations with the playwright Giraudoux, and together the two worked to shift focus from the authorial voice of the director (which had dominated the French stage since the early twentieth century) back to the playwright and his text.\n\nGiraudoux was an inspiration to Anouilh and, with the encouragement of the acclaimed playwright, he began writing again in 1929. Before the end of the year he made his theatrical debut with ''Humulus le muet'', a collaborative project with [[Jean Aurenche]]. It was followed by his first solo projects, ''L'Hermine'' (''The Ermine'') in 1932 and ''Mandarine'' in 1933, both produced by [[Aur\u00e9lien Lugn\u00e9-Poe]], an innovative actor and stage manager who was then head of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre]].<ref name=\"Levi\"/> Ruled by the philosophy, \"the word creates the decor,\" Lugn\u00e9-Poe let Anouilh's lyrical prose shine in front of a backdrop of simple compositions of line and color that created a unity of style and mood.<ref name=\"Brockett442\"/>\n\nThe plays were not great successes, closing after 37 and 13 performances respectively, but Anouilh persevered, following it up with a string of productions, most notably ''Y'avait un prisonnier'' (1935). These works, most in collaboration with the experimental Russian director [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]], were considered promising despite their lack of commercial profits, and the duo continued to work together until they had their first major success in 1937 with ''[[Le voyageur sans bagage]]'' (''Traveller Without Luggage''). In subsequent years, there was rarely a season in Paris that did not prominently feature a new Anouilh play and many of these were also being exported to England and America.<ref name=\"Pronko\"/> After 1938, however, much of Anouilh's later work was directed by the prominent Paris scenic designer [[Andr\u00e9 Barsacq]], who had taken over as director of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Atelier]] after [[Charles Dullin]]'s retirement in 1940.  Barsacq was a champion for Anouilh and their affiliation was a major factor in the playwright's continued success after the war.<ref name=\"Brockett458485\"/>\n\n===Playwright===\nIn the 1940s, Anouilh turned from contemporary tales to more mythical, classic, and historic subjects.  With protagonists who asserted their independence from the fated past, themes during this period are more closely related to the existential concerns of such writers as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]]. The most famous play of this group is ''Antigone'', which \"established Anouilh as a leading dramatist, not only because of the power with which he drew the classic confrontation between the uncompromising Antigone and the politically expedient Creon, but also because French theatre-goers under the occupation read the play as a contemporary political parable.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/> His post-war plays dealt with similar concerns and included ''Rom\u00e9o et Jeannette'', ''M\u00e9d\u00e9e'' (''Medea''), and Anouilh's [[Joan of Arc]] story ''L'Alouette'' (''[[The Lark (play)|The Lark]]''), which, in its distinct optimism, rivalled the commercial success of ''Antigone''.\n\nAnouilh himself grouped his plays of this period on the basis of their dominant tone, publishing his later works in collected volumes to reflect what he felt \"represented the phases of his evolution and loosely resembled the distinction between comedy and tragedy.\"<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/> ''Pi\u00e8ces noires'' or \"Black plays\" were tragedies or realistic dramas and included ''Antigone'', ''J\u00e9zabel'', and ''La Sauvage'' (''The Restless Heart'').  This category typically featured \"young,  idealistic, and uncompromising protagonists [who] are able to maintain their integrity only by choosing death.\"<ref name=\"Brockett483\"/>  By contrast, Anouilh's ''pi\u00e8ces roses'' or \"pink plays\" were comedies where fantasy dominated with an atmosphere similar to that of fairy tales. In these plays such as ''Le Bal des voleurs'' (''Carnival of Thieves''), ''Le Rendez-vous de Senlis'' (''Dinner with the Family'') and ''[[L\u00e9ocadia]]'' (''Time Remembered''), the focus is on \"the burden of the environment and especially of the past on a protagonist seeking a happier, freer existence.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nMost of Anouilh's plays of the late 1940s and into the 1950s become darker and distinctly cruel and, in contrast with his earlier works, begin to feature middle-aged characters who must view life more practically than Anouilh's former idealistic youths. The playwright divided the works of this period into ''pi\u00e8ces brillantes'' (\"brilliant plays\") and ''pi\u00e8ces grin\u00e7antes'' (\"grating plays\"). The first group includes works such as ''L'Invitation au ch\u00e2teau'' (Ring Round the Moon) and ''Colombe'', and are typified by aristocratic settings and witty banter. The grating plays like ''[[The Waltz of the Toreadors|La Valse des tor\u00e9adors]]'' (''Waltz of the Toreadors'') and ''Le R\u00e9actionnaire amoureux'' (''The Fighting Cock'') are more bitterly funny, trading clever word play for a darker tone of disillusionment.\n\nAnother category Anouilh specifies are his ''pi\u00e8ces costum\u00e9es'' (\"costume plays\") which include ''The Lark'', ''La Foire d'Empoigne'' (''Catch as Catch Can''), and [[Becket]], an international success, depicting the historical martyr [[Thomas Becket]], the Archbishop of Canterbury who sought to defend the church against the monarch (and his friend), [[Henry II of England]], who had appointed him to his see. So classified because they share historical \"costumed\" settings, Anouilh also specifies that these plays must also prominently feature an enlightened protagonist seeking \"a moral path in a world of corruption and manipulation.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nAnouilh's final period begins with ''La Grotte'' (''The Cavern''), in which he comments on his own progress as a writer and a theatre artist. The central character is a playwright suffering from writer's block who in his frustration recalls the foibles of [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''. Anouilh's work had always contained hints of [[metatheatre|metatheatricality]], or commentary on the business of theatre within the world of the play, but in his late works these structures became more fully developed as he begins to write primarily about character who are dramatists or theatre directors. There is also a pronounced link, during this time, of Anouilh's emphasis of theatre and the family, displaying intimate relationships that are \"more profound and more important than the traditional heightened action of 'theatre'&thinsp;\".{{whose quote|dated=October 2016}} Antoine, the playwright-protagonist of ''Cher Antoine; ou, L'Amour rat\u00e9'' (''Dear Antoine; or, The Love That Failed''), asserts that the world must take notice of these ''pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes'' (secret dramas) and Anouilh scholars have proposed this name, ''pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes'', to classify the collected works of his latest period.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>{{clarify|date=October 2016}}<!--one double-quotation mark missing; quotation uncertain.-->\n\n===Political controversy===\nAnouilh remained staunchly apolitical for most of his life and career. He served in the military during at least two periods, having been drafted into the French Army in 1931 and 1939. He was a prisoner of war for a short time when the Germans conquered France and willingly lived and worked in Paris during the subsequent [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]]. Because he refused to take sides during France's collaboration with the [[Axis Alliance]] some critics have branded him as a potential Nazi sympathiser.  This controversy escalated as a result of Anouilh's public clashes with leader of the [[Free French Forces]] (and later President of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]), [[Charles de Gaulle|General Charles de Gaulle]].  In the mid-1940s Anouilh and several other intellectuals signed a petition for clemency to save the writer [[Robert Brasillach]], who was condemned to death for being a Nazi collaborator. Brasillach was executed by firing squad in February 1945, despite the outcry from Anouilh and his peers that the new government had no right to persecute individuals for \"intellectual crimes\" in the absence of military or political action.<ref name=\"Kaplan\"/> Nevertheless, Anouilh refused to comment on his political views, writing in a letter to the Belgian critic Hubert Gignoux in 1946, \"I do not have a biography and I am very happy about it. The rest of my life, as long as God wills it, will remain my personal business, and I will withhold the details of it.\"<ref name=\"Ginestier\"/>\nAnouilh's plays provide the most important clues about his political point of view, though their reputation for ambiguity further complicates the matter. For instance ''Antigone'', provides an [[allegory|allegorical]] representation of the debate between the idealistic members of the [[French Resistance]] and the pragmatism of the collaborationists. Though many have read the play as having a strong anti-Nazi sentiment, the fact that the Vichy Regime allowed the piece to be performed without censure testifies to the fact that it was potentially seen as supportive of the occupation in its time.<ref name=\"Wiles\"/><ref name=\"Krauss\"/>  Though the playwright romanticizes Antigone's sense of honor and duty to what is morally right, in this case resisting the Nazi forces, it can also be said that Anouilh, like Sophocles before him, makes a convincing argument for Creon's method of leadership.<ref name=\"Smith2426\"/>\n\n===Awards and recognition===\nIn 1970 his work was recognized with the ''[[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]]''. In 2012, the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years and it was revealed that Anouilh was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], along with John Steinbeck (winner), [[Robert Graves]], [[Lawrence Durrell]] and [[Karen Blixen]].<ref name=floodjan2013>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |title=Swedish Academy reopens controversy surrounding Steinbeck's Nobel prize |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Alison Flood |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}</ref> According to a report in ''The Guardian'', \"It is not clear why Anouilh was passed over, but the French poet [[Saint-John Perse]] had taken the Nobel in 1960, meaning that France was well represented on the roster of winners, and ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' reveals that [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who won the prize in 1964, was starting to be seriously considered as a candidate.\"<ref name=floodjan2013/>\n\nIn 1980, he was the first recipient of the [[Grand prix du th\u00e9\u00e2tre (Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise)|Grand Prix du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] established that year.\n\n==Critical discussion==\nBy the end of his career, Anouilh's reputation outstripped all his contemporaries. However, his repertoire remained unusually confined to theatre and film. Most French dramatists of the 1930s and 1940s, including Anouilh's most significant contemporary influence, Giraudoux, not only wrote for the stage but also composed poetry, novels, or essays.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/> Nevertheless, he remained prolific, consistently producing and publishing performance works for more than fifty years.\n\nAnouilh's early works were \"naturalistic studies of a sordid and corrupt world.\"<ref name=\"Liukkonen\"/> Many of these plays present the reader with the striking and inescapable dichotomy between pragmatism and a sort of transcendent idealism.  There is little to no \"middle ground of ambiguity\" that exists where this conflict asserts itself.<ref name=\"Pucciani\"/> This is evidenced in ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage.'' The main character Gaston, a World War I veteran who suffers from amnesia, cannot remember the moral depravity of his youth (he slept with his brother's wife and severely injured his best friend). This checkered past is invariably at odds with the near-angelic behavior that he now exhibits, and recognition of this truth forces him to leave his former identity behind, unable to reconcile the two sides of himself. In denouncing his past, Gaston reclasses his freedom as an illusion, but one of his own making. He befriends a young English boy and shows him his identifying scar; this gesture allows the boy to describe Gaston to the authorities, thereby claiming him as kin. With a new life and a new family, Gaston has a fresh start.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/>  David I. Grossvogel, describes this situation as the \"restoration of a childhood paradise lost,\" attributing ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage'' as the beginning of Anouilh's search to justify the unhappiness of his youth.<ref name=\"Grossvogel\"/> Theatre historian Marvin Carlson agrees, noting that this play epitomizes the \"complex tonality and deft dramatic technique\" that remained throughout his work, though, he asserts, it was only as the playwright matured that his \"dark view of the human condition [reached] its final expression.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nAnouilh disagreed with these somber readings of his best works, however, arguing that, like all great French literature, his plays had found ways to laugh at misfortune. \"Thanks to Moli\u00e8re,\" Anouilh said, \"the true French theatre is the only one that is not gloomy, in which we laugh like men at war with our misery and our horror. This humor is one of France's messages to the world.\"<ref name=\"Hotchman\"/>\n\nDisclosing his thoughts on French theatre and his personal perspective as a playwright, he said that the perception of his work was often misguided:\n\n{{quote|I am played in private theaters, so I write for the bourgeoisie.  One has to rely on the people who pay for their places; the people who support the theater are bourgeois.  But this public has changed:  They have such a terror of not being in touch, of missing out on a fashionable event that they no longer exist as a decisive force.  I think the public has lost its head.  They now say that a play can't be that good if they can understand it.  My plays are not hermetic enough.  It's rather Moli\u00e8resque, don't you think?|author=Jean Anouilh<ref name=\"Porter\"/>}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Anouilh examined his antagonism with General de Gaulle in ''L'Hurluberlu, ou Le Reactionnaire amoureux'' (1958) and ''Le Songe du critique'' (1960). He began to lose the favor of audiences and critics alike, however, with the emergence of such playwrights as [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] and [[Samuel Beckett]]. Though he shared with these authors a \"similar desperate vision of human existence,\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Liukkonen|first=Petri and Ari Pesonen|title=Jean Anouilh (1910-1987)}}</ref> these new absurdist theatres' pursuit of alternative dramaturgies made Anouilh's semi-realistic plays seem dull and old-fashioned. In the 1980s Anouilh reinvented himself as a director, staging his own plays as well as those of other authors. He died of a heart attack in Lausanne, Switzerland on 3 October 1987. By then divorced from Monelle Valentin, he was survived by his second wife, Nicole Lan\u00e7on, and four children.\n\n==Works==\n===Original theatre productions: Paris===\n* ''L'Hermine''.

Though his work ranged from high drama to absurdist farce, Anouilh is best known for his 1944 play ''[[Antigone (Anouilh)|Antigone]]'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' classical drama, that was seen as an attack on [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|Marshal P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]. His plays are less experimental than those of his contemporaries, having clearly organized plot and eloquent dialogue.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Arts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0198691372|location=USA|pages=18}}</ref> One of France's most prolific writers after World War II, much of Anouilh's work deals with themes of maintaining integrity in a world of moral compromise.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life===\nAnouilh was born in C\u00e9risole, a small village on the outskirts of [[Bordeaux]], and had [[Basque people|Basque]] ancestry. His father, Fran\u00e7ois Anouilh, was a tailor, and Anouilh maintained that he inherited from him a pride in conscientious craftmanship. He may owe his artistic bent to his mother, Marie-Magdeleine, a violinist who supplemented the family's meager income by playing summer seasons in the casino orchestra in the nearby seaside resort of [[Arcachon]]. Marie-Magdeleine worked the night shifts in the music-hall orchestras and sometimes accompanied stage presentations, affording Anouilh ample opportunity to absorb the dramatic performances from backstage. He often attended rehearsals and solicited the resident authors to let him read scripts until bedtime. He first tried his hand at playwriting here, at the age of 12, though his earliest works do not survive.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/>\n\n[[Image:lyc\u00e9e chaptal.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Lyc\u00e9e Chaptal]], at the corner of rue de Rome and the boulevard des Batignolles]]\n\nIn 1918 the family moved to Paris where the young Anouilh received his secondary education at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Chaptal]]. [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], later a major French director, was a pupil there at the same time and recalls Anouilh as an intense, rather dandified figure who hardly noticed a boy some two years younger than himself. He earned acceptance into the law school at the [[Sorbonne]] but, unable to support himself financially, he left after just 18 months to seek work as a copywriter at the advertising agency Publicit\u00e9 Damour. He liked the work, and spoke more than once with wry approval of the lessons in the classical virtues of brevity and precision of language he learned while drafting advertising copy.<ref name=\"Liukkonen\"/>\n\nAnouilh's financial troubles continued after he was called up to military service in 1929.  Supported by only his meager conscription salary, Anouilh married the actress Monelle Valentin in 1931. Though Valentin starred in many of his plays, Anouilh's daughter Caroline (from his second marriage), claims that the marriage was not a happy one. Anouilh's youngest daughter Colombe even claims that there was never an official marriage between Anouilh and Valentin. She allegedly had multiple extramarital affairs, which caused Anouilh much pain and suffering.  The infidelity weighed heavily on the dramatist as a result of the uncertainty about his own parentage. According to Caroline, Anouilh had learned that his mother had had a lover at the theatre in Arcachon who was actually his biological father. In spite of this, Anouilh and Valentin had a daughter, Catherine, in 1934 who followed the pair into theatre work at an early age. Anouilh's growing family placed further strain on his already limited finances. Determined to break into writing full-time, he began to write comic scenes for the cinema to supplement their income.<ref name=\"AnouilhCaroline\"/>\n\n===Theatre work===\nAt the age of 25, Anouilh found work as a secretary to the French actor and director [[Louis Jouvet]] at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Though Anouilh's boss had happily lent him some of the set furniture left over from the production of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s  play ''Siegfried'' to furnish his modest home, the director was not interested in encouraging his assistant's attempts at playwriting.<ref name=\"Falb\"/> Jouvet had risen to fame in the early 1930s through his collaborations with the playwright Giraudoux, and together the two worked to shift focus from the authorial voice of the director (which had dominated the French stage since the early twentieth century) back to the playwright and his text.\n\nGiraudoux was an inspiration to Anouilh and, with the encouragement of the acclaimed playwright, he began writing again in 1929. Before the end of the year he made his theatrical debut with ''Humulus le muet'', a collaborative project with [[Jean Aurenche]]. It was followed by his first solo projects, ''L'Hermine'' (''The Ermine'') in 1932 and ''Mandarine'' in 1933, both produced by [[Aur\u00e9lien Lugn\u00e9-Poe]], an innovative actor and stage manager who was then head of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre]].<ref name=\"Levi\"/> Ruled by the philosophy, \"the word creates the decor,\" Lugn\u00e9-Poe let Anouilh's lyrical prose shine in front of a backdrop of simple compositions of line and color that created a unity of style and mood.<ref name=\"Brockett442\"/>\n\nThe plays were not great successes, closing after 37 and 13 performances respectively, but Anouilh persevered, following it up with a string of productions, most notably ''Y'avait un prisonnier'' (1935). These works, most in collaboration with the experimental Russian director [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]], were considered promising despite their lack of commercial profits, and the duo continued to work together until they had their first major success in 1937 with ''[[Le voyageur sans bagage]]'' (''Traveller Without Luggage''). In subsequent years, there was rarely a season in Paris that did not prominently feature a new Anouilh play and many of these were also being exported to England and America.<ref name=\"Pronko\"/> After 1938, however, much of Anouilh's later work was directed by the prominent Paris scenic designer [[Andr\u00e9 Barsacq]], who had taken over as director of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Atelier]] after [[Charles Dullin]]'s retirement in 1940.  Barsacq was a champion for Anouilh and their affiliation was a major factor in the playwright's continued success after the war.<ref name=\"Brockett458485\"/>\n\n===Playwright===\nIn the 1940s, Anouilh turned from contemporary tales to more mythical, classic, and historic subjects.  With protagonists who asserted their independence from the fated past, themes during this period are more closely related to the existential concerns of such writers as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]]. The most famous play of this group is ''Antigone'', which \"established Anouilh as a leading dramatist, not only because of the power with which he drew the classic confrontation between the uncompromising Antigone and the politically expedient Creon, but also because French theatre-goers under the occupation read the play as a contemporary political parable.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/> His post-war plays dealt with similar concerns and included ''Rom\u00e9o et Jeannette'', ''M\u00e9d\u00e9e'' (''Medea''), and Anouilh's [[Joan of Arc]] story ''L'Alouette'' (''[[The Lark (play)|The Lark]]''), which, in its distinct optimism, rivalled the commercial success of ''Antigone''.\n\nAnouilh himself grouped his plays of this period on the basis of their dominant tone, publishing his later works in collected volumes to reflect what he felt \"represented the phases of his evolution and loosely resembled the distinction between comedy and tragedy.\"<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/> ''Pi\u00e8ces noires'' or \"Black plays\" were tragedies or realistic dramas and included ''Antigone'', ''J\u00e9zabel'', and ''La Sauvage'' (''The Restless Heart'').  This category typically featured \"young,  idealistic, and uncompromising protagonists [who] are able to maintain their integrity only by choosing death.\"<ref name=\"Brockett483\"/>  By contrast, Anouilh's ''pi\u00e8ces roses'' or \"pink plays\" were comedies where fantasy dominated with an atmosphere similar to that of fairy tales. In these plays such as ''Le Bal des voleurs'' (''Carnival of Thieves''), ''Le Rendez-vous de Senlis'' (''Dinner with the Family'') and ''[[L\u00e9ocadia]]'' (''Time Remembered''), the focus is on \"the burden of the environment and especially of the past on a protagonist seeking a happier, freer existence.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nMost of Anouilh's plays of the late 1940s and into the 1950s become darker and distinctly cruel and, in contrast with his earlier works, begin to feature middle-aged characters who must view life more practically than Anouilh's former idealistic youths. The playwright divided the works of this period into ''pi\u00e8ces brillantes'' (\"brilliant plays\") and ''pi\u00e8ces grin\u00e7antes'' (\"grating plays\"). The first group includes works such as ''L'Invitation au ch\u00e2teau'' (Ring Round the Moon) and ''Colombe'', and are typified by aristocratic settings and witty banter. The grating plays like ''[[The Waltz of the Toreadors|La Valse des tor\u00e9adors]]'' (''Waltz of the Toreadors'') and ''Le R\u00e9actionnaire amoureux'' (''The Fighting Cock'') are more bitterly funny, trading clever word play for a darker tone of disillusionment.\n\nAnother category Anouilh specifies are his ''pi\u00e8ces costum\u00e9es'' (\"costume plays\") which include ''The Lark'', ''La Foire d'Empoigne'' (''Catch as Catch Can''), and [[Becket]], an international success, depicting the historical martyr [[Thomas Becket]], the Archbishop of Canterbury who sought to defend the church against the monarch (and his friend), [[Henry II of England]], who had appointed him to his see. So classified because they share historical \"costumed\" settings, Anouilh also specifies that these plays must also prominently feature an enlightened protagonist seeking \"a moral path in a world of corruption and manipulation.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nAnouilh's final period begins with ''La Grotte'' (''The Cavern''), in which he comments on his own progress as a writer and a theatre artist. The central character is a playwright suffering from writer's block who in his frustration recalls the foibles of [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''. Anouilh's work had always contained hints of [[metatheatre|metatheatricality]], or commentary on the business of theatre within the world of the play, but in his late works these structures became more fully developed as he begins to write primarily about character who are dramatists or theatre directors. There is also a pronounced link, during this time, of Anouilh's emphasis of theatre and the family, displaying intimate relationships that are \"more profound and more important than the traditional heightened action of 'theatre'&thinsp;\".{{whose quote|dated=October 2016}} Antoine, the playwright-protagonist of ''Cher Antoine; ou, L'Amour rat\u00e9'' (''Dear Antoine; or, The Love That Failed''), asserts that the world must take notice of these ''pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes'' (secret dramas) and Anouilh scholars have proposed this name, ''pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes'', to classify the collected works of his latest period.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>{{clarify|date=October 2016}}<!--one double-quotation mark missing; quotation uncertain.-->\n\n===Political controversy===\nAnouilh remained staunchly apolitical for most of his life and career. He served in the military during at least two periods, having been drafted into the French Army in 1931 and 1939. He was a prisoner of war for a short time when the Germans conquered France and willingly lived and worked in Paris during the subsequent [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]]. Because he refused to take sides during France's collaboration with the [[Axis Alliance]] some critics have branded him as a potential Nazi sympathiser.  This controversy escalated as a result of Anouilh's public clashes with leader of the [[Free French Forces]] (and later President of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]), [[Charles de Gaulle|General Charles de Gaulle]].  In the mid-1940s Anouilh and several other intellectuals signed a petition for clemency to save the writer [[Robert Brasillach]], who was condemned to death for being a Nazi collaborator. Brasillach was executed by firing squad in February 1945, despite the outcry from Anouilh and his peers that the new government had no right to persecute individuals for \"intellectual crimes\" in the absence of military or political action.<ref name=\"Kaplan\"/> Nevertheless, Anouilh refused to comment on his political views, writing in a letter to the Belgian critic Hubert Gignoux in 1946, \"I do not have a biography and I am very happy about it. The rest of my life, as long as God wills it, will remain my personal business, and I will withhold the details of it.\"<ref name=\"Ginestier\"/>\nAnouilh's plays provide the most important clues about his political point of view, though their reputation for ambiguity further complicates the matter. For instance ''Antigone'', provides an [[allegory|allegorical]] representation of the debate between the idealistic members of the [[French Resistance]] and the pragmatism of the collaborationists. Though many have read the play as having a strong anti-Nazi sentiment, the fact that the Vichy Regime allowed the piece to be performed without censure testifies to the fact that it was potentially seen as supportive of the occupation in its time.<ref name=\"Wiles\"/><ref name=\"Krauss\"/>  Though the playwright romanticizes Antigone's sense of honor and duty to what is morally right, in this case resisting the Nazi forces, it can also be said that Anouilh, like Sophocles before him, makes a convincing argument for Creon's method of leadership.<ref name=\"Smith2426\"/>\n\n===Awards and recognition===\nIn 1970 his work was recognized with the ''[[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]]''. In 2012, the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years and it was revealed that Anouilh was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], along with John Steinbeck (winner), [[Robert Graves]], [[Lawrence Durrell]] and [[Karen Blixen]].<ref name=floodjan2013>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |title=Swedish Academy reopens controversy surrounding Steinbeck's Nobel prize |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Alison Flood |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}</ref> According to a report in ''The Guardian'', \"It is not clear why Anouilh was passed over, but the French poet [[Saint-John Perse]] had taken the Nobel in 1960, meaning that France was well represented on the roster of winners, and ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' reveals that [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who won the prize in 1964, was starting to be seriously considered as a candidate.\"<ref name=floodjan2013/>\n\nIn 1980, he was the first recipient of the [[Grand prix du th\u00e9\u00e2tre (Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise)|Grand Prix du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] established that year.\n\n==Critical discussion==\nBy the end of his career, Anouilh's reputation outstripped all his contemporaries. However, his repertoire remained unusually confined to theatre and film. Most French dramatists of the 1930s and 1940s, including Anouilh's most significant contemporary influence, Giraudoux, not only wrote for the stage but also composed poetry, novels, or essays.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/> Nevertheless, he remained prolific, consistently producing and publishing performance works for more than fifty years.\n\nAnouilh's early works were \"naturalistic studies of a sordid and corrupt world.\"<ref name=\"Liukkonen\"/> Many of these plays present the reader with the striking and inescapable dichotomy between pragmatism and a sort of transcendent idealism.  There is little to no \"middle ground of ambiguity\" that exists where this conflict asserts itself.<ref name=\"Pucciani\"/> This is evidenced in ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage.'' The main character Gaston, a World War I veteran who suffers from amnesia, cannot remember the moral depravity of his youth (he slept with his brother's wife and severely injured his best friend). This checkered past is invariably at odds with the near-angelic behavior that he now exhibits, and recognition of this truth forces him to leave his former identity behind, unable to reconcile the two sides of himself. In denouncing his past, Gaston reclasses his freedom as an illusion, but one of his own making. He befriends a young English boy and shows him his identifying scar; this gesture allows the boy to describe Gaston to the authorities, thereby claiming him as kin. With a new life and a new family, Gaston has a fresh start.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/>  David I. Grossvogel, describes this situation as the \"restoration of a childhood paradise lost,\" attributing ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage'' as the beginning of Anouilh's search to justify the unhappiness of his youth.<ref name=\"Grossvogel\"/> Theatre historian Marvin Carlson agrees, noting that this play epitomizes the \"complex tonality and deft dramatic technique\" that remained throughout his work, though, he asserts, it was only as the playwright matured that his \"dark view of the human condition [reached] its final expression.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nAnouilh disagreed with these somber readings of his best works, however, arguing that, like all great French literature, his plays had found ways to laugh at misfortune. \"Thanks to Moli\u00e8re,\" Anouilh said, \"the true French theatre is the only one that is not gloomy, in which we laugh like men at war with our misery and our horror. This humor is one of France's messages to the world.\"<ref name=\"Hotchman\"/>\n\nDisclosing his thoughts on French theatre and his personal perspective as a playwright, he said that the perception of his work was often misguided:\n\n{{quote|I am played in private theaters, so I write for the bourgeoisie.  One has to rely on the people who pay for their places; the people who support the theater are bourgeois.  But this public has changed:  They have such a terror of not being in touch, of missing out on a fashionable event that they no longer exist as a decisive force.  I think the public has lost its head.  They now say that a play can't be that good if they can understand it.  My plays are not hermetic enough.  It's rather Moli\u00e8resque, don't you think?|author=Jean Anouilh<ref name=\"Porter\"/>}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Anouilh examined his antagonism with General de Gaulle in ''L'Hurluberlu, ou Le Reactionnaire amoureux'' (1958) and ''Le Songe du critique'' (1960). He began to lose the favor of audiences and critics alike, however, with the emergence of such playwrights as [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] and [[Samuel Beckett]]. Though he shared with these authors a \"similar desperate vision of human existence,\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Liukkonen|first=Petri and Ari Pesonen|title=Jean Anouilh (1910-1987)}}</ref> these new absurdist theatres' pursuit of alternative dramaturgies made Anouilh's semi-realistic plays seem dull and old-fashioned. In the 1980s Anouilh reinvented himself as a director, staging his own plays as well as those of other authors. He died of a heart attack in Lausanne, Switzerland on 3 October 1987. By then divorced from Monelle Valentin, he was survived by his second wife, Nicole Lan\u00e7on, and four children.\n\n==Works==\n===Original theatre productions: Paris===\n* ''L'Hermine''.

Because of the difficulty of building [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] that can radiate such long waves, ELF frequencies have been used in only a very few man-made communication systems. ELF waves can penetrate [[seawater]], which makes them useful in [[communication with submarines]], and a few nations have built military ELF transmitters to transmit signals to their submerged submarines, consisting of huge grounded wire antennas ([[ground dipole]]s) 15 - 60 km long driven by transmitters producing [[megawatt]]s of power. The US, Russia, India, and China are the only nations known to have constructed these ELF communication facilities.<!--Ref blast--><ref name=\"NavyFactSheet\">{{cite web |title=Extremely Low Frequency Transmitter Site, Clam Lake, Wisconsin |work=Navy Fact File |publisher=United States Navy |date=28 June 2001 |url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/fs_clam_lake_elf2003.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=17 February 2012}} at the [http://www.fas.org/ Federation of American Scientists website]</ref><ref name=\"Wolkoff\">{{cite conference |first=E.

In contrast to VLF waves, the height of the layer is much less than one wavelength at ELF frequencies, so the only mode that can propagate at ELF frequencies is the [[TEM mode]] in [[vertical polarization]], with the [[electric field]] vertical and the [[magnetic field]] horizontal.

Signals in the ELF frequency range, however, can penetrate much deeper. Two factors limit the usefulness of ELF communications channels: the low data transmission rate of a few characters per minute and, to a lesser extent, the one-way nature due to the impracticality of installing an antenna of the required size on a submarine (the antenna needs to be of an exceptional size in order to achieve successful communication). Generally, ELF signals have been used to order a submarine to rise to a shallow depth where it could receive some other form of communication.\n\n===Difficulties of ELF communication===\nOne of the difficulties posed when broadcasting in the ELF frequency range is [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] size, because the length of the antenna must be at least a substantial fraction of the length of the waves. Simply put, a 3 [[hertz|Hz]] (cycle per second) signal would have a wavelength equal to the distance EM waves travel through a given medium in one third of a second. Taking account of [[refractive index]], ELF waves propagate slightly slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. As used in military applications, the wavelength is {{convert|299,792|km|abbr=on}} per second divided by 50\u201385&nbsp;Hz, which equals around {{convert|3500|to|6000|km|abbr=on}} long. This is comparable to the [[Earth]]'s diameter of around {{convert|12742|km|abbr=on}}. Because of this huge size requirement, to transmit internationally using ELF frequencies, the Earth itself forms a significant part of the antenna, and extremely long leads are necessary into the ground. Various means, such as [[electrical lengthening]], are used to construct practical radio stations with smaller sizes.\n\nThe U.S. maintained two sites, in the [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]], [[Wisconsin]] and in the [[Escanaba River State Forest]], [[Michigan]] (originally named [[Project Sanguine]], then downsized and rechristened Project ELF prior to construction), until they were dismantled, beginning in late September 2004. Both sites used long [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, so-called [[ground dipole]]s, as leads. These leads were in multiple strands ranging from {{convert|22.5|to|45|km}} long. Because of the inefficiency of this method, considerable amounts of [[electric power|electrical power]] were required to operate the system.\n\n===Ecological impact===\nThere have been some concerns over the possible ecological impact of ELF signals. In 1984 a federal judge halted construction, requiring more environmental and health studies. This judgment was overruled by a federal appeals court on the basis that the [[US Navy]] claimed to have spent over $25 million studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields, with results indicating that they were similar to the effect produced by standard power distribution lines. The judgment was not accepted by everyone and, during the time that ELF was in use, some Wisconsin politicians such as Democratic Senators [[Herb Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold]] and Congressman [[Dave Obey]] called for its closure. Similar concerns have, in the past, been raised about electromagnetic radiation and health.\n\n==Other uses==\nTransmitters in the 22&nbsp;Hz range are also used in pipeline maintenance or [[pigging]]. The signal is generated as an alternating magnetic field, and the transmitter is mounted to, or to part of, the \"pig\", the cleaning device inserted into the pipe. The pig is pushed through a pipeline mostly made of metal. The ELF signal can be detected through the metal allowing its location to be detected by receivers located outside of the pipe.<ref>St\u00e9phane Sainson, ''Inspection en ligne des pipelines. Principes et m\u00e9thodes''. Ed. Lavoisier. 2007. {{ISBN|978-2743009724}}. 332 p.</ref> It is needed to check if a pig has passed a certain location and to locate a pig which has become stuck.\n\nSome radio monitoring hobbyists record ELF [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s using antennas ranging in size from eighteen inch active antennas up to several thousand feet in length taking advantage of fences, highway guard rails, and even decommissioned railroad tracks, and [[pitch control|play them back at higher speeds]] to more easily observe natural low frequency fluctuations in the [[Earth science#Earth's electromagnetic field|Earth's electromagnetic field]]. Increasing the playback speed increases the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], so that it can be brought into the [[audio frequency]] range for audibility.\n\n==Natural sources==\nNaturally occurring ELF waves are present on Earth, resonating in the region between [[ionosphere]] and surface seen in [[lightning]] strikes that make electrons in the atmosphere oscillate.<ref name=\"Titan ELF\">{{cite news| url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| title=Titan's Mysterious Radio Wave| date=1 June 2007| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory| accessdate=2007-06-02| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603142552/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| archivedate=3 June 2007| df=dmy-all}} Republished as \"''[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassinif-20070601-02.html Casini - Unlocking Saturn's Secrets - Titan's mysterious radio wave]''\". 22 November 2007.

Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of ELF waves, so the waves may instead be reflecting off the liquid-ice boundary of a subsurface ocean of water and ammonia, the existence of which is predicted by some theoretical models.

Williams showed a correlation between the resonance frequency and tropical air temperatures, suggesting the resonance could be used to monitor [[global warming]].<ref name=\"Williams\">{{cite journal\n  | last1  = Williams\n  | first1 = Earle R.\n  | title = The Schumann resonance: A global tropical thermometer\n  | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]\n  | volume = 256\n  | issue = 5060\n  | pages = 1184\u20131187\n  | date = May 22, 1992\n  | issn = \n  | doi =  10.1126/science.256.5060.1184 \n  | pmid = 17795213\n | id = \n  | bibcode =1992Sci...256.1184W}}</ref><ref name=\"Barr2\" />\n\n==Submarine communications==\n[[Image:Ground dipole ELF antenna.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|A [[ground dipole]] antenna used for transmitting ELF waves, similar to the U.S. Navy Clam Lake antennas, showing how it works.

Signals in the ELF frequency range, however, can penetrate much deeper. Two factors limit the usefulness of ELF communications channels: the low data transmission rate of a few characters per minute and, to a lesser extent, the one-way nature due to the impracticality of installing an antenna of the required size on a submarine (the antenna needs to be of an exceptional size in order to achieve successful communication). Generally, ELF signals have been used to order a submarine to rise to a shallow depth where it could receive some other form of communication.\n\n===Difficulties of ELF communication===\nOne of the difficulties posed when broadcasting in the ELF frequency range is [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] size, because the length of the antenna must be at least a substantial fraction of the length of the waves. Simply put, a 3 [[hertz|Hz]] (cycle per second) signal would have a wavelength equal to the distance EM waves travel through a given medium in one third of a second. Taking account of [[refractive index]], ELF waves propagate slightly slower than the speed of light in a vacuum. As used in military applications, the wavelength is {{convert|299,792|km|abbr=on}} per second divided by 50\u201385&nbsp;Hz, which equals around {{convert|3500|to|6000|km|abbr=on}} long. This is comparable to the [[Earth]]'s diameter of around {{convert|12742|km|abbr=on}}. Because of this huge size requirement, to transmit internationally using ELF frequencies, the Earth itself forms a significant part of the antenna, and extremely long leads are necessary into the ground. Various means, such as [[electrical lengthening]], are used to construct practical radio stations with smaller sizes.\n\nThe U.S. maintained two sites, in the [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]], [[Wisconsin]] and in the [[Escanaba River State Forest]], [[Michigan]] (originally named [[Project Sanguine]], then downsized and rechristened Project ELF prior to construction), until they were dismantled, beginning in late September 2004. Both sites used long [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, so-called [[ground dipole]]s, as leads. These leads were in multiple strands ranging from {{convert|22.5|to|45|km}} long. Because of the inefficiency of this method, considerable amounts of [[electric power|electrical power]] were required to operate the system.\n\n===Ecological impact===\nThere have been some concerns over the possible ecological impact of ELF signals. In 1984 a federal judge halted construction, requiring more environmental and health studies. This judgment was overruled by a federal appeals court on the basis that the [[US Navy]] claimed to have spent over $25 million studying the effects of the electromagnetic fields, with results indicating that they were similar to the effect produced by standard power distribution lines. The judgment was not accepted by everyone and, during the time that ELF was in use, some Wisconsin politicians such as Democratic Senators [[Herb Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold]] and Congressman [[Dave Obey]] called for its closure. Similar concerns have, in the past, been raised about electromagnetic radiation and health.\n\n==Other uses==\nTransmitters in the 22&nbsp;Hz range are also used in pipeline maintenance or [[pigging]]. The signal is generated as an alternating magnetic field, and the transmitter is mounted to, or to part of, the \"pig\", the cleaning device inserted into the pipe. The pig is pushed through a pipeline mostly made of metal. The ELF signal can be detected through the metal allowing its location to be detected by receivers located outside of the pipe.<ref>St\u00e9phane Sainson, ''Inspection en ligne des pipelines. Principes et m\u00e9thodes''. Ed. Lavoisier. 2007. {{ISBN|978-2743009724}}. 332 p.</ref> It is needed to check if a pig has passed a certain location and to locate a pig which has become stuck.\n\nSome radio monitoring hobbyists record ELF [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s using antennas ranging in size from eighteen inch active antennas up to several thousand feet in length taking advantage of fences, highway guard rails, and even decommissioned railroad tracks, and [[pitch control|play them back at higher speeds]] to more easily observe natural low frequency fluctuations in the [[Earth science#Earth's electromagnetic field|Earth's electromagnetic field]]. Increasing the playback speed increases the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], so that it can be brought into the [[audio frequency]] range for audibility.\n\n==Natural sources==\nNaturally occurring ELF waves are present on Earth, resonating in the region between [[ionosphere]] and surface seen in [[lightning]] strikes that make electrons in the atmosphere oscillate.<ref name=\"Titan ELF\">{{cite news| url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| title=Titan's Mysterious Radio Wave| date=1 June 2007| publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory| accessdate=2007-06-02| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603142552/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features/feature20070601c.cfm| archivedate=3 June 2007| df=dmy-all}} Republished as \"''[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/whycassini/cassinif-20070601-02.html Casini - Unlocking Saturn's Secrets - Titan's mysterious radio wave]''\". 22 November 2007.

This frequency, and higher resonance modes of 14, 20, 26 and 32&nbsp;Hz appear as peaks in the ELF spectrum and are called [[Schumann resonance]].\n\nELF waves have also been tentatively identified on Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of ELF waves, so the waves may instead be reflecting off the liquid-ice boundary of a subsurface ocean of water and ammonia, the existence of which is predicted by some theoretical models. Titan's ionosphere is also more complex than Earth's, with the main ionosphere at an altitude of {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} but with an additional layer of charged particles at {{convert|63|km|abbr=on}}. This splits Titan's atmosphere into two separate resonating chambers.

A study by Reilly in 1999 showed that the threshold for direct perception of exposure to ELF RF by human volunteer subjects started at around 2 to 5 kV/m at 60&nbsp;Hz, with 10% of volunteers detecting the ELF exposure at this level.

He became frustrated with his [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag pores kept becoming clogged with dust thus reducing suction.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dyson.co.uk/community/aboutdyson.aspx |title=About Dyson |publisher=Dyson |year=2015}}</ref> The cyclone idea came from a [[sawmill]] that used cyclone technology (''qv.''

It won the [[iF product design award|1991 International Design Fair Prize]] in Japan. He filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner [https://encrypted.google.com/patents/EP0037674A1?cl=pt EP0037674] in 1980.\n\nAfter his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Ltd]]. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in [[Malmesbury]], Wiltshire.\n\nDyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was \u00a3100&nbsp;million. The slogan \"say goodbye to the bag\" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag&nbsp;\u2013 users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience.  The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |title=Against The Odds |last=Dyson |first=James |authorlink=James Dyson |first2=Giles |last2=Coren |year=1997 |edition=1st |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London, UK |isbn=0-7528-0981-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 134, 135, 244] |url=https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 }}</ref> In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).\n\nDyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to [[Fantom Technologies]], after which Dyson entered the market directly.\n\nFollowing his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued [[The Hoover Company|Hoover (UK)]] for patent infringement.  The [[High Court]] ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dyson cleans up in patent battle with rival Hoover|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1368860/Dyson-cleans-up-in-patent-battle-with-rival-Hoover.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=3 October 2000}}</ref> Hoover agreed to pay damages of \u00a34&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball.  This ball, rather than the static wheels on existing vacuums, enabled it to become more steerable, which was more useful for navigating around obstacles and corners.\n\nIn mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his \"360 Eye\" [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360\u00b0 scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]].<ref name=360Eye>{{cite web|title=Dyson 360 Eye\u2122 robot|url=https://www.dyson360eye.com/|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=26 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326022104/https://www.dyson360eye.com/|archivedate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nInterviewed by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company magazine]]'' (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one's life, \"I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution. So I don't mind failure. I've always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they've had. The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative.\"<ref name=\"Failure Doesn\u2019t Suck\"/>\n\n== Other inventions ==\nIn 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a [[washing machine]] called the [[List of Dyson products#Contrarotator washing machine|ContraRotator]], which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. It was not a commercial success, and is no longer available.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |title=Dyson declines to commit to controversial Contrarotator <!--sic--> |date=11 December 2007 |publisher=Current.com.au |accessdate=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603160954/http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |archivedate=3 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the [[optical illusion]]s depicted in the [[Lithography|lithographs]] of Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]]. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a [[water sculpture]] in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. Called ''Wrong Garden'', it was displayed at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3046791.stm |work=BBC News| title=How does Dyson make water go uphill? | date=21 May 2003 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.\n\n[[File:DysonAirblade.jpg|thumb|Dyson Airblade [[hand dryer]]]]\nIn October 2006 Dyson launched the [[Dyson Airblade]], a fast [[hand dryer]] that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a [[squeegee]] to remove water, rather than attempting to [[evaporation|evaporate]] it with heat.

The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for [[Key Stage]] 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of ''Genius of Britain'', a [[Channel 4]] TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\n\nIn May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the [[University of Cambridge]].

His first original invention, the [[Ballbarrow]], was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel. This was featured on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' television programme. Dyson stuck with the idea of a ball, inventing the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He then designed the Wheelboat,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.dyson.co.nz/about/story/default.asp?searchType=story&story=earlydesigns|title=Inside Dyson|publisher=Dyson|access-date=22 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018160236/http://content.dyson.co.nz/about/story/default.asp?searchType=story&story=earlydesigns|archive-date=18 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40&nbsp;mph) on both land and water.\n\n==Vacuum cleaners==\n[[File:Dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|DC07 bagless [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]] [[vacuum cleaner]]]]\nIn the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using [[cyclonic separation]] to create a [[vacuum cleaner]] that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag pores kept becoming clogged with dust thus reducing suction.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dyson.co.uk/community/aboutdyson.aspx |title=About Dyson |publisher=Dyson |year=2015}}</ref> The cyclone idea came from a [[sawmill]] that used cyclone technology (''qv.'' [[Dyson (company)#History|History of Dyson Ltd]]).<ref name=JBD>Issue: ''The Journal of Business and Design'', vol. 8, no. 1</ref>\n\nPartly supported by his wife's salary as an art teacher, and after five years and about 5,127 [[prototype]]s, Dyson launched the \"G-Force\" cleaner in 1983.<ref name=\"Failure Doesn\u2019t Suck\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/59549/failure-doesnt-suck|title=Failure Doesn't Suck|date=1 May 2007|work=Fast Company|accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref> However, no manufacturer or distributor would handle his product in the UK, as it would have disturbed the valuable market for replacement dust bags, so Dyson launched it in Japan through catalogue sales.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/ceonetwork/2006/08/01/leadership-facetime-dyson-cx_hc_0801dyson.html | work=Forbes | title=James Dyson Cleans Up | date=1 August 2006}}</ref> Manufactured in bright pink, the G-Force sold for the equivalent of \u00a32,000. It won the [[iF product design award|1991 International Design Fair Prize]] in Japan. He filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner [https://encrypted.google.com/patents/EP0037674A1?cl=pt EP0037674] in 1980.\n\nAfter his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Ltd]]. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in [[Malmesbury]], Wiltshire.\n\nDyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was \u00a3100&nbsp;million. The slogan \"say goodbye to the bag\" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag&nbsp;\u2013 users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience.  The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |title=Against The Odds |last=Dyson |first=James |authorlink=James Dyson |first2=Giles |last2=Coren |year=1997 |edition=1st |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London, UK |isbn=0-7528-0981-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 134, 135, 244] |url=https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 }}</ref> In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).\n\nDyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to [[Fantom Technologies]], after which Dyson entered the market directly.\n\nFollowing his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued [[The Hoover Company|Hoover (UK)]] for patent infringement.  The [[High Court]] ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dyson cleans up in patent battle with rival Hoover|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1368860/Dyson-cleans-up-in-patent-battle-with-rival-Hoover.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=3 October 2000}}</ref> Hoover agreed to pay damages of \u00a34&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball.  This ball, rather than the static wheels on existing vacuums, enabled it to become more steerable, which was more useful for navigating around obstacles and corners.\n\nIn mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his \"360 Eye\" [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360\u00b0 scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]].<ref name=360Eye>{{cite web|title=Dyson 360 Eye\u2122 robot|url=https://www.dyson360eye.com/|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=26 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326022104/https://www.dyson360eye.com/|archivedate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nInterviewed by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company magazine]]'' (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one's life, \"I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution. So I don't mind failure. I've always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they've had. The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative.\"<ref name=\"Failure Doesn\u2019t Suck\"/>\n\n== Other inventions ==\nIn 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a [[washing machine]] called the [[List of Dyson products#Contrarotator washing machine|ContraRotator]], which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. It was not a commercial success, and is no longer available.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |title=Dyson declines to commit to controversial Contrarotator <!--sic--> |date=11 December 2007 |publisher=Current.com.au |accessdate=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603160954/http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |archivedate=3 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the [[optical illusion]]s depicted in the [[Lithography|lithographs]] of Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]]. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a [[water sculpture]] in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp.

The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for [[Key Stage]] 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of ''Genius of Britain'', a [[Channel 4]] TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\n\nIn May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the [[University of Cambridge]].

It opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, and dramatically [[structural failure|collapsed]] into Puget Sound on November{{nbsp}}7 the same year. The bridge's collapse has been described as \"spectacular\" and in subsequent decades \"has attracted the attention of engineers, physicists, and mathematicians\".<ref>Gianni Arioli and Filippo Gazzola. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X14003424?via%3Dihub A new mathematical explanation of what triggered the catastrophic torsional mode of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge]. Applied Mathematical Modelling, Jan 2015. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2014.06.022</ref> Throughout its short existence, it was the world's third-longest suspension bridge by main span, behind the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and the [[George Washington Bridge]].\n\nConstruction began in September 1938. From the time the [[deck (bridge)|deck]] was built, it began to move vertically in windy conditions, so construction workers nicknamed the bridge '''Galloping Gertie'''. The motion continued after the bridge opened to the public, despite several damping measures. The bridge's main span finally collapsed in {{convert|40|mph|km/h|adj=on}} winds on the morning of November 7, 1940, as the deck oscillated in an alternating twisting motion that gradually increased in amplitude until the deck tore apart.\n\nThe portions of the bridge still standing after the collapse, including the towers and cables, were dismantled and sold as scrap metal. Efforts to replace the bridge were delayed by the United States' entry into [[World War II]], but in 1950, a [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)|new Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] opened in the same location, using the original bridge's tower pedestals and cable anchorages. The portion of the bridge that fell into the water now serves as an [[artificial reef]].\n\nThe bridge's collapse had a lasting effect on science and engineering. In many [[physics]] textbooks, the event is presented as an example of elementary forced [[Mechanical resonance|resonance]], but that is incorrect: the bridge collapsed because moderate winds produced [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]] that was self-exciting and unbounded: for any constant sustained wind speed above about {{cvt|35|mph|km/h|||}}, the amplitude of the ([[torsion]]al) flutter oscillation would continuously increase, with a negative [[damping]] factor (i.e. a reinforcing effect, opposite to damping).<ref name=\"BillahScanlan91\"/> The collapse boosted research into bridge aerodynamics-aeroelastics, which has influenced the designs of all later long-span bridges.\n\n==Design and construction==\n{{refimprove section|date = April 2015}}\nThe desire for the construction of a bridge between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula dates back to 1889 with a [[Northern Pacific Railway]] proposal for a [[trestle]], but concerted efforts began in the mid-1920s. The Tacoma [[Chamber of Commerce]] began campaigning and funding studies in 1923.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tacoma Narrows Bridges|last = Petroski|first = Henry|date = 2009|journal =[[American Scientist]]|doi = 10.1511/2009.77.103|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 97|issue = 2|edition = 2|issn = 0003-0996|pages = 103\u2013107}}</ref> Several noted bridge engineers, including [[Joseph Strauss (engineer)|Joseph B. Strauss]], who went on to be chief engineer of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], and [[David B. Steinman]], who went on to design the [[Mackinac Bridge]], were consulted. Steinman made several Chamber-funded visits, culminating in a preliminary proposal presented in 1929, but by 1931, the Chamber decided to cancel the agreement on the grounds that Steinman was not sufficiently active in working to obtain financing. Another problem with financing the first bridge was buying out the ferry contract from a private firm running services on the Narrows at the time.\n\nThe Washington State legislature created the [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority|Washington State Toll Bridge Authority]] and appropriated $5,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|5000|1931|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to study the request by Tacoma and [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] for a bridge over the Narrows.<ref>Plaut, R.H. (2008). \"Snap Loads and Torsional Oscillation of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge\". ''[[Journal of Sound and Vibration]]. doi: 10.1016/j.jsv.2007.07.057''</ref>\n\nFrom the start, financing of the bridge was a problem: revenue from the proposed tolls would not be enough to cover construction costs, but there was strong support for the bridge from the [[U.S. Navy]], which operated the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], and from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], which ran [[McChord Air Force Base|McChord Field]] and [[Fort Lewis]] near Tacoma.\n\nWashington State engineer [[Clark Eldridge]] <!-- state employee, not just resident in the state --> produced a preliminary tried-and-true conventional suspension bridge design, and the [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority]] requested $11 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|11|1931|r=0|fmt=c}} million today) from the Federal [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA). Preliminary construction plans by the Washington Department of Highways had called for a set of {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} [[trusses]] to sit beneath the roadway and stiffen it.\n\nHowever, according to Eldridge, \"Eastern consulting engineers\"\u2014by which Eldridge meant [[Leon Moisseiff]], the noted New York bridge engineer who served as designer and consultant engineer for the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]\u2014petitioned the PWA and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) to build the bridge for less. Moisseiff and Frederick Lienhard, the latter an engineer with what was then known as the [[Port of New York Authority]], had published a paper<ref>Leon S. Moisseiff and Frederick Lienhard. \"Suspension Bridges Under the Action of Lateral Forces,\" with discussion. ''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'', No. 98, 1933, pp. 1080\u20131095, 1096\u20131141</ref> that was probably the most important theoretical advance in the bridge engineering field of the decade.<ref name=\"RichardScott\">Richard Scott. In the Wake of Tacoma: Suspension Bridges and the Quest for Aerodynamic Stability. ''American Society of Civil Engineers'' (June 1, 2001) {{ISBN|0-7844-0542-5}}  https://books.google.com/books?id=DnQOzYDJsm8C</ref> Their theory of elastic distribution extended the [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] theory that was originally devised by the Austrian engineer [[Josef Melan]] to horizontal bending under static wind load. They showed that the stiffness of the main cables (via the suspenders) would absorb up to one-half of the static wind pressure pushing a suspended structure laterally. This energy would then be transmitted to the anchorages and towers.<ref name=\"RichardScott\"/> Using this theory, Moisseiff argued for stiffening the bridge with a set of {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|spell=in|-deep}} plate girders rather than the {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep|}} trusses proposed by the Washington Toll Bridge Authority. This approach meant a slimmer, more elegant design, and also reduced the construction costs as compared with the Highway Department's design proposed by Eldridge. Moisseiff's design won out, inasmuch as the other proposal was considered to be too expensive. On June 23, 1938, the PWA approved nearly $6 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|6|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Another $1.6 million (${{inflation|US|1.6|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) was to be collected from tolls to cover the estimated total $8<!-- ibid --> million cost (${{inflation|US|8|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).\n[[File:Tacoma Narrows Bridge opening program June 30, 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Program for the opening of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, June 30, 1940]]\nFollowing Moisseiff's design, bridge construction began on September 27, 1938. Construction took only nineteen months, at a cost of $6.4 million (${{inflation|US|6.4|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today), which was financed by the grant from the PWA and a loan from the RFC.\n\nThe Tacoma Narrows Bridge, with a main span of {{convert|2800|ft}}, was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world at that time, following the [[George Washington Bridge]] between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York City]], and the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], connecting [[San Francisco]] with [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to its north.<ref>Henry Petroski. Engineers of Dreams: Great Bridge Builders and the Spanning of America. New York: [[Knopf]]/[[Random House]], 1995.</ref>\n\nBecause planners expected fairly light traffic volumes, the bridge was designed with two lanes, and it was just {{convert|39|ft}} wide. This was quite narrow, especially in comparison with its length. With only the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} plate girders providing additional depth, the bridge's roadway section was also shallow.\n\nThe decision to use such shallow and narrow girders proved to be the original Tacoma Narrows  Bridge's undoing. With such minimal girders, the deck of the bridge was insufficiently rigid and was easily moved about by winds; from the start, the bridge became infamous for its movement. A mild to moderate wind could cause alternate halves of the center [[span (architecture)|span]] to visibly rise and fall several feet over four- to five-second intervals. This flexibility was experienced by the builders and workmen during construction, which led some of the workers to christen the bridge  \"Galloping Gertie\". The nickname soon stuck, and even the public (when the [[toll bridge|toll]]-paid traffic started) felt these motions on the day that the bridge opened on July 1, 1940.\n\n==Attempt to control structural vibration==\nSince the structure experienced considerable vertical [[oscillations]] while it was still under construction, several strategies were used to reduce the motion of the bridge. They included<ref>Rita Robison. \"Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse.\" In ''When Technology Fails'', edited by Neil Schlager, pp. 18\u2013190. Detroit: [[Gale Research]], 1994.</ref>\n* attachment of tie-down cables to the plate girders, which were anchored to 50-ton [[concrete]] blocks on the shore. This measure proved ineffective, as the cables snapped shortly after installation.\n* addition of a pair of inclined [[Cable-stayed bridge|cable stays]] that connected the main cables to the bridge deck at mid-span. These remained in place until the collapse, but were also ineffective at reducing the oscillations.\n* finally, the structure was equipped with hydraulic buffers installed between the towers and the floor system of the deck to [[damping|damp]] longitudinal motion of the main span. The effectiveness of the hydraulic dampers was nullified, however, because the seals of the units were damaged when the bridge was sand-blasted before being painted.\n\nThe [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority]] hired Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineering professor at the [[University of Washington]], to make [[wind-tunnel]] tests and recommend solutions in order to reduce the oscillations of the bridge. Professor Farquharson and his students built a 1:200-scale model of the bridge and a 1:20-scale model of a section of the deck. The first studies concluded on November 2, 1940\u2014five days before the bridge collapse on November 7. He proposed two solutions:\n* To drill holes in the lateral girders and along the deck so that the air flow could circulate through them (in this way reducing [[lift (force)|lift forces]]).\n* To give a more [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] shape to the transverse section of the deck by adding fairings or deflector vanes along the deck, attached to the girder fascia.\nThe first option was not favored because of its irreversible nature. The second option was the chosen one, but it was not carried out, because the bridge collapsed five days after the studies were concluded.<ref name=\"RichardScott\"/>\n\n==Collapse==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TacomaNarrowsBridgeCollapse in color.jpg|thumb|The bridge collapsing, in a frame from a 16 mm Kodachrome motion picture film taken by Barney Elliott]] -->\nThe wind-induced collapse occurred on November 7, 1940, at approximately 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (PST), and was caused by a physical phenomenon known as [[aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]].<ref name=\"BillahScanlan91\"/>\n\nLeonard Coatsworth, a ''[[Tacoma News Tribune]]'' editor, was the last person to drive on the bridge:\n\n{{quote|Around me I could hear concrete cracking.

It included [[Othmar Ammann]] and [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]]. Without drawing any definitive conclusions, the commission explored three possible failure causes:\n* Aerodynamic instability by self-induced vibrations in the structure\n* Eddy formations that might be periodic in nature\n* Random effects of turbulence, that is the random fluctuations in velocity of the wind.\n\n===Cause of the collapse===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nThe original Tacoma Narrows Bridge was the first to be built with girders of carbon [[steel]] anchored in concrete blocks; preceding designs typically had open lattice beam trusses underneath the roadbed. This bridge was the first of its type to employ plate girders (pairs of deep [[I-beam]]s) to support the roadbed. With the earlier designs, any wind would simply pass through the truss, but in the new design the wind would be diverted above and below the structure. Shortly after construction finished at the end of June (opened to traffic on July 1, 1940), it was discovered that the bridge would sway and [[buckling|buckle]] dangerously in relatively mild windy conditions that are common for the area, and worse during severe winds. This vibration was [[transverse wave|transverse]], one-half of the central span rising while the other lowered. Drivers would see cars approaching from the other direction rise and fall, riding the violent energy wave through the bridge. However, at that time the mass of the bridge was considered to be sufficient to keep it structurally sound.\n\nThe failure of the bridge occurred when a never-before-seen twisting mode occurred, from winds at {{convert|40|mph}}. This is a so-called torsional [[vibration mode]] (which is different from the [[transverse mode|transversal]] or [[longitudinal mode|longitudinal]] vibration mode), whereby when the left side of the roadway went down, the right side would rise, and vice versa (i.e., the two halves of the bridge twisted in opposite directions), with the center line of the road remaining still (motionless). This vibration was caused by [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic fluttering]].\n\n[[File:Tacoma Bridge Animation.ogv|thumb|Full-scale, two-way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) model of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge exhibiting aeroelastic flutter]] Fluttering is a physical phenomenon in which several [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] of a structure become coupled in an unstable oscillation driven by the wind. Here, unstable means that the forces and effects that cause the oscillation are not checked by forces and effects that limit the oscillation, so it does not self-limit but grows without bound.  Eventually, the amplitude of the motion produced by the fluttering increased beyond the strength of a vital part, in this case the suspender cables.  As several cables failed, the weight of the deck transferred to the adjacent cables, which became overloaded and broke in turn until almost all of the central deck fell into the water below the span.\n\n====Resonance (due to Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street) hypothesis====\n[[Image:Vortex-street-animation.gif|thumb|right|Vortex shedding and [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]] behind a circular cylinder.

H. Freeman]] | location= | isbn=978-0-7167-0903-9 | pages=|year=2004 }})</ref>) wrongly explain that the cause of the failure of the Tacoma Narrows bridge was externally forced mechanical resonance. Resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate at larger amplitudes at certain frequencies, known as the system's natural frequencies. At these frequencies, even relatively small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude vibrations, because the system stores energy. For example, a child using a swing realizes that if the pushes are properly timed, the swing can move with a very large amplitude. The driving force, in this case the child pushing the swing, exactly replenishes the energy that the system loses if its frequency equals the natural frequency of the system.\n\nUsually, the approach taken by those physics textbooks is to introduce a first order  forced oscillator, defined by the [[second-order differential equation]]\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>m\\ddot{x}(t) + c\\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = F \\cos (\\omega t)</math>  |{{EquationRef|eq. 1}}}}\n\nwhere {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|k}} stand for the [[mass]], [[damping coefficient]] and [[stiffness]] of the [[linear system]] and {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|\u03c9}} represent the amplitude and the [[angular frequency]] of the exciting force.  The solution of such [[ordinary differential equation]] as a function of time {{mvar|t}} represents the displacement response of the system (given appropriate initial conditions). In the above system resonance happens when {{mvar|\u03c9}} is approximately <math>\\omega_r = \\sqrt{k/m}</math>, i.e. <math>\\omega_r</math> is the natural (resonant) frequency of the system. The actual vibration analysis of a more complicated mechanical system\u2014such as an airplane, a building or a bridge\u2014is based on the linearization of the equation of motion for the system, which is a multidimensional version of equation ({{EquationNote|eq. 1}}). The analysis requires [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] analysis and thereafter the natural frequencies of the structure are found, together with the so-called ''fundamental modes'' of the system, which are a set of independent displacements and/or rotations that specify completely the displaced or deformed position and orientation of the body or system, i.e., the bridge moves as a (linear) combination of those basic deformed positions.\n\nEach structure has natural frequencies.  For resonance to occur, it is necessary to have also periodicity in the excitation force. The most tempting candidate of the periodicity in the wind force was assumed to be the so-called [[vortex shedding]]. This is because bluff bodies (non-streamlined bodies), like bridge decks, in a fluid stream shed [[wake]]s, whose characteristics depend on the size and shape of the body and the properties of the fluid. These wakes are accompanied by alternating low-pressure vortices on the downwind side of the body (the so-called [[Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]]). The body will in consequence try to move toward the low-pressure zone, in an oscillating movement called [[vortex induced vibration|vortex-induced vibration]]. Eventually, if the frequency of vortex shedding matches the natural frequency of the structure, the structure will begin to resonate and the structure's movement can become self-sustaining.\n\nThe frequency of the vortices in the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street is called the Strouhal frequency <math>f_s</math>, and is given by\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{f_s D}{U} = S</math>  |{{EquationRef|eq. 2}}}}\nHere, {{mvar|U}} stands for the flow velocity, {{mvar|D}} is a characteristic length of the bluff body and {{mvar|S}} is the dimensionless [[Strouhal number]], which depends on the body in question. For [[Reynolds Number]]s greater than 1000, the Strouhal number is approximately equal to 0.21. In the case of the Tacoma Narrows, {{mvar|D}}&nbsp; was approximately {{convert|8|ft}} and {{mvar|S}} was 0.20.\n\nIt was thought that the Strouhal frequency was close enough to one of the natural vibration frequencies of the bridge i.e. <math>2\\pi f_s = \\omega</math>, to cause resonance and therefore [[vortex induced vibration|vortex-induced vibration]].\n\nIn the case of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, this appears not to have been the cause of the catastrophic damage. According to Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineering professor at the University of Washington and one of the main researchers into the cause of the bridge collapse, the wind was steady at {{convert|42|mph}} and the frequency of the destructive mode was 12 cycles/minute (0.2 [[Hertz|Hz]]).<ref>F. B. Farquharson et al. Aerodynamic stability of suspension bridges with special reference to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. University of Washington Engineering Experimental Station, Seattle. Bulletin 116. Parts I to V. A series of reports issued since June 1949 to June 1954.</ref> This frequency was neither a natural mode of the isolated structure nor the frequency of blunt-body [[vortex shedding]] of the bridge at that wind speed (which was approximately 1&nbsp;Hz). It can be concluded therefore that the vortex shedding was not the cause of the bridge collapse. The event can be understood only while considering the coupled aerodynamic and structural system that requires rigorous mathematical analysis to reveal all the degrees of freedom of the particular structure and the set of design loads imposed.\n\nVortex-induced vibration is a far more complex process that involves both the external wind-initiated forces and internal self-excited forces that lock on to the motion of the structure. During lock-on, the wind forces drive the structure at or near one of its natural frequencies, but as the amplitude increases this has the effect of changing the local fluid boundary conditions, so that this induces compensating, self-limiting forces, which restrict the motion to relatively benign amplitudes. This is clearly not a linear resonance phenomenon, even if the bluff body has itself linear behaviour, since the exciting force amplitude is a nonlinear force of the structural response.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Billah, K.Y.R. and Scanlan, R.H. \"Vortex-Induced Vibration and its Mathematical Modeling: A Bibliography\", Report No. SM-89-1.

Yusuf Billah and Robert Scanlan. According to the two engineers, the failure of the bridge was related to a wind-driven amplification of the torsional oscillation that, unlike a resonance, increases monotonically with increasing wind speed. The fluid dynamics behind that amplification is complicated, but one key element, as described by physicists Daniel Green and William Unruh, is the creation of large-scale vortices above and below the roadway, or deck, of the bridge. Nowadays, bridges are constructed to be rigid and to have mechanisms that damp oscillations. Sometimes they include a slot in the middle of the deck to alleviate pressure differences above and below the road.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse|journal =[[Physics Today]]|date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0031-9228|pages = 64\u201365|volume = 68|issue = 11|doi = 10.1063/PT.3.2991|first = Donald W.|last = Olson|first2 = Steven F.|last2 = Wolf|first3 = Joseph M.|last3 = Hook|bibcode = 2015PhT....68k..64O |doi-access = free}}</ref> }}\n\nTo some degree the debate is due to the lack of a commonly accepted precise definition of resonance.

It would appear not to contradict the qualitative definition of resonance quoted earlier, if we now identify the source of the periodic impulses as ''self-induced'', the wind supplying the power, and the motion supplying the power-tapping mechanism.  If one wishes to argue, however, that it was a case of ''externally forced linear resonance'', the mathematical distinction ... is quite clear, self-exciting systems differing strongly enough from ordinary linear resonant ones.\"\n\n== Link to the Armistice Day blizzard ==\nThe weather system that caused the bridge collapse went on to cause the [[Armistice Day Blizzard]] that killed 145 people in the [[Midwest]]:\n\n{{quote|The strong winds in the Tacoma Narrows on 7 November 1940 were related to a remarkable low-pressure system that followed a track across the country and four days later produced the Armistice Day storm, one of the greatest storms ever to strike the Great Lakes region.

It opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, and dramatically [[structural failure|collapsed]] into Puget Sound on November{{nbsp}}7 the same year. The bridge's collapse has been described as \"spectacular\" and in subsequent decades \"has attracted the attention of engineers, physicists, and mathematicians\".<ref>Gianni Arioli and Filippo Gazzola.

Applied Mathematical Modelling, Jan 2015. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2014.06.022</ref> Throughout its short existence, it was the world's third-longest suspension bridge by main span, behind the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and the [[George Washington Bridge]].\n\nConstruction began in September 1938. From the time the [[deck (bridge)|deck]] was built, it began to move vertically in windy conditions, so construction workers nicknamed the bridge '''Galloping Gertie'''. The motion continued after the bridge opened to the public, despite several damping measures. The bridge's main span finally collapsed in {{convert|40|mph|km/h|adj=on}} winds on the morning of November 7, 1940, as the deck oscillated in an alternating twisting motion that gradually increased in amplitude until the deck tore apart.\n\nThe portions of the bridge still standing after the collapse, including the towers and cables, were dismantled and sold as scrap metal. Efforts to replace the bridge were delayed by the United States' entry into [[World War II]], but in 1950, a [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)|new Tacoma Narrows Bridge]] opened in the same location, using the original bridge's tower pedestals and cable anchorages. The portion of the bridge that fell into the water now serves as an [[artificial reef]].\n\nThe bridge's collapse had a lasting effect on science and engineering. In many [[physics]] textbooks, the event is presented as an example of elementary forced [[Mechanical resonance|resonance]], but that is incorrect: the bridge collapsed because moderate winds produced [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]] that was self-exciting and unbounded: for any constant sustained wind speed above about {{cvt|35|mph|km/h|||}}, the amplitude of the ([[torsion]]al) flutter oscillation would continuously increase, with a negative [[damping]] factor (i.e. a reinforcing effect, opposite to damping).<ref name=\"BillahScanlan91\"/> The collapse boosted research into bridge aerodynamics-aeroelastics, which has influenced the designs of all later long-span bridges.\n\n==Design and construction==\n{{refimprove section|date = April 2015}}\nThe desire for the construction of a bridge between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula dates back to 1889 with a [[Northern Pacific Railway]] proposal for a [[trestle]], but concerted efforts began in the mid-1920s. The Tacoma [[Chamber of Commerce]] began campaigning and funding studies in 1923.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Tacoma Narrows Bridges|last = Petroski|first = Henry|date = 2009|journal =[[American Scientist]]|doi = 10.1511/2009.77.103|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 97|issue = 2|edition = 2|issn = 0003-0996|pages = 103\u2013107}}</ref> Several noted bridge engineers, including [[Joseph Strauss (engineer)|Joseph B. Strauss]], who went on to be chief engineer of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], and [[David B. Steinman]], who went on to design the [[Mackinac Bridge]], were consulted. Steinman made several Chamber-funded visits, culminating in a preliminary proposal presented in 1929, but by 1931, the Chamber decided to cancel the agreement on the grounds that Steinman was not sufficiently active in working to obtain financing. Another problem with financing the first bridge was buying out the ferry contract from a private firm running services on the Narrows at the time.\n\nThe Washington State legislature created the [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority|Washington State Toll Bridge Authority]] and appropriated $5,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|5000|1931|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) to study the request by Tacoma and [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] for a bridge over the Narrows.<ref>Plaut, R.H. (2008). \"Snap Loads and Torsional Oscillation of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge\". ''[[Journal of Sound and Vibration]]. doi: 10.1016/j.jsv.2007.07.057''</ref>\n\nFrom the start, financing of the bridge was a problem: revenue from the proposed tolls would not be enough to cover construction costs, but there was strong support for the bridge from the [[U.S. Navy]], which operated the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], and from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], which ran [[McChord Air Force Base|McChord Field]] and [[Fort Lewis]] near Tacoma.\n\nWashington State engineer [[Clark Eldridge]] <!-- state employee, not just resident in the state --> produced a preliminary tried-and-true conventional suspension bridge design, and the [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority]] requested $11 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|11|1931|r=0|fmt=c}} million today) from the Federal [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA). Preliminary construction plans by the Washington Department of Highways had called for a set of {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} [[trusses]] to sit beneath the roadway and stiffen it.\n\nHowever, according to Eldridge, \"Eastern consulting engineers\"\u2014by which Eldridge meant [[Leon Moisseiff]], the noted New York bridge engineer who served as designer and consultant engineer for the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]\u2014petitioned the PWA and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) to build the bridge for less. Moisseiff and Frederick Lienhard, the latter an engineer with what was then known as the [[Port of New York Authority]], had published a paper<ref>Leon S. Moisseiff and Frederick Lienhard. \"Suspension Bridges Under the Action of Lateral Forces,\" with discussion. ''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'', No. 98, 1933, pp. 1080\u20131095, 1096\u20131141</ref> that was probably the most important theoretical advance in the bridge engineering field of the decade.<ref name=\"RichardScott\">Richard Scott. In the Wake of Tacoma: Suspension Bridges and the Quest for Aerodynamic Stability. ''American Society of Civil Engineers'' (June 1, 2001) {{ISBN|0-7844-0542-5}}  https://books.google.com/books?id=DnQOzYDJsm8C</ref> Their theory of elastic distribution extended the [[deflection (engineering)|deflection]] theory that was originally devised by the Austrian engineer [[Josef Melan]] to horizontal bending under static wind load. They showed that the stiffness of the main cables (via the suspenders) would absorb up to one-half of the static wind pressure pushing a suspended structure laterally. This energy would then be transmitted to the anchorages and towers.<ref name=\"RichardScott\"/> Using this theory, Moisseiff argued for stiffening the bridge with a set of {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|spell=in|-deep}} plate girders rather than the {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep|}} trusses proposed by the Washington Toll Bridge Authority. This approach meant a slimmer, more elegant design, and also reduced the construction costs as compared with the Highway Department's design proposed by Eldridge. Moisseiff's design won out, inasmuch as the other proposal was considered to be too expensive. On June 23, 1938, the PWA approved nearly $6 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|6|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Another $1.6 million (${{inflation|US|1.6|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) was to be collected from tolls to cover the estimated total $8<!-- ibid --> million cost (${{inflation|US|8|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).\n[[File:Tacoma Narrows Bridge opening program June 30, 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Program for the opening of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, June 30, 1940]]\nFollowing Moisseiff's design, bridge construction began on September 27, 1938. Construction took only nineteen months, at a cost of $6.4 million (${{inflation|US|6.4|1938|r=1|fmt=c}} million today), which was financed by the grant from the PWA and a loan from the RFC.\n\nThe Tacoma Narrows Bridge, with a main span of {{convert|2800|ft}}, was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world at that time, following the [[George Washington Bridge]] between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York City]], and the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], connecting [[San Francisco]] with [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to its north.<ref>Henry Petroski. Engineers of Dreams: Great Bridge Builders and the Spanning of America. New York: [[Knopf]]/[[Random House]], 1995.</ref>\n\nBecause planners expected fairly light traffic volumes, the bridge was designed with two lanes, and it was just {{convert|39|ft}} wide. This was quite narrow, especially in comparison with its length. With only the {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} plate girders providing additional depth, the bridge's roadway section was also shallow.\n\nThe decision to use such shallow and narrow girders proved to be the original Tacoma Narrows  Bridge's undoing. With such minimal girders, the deck of the bridge was insufficiently rigid and was easily moved about by winds; from the start, the bridge became infamous for its movement. A mild to moderate wind could cause alternate halves of the center [[span (architecture)|span]] to visibly rise and fall several feet over four- to five-second intervals. This flexibility was experienced by the builders and workmen during construction, which led some of the workers to christen the bridge  \"Galloping Gertie\". The nickname soon stuck, and even the public (when the [[toll bridge|toll]]-paid traffic started) felt these motions on the day that the bridge opened on July 1, 1940.\n\n==Attempt to control structural vibration==\nSince the structure experienced considerable vertical [[oscillations]] while it was still under construction, several strategies were used to reduce the motion of the bridge. They included<ref>Rita Robison. \"Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse.\" In ''When Technology Fails'', edited by Neil Schlager, pp. 18\u2013190. Detroit: [[Gale Research]], 1994.</ref>\n* attachment of tie-down cables to the plate girders, which were anchored to 50-ton [[concrete]] blocks on the shore. This measure proved ineffective, as the cables snapped shortly after installation.\n* addition of a pair of inclined [[Cable-stayed bridge|cable stays]] that connected the main cables to the bridge deck at mid-span. These remained in place until the collapse, but were also ineffective at reducing the oscillations.\n* finally, the structure was equipped with hydraulic buffers installed between the towers and the floor system of the deck to [[damping|damp]] longitudinal motion of the main span. The effectiveness of the hydraulic dampers was nullified, however, because the seals of the units were damaged when the bridge was sand-blasted before being painted.\n\nThe [[Washington Toll Bridge Authority]] hired Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineering professor at the [[University of Washington]], to make [[wind-tunnel]] tests and recommend solutions in order to reduce the oscillations of the bridge. Professor Farquharson and his students built a 1:200-scale model of the bridge and a 1:20-scale model of a section of the deck. The first studies concluded on November 2, 1940\u2014five days before the bridge collapse on November 7. He proposed two solutions:\n* To drill holes in the lateral girders and along the deck so that the air flow could circulate through them (in this way reducing [[lift (force)|lift forces]]).\n* To give a more [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] shape to the transverse section of the deck by adding fairings or deflector vanes along the deck, attached to the girder fascia.\nThe first option was not favored because of its irreversible nature. The second option was the chosen one, but it was not carried out, because the bridge collapsed five days after the studies were concluded.<ref name=\"RichardScott\"/>\n\n==Collapse==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TacomaNarrowsBridgeCollapse in color.jpg|thumb|The bridge collapsing, in a frame from a 16 mm Kodachrome motion picture film taken by Barney Elliott]] -->\nThe wind-induced collapse occurred on November 7, 1940, at approximately 11:00&nbsp;a.m. (PST), and was caused by a physical phenomenon known as [[aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic flutter]].<ref name=\"BillahScanlan91\"/>\n\nLeonard Coatsworth, a ''[[Tacoma News Tribune]]'' editor, was the last person to drive on the bridge:\n\n{{quote|Around me I could hear concrete cracking.

It included [[Othmar Ammann]] and [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]]. Without drawing any definitive conclusions, the commission explored three possible failure causes:\n* Aerodynamic instability by self-induced vibrations in the structure\n* Eddy formations that might be periodic in nature\n* Random effects of turbulence, that is the random fluctuations in velocity of the wind.\n\n===Cause of the collapse===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nThe original Tacoma Narrows Bridge was the first to be built with girders of carbon [[steel]] anchored in concrete blocks; preceding designs typically had open lattice beam trusses underneath the roadbed. This bridge was the first of its type to employ plate girders (pairs of deep [[I-beam]]s) to support the roadbed. With the earlier designs, any wind would simply pass through the truss, but in the new design the wind would be diverted above and below the structure. Shortly after construction finished at the end of June (opened to traffic on July 1, 1940), it was discovered that the bridge would sway and [[buckling|buckle]] dangerously in relatively mild windy conditions that are common for the area, and worse during severe winds. This vibration was [[transverse wave|transverse]], one-half of the central span rising while the other lowered. Drivers would see cars approaching from the other direction rise and fall, riding the violent energy wave through the bridge. However, at that time the mass of the bridge was considered to be sufficient to keep it structurally sound.\n\nThe failure of the bridge occurred when a never-before-seen twisting mode occurred, from winds at {{convert|40|mph}}. This is a so-called torsional [[vibration mode]] (which is different from the [[transverse mode|transversal]] or [[longitudinal mode|longitudinal]] vibration mode), whereby when the left side of the roadway went down, the right side would rise, and vice versa (i.e., the two halves of the bridge twisted in opposite directions), with the center line of the road remaining still (motionless). This vibration was caused by [[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|aeroelastic fluttering]].\n\n[[File:Tacoma Bridge Animation.ogv|thumb|Full-scale, two-way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) model of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge exhibiting aeroelastic flutter]] Fluttering is a physical phenomenon in which several [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] of a structure become coupled in an unstable oscillation driven by the wind. Here, unstable means that the forces and effects that cause the oscillation are not checked by forces and effects that limit the oscillation, so it does not self-limit but grows without bound.  Eventually, the amplitude of the motion produced by the fluttering increased beyond the strength of a vital part, in this case the suspender cables.  As several cables failed, the weight of the deck transferred to the adjacent cables, which became overloaded and broke in turn until almost all of the central deck fell into the water below the span.\n\n====Resonance (due to Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street) hypothesis====\n[[Image:Vortex-street-animation.gif|thumb|right|Vortex shedding and [[K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]] behind a circular cylinder.

H. Freeman]] | location= | isbn=978-0-7167-0903-9 | pages=|year=2004 }})</ref>) wrongly explain that the cause of the failure of the Tacoma Narrows bridge was externally forced mechanical resonance. Resonance is the tendency of a system to oscillate at larger amplitudes at certain frequencies, known as the system's natural frequencies. At these frequencies, even relatively small periodic driving forces can produce large amplitude vibrations, because the system stores energy. For example, a child using a swing realizes that if the pushes are properly timed, the swing can move with a very large amplitude. The driving force, in this case the child pushing the swing, exactly replenishes the energy that the system loses if its frequency equals the natural frequency of the system.\n\nUsually, the approach taken by those physics textbooks is to introduce a first order  forced oscillator, defined by the [[second-order differential equation]]\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>m\\ddot{x}(t) + c\\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = F \\cos (\\omega t)</math>  |{{EquationRef|eq. 1}}}}\n\nwhere {{mvar|m}}, {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|k}} stand for the [[mass]], [[damping coefficient]] and [[stiffness]] of the [[linear system]] and {{mvar|F}} and {{mvar|\u03c9}} represent the amplitude and the [[angular frequency]] of the exciting force.  The solution of such [[ordinary differential equation]] as a function of time {{mvar|t}} represents the displacement response of the system (given appropriate initial conditions). In the above system resonance happens when {{mvar|\u03c9}} is approximately <math>\\omega_r = \\sqrt{k/m}</math>, i.e. <math>\\omega_r</math> is the natural (resonant) frequency of the system. The actual vibration analysis of a more complicated mechanical system\u2014such as an airplane, a building or a bridge\u2014is based on the linearization of the equation of motion for the system, which is a multidimensional version of equation ({{EquationNote|eq. 1}}). The analysis requires [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue]] analysis and thereafter the natural frequencies of the structure are found, together with the so-called ''fundamental modes'' of the system, which are a set of independent displacements and/or rotations that specify completely the displaced or deformed position and orientation of the body or system, i.e., the bridge moves as a (linear) combination of those basic deformed positions.\n\nEach structure has natural frequencies.  For resonance to occur, it is necessary to have also periodicity in the excitation force. The most tempting candidate of the periodicity in the wind force was assumed to be the so-called [[vortex shedding]]. This is because bluff bodies (non-streamlined bodies), like bridge decks, in a fluid stream shed [[wake]]s, whose characteristics depend on the size and shape of the body and the properties of the fluid. These wakes are accompanied by alternating low-pressure vortices on the downwind side of the body (the so-called [[Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]]). The body will in consequence try to move toward the low-pressure zone, in an oscillating movement called [[vortex induced vibration|vortex-induced vibration]]. Eventually, if the frequency of vortex shedding matches the natural frequency of the structure, the structure will begin to resonate and the structure's movement can become self-sustaining.\n\nThe frequency of the vortices in the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street is called the Strouhal frequency <math>f_s</math>, and is given by\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\frac{f_s D}{U} = S</math>  |{{EquationRef|eq. 2}}}}\nHere, {{mvar|U}} stands for the flow velocity, {{mvar|D}} is a characteristic length of the bluff body and {{mvar|S}} is the dimensionless [[Strouhal number]], which depends on the body in question. For [[Reynolds Number]]s greater than 1000, the Strouhal number is approximately equal to 0.21. In the case of the Tacoma Narrows, {{mvar|D}}&nbsp; was approximately {{convert|8|ft}} and {{mvar|S}} was 0.20.\n\nIt was thought that the Strouhal frequency was close enough to one of the natural vibration frequencies of the bridge i.e. <math>2\\pi f_s = \\omega</math>, to cause resonance and therefore [[vortex induced vibration|vortex-induced vibration]].\n\nIn the case of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, this appears not to have been the cause of the catastrophic damage. According to Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson, an engineering professor at the University of Washington and one of the main researchers into the cause of the bridge collapse, the wind was steady at {{convert|42|mph}} and the frequency of the destructive mode was 12 cycles/minute (0.2 [[Hertz|Hz]]).<ref>F. B. Farquharson et al. Aerodynamic stability of suspension bridges with special reference to the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. University of Washington Engineering Experimental Station, Seattle. Bulletin 116. Parts I to V. A series of reports issued since June 1949 to June 1954.</ref> This frequency was neither a natural mode of the isolated structure nor the frequency of blunt-body [[vortex shedding]] of the bridge at that wind speed (which was approximately 1&nbsp;Hz). It can be concluded therefore that the vortex shedding was not the cause of the bridge collapse. The event can be understood only while considering the coupled aerodynamic and structural system that requires rigorous mathematical analysis to reveal all the degrees of freedom of the particular structure and the set of design loads imposed.\n\nVortex-induced vibration is a far more complex process that involves both the external wind-initiated forces and internal self-excited forces that lock on to the motion of the structure. During lock-on, the wind forces drive the structure at or near one of its natural frequencies, but as the amplitude increases this has the effect of changing the local fluid boundary conditions, so that this induces compensating, self-limiting forces, which restrict the motion to relatively benign amplitudes. This is clearly not a linear resonance phenomenon, even if the bluff body has itself linear behaviour, since the exciting force amplitude is a nonlinear force of the structural response.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Billah, K.Y.R. and Scanlan, R.H. \"Vortex-Induced Vibration and its Mathematical Modeling: A Bibliography\", Report No. SM-89-1.

[[McGraw Hill]], 1984, pp. 216\u2013239.</ref> }}\n\nA group of physicists cited \"wind-driven amplification of the torsional oscillation\" as distinct from resonance:\n\n{{quote|Subsequent authors have rejected the resonance explanation, and their perspective is gradually spreading to the physics community. The user's guide for the current American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) DVD states the bridge collapse \"was not a case of resonance.\" Bernard Feldman likewise concluded in a 2003 article for the Physics Teacher that for the torsional oscillation mode, there was \"no resonance behavior in the amplitude as a function of the wind velocity.\"\n\nAn important source for both the AAPT user's guide and for Feldman was a 1991 American Journal of Physics article by K. Yusuf Billah and Robert Scanlan. According to the two engineers, the failure of the bridge was related to a wind-driven amplification of the torsional oscillation that, unlike a resonance, increases monotonically with increasing wind speed. The fluid dynamics behind that amplification is complicated, but one key element, as described by physicists Daniel Green and William Unruh, is the creation of large-scale vortices above and below the roadway, or deck, of the bridge. Nowadays, bridges are constructed to be rigid and to have mechanisms that damp oscillations. Sometimes they include a slot in the middle of the deck to alleviate pressure differences above and below the road.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse|journal =[[Physics Today]]|date = 2015-11-01|issn = 0031-9228|pages = 64\u201365|volume = 68|issue = 11|doi = 10.1063/PT.3.2991|first = Donald W.|last = Olson|first2 = Steven F.|last2 = Wolf|first3 = Joseph M.|last3 = Hook|bibcode = 2015PhT....68k..64O |doi-access = free}}</ref> }}\n\nTo some degree the debate is due to the lack of a commonly accepted precise definition of resonance.   Billah and Scanlan<ref name=\"BillahScanlan91\" />  provide the following definition of resonance \"In general, whenever a system capable of oscillation is acted on by a periodic series of impulses having a frequency equal to or nearly equal to one of the natural frequencies of the oscillation of the system, the system is set into oscillation with a relatively large amplitude.\"  They then state later in their paper \"Could this be called a resonant phenomenon? It would appear not to contradict the qualitative definition of resonance quoted earlier, if we now identify the source of the periodic impulses as ''self-induced'', the wind supplying the power, and the motion supplying the power-tapping mechanism.  If one wishes to argue, however, that it was a case of ''externally forced linear resonance'', the mathematical distinction ... is quite clear, self-exciting systems differing strongly enough from ordinary linear resonant ones.\"\n\n== Link to the Armistice Day blizzard ==\nThe weather system that caused the bridge collapse went on to cause the [[Armistice Day Blizzard]] that killed 145 people in the [[Midwest]]:\n\n{{quote|The strong winds in the Tacoma Narrows on 7 November 1940 were related to a remarkable low-pressure system that followed a track across the country and four days later produced the Armistice Day storm, one of the greatest storms ever to strike the Great Lakes region.

Fourteen-foot-high (4.3 m) steel trusses were installed on both sides of the deck in 1943 to weigh down and stiffen the bridge in an effort to reduce oscillation. In 2003, the stiffening trusses were removed and aerodynamic fiberglass fairings were installed along both sides of the road deck.\n\nA key consequence was that suspension bridges reverted to a deeper and heavier [[truss]] design, including the replacement [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)]], until the development in the 1960s of [[box girder bridges]] with an [[aerofoil]] shape such as the [[Severn Bridge]], which gave the necessary stiffness together with reduced torsional forces.\n\n== Replacement bridge ==\n{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1950)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge}}\nBecause of shortages in materials and labor as a result of the involvement of the United States in World War II, it took 10 years before a replacement bridge was opened to traffic.

The replacement bridge also has more lanes than the original bridge, which only had two traffic lanes, plus shoulders on both sides.\n\nHalf a century later, the replacement bridge had exceeded its traffic capacity, and a second, parallel suspension bridge was constructed to carry eastbound traffic. The suspension bridge that was completed in 1950 was reconfigured to carry only westbound traffic. The new parallel bridge opened to traffic in July 2007.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of bridge disasters]]\n* [[List of structural failures and collapses]]\n* [[Engineering disasters]]\n* [[Millennium Bridge, London]], for an engineering error\n* [[Silver Bridge]]\n* [[Volgograd Bridge]], a bridge in Russia which experienced similar problems with the wind\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [https://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-myth-of-galloping-gertie \"The Strangest, Most Spectacular Bridge Collapse (And How We Got It Wrong)\"] (December 2015).

His most famous invention was the [[snowmobile]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Valcourt (city), Quebec|Valcourt]], Quebec, Joseph-Armand Bombardier dabbled in mechanics from an early age. He acquired experience by reading, taking notes and repairing what he found until he opened his own garage at age 19, where he would repair cars and sell gasoline in the summertime.\n\nDuring wintertime, he worked on developing a vehicle able to travel on snow. At that time, the Quebec government did not clear snow from secondary roads, so residents of these areas stored their cars for the winter season. The idea to build a winter vehicle came to Bombardier after a blizzard in which his young son fell ill of [[peritonitis]] and died because he could not be brought to the nearest hospital.\n\nThe first B7 (B for Bombardier and 7 for 7 passengers) snowmobiles were sold during the winter of 1936\u201337 and were well received. A new plant able to produce more than 200 vehicles a year was built in 1940. A new 12-passenger model was made available in 1941, but demand was halted when Canada entered [[World War II]]. Bombardier offered his expertise to the Canadian government and started producing specialized military vehicles for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].\n\nAfter the war, business declined when the Quebec government began clearing snow from secondary roads in 1948.

His most famous invention was the [[snowmobile]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Valcourt (city), Quebec|Valcourt]], Quebec, Joseph-Armand Bombardier dabbled in mechanics from an early age. He acquired experience by reading, taking notes and repairing what he found until he opened his own garage at age 19, where he would repair cars and sell gasoline in the summertime.\n\nDuring wintertime, he worked on developing a vehicle able to travel on snow. At that time, the Quebec government did not clear snow from secondary roads, so residents of these areas stored their cars for the winter season. The idea to build a winter vehicle came to Bombardier after a blizzard in which his young son fell ill of [[peritonitis]] and died because he could not be brought to the nearest hospital.\n\nThe first B7 (B for Bombardier and 7 for 7 passengers) snowmobiles were sold during the winter of 1936\u201337 and were well received. A new plant able to produce more than 200 vehicles a year was built in 1940. A new 12-passenger model was made available in 1941, but demand was halted when Canada entered [[World War II]]. Bombardier offered his expertise to the Canadian government and started producing specialized military vehicles for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].\n\nAfter the war, business declined when the Quebec government began clearing snow from secondary roads in 1948. Bombardier went on to build smaller snowmobiles during the 1950s and developed a new market for recreational products for one or two people. Bombardier died in 1964 of cancer but the snowmobile idea was a success and more than 8200 units were sold annually.\n\n==Honours==\nIn 2004, [[Quebec Autoroute 55|Autoroute 55]] in Quebec was named ''{{lang|fr-CA|autoroute Joseph-Armand-Bombardier}}'' between [[Stanstead, Quebec|Stanstead]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]] (''{{lang|fr-CA|autoroute Jean-Lesage}}'') near [[Drummondville]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/pdf/joseph_armand_bombardier.pdf\n |title       = Hommage \u00e0 Joseph-Armand Bombardier\n |publisher   = gouv.qc.ca\n |accessdate  = 2009-04-03\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091007171928/http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/pdf/joseph_armand_bombardier.pdf\n |archivedate = 2009-10-07\n}}</ref> The [[Bombardier Glacier]] in [[Antarctica]] is also named after him.\n\nIn 2000, Joseph-Armand Bombardier was honoured by the [[government of Canada]] with his image on a [[List of people on stamps of Canada|postage stamp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=2266912&rec_nbr_list=2266912|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307093419/http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&lang=eng&rec_nbr=2266912&rec_nbr_list=2266912|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-03-07|title=Joseph-Armand Bombardier: Getting Around in the Winter|work=Library and Archives Canada}}</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"CSEHoF-hall\">[http://sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/about/hallfame/u_m_e.cfm The Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame: The Hall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109201033/http://sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/about/hallfame/u_m_e.cfm |date=2014-11-09 }}, Canada Science and Technology Museum.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bombardier Recreational Products]]\n*[[Snowmobile|Ski-doo]]\n*[[Roski]], a division founded by Joseph-Armand Bombardier\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book| title=Joseph-Armand Bombardier: An Inventor's Dream Come True| last=Lacasse |first=Roger| year=1988| publisher=Libre expression| isbn=2-89111-341-1}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bombardiermuseum.com/  J.

His first original invention, the [[Ballbarrow]], was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel. This was featured on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' television programme. Dyson stuck with the idea of a ball, inventing the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He then designed the Wheelboat,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.dyson.co.nz/about/story/default.asp?searchType=story&story=earlydesigns|title=Inside Dyson|publisher=Dyson|access-date=22 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018160236/http://content.dyson.co.nz/about/story/default.asp?searchType=story&story=earlydesigns|archive-date=18 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40&nbsp;mph) on both land and water.\n\n==Vacuum cleaners==\n[[File:Dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|DC07 bagless [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]] [[vacuum cleaner]]]]\nIn the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using [[cyclonic separation]] to create a [[vacuum cleaner]] that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag pores kept becoming clogged with dust thus reducing suction.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dyson.co.uk/community/aboutdyson.aspx |title=About Dyson |publisher=Dyson |year=2015}}</ref> The cyclone idea came from a [[sawmill]] that used cyclone technology (''qv.''

It won the [[iF product design award|1991 International Design Fair Prize]] in Japan. He filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner [https://encrypted.google.com/patents/EP0037674A1?cl=pt EP0037674] in 1980.\n\nAfter his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Ltd]]. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in [[Malmesbury]], Wiltshire.\n\nDyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was \u00a3100&nbsp;million. The slogan \"say goodbye to the bag\" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag&nbsp;\u2013 users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience.  The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |title=Against The Odds |last=Dyson |first=James |authorlink=James Dyson |first2=Giles |last2=Coren |year=1997 |edition=1st |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London, UK |isbn=0-7528-0981-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 134, 135, 244] |url=https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 }}</ref> In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).\n\nDyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to [[Fantom Technologies]], after which Dyson entered the market directly.\n\nFollowing his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued [[The Hoover Company|Hoover (UK)]] for patent infringement.  The [[High Court]] ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dyson cleans up in patent battle with rival Hoover|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1368860/Dyson-cleans-up-in-patent-battle-with-rival-Hoover.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=3 October 2000}}</ref> Hoover agreed to pay damages of \u00a34&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball.  This ball, rather than the static wheels on existing vacuums, enabled it to become more steerable, which was more useful for navigating around obstacles and corners.\n\nIn mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his \"360 Eye\" [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360\u00b0 scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]].<ref name=360Eye>{{cite web|title=Dyson 360 Eye\u2122 robot|url=https://www.dyson360eye.com/|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=26 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326022104/https://www.dyson360eye.com/|archivedate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nInterviewed by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company magazine]]'' (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one's life, \"I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution. So I don't mind failure. I've always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they've had. The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative.\"<ref name=\"Failure Doesn\u2019t Suck\"/>\n\n== Other inventions ==\nIn 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a [[washing machine]] called the [[List of Dyson products#Contrarotator washing machine|ContraRotator]], which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. It was not a commercial success, and is no longer available.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |title=Dyson declines to commit to controversial Contrarotator <!--sic--> |date=11 December 2007 |publisher=Current.com.au |accessdate=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603160954/http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |archivedate=3 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the [[optical illusion]]s depicted in the [[Lithography|lithographs]] of Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]]. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a [[water sculpture]] in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. Called ''Wrong Garden'', it was displayed at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3046791.stm |work=BBC News| title=How does Dyson make water go uphill? | date=21 May 2003 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.\n\n[[File:DysonAirblade.jpg|thumb|Dyson Airblade [[hand dryer]]]]\nIn October 2006 Dyson launched the [[Dyson Airblade]], a fast [[hand dryer]] that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a [[squeegee]] to remove water, rather than attempting to [[evaporation|evaporate]] it with heat. This allows faster drying, while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAnother product, launched on 18 October 2009, is a [[Bladeless fan|fan without external blades]], which he calls the Air Multiplier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dyson.com/fans/ |title=Dyson air multiplier fan |publisher=Dyson}}</ref> In addition to a cooling fan, a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available.\n\nIn April 2016, Dyson launched the Dyson Supersonic, a [[hair dryer]] with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size, as well as quieter operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dyson.com/haircare/supersonic.aspx|title=The Dyson Supersonic\u2122 hair dryer|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref> Commenting on the launch, [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]] said \"as the first product to launch from Dyson's new UK state-of-the-art hair laboratory, we have high hopes for the future of our blow-dries.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/2016/04/27/dyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-review | work=Vogue | title=Blown Away | date=27 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Research and development==\n\nIn 2017 Dyson spent \u00a37m a week on research and development of new products.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/03/27/sir-james-dyson-remain-controls-dyson-reports-record-results/|title=Sir James Dyson to remain at controls as Dyson reports record results|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=27 March 2017}}</ref> The company is the UK's biggest investor in robotics and artificial intelligence research, employing over 3,500 engineers and scientists, and engaging in more than 40 university research programmes.

The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for [[Key Stage]] 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of ''Genius of Britain'', a [[Channel 4]] TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\n\nIn May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the [[University of Cambridge]]. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research. The donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/the-james-dyson-foundation-donates-ps8m-to-fuel-invention-powerhouse|title=The James Dyson Foundation donates \u00a38m to fuel invention powerhouse |date=6 May 2014 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, the foundation pledged a \u00a312m donation to [[Imperial College London]] to allow the purchase of a Post Office building in [[Exhibition Road]] from the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]].

It won the [[iF product design award|1991 International Design Fair Prize]] in Japan. He filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner [https://encrypted.google.com/patents/EP0037674A1?cl=pt EP0037674] in 1980.\n\nAfter his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Ltd]]. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in [[Malmesbury]], Wiltshire.\n\nDyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was \u00a3100&nbsp;million. The slogan \"say goodbye to the bag\" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag&nbsp;\u2013 users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience.  The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |title=Against The Odds |last=Dyson |first=James |authorlink=James Dyson |first2=Giles |last2=Coren |year=1997 |edition=1st |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London, UK |isbn=0-7528-0981-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 134, 135, 244] |url=https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 }}</ref> In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).\n\nDyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to [[Fantom Technologies]], after which Dyson entered the market directly.\n\nFollowing his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued [[The Hoover Company|Hoover (UK)]] for patent infringement.  The [[High Court]] ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dyson cleans up in patent battle with rival Hoover|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1368860/Dyson-cleans-up-in-patent-battle-with-rival-Hoover.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=3 October 2000}}</ref> Hoover agreed to pay damages of \u00a34&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball.  This ball, rather than the static wheels on existing vacuums, enabled it to become more steerable, which was more useful for navigating around obstacles and corners.\n\nIn mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his \"360 Eye\" [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360\u00b0 scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]].<ref name=360Eye>{{cite web|title=Dyson 360 Eye\u2122 robot|url=https://www.dyson360eye.com/|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=26 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326022104/https://www.dyson360eye.com/|archivedate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nInterviewed by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company magazine]]'' (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one's life, \"I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution. So I don't mind failure. I've always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they've had. The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative.\"<ref name=\"Failure Doesn\u2019t Suck\"/>\n\n== Other inventions ==\nIn 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a [[washing machine]] called the [[List of Dyson products#Contrarotator washing machine|ContraRotator]], which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. It was not a commercial success, and is no longer available.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |title=Dyson declines to commit to controversial Contrarotator <!--sic--> |date=11 December 2007 |publisher=Current.com.au |accessdate=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603160954/http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |archivedate=3 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the [[optical illusion]]s depicted in the [[Lithography|lithographs]] of Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]]. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a [[water sculpture]] in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. Called ''Wrong Garden'', it was displayed at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3046791.stm |work=BBC News| title=How does Dyson make water go uphill? | date=21 May 2003 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.\n\n[[File:DysonAirblade.jpg|thumb|Dyson Airblade [[hand dryer]]]]\nIn October 2006 Dyson launched the [[Dyson Airblade]], a fast [[hand dryer]] that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a [[squeegee]] to remove water, rather than attempting to [[evaporation|evaporate]] it with heat.

The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for [[Key Stage]] 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of ''Genius of Britain'', a [[Channel 4]] TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\n\nIn May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the [[University of Cambridge]].

(Lower-middle left, below the [[Altair 8800]] computer and next to the [[TV Typewriter]].)]]\nThe '''COSMAC Elf''' was an [[RCA 1802]] microprocessor-based computer described in a series of construction articles in ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' [[magazine]] in 1976 and 1977.  Through the back pages of electronics magazines, both [[Netronics]] and [[Quest Electronics]] offered low-priced, enhanced kits that were based on this design. The system was a very early single-board [[personal computer]]. It was operated without built-in [[Read-only memory|ROM]]s and programs were entered directly with help of the [[CPU]] integrated DMA using 8 toggle switches and an Input push button.\n\nIt featured two [[hexadecimal]] [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] displays for byte data value output and a set of 8 [[toggle switch]]es for input. (a hexadecimal [[keypad]] was an optional extension) The base configuration had 256 [[byte]]s of [[RAM]], but expansion projects could raise that to a power of two-based memory store, with an upper limit of 64K address space.\n\nThe original Elf design used a crystal with a frequency in the range of 1 to 2&nbsp;MHz with the 1802's built in oscillator circuit.\n\nA simple circuit used the DMA feature of the 1802 to permit entry of programs and data into RAM through the toggle switches.  Entering a byte via the toggle switches and pressing the \"input\" button would enter a byte into RAM and display it on the pair of hex LEDs, then advance the DMA counter to the next location.  A \"memory protect\" switch could be used to disable memory alteration.  If an error was made in program entry, it could be corrected by turning on memory protect, turning off load mode (thus resetting the program counter to zero), turning on load mode, and pressing \"input\" to advance to the address of the incorrect data.  After turning off memory protect, the correct value could be entered.\n\nThe fourth article of the series presented modifications to use a companion RCA 1861 \u201cPixie\u201d video generator IC (CDP1861).  The Pixie required a 1.76&nbsp;MHz clock, and since that was an uncommon crystal frequency, usually a readily available 3.579545&nbsp;MHz [[colorburst]] crystal was instead used in a separate oscillator circuit with a divide-by-two circuit to drive the clock inputs of both the [[microprocessor]] and Pixie.  The resulting 1.7897725&nbsp;MHz clock was close enough for the hardware to work. Monochrome video output (with timing roughly approximating NTSC standard) could be generated using DMA operations interleaved with carefully arranged 1802 opcodes as instructions in software.  The maximum resolution of the 1861 was 64h by 128v rectangular pixels.  By changing the placement of instructions in the video display control and interrupt routines, pixel rows could be repeated to obtain lower resolutions, allowing the video display to be used with 256 bytes of RAM (64\u00d732 square pixels).\n\nA one-bit output from the microprocessor, the Q line, could be driven by software to produce sounds through an attached speaker, to save programs in RAM to a cassette recorder, and for serial I/O output.  Branch instructions in the 1802 instruction set could read the state of the EF1 through EF4 single bit value input lines, which were used to read the 'I' keypad (input) momentary pushbutton (typically EF4), programs from the cassette recorder through interface circuitry, serial I/O input, and input from peripherals such as a light pen. There are also seven 8-bit I/O ports available for decoding and interfacing.\n\n== Microcomputers ==\nThe original Elf computers were essentially home-built versions of the [[RCA]] Microkit, Microtutor I and Microtutor II, which were RCA's demonstration boards for their CDP1801 2-chip predecessor and single-chip CDP1802 microprocessors.\n\nEnhanced kits such as the Netronics Elf II and Quest Super Elf added built-in features such as keypads for data entry, serial I/O, cassette interface, and the CDP1861 \"Pixie\" [[Video Display Controller|video]] chip.  RCA later introduced their own similarly expanded version as the [[COSMAC VIP]].\n\nIn August 2006, [[Nuts and Volts]] magazine, along with [http://www.sparetimegizmos.com/ Spare Time Gizmos], released a project to build the \"Cosmac Elf 2000,\" based on the original Elf, with some newer and easier to find components and enhanced features, modules, and functionality, including the STG1861 Pixie Graphics Replacement board that is functionally equivalent to the now-rare RCA CDP1861 integrated circuit.\n\nThe [http://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/memship.html Membership Card] is a modern, simple COSMAC Elf-like [[Home computer remake|remake]] for [[retrocomputing]] hobbyists that is designed to fit in an Altoids tin.\n\nVarious other hobbyist systems can be found on the Internet, including hardware emulators using FPGA and modern microcontrollers.\n\n== Software ==\nA series of newsletters and small booklets offered by Netronics and Quest contained 1802 machine language and [[CHIP-8]] programs, along with schematics for expanding the Elf and adding peripherals, including a light pen. Other, similar information and hobbyist software projects can be found on the Internet. The only published book about the 1802 is Tom Swan's \"Programmer\u2019s Guide to the 1802\" (1981), which has been made available as a PDF after being out of print for many years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tomswan.com/|title=Programmer\u2019s Guide to the 1802|last=Swan|first=Tom|date=1981|website=Tom Swan Homepage|publisher=Tom Swan|access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nTiny BASIC, a version of [[BASIC]] offered by Tom Pittman, could be used to write small BASIC programs on the Elf that could display through the Pixie low-resolution monochrome graphics display or TV-Typewriter hardware.

RCA later introduced their own similarly expanded version as the [[COSMAC VIP]].\n\nIn August 2006, [[Nuts and Volts]] magazine, along with [http://www.sparetimegizmos.com/ Spare Time Gizmos], released a project to build the \"Cosmac Elf 2000,\" based on the original Elf, with some newer and easier to find components and enhanced features, modules, and functionality, including the STG1861 Pixie Graphics Replacement board that is functionally equivalent to the now-rare RCA CDP1861 integrated circuit.\n\nThe [http://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/memship.html Membership Card] is a modern, simple COSMAC Elf-like [[Home computer remake|remake]] for [[retrocomputing]] hobbyists that is designed to fit in an Altoids tin.\n\nVarious other hobbyist systems can be found on the Internet, including hardware emulators using FPGA and modern microcontrollers.\n\n== Software ==\nA series of newsletters and small booklets offered by Netronics and Quest contained 1802 machine language and [[CHIP-8]] programs, along with schematics for expanding the Elf and adding peripherals, including a light pen. Other, similar information and hobbyist software projects can be found on the Internet. The only published book about the 1802 is Tom Swan's \"Programmer\u2019s Guide to the 1802\" (1981), which has been made available as a PDF after being out of print for many years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tomswan.com/|title=Programmer\u2019s Guide to the 1802|last=Swan|first=Tom|date=1981|website=Tom Swan Homepage|publisher=Tom Swan|access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nTiny BASIC, a version of [[BASIC]] offered by Tom Pittman, could be used to write small BASIC programs on the Elf that could display through the Pixie low-resolution monochrome graphics display or TV-Typewriter hardware. Pittman also wrote a small booklet about the 1802 titled \"A Short Course In Programming\", which he has allowed to be published and made available online free of charge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosmacelf.com/publications/books/short-course-in-programming.html|title=A Short Course In Programming|last=Pittman|first=Tom|date=1980|website=COSMAC Elf|publisher=Dave Ruske|access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/ShortCor.htm|title=A Short Course In Programming|last=Pittman|first=Tom|date=1980|website=Itty Bitty Computers|publisher=Tom Pittman|access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nMike Riley has written an editor, assembler, [[BASIC]] and [[FORTH]] interpreters, a [[BIOS]], and the Elf/OS [[disk operating system]] that will run on expanded Elf systems, including the COSMAC Elf 2000.\n\nOther languages available are noted at the [[RCA 1802]] Wikipedia entry, including interpreters, compilers and assemblers.\n\nGame cartridges for the RCA Studio II contain Chip-8 games, which can run on other 1802 systems. File dumps of these games can be found on the Internet.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\nConstruction Articles\n* {{cite journal| last =Weisbecker | first =Joseph |date=August 1976 | title = Build the COSMAC Elf (Part 1) | journal = Popular Electronics | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 33\u201338 | publisher = Ziff Davis}}\n* {{cite journal| last =Weisbecker | first =Joseph |date=September 1976 | title = Build the COSMAC Elf (Part 2) | journal = Popular Electronics | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 37\u201340 | publisher = Ziff Davis}}\n* {{cite journal | last =Weisbecker | first =Joseph |date=March 1977 | title = Build the COSMAC Elf (Part 3) | journal = Popular Electronics | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 63\u201367 | publisher = Ziff Davis\n}}\n* {{cite journal| last =Weisbecker | first =Joseph |date=July 1977 | title = Build the COSMAC Elf (Part 4 Pixie Graphics Display) | journal = Popular Electronics | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 41\u201346 | publisher = Ziff Davis}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.sparetimegizmos.com/Hardware/Elf2K.htm Spare Time Gizmo's article on the Cosmac Elf 2000]\n* [http://www.emma02.hobby-site.com Emma 02] including Cosmac Elf Emulator\n* [http://www.donnelly-house.net/programming/cdp1802/simelf/ SimElf] COSMAC Elf-ish CDP1802 Simulator, an extended web app in JavaScript, SimElf++ / COSMAC Elf<sup>2</sup>\n\n[[Category:Early microcomputers]]\n", "name_user": "Pqtnica", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COSMAC_ELF"}
