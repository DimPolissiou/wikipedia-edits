The team has competed in NASCAR, the [[ARCA Racing Series]], the WMA Motocross Series, AMA Arenacross, Motocross and Supercross Series, Summer [[X Games]] and [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] since 2008, and is owned by former driver [[Rick Ware]]. Since RWR's inception, the organization has won championships in the SCCA (1988), the WMA Motocross Series (2006, 2007) the AMA Arenacross Series (2007, 2008, 2009), in partnership with Tuf Racing, the [[Whelen Modified Tour]] at [[Bowman Gray Stadium]] (2009) in partnership with Tim Brown Motorsports, as well as \"Top Performing Independent Team\" in the Motocross and Supercross Series'.\n\n==Early years==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe organizational roots of RWR date back to Ware & Sons Racing with Rick and his father John Ware competing in the SCCA Series. They raced under the banner \"Ware & Sons\" as early as the 60's when Rick went go-kart racing. Once of legal driving age, Rick joined his father John Ware in the SCCA and IMSA Series.\n\nIn 1983, Ware & Sons won Rookie of the Year in the California Sports Car Club with Rick behind the wheel. Ware & Sons with Rick as the driver, went on to win several titles in that series, as well as the SCCA and IMSA Championship.\n\nAfter a stint as a driver in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, Ware renamed the organization Ware Racing Enterprises in the 1990s and eventually Rick Ware Racing in 2004.\n\n==NASCAR==\n===NASCAR Cup Series===\n[[File:Josh Bilicki 2017 Toyota Save Mart 350 qualifying.jpg|thumb|left|[[Josh Bilicki]] driving Ware's No. 51 during qualifying for the [[2017 Toyota/Save Mart 350]].]]\nIn 1998 Rick Ware attempted to qualify a Ware Racing Enterprises Ford in the Winston Cup event at Sears Point Raceway but failed to make the race.\n\nRick Ware Racing (RWR) had made a handful of attempts in the NASCAR Cup Series beginning in 2004 with Stanton Barrett in the No. 52. In 2005, the organization made attempts with [[Larry Gunselman]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Ram\u00edrez (racing driver)|Jos\u00e9 Luis Ram\u00edrez]] and [[Derrike Cope]]. In 2006 Larry Gunselman, [[Steve Portenga]], [[Donnie Neuenberger]] and [[Stanton Barrett]] in the No. 52 and No. 30 respectively.\n\nIn 2007, Barrett attempted to make the Daytona 500 only to miss the race by a single position.\n\nIn 2011, Rick Ware Racing allied with the No. 37 [[Front Row Motorsports]]/[[Max Q Motorsports]] Sprint Cup Team. American Le Mans Series driver [[Tomy Drissi]] qualified for the Infineon Cup race, but NASCAR would not approve him for competition; [[Chris Cook (racing driver)|Chris Cook]] drove the 37 to a 27th-place finish.\n\nFor 2012, Rick Ware Racing again allied with Max Q Motorsports to run Timmy Hill for the majority of the season in the No. 37 to vie for Rookie of the Year honors. After [[Mike Wallace (racing driver)|Mike Wallace]] failed to make Daytona, Hill DNQ'd the next race, but qualified in Vegas; he finished 42nd after a crash. When the team missed five races in six attempts, they were outside the top 35 and Ware moved Hill back to Nationwide, ending the partnership.\n\nIn 2017, Rick Ware Racing came back to the Cup Series with the No. 51 Chevrolet for most of the schedule. [[Timmy Hill]] drove at the [[2017 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], while he split the ride with [[Cody Ware]] throughout the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2017/1/20/rick-ware-racing-to-field-monster-energy-nascar-cup-series-team.html|title=Rick Ware Racing to Field Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Team|work=[[NASCAR]]|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}</ref> [[Josh Bilicki]] joined the team for the road course races,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joshbilickiracing.com/news/josh-bilicki-joins-rick-ware-racing-cup-program-for-sonoma-watkins-glen|title=Josh Bilicki and Tommy Regan joins Rick Ware Racing Cup program for Sonoma, Watkins Glen|work=Josh Bilicki|date=April 14, 2017|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}</ref> while [[Kyle Weatherman]], [[B.

The team did not disclose how they had acquired the charter. However, the deal with Black soon fell apart, leaving the 51 open for another driver.

[[Stanton Barrett]], [[Stan Boyd]], [[Kim Crosby]], [[Bobby Dotter]], [[David Eshleman]], [[Kenny Hendrick]], [[Travis Powell]], [[Morgan Shepherd]], [[Shane Sieg]], [[Dana White (racing driver)|Dana White]] and [[J. J. Yeley]] all took turns at the wheel for RWR in their inaugural debut in the series under the No. 51 and No. 57 banner.\n\nThe organization took a five-year hiatus from the series to focus on the Motocross, Supercross, Arenacross, and Women's Motocross series' only to make a return in 2009.\n\nWith a new attitude, the organization returned under the Chevrolet banner and numbers 31 and 41.  RWR purchased equipment from [[Stanton Barrett Motorsports]] to start the season and quickly moved to [[Earnhardt Childress Racing]] engines after power issues hindered the team.\n\nDrivers [[Stanton Barrett]], [[Derrike Cope]], [[Tim Andrews]], [[Travis Kittleson]], [[Kerry Earnhardt]], [[Tom Hubert]], [[Kevin Hamlin]], [[Daryl Harr]] and [[Justin Hobgood]] all split the time between the two cars. RWR later signed developmental driver [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]], the grandson of [[Dale Earnhardt]].  Jeffrey Earnhardt's series debut at Dover was cut short with a late crash in practice and a subsequent DNQ.\n\n2009 was a significant year for RW. At [[Lowes Motor Speedway]], Stanton Barrett qualified the No. 31 in the 11th position. [[Kerry Earnhardt]] finished 12th at [[Talladega Speedway]] and also qualified 8th at [[Daytona International Speedway]], both organizational benchmarks. [[Tim Andrews]] went into the history books as he was led by crew chief and father [[Paul Andrews (NASCAR)|Paul Andrews]], marking the first time in NASCAR history that a father was a crew chief for a son in the Nationwide Series.\n\nIn 2010, RWR ran in select races as it focused on the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. At [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], RWR went into the record books again, this time with driver [[Chrissy Wallace]].  Wallace became the first female driver to make her series debut at Daytona in the No. 41 Chevrolet. [[Danica Patrick]] also accomplished the feat in the same event.  Stanton Barrett competed in the No. 31 Fuel Doctor Chevy at Daytona.\n\nBarrett rallied to a 14th-place finish at [[Darlington Raceway]] while leading laps for the first time in RWR history. Barrett competed in 5 races for RWR in 2010 in both the 31 and 41 Chevrolet. [[J.C. Stout]] also made a race for Ware Racing at ORP.\n[[File:Nationwide 15 Timmy Hill 2011 Road America Bucyrus 200.jpg|thumb|right|RWR's No. 15 driven to the 2011 Rookie of the Year by [[Timmy Hill]]]]\nFor 2011, RWR returned to the Nationwide Series, running the No. 15 car with Fords purchased from [[Roush Fenway Racing]]. Ware ran ARCA development driver [[Timmy Hill]] for Rookie of the Year honors. Hill won Rookie of the Year but was forced to miss the season opener at Daytona because Hill didn't turn 18 (NASCAR's minimum age to drive in the three national series) until February 25. [[Germain Racing]] ran the No. 15 Toyota in Hill's place with [[Todd Bodine]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] before selling the points to RWR. RWR also ran the No. 41 Ford with drivers [[Patrick Sheltra]], [[Carl Long]], [[Jennifer Jo Cobb]] and [[Doug Harrington]]. RWR also formed a partnership with [[Fleur-de-lis Motorsports]], fielding the No. 68 for [[Tim Andrews]], Carl Long and [[Matt Carter (racing driver)|Matt Carter]]. [[Clay Greenfield]] made his NASCAR Nationwide Series debut for the team in their No. 71 car in [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] but was pinched up into the wall just under 100 laps into the race and finished 35th after starting in the 43rd position. Hill would eventually win Rookie of the Year over primary rivals [[Blake Koch]] and [[Ryan Truex]]\n\nIn 2012, Koch joined RWR full-time as Hill moved up to RWR's Sprint Cup program. Hill ran the season-opening race at Daytona before the No. 15 was moved to a limited schedule with [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]] driving at Bristol with Sam's Club. Koch's original sponsor dropped their agreement due to ESPN not showing the sponsor's ad due to Koch being an outspoken Christian. Hill returned to Nationwide after a failed Rookie of the Year run in Cup, and drove the 41 while Koch drove the 15 as an occasional start and park. Riggs started and parked for Ware in the 75.\n\nIn 2013, the team returned with the No. 15 Ford Mustang driven by [[Juan Carlos Blum]] and [[Harrison Rhodes]]. The team also fielded cars for [[Carl Long]]. For 2014, RWR drove primarily with [[Carlos Contreras (racing driver)|Carlos Contreras]], Hill, and [[Josh Reaume]].\n\nIn 2015, the team reunited with Contreras and Hill, but also ran with [[B.J. McLeod]] and [[Jimmy Weller III]]. For 2016, the team celebrated its 25th anniversary, The team partnered with [[B.J. McLeod Motorsports]] to share the No. 15, while RWR runs the 25. The team shut down the Xfinity program after the 2016 season to focus on the Truck Series.<ref name=\"Truck Series 2017\">{{cite web|last=Albino|first=Dustin|url=https://frontstretch.com/2016/12/29/rick-ware-racing-truck-series-2017/|title=Rick Ware Racing Move to Truck Series, Shut Down XFINITY Program|publisher=Frontstretch|date=December 29, 2016|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, despite this announcement, the team returned at [[Road America]] in a partnership with [[Mike Harmon Racing]]. [[John Graham (racing driver)|John Graham]] drove the No. 74 (usually Harmon's number) for RWR because the car was locked in the race and Harmon's driver: [[Nicolas Hammann]] drove the No. 17 (usually RWR's number) and would have to qualify on time but since other cars withdrew both cars make the race. [[Cody Ware]] also drove for Harmon in a collaborative effort between RWR and MHR and he continues to drive the No. 74 car part-time for 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the team announced a full-time car numbered 17. [[Chris Cockrum]] drove at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. [[Bayley Currey]] ran most of the races. [[Kyle Weatherman]] ran at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]] and other races. Starting sometime around the Charlotte race in May, RWR partnered with Mike Harmon Racing (again) to field the No. 17 car together for the remainder of the season. The font that Harmon uses on his No. 74 car is now used on the No. 17 as well. [[Camden Murphy]] drove at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] and [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]]. The team withdrew at [[Iowa Speedway|Iowa]] and was not entered at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]. The team sold their owner points before Iowa to the new No. 28 [[H2 Motorsports]] car driven by [[Shane Lee (racing driver)|Shane Lee]], which indicated that the team may only run part-time for the rest of the year. [[Josh Bilicki]] drove at [[Chicagoland Speedway|Chicagoland]] after Currey qualified the car while Bilicki failed to qualify his own No. 38 car for [[RSS Racing]]. Both Murphy and Currey would return for [[Kentucky Speedway|Kentucky]] and [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]], respectfully. Part-time [[ARCA Menards Series]] driver Mark Meunier attempted to make his Xfinity debut at Iowa in July but failed to qualify. The No. 17 would also skip both road course races at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] and [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course|Mid-Ohio]].\n\n===Camping World Truck Series===\nRick Ware Racing made its NASCAR debut in the [[Craftsman Truck Series]].  In 1999, RWR made two starts, one with [[Randy MacDonald]] and the other with driver-owner [[Rick Ware]] in trucks 51 and 81.\n\nIn 2000, the organization was set to run the entire season with two teams, the 51 and 81 when Rick Ware was injured in a head-on crash at [[California Speedway]] that resulted in a career-ending fractured vertebra to the neck.  Ware moved into the ownership role to continue the team. Drivers [[Tom Boston]], [[David Starr (racing driver)|David Starr]], [[Michael Dokken]] and [[Donnie Neuenberger]] finished out the 20 race schedule. Dokken produced an 8th-place finish at Loudon and led at Nazareth. [[Rick Ware]] finished a career-high of 13th at Texas.\n\nFor 2001, [[Brian Rose (racing driver)|Brian Rose]] ran 15 races before heading off to [[Bobby Hamilton Racing]]. [[Nathan Buttke]], [[Travis Clark]], Dokken, [[Coy Gibbs]], [[Donnie Neuenberger]], [[Trent Owens]], [[Jonathon Price]], [[Sammy Ragan]], [[Michael Ritch]], [[Jerry Robertson (racing driver)|Jerry Robertson]], [[Brian Sockwell]], [[Jason Thom]] and [[Rich Woodland Jr]] completed the roster that watched Rick Ware Racing expand to a three and an occasional four race team with numbers 51, 71, 81, 91.\n\nDokken had a season-high of 11th at Nazareth, Rose finished 12th at Fontana and many others finished in the Top 20 with laps being led by Dokken and Ritch for the season.\n\nIn 2002, Rick Ware Racing switched to Dodge and fielded the 5, 51 and 81 entries for several drivers. [[Lance Hooper]] ran the most races for the team with a total of twelve events. [[Randy Briggs]], [[Mike Cofer (kicker)|Mike Cofer]], [[Michael Dokken]], [[Jason Hedlesky]], [[Ryan Hemphill]], [[Scott Kirkpatrick]], [[Scott Kuhn]], [[Carl Long]], [[Blake Mallory]], [[Donny Morelock]], [[Donnie Neuenberger]], [[Jonathon Price]], [[Michael Ritch]], [[Brian Rose (racing driver)|Brian Rose]], [[Morgan Shepherd]], [[Jason Thom]], [[Andy Thurman]], [[Jason White (racing driver)|Jason White]] and [[Angie Wilson]] all competed for the team. Most drivers finished in the top 15 with Hooper leading a lap at Darlington.\n\nDuring the 2003 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series season, Rick Ware Racing decided to focus on one driver for a full season. [[Jerry Hill (racing driver)|Jerry Hill]] was slated for the task.  Hill competed in 22 of the 25 events and finished 18th in the drivers' standings in the No. 5 Dodge.  Ware also raced the number 51 and 81 with a number of drivers such as [[Rusty Alton]], [[Stan Boyd]], [[Randy Briggs]], [[Doug Keller]], [[Carl Long]], [[Blake Mallory]], [[G. J. Mennen Jr.]], [[Chase Montgomery]] and [[Brian Sockwell]].\n\nAfter taking a leave from the series, Ware returned to the newly named NASCAR Camping World Truck Series for just two races in 2009 while competing in the Nationwide Series full-time. [[Chrissy Wallace]] in the No. 08 for Ware competed against her father, [[Mike Wallace (racing driver)|Mike Wallace]], as it marked the first time a father and daughter raced in the same event in any of the top three NASCAR Series'.  Chrissy finished in front of her father in the 13th position, marking the 2nd highest finish by a female in NASCAR history.\n\n[[Tim Brown (racing driver)|Tim Brown]], coming off his record-breaking 8th Championship at [[Bowman-Gray Stadium]] in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series raced the truck at Martinsville as a celebration of their title earlier that month. RWR returned to the Truck Series with two full-time teams and an occasional third, using the 6, 47 and 16. [[Brett Butler (racing driver)|Brett Butler]] competed in fifteen races for Rookie of the Year. Neuenberger finished 9th at Daytona as Butler finished 11th. [[Bobby Hamilton Jr.]] qualified and finished tenth on two occasions each. [[Travis Kvapil]] along with Hamilton Jr. and Butler all led laps during the season. [[Amber Cope]], [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]], [[Ken Butler III]], [[J. C. Stout]], [[Brian Rose (racing driver)|Brian Rose]], [[Mike Guerity]], [[C. E. Falk]], [[Ryan Rust]], [[Carl Long]], Derek White, [[Lance Fenton]], [[Clay Greenfield]], [[Justin Hobgood]] and [[D. J. Kennington]] all drove the No. 6 for 2010 in mostly 1\u20132 race deals.\n\n[[Jeffrey Earnhardt]], the 4th generation driver of the Earnhardt family, made his series debut at Gateway. [[Amber Cope]] and [[Angela Cope]], the twin daughters of Daytona 500 winner [[Derrike Cope]], made their respective debuts at Martinsville Speedway, as the two became the first twins to compete against each other.\n\nFor 2011, [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]] was to run for the Rookie of the Year title in the No. 1 Fuel Doctor Chevy. However, after only 3 races, the team was hit with the double tragedy of losing two crew members and Fuel Doctor announcing it could no longer sponsor RWR. Earnhardt was released from RWR after Fuel Doctor's announcement, but the two mended fences and raced again at Martinsville. However, Earnhardt was caught up in a crash running 7th with just 25 laps remaining. Bobby Hamilton Jr. raced the truck at Nashville and Carl Long and Dover before the team took a temporary break to focus on the Nationwide Series where Earnhardt would drive select races in the No. 41 car.\n\nThe Truck team would return in 2013 with multiple drivers. The program was revived in 2017, fielding the No. 12 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] for [[Spencer Boyd]], [[Jordan Anderson (racing driver)|Jordan Anderson]], and [[Cody Ware]].<ref name=\"Truck Series 2017\" /> The No. 12 team failed to qualify the season opener at Daytona, with Boyd blowing up an engine during qualifying. The truck operation was dissolved after the fifth race of the season.\n\n===Whelen Modified Series===\nRick Ware Racing joined the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series in conjunction with Tim Brown Motorsports.  Brown and Ware's relationship dates back to the 90's when Ware made his own NASCAR Sprint Cup Series debut with the help of a young mechanic, [[Tim Brown (racing driver)|Tim Brown]].  Ware promised the youngster that he would help his career once he got going but Brown needed little help.\n\nIn 2009, Brown and Ware struck a deal to partner together for his attempt at a historic 8th Championship at the famous [[Bowman-Gray Stadium]], the oldest NASCAR sanctioned track, located in nearby Winston-Salem, NC.  Brown won five races en route to the title and the first for Ware in the series in the No. 83 Circle K/Hayes Jewelers entry.  The entire season was caught on film for the series, [[MadHouse (TV series)|Madhouse]] featured on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].\n\nAs true to their word, Ware promised Brown a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut if he won the title.  Tim Brown made his truck series debut at Martinsville Speedway where he finished 27th in the No. 08.\n\n==Sports car racing==\n===Rolex Sports Car Series===\n[[File:RWR 2012 Rolex 24.jpg|thumb|right|RWR's 2012 24 Hours of Daytona car]]\nRick Ware Racing returned to its roots of road racing as it did with Ware & Sons in the 1980s for the running of the Grand-Am Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona in 2011.\n\nRWR competed in the GT3 Cup Division at Daytona International Speedway for the historic Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona and finished 11th in class and 25th overall with drivers, [[Brett Sandberg]], [[Scott Monroe]], [[Maurice Hull]], [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]] and [[Doug Harrington]].\n\nThe event marked the 10th Anniversary of [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]]'s grandfather, [[Dale Earnhardt]] and uncle [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]]'s run in the same event.\n\nFuel Doctor was the primary of the No. 47 Porsche.\n\nRWR's entry marked the first time that a NASCAR team owner has moved from NASCAR to the Grand-Am Series.  Penske Racing and Ganassi Racing have competed in the Grand-Am Series then later moved to NASCAR.\n\n===Asian Le Mans===\nIn 2019, RWR began competing in the [[Asian Le Mans Series]], fielding two [[Ligier JS P2]]s in the LMPS Am class for Cody Ware and [[Mark Kvamme]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lemans.org/en/news/asian-le-mans-series-rick-ware-racing-gets-to-know-the-ligier-jsp2-at-le-mans-aerodrome/52744|title=Asian Le Mans Series \u2013 Rick Ware Racing Gets to Know the Ligier JSP2 at Le Mans Aerodrome|work=LeMans.org|date=September 13, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref> In their first race at [[Shanghai International Circuit]], the team missed qualifying and much of practice as their cars were plagued by shipping delays; to ensure their cars would be up to par, the team formed a partnership with [[ARC Bratislava]].<ref name=\"4H Shanghai\" /> Although the No. 25 was unable to compete in the race, Ware and Kvappe drove the No. 52 to a 14th-overall finish and second place in their class.<ref name=\"4H Shanghai\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2019/11/23/shanghai-saturday-paddock-notes.html|title=4H Shanghai: Saturday Paddock Notes|work=DailySportsCar.com|date=November 23, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Christie|first=Toby|url=https://tobychristie.com/2019/11/24/rick-ware-racing-finishes-second-in-class-in-asian-le-mans-series-race/|title=Rick Ware Racing Finishes Second in Class in Asian Le Mans Series Race|publisher=TobyChristie.com|date=November 24, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref> At [[The Bend Motorsport Park]], the team scored the LMP2 Am Trophy class win as they finished fifth overall with Ware and [[Gustas Grinbergas]]; at 16 years of age, Grinbergas became the youngest driver to win an [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO)-sanctioned race.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perrins|first=Slade|url=https://sportscar365.com/lemans/asian-lms/g-drive-takes-dramatic-4h-the-bend-win/|title=G-Drive Takes Dramatic 4H The Bend Win|publisher=Sportscar365|date=January 12, 2020|accessdate=January 12, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2020/01/13/grinbergas-becomes-youngest-ever-aco-rules-race-winner.html|title=Grinbergas Becomes Youngest Ever ACO Rules Race Winner|work=DailySportsCar.com|date=January 13, 2020|accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===IMSA Weathertech SportsCar Championship===\nIn August of 2019, RWR announced that they will be entering the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] for the 2020 season with an updated [[Riley Mk. 30]] in the PRO/AM [[Le Mans Prototype#LMP2|LMP2]] class.\n\n==Motorcycle racing==\n===AMA Arenacross Series===\nRick Ware Racing has always had its heart in two-wheel racing. [[Rick Ware]] had raced a few seasons in the AMA Supercross Series in the late 80's at places like the Superdome.  In 2007, Rick Ware partnered with Tuf Honda owner, [[Dave Antolak]] and put together one of the most impressive organizations in AMA Arenacross history.\n\nRWR with Tuf Honda with sponsorship from Bad Boy Power Drinks and Mahindra Tractors won the championship in 2007 with rider [[Danny Smith (racing driver)|Danny Smith]].  In 2008, [[Chad Johnson (racing driver)|Chad Johnson]] won the organization's second title in a row and in 2009, rider [[Jeff Gibson]] made it a record three championships consecutively.\n\nTuf Honda with Dave Antolak has a total of 5 Championships, the most in the series history with three of those titles coming in partnership with Rick Ware Racing\n\n===AMA Supercross Series===\nRick Ware Racing dates back in the Supercross to 1986 when the owner first raced in the series.  In 2007, Ware focused on putting together a team in his return that would compete with factory teams, yet remain a small independent. [[Brock Sellards]], [[Tyler Bright]], [[Jeff Dement]] and [[Tyson Hadsell]] completed the team under the Yamaha flagship alongside Bad Boy Power Drinks and Pro30.\n\nTyler Bright captured a holeshot award at Detroit (1) in the Superlites and Jeff Dement captured a holeshot award at Phoenix.\n\nIn 2008, [[Jake Marsack]] joined the organization and the success followed. Marsack finished 4th at San Francisco, just one spot from the podium and on a muddy evening in Daytona, Jake Marsack raced his way through the mud to a 3rd-place finish on the podium, marking the first time in modern-day history that an independent team finished that high.\n\n===AMA Motocross Series===\nRWR completed the three major series in AMA with the addition of the Motocross Series in 2007.  Riders [[Tyler Bright]], [[Tyson Hadsell]] and [[Jake Marsack]] raced for Ware on Yamaha's with Bad Boy Power Drinks and Pro30 on board.\n\nThe team came back in 2008 and made several main events but trouble kept them from competing with the bigger budget teams in the series.\n\nIn 2009, Ware went to a single rider team with [[Tyler Bright]] on a Honda with Mahindra Tractors on board in sponsorship.\n<ref name=\"wareracing.com\">wareracing.com</ref>\n\n===WMA Motocross Series===\nFew teams have scored as much success in the WMA Motocross Series, a motocross series for female riders, as Rick Ware Racing.  With Bad Boy Power Drinks and Pro30 in sponsorship, [[Jessica Patterson]], made history on her Honda bike for the organization.\n\nIn 2006, Patterson captured her 3rd title in the series and first for RWR.  Patterson backed that title up in 2007 with Ware, becoming the most successful female rider in AMA Motocross history.  During the two years with RWR, Patterson captured 10 holeshot awards and 13 victories, never failing to make a podium during the two-year stint.\n\nWare went in a different direction after the 2007 season to focus more on the NASCAR, Motocross and X-Games Series, after making his mark in the history books in the WMA Series\n<ref name=\"wareracing.com\"/>\n\n===Summer X Games===\nRick Ware Racing became interested in the crowd and excitement surrounding the X Games since its inception.  In 2009, RWR finally took the step into the events with Women's Motocross rider, [[Sherri Cruse]] for X-Games 15.\n\nCruse had captured the bronze medal in 2008 was highly favored in the event.  With Circle K and Fastwax on board, Cruse stumbled early in the event and charged from last place to 4th in the shorted race due to a television schedule.\n\nWare had faith in Cruse and went back X-Games 15 in 2010 for the same event.  Cruse had suffered an injury just weeks before the event and still completed the event after falling during the race.  Cruse finished 8th.\n\nRWR returned to the X Games in 2011 with a new rider in the Women's Moto X, Vicki Golden.  Golden had competed with RWR and Tuf Honda during the 2011 AMA Arenacross Series and gave her the nod for X Games 17.  Vicki Golden grabbed the holeshot for the event and went on to win gold for the organizations first gold medal in the X Games.<ref name=\"wareracing.com\"/>\n\n==Other series==\n===Allison Legacy Series===\nIn 2012, Rick Ware Racing joined the [[Allison Legacy Series]] with [[Tyler Hill (racing driver)|Tyler Hill]], the brother of [[Timmy Hill]]. Hill won the U.S. National Championship in 2009 and set a record of 10 wins in a season.  His brother [[Tyler Hill (racing driver)|Tyler Hill]] won the championship in 2011 after winning 13 of 18 races.<ref>{{cite web|last=Allie Fetterolf|first=Allie|title=Senior Tyler Hill Declared Allison Legacy Series Champion|url=http://nphseagleeye.com/student-life/2012/01/15/senior-tyler-hill-declared-allison-legacy-series-champion/|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|1=http://www.wareracing.com}}\n* {{Racing-Reference owner|Rick_Ware}}\n\n{{Rick Ware Racing}}\n{{NASCAR Cup Series teams}}\n{{Chevrolet in NASCAR}}\n{{Ford in NASCAR}}\n\n[[Category:American auto racing teams]]\n[[Category:Companies based in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:NASCAR teams]]\n[[Category:ARCA Menards Series teams]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American racing team}}\n{{Infobox NASCAR team\n| Team_name      = Rick Ware Racing\n| Logo           = File:RickWareRacingLogo.png\n| Owner_names    = [[Rick Ware]]\n| Base           = [[Thomasville, North Carolina]]\n| Series         = [[NASCAR Cup Series]]<br>[[Asian Le Mans Series]]<br>[[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]\n| Numbers        = 2, 17, 25, 36, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54\n| Drivers        = '''Cup Series''':<br/>36.

The team has competed in NASCAR, the [[ARCA Racing Series]], the WMA Motocross Series, AMA Arenacross, Motocross and Supercross Series, Summer [[X Games]] and [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] since 2008, and is owned by former driver [[Rick Ware]]. Since RWR's inception, the organization has won championships in the SCCA (1988), the WMA Motocross Series (2006, 2007) the AMA Arenacross Series (2007, 2008, 2009), in partnership with Tuf Racing, the [[Whelen Modified Tour]] at [[Bowman Gray Stadium]] (2009) in partnership with Tim Brown Motorsports, as well as \"Top Performing Independent Team\" in the Motocross and Supercross Series'.\n\n==Early years==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe organizational roots of RWR date back to Ware & Sons Racing with Rick and his father John Ware competing in the SCCA Series. They raced under the banner \"Ware & Sons\" as early as the 60's when Rick went go-kart racing. Once of legal driving age, Rick joined his father John Ware in the SCCA and IMSA Series.\n\nIn 1983, Ware & Sons won Rookie of the Year in the California Sports Car Club with Rick behind the wheel. Ware & Sons with Rick as the driver, went on to win several titles in that series, as well as the SCCA and IMSA Championship.\n\nAfter a stint as a driver in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, Ware renamed the organization Ware Racing Enterprises in the 1990s and eventually Rick Ware Racing in 2004.\n\n==NASCAR==\n===NASCAR Cup Series===\n[[File:Josh Bilicki 2017 Toyota Save Mart 350 qualifying.jpg|thumb|left|[[Josh Bilicki]] driving Ware's No. 51 during qualifying for the [[2017 Toyota/Save Mart 350]].]]\nIn 1998 Rick Ware attempted to qualify a Ware Racing Enterprises Ford in the Winston Cup event at Sears Point Raceway but failed to make the race.\n\nRick Ware Racing (RWR) had made a handful of attempts in the NASCAR Cup Series beginning in 2004 with Stanton Barrett in the No. 52. In 2005, the organization made attempts with [[Larry Gunselman]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Ram\u00edrez (racing driver)|Jos\u00e9 Luis Ram\u00edrez]] and [[Derrike Cope]]. In 2006 Larry Gunselman, [[Steve Portenga]], [[Donnie Neuenberger]] and [[Stanton Barrett]] in the No. 52 and No. 30 respectively.\n\nIn 2007, Barrett attempted to make the Daytona 500 only to miss the race by a single position.\n\nIn 2011, Rick Ware Racing allied with the No. 37 [[Front Row Motorsports]]/[[Max Q Motorsports]] Sprint Cup Team. American Le Mans Series driver [[Tomy Drissi]] qualified for the Infineon Cup race, but NASCAR would not approve him for competition; [[Chris Cook (racing driver)|Chris Cook]] drove the 37 to a 27th-place finish.\n\nFor 2012, Rick Ware Racing again allied with Max Q Motorsports to run Timmy Hill for the majority of the season in the No. 37 to vie for Rookie of the Year honors. After [[Mike Wallace (racing driver)|Mike Wallace]] failed to make Daytona, Hill DNQ'd the next race, but qualified in Vegas; he finished 42nd after a crash. When the team missed five races in six attempts, they were outside the top 35 and Ware moved Hill back to Nationwide, ending the partnership.\n\nIn 2017, Rick Ware Racing came back to the Cup Series with the No. 51 Chevrolet for most of the schedule. [[Timmy Hill]] drove at the [[2017 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], while he split the ride with [[Cody Ware]] throughout the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2017/1/20/rick-ware-racing-to-field-monster-energy-nascar-cup-series-team.html|title=Rick Ware Racing to Field Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Team|work=[[NASCAR]]|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}</ref> [[Josh Bilicki]] joined the team for the road course races,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joshbilickiracing.com/news/josh-bilicki-joins-rick-ware-racing-cup-program-for-sonoma-watkins-glen|title=Josh Bilicki and Tommy Regan joins Rick Ware Racing Cup program for Sonoma, Watkins Glen|work=Josh Bilicki|date=April 14, 2017|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}</ref> while [[Kyle Weatherman]], [[B.

[[Stanton Barrett]], [[Stan Boyd]], [[Kim Crosby]], [[Bobby Dotter]], [[David Eshleman]], [[Kenny Hendrick]], [[Travis Powell]], [[Morgan Shepherd]], [[Shane Sieg]], [[Dana White (racing driver)|Dana White]] and [[J. J. Yeley]] all took turns at the wheel for RWR in their inaugural debut in the series under the No. 51 and No. 57 banner.\n\nThe organization took a five-year hiatus from the series to focus on the Motocross, Supercross, Arenacross, and Women's Motocross series' only to make a return in 2009.\n\nWith a new attitude, the organization returned under the Chevrolet banner and numbers 31 and 41.  RWR purchased equipment from [[Stanton Barrett Motorsports]] to start the season and quickly moved to [[Earnhardt Childress Racing]] engines after power issues hindered the team.\n\nDrivers [[Stanton Barrett]], [[Derrike Cope]], [[Tim Andrews]], [[Travis Kittleson]], [[Kerry Earnhardt]], [[Tom Hubert]], [[Kevin Hamlin]], [[Daryl Harr]] and [[Justin Hobgood]] all split the time between the two cars. RWR later signed developmental driver [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]], the grandson of [[Dale Earnhardt]].  Jeffrey Earnhardt's series debut at Dover was cut short with a late crash in practice and a subsequent DNQ.\n\n2009 was a significant year for RW. At [[Lowes Motor Speedway]], Stanton Barrett qualified the No. 31 in the 11th position. [[Kerry Earnhardt]] finished 12th at [[Talladega Speedway]] and also qualified 8th at [[Daytona International Speedway]], both organizational benchmarks. [[Tim Andrews]] went into the history books as he was led by crew chief and father [[Paul Andrews (NASCAR)|Paul Andrews]], marking the first time in NASCAR history that a father was a crew chief for a son in the Nationwide Series.\n\nIn 2010, RWR ran in select races as it focused on the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. At [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], RWR went into the record books again, this time with driver [[Chrissy Wallace]].  Wallace became the first female driver to make her series debut at Daytona in the No. 41 Chevrolet. [[Danica Patrick]] also accomplished the feat in the same event.  Stanton Barrett competed in the No. 31 Fuel Doctor Chevy at Daytona.\n\nBarrett rallied to a 14th-place finish at [[Darlington Raceway]] while leading laps for the first time in RWR history. Barrett competed in 5 races for RWR in 2010 in both the 31 and 41 Chevrolet. [[J.C. Stout]] also made a race for Ware Racing at ORP.\n[[File:Nationwide 15 Timmy Hill 2011 Road America Bucyrus 200.jpg|thumb|right|RWR's No. 15 driven to the 2011 Rookie of the Year by [[Timmy Hill]]]]\nFor 2011, RWR returned to the Nationwide Series, running the No. 15 car with Fords purchased from [[Roush Fenway Racing]]. Ware ran ARCA development driver [[Timmy Hill]] for Rookie of the Year honors. Hill won Rookie of the Year but was forced to miss the season opener at Daytona because Hill didn't turn 18 (NASCAR's minimum age to drive in the three national series) until February 25. [[Germain Racing]] ran the No. 15 Toyota in Hill's place with [[Todd Bodine]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] before selling the points to RWR. RWR also ran the No. 41 Ford with drivers [[Patrick Sheltra]], [[Carl Long]], [[Jennifer Jo Cobb]] and [[Doug Harrington]]. RWR also formed a partnership with [[Fleur-de-lis Motorsports]], fielding the No. 68 for [[Tim Andrews]], Carl Long and [[Matt Carter (racing driver)|Matt Carter]]. [[Clay Greenfield]] made his NASCAR Nationwide Series debut for the team in their No. 71 car in [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] but was pinched up into the wall just under 100 laps into the race and finished 35th after starting in the 43rd position. Hill would eventually win Rookie of the Year over primary rivals [[Blake Koch]] and [[Ryan Truex]]\n\nIn 2012, Koch joined RWR full-time as Hill moved up to RWR's Sprint Cup program. Hill ran the season-opening race at Daytona before the No. 15 was moved to a limited schedule with [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]] driving at Bristol with Sam's Club. Koch's original sponsor dropped their agreement due to ESPN not showing the sponsor's ad due to Koch being an outspoken Christian. Hill returned to Nationwide after a failed Rookie of the Year run in Cup, and drove the 41 while Koch drove the 15 as an occasional start and park. Riggs started and parked for Ware in the 75.\n\nIn 2013, the team returned with the No. 15 Ford Mustang driven by [[Juan Carlos Blum]] and [[Harrison Rhodes]]. The team also fielded cars for [[Carl Long]]. For 2014, RWR drove primarily with [[Carlos Contreras (racing driver)|Carlos Contreras]], Hill, and [[Josh Reaume]].\n\nIn 2015, the team reunited with Contreras and Hill, but also ran with [[B.J. McLeod]] and [[Jimmy Weller III]]. For 2016, the team celebrated its 25th anniversary, The team partnered with [[B.J. McLeod Motorsports]] to share the No. 15, while RWR runs the 25. The team shut down the Xfinity program after the 2016 season to focus on the Truck Series.<ref name=\"Truck Series 2017\">{{cite web|last=Albino|first=Dustin|url=https://frontstretch.com/2016/12/29/rick-ware-racing-truck-series-2017/|title=Rick Ware Racing Move to Truck Series, Shut Down XFINITY Program|publisher=Frontstretch|date=December 29, 2016|accessdate=December 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, despite this announcement, the team returned at [[Road America]] in a partnership with [[Mike Harmon Racing]]. [[John Graham (racing driver)|John Graham]] drove the No. 74 (usually Harmon's number) for RWR because the car was locked in the race and Harmon's driver: [[Nicolas Hammann]] drove the No. 17 (usually RWR's number) and would have to qualify on time but since other cars withdrew both cars make the race. [[Cody Ware]] also drove for Harmon in a collaborative effort between RWR and MHR and he continues to drive the No. 74 car part-time for 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the team announced a full-time car numbered 17. [[Chris Cockrum]] drove at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. [[Bayley Currey]] ran most of the races. [[Kyle Weatherman]] ran at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]] and other races. Starting sometime around the Charlotte race in May, RWR partnered with Mike Harmon Racing (again) to field the No. 17 car together for the remainder of the season. The font that Harmon uses on his No. 74 car is now used on the No. 17 as well. [[Camden Murphy]] drove at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] and [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]]. The team withdrew at [[Iowa Speedway|Iowa]] and was not entered at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]]. The team sold their owner points before Iowa to the new No. 28 [[H2 Motorsports]] car driven by [[Shane Lee (racing driver)|Shane Lee]], which indicated that the team may only run part-time for the rest of the year. [[Josh Bilicki]] drove at [[Chicagoland Speedway|Chicagoland]] after Currey qualified the car while Bilicki failed to qualify his own No. 38 car for [[RSS Racing]]. Both Murphy and Currey would return for [[Kentucky Speedway|Kentucky]] and [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]], respectfully. Part-time [[ARCA Menards Series]] driver [[Mark Meunier]] attempted to make his Xfinity debut at Iowa in July but failed to qualify. The No. 17 would also skip both road course races at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] and [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course|Mid-Ohio]].\n\n===Camping World Truck Series===\nRick Ware Racing made its NASCAR debut in the [[Craftsman Truck Series]].  In 1999, RWR made two starts, one with [[Randy MacDonald]] and the other with driver-owner [[Rick Ware]] in trucks 51 and 81.\n\nIn 2000, the organization was set to run the entire season with two teams, the 51 and 81 when Rick Ware was injured in a head-on crash at [[California Speedway]] that resulted in a career-ending fractured vertebra to the neck.  Ware moved into the ownership role to continue the team. Drivers [[Tom Boston]], [[David Starr (racing driver)|David Starr]], [[Michael Dokken]] and [[Donnie Neuenberger]] finished out the 20 race schedule. Dokken produced an 8th-place finish at Loudon and led at Nazareth. [[Rick Ware]] finished a career-high of 13th at Texas.\n\nFor 2001, [[Brian Rose (racing driver)|Brian Rose]] ran 15 races before heading off to [[Bobby Hamilton Racing]]. [[Nathan Buttke]], [[Travis Clark]], Dokken, [[Coy Gibbs]], [[Donnie Neuenberger]], [[Trent Owens]], [[Jonathon Price]], [[Sammy Ragan]], [[Michael Ritch]], [[Jerry Robertson (racing driver)|Jerry Robertson]], [[Brian Sockwell]], [[Jason Thom]] and [[Rich Woodland Jr]] completed the roster that watched Rick Ware Racing expand to a three and an occasional four race team with numbers 51, 71, 81, 91.\n\nDokken had a season-high of 11th at Nazareth, Rose finished 12th at Fontana and many others finished in the Top 20 with laps being led by Dokken and Ritch for the season.\n\nIn 2002, Rick Ware Racing switched to Dodge and fielded the 5, 51 and 81 entries for several drivers. [[Lance Hooper]] ran the most races for the team with a total of twelve events. [[Randy Briggs]], [[Mike Cofer (kicker)|Mike Cofer]], [[Michael Dokken]], [[Jason Hedlesky]], [[Ryan Hemphill]], [[Scott Kirkpatrick]], [[Scott Kuhn]], [[Carl Long]], [[Blake Mallory]], [[Donny Morelock]], [[Donnie Neuenberger]], [[Jonathon Price]], [[Michael Ritch]], [[Brian Rose (racing driver)|Brian Rose]], [[Morgan Shepherd]], [[Jason Thom]], [[Andy Thurman]], [[Jason White (racing driver)|Jason White]] and [[Angie Wilson]] all competed for the team. Most drivers finished in the top 15 with Hooper leading a lap at Darlington.\n\nDuring the 2003 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series season, Rick Ware Racing decided to focus on one driver for a full season. [[Jerry Hill (racing driver)|Jerry Hill]] was slated for the task.  Hill competed in 22 of the 25 events and finished 18th in the drivers' standings in the No. 5 Dodge.  Ware also raced the number 51 and 81 with a number of drivers such as [[Rusty Alton]], [[Stan Boyd]], [[Randy Briggs]], [[Doug Keller]], [[Carl Long]], [[Blake Mallory]], [[G. J. Mennen Jr.]], [[Chase Montgomery]] and [[Brian Sockwell]].\n\nAfter taking a leave from the series, Ware returned to the newly named NASCAR Camping World Truck Series for just two races in 2009 while competing in the Nationwide Series full-time. [[Chrissy Wallace]] in the No. 08 for Ware competed against her father, [[Mike Wallace (racing driver)|Mike Wallace]], as it marked the first time a father and daughter raced in the same event in any of the top three NASCAR Series'.  Chrissy finished in front of her father in the 13th position, marking the 2nd highest finish by a female in NASCAR history.\n\n[[Tim Brown (racing driver)|Tim Brown]], coming off his record-breaking 8th Championship at [[Bowman-Gray Stadium]] in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series raced the truck at Martinsville as a celebration of their title earlier that month. RWR returned to the Truck Series with two full-time teams and an occasional third, using the 6, 47 and 16. [[Brett Butler (racing driver)|Brett Butler]] competed in fifteen races for Rookie of the Year. Neuenberger finished 9th at Daytona as Butler finished 11th. [[Bobby Hamilton Jr.]] qualified and finished tenth on two occasions each. [[Travis Kvapil]] along with Hamilton Jr. and Butler all led laps during the season. [[Amber Cope]], [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]], [[Ken Butler III]], [[J. C. Stout]], [[Brian Rose (racing driver)|Brian Rose]], [[Mike Guerity]], [[C. E. Falk]], [[Ryan Rust]], [[Carl Long]], Derek White, [[Lance Fenton]], [[Clay Greenfield]], [[Justin Hobgood]] and [[D. J. Kennington]] all drove the No. 6 for 2010 in mostly 1\u20132 race deals.\n\n[[Jeffrey Earnhardt]], the 4th generation driver of the Earnhardt family, made his series debut at Gateway. [[Amber Cope]] and [[Angela Cope]], the twin daughters of Daytona 500 winner [[Derrike Cope]], made their respective debuts at Martinsville Speedway, as the two became the first twins to compete against each other.\n\nFor 2011, [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]] was to run for the Rookie of the Year title in the No. 1 Fuel Doctor Chevy. However, after only 3 races, the team was hit with the double tragedy of losing two crew members and Fuel Doctor announcing it could no longer sponsor RWR. Earnhardt was released from RWR after Fuel Doctor's announcement, but the two mended fences and raced again at Martinsville. However, Earnhardt was caught up in a crash running 7th with just 25 laps remaining. Bobby Hamilton Jr. raced the truck at Nashville and Carl Long and Dover before the team took a temporary break to focus on the Nationwide Series where Earnhardt would drive select races in the No. 41 car.\n\nThe Truck team would return in 2013 with multiple drivers. The program was revived in 2017, fielding the No. 12 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] for [[Spencer Boyd]], [[Jordan Anderson (racing driver)|Jordan Anderson]], and [[Cody Ware]].<ref name=\"Truck Series 2017\" /> The No. 12 team failed to qualify the season opener at Daytona, with Boyd blowing up an engine during qualifying. The truck operation was dissolved after the fifth race of the season.\n\n===Whelen Modified Series===\nRick Ware Racing joined the NASCAR Whelen Modified Series in conjunction with Tim Brown Motorsports.  Brown and Ware's relationship dates back to the 90's when Ware made his own NASCAR Sprint Cup Series debut with the help of a young mechanic, [[Tim Brown (racing driver)|Tim Brown]].  Ware promised the youngster that he would help his career once he got going but Brown needed little help.\n\nIn 2009, Brown and Ware struck a deal to partner together for his attempt at a historic 8th Championship at the famous [[Bowman-Gray Stadium]], the oldest NASCAR sanctioned track, located in nearby Winston-Salem, NC.  Brown won five races en route to the title and the first for Ware in the series in the No. 83 Circle K/Hayes Jewelers entry.  The entire season was caught on film for the series, [[MadHouse (TV series)|Madhouse]] featured on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].\n\nAs true to their word, Ware promised Brown a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut if he won the title.  Tim Brown made his truck series debut at Martinsville Speedway where he finished 27th in the No. 08.\n\n==Sports car racing==\n===Rolex Sports Car Series===\n[[File:RWR 2012 Rolex 24.jpg|thumb|right|RWR's 2012 24 Hours of Daytona car]]\nRick Ware Racing returned to its roots of road racing as it did with Ware & Sons in the 1980s for the running of the Grand-Am Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona in 2011.\n\nRWR competed in the GT3 Cup Division at Daytona International Speedway for the historic Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona and finished 11th in class and 25th overall with drivers, [[Brett Sandberg]], [[Scott Monroe]], [[Maurice Hull]], [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]] and [[Doug Harrington]].\n\nThe event marked the 10th Anniversary of [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]]'s grandfather, [[Dale Earnhardt]] and uncle [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]]'s run in the same event.\n\nFuel Doctor was the primary of the No. 47 Porsche.\n\nRWR's entry marked the first time that a NASCAR team owner has moved from NASCAR to the Grand-Am Series.  Penske Racing and Ganassi Racing have competed in the Grand-Am Series then later moved to NASCAR.\n\n===Asian Le Mans===\nIn 2019, RWR began competing in the [[Asian Le Mans Series]], fielding two [[Ligier JS P2]]s in the LMPS Am class for Cody Ware and [[Mark Kvamme]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lemans.org/en/news/asian-le-mans-series-rick-ware-racing-gets-to-know-the-ligier-jsp2-at-le-mans-aerodrome/52744|title=Asian Le Mans Series \u2013 Rick Ware Racing Gets to Know the Ligier JSP2 at Le Mans Aerodrome|work=LeMans.org|date=September 13, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref> In their first race at [[Shanghai International Circuit]], the team missed qualifying and much of practice as their cars were plagued by shipping delays; to ensure their cars would be up to par, the team formed a partnership with [[ARC Bratislava]].<ref name=\"4H Shanghai\" /> Although the No. 25 was unable to compete in the race, Ware and Kvappe drove the No. 52 to a 14th-overall finish and second place in their class.<ref name=\"4H Shanghai\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2019/11/23/shanghai-saturday-paddock-notes.html|title=4H Shanghai: Saturday Paddock Notes|work=DailySportsCar.com|date=November 23, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Christie|first=Toby|url=https://tobychristie.com/2019/11/24/rick-ware-racing-finishes-second-in-class-in-asian-le-mans-series-race/|title=Rick Ware Racing Finishes Second in Class in Asian Le Mans Series Race|publisher=TobyChristie.com|date=November 24, 2019|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref> At [[The Bend Motorsport Park]], the team scored the LMP2 Am Trophy class win as they finished fifth overall with Ware and [[Gustas Grinbergas]]; at 16 years of age, Grinbergas became the youngest driver to win an [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO)-sanctioned race.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perrins|first=Slade|url=https://sportscar365.com/lemans/asian-lms/g-drive-takes-dramatic-4h-the-bend-win/|title=G-Drive Takes Dramatic 4H The Bend Win|publisher=Sportscar365|date=January 12, 2020|accessdate=January 12, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2020/01/13/grinbergas-becomes-youngest-ever-aco-rules-race-winner.html|title=Grinbergas Becomes Youngest Ever ACO Rules Race Winner|work=DailySportsCar.com|date=January 13, 2020|accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===IMSA Weathertech SportsCar Championship===\nIn August of 2019, RWR announced that they will be entering the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] for the 2020 season with an updated [[Riley Mk. 30]] in the PRO/AM [[Le Mans Prototype#LMP2|LMP2]] class.\n\n==Motorcycle racing==\n===AMA Arenacross Series===\nRick Ware Racing has always had its heart in two-wheel racing. [[Rick Ware]] had raced a few seasons in the AMA Supercross Series in the late 80's at places like the Superdome.  In 2007, Rick Ware partnered with Tuf Honda owner, [[Dave Antolak]] and put together one of the most impressive organizations in AMA Arenacross history.\n\nRWR with Tuf Honda with sponsorship from Bad Boy Power Drinks and Mahindra Tractors won the championship in 2007 with rider [[Danny Smith (racing driver)|Danny Smith]].  In 2008, [[Chad Johnson (racing driver)|Chad Johnson]] won the organization's second title in a row and in 2009, rider [[Jeff Gibson]] made it a record three championships consecutively.\n\nTuf Honda with Dave Antolak has a total of 5 Championships, the most in the series history with three of those titles coming in partnership with Rick Ware Racing\n\n===AMA Supercross Series===\nRick Ware Racing dates back in the Supercross to 1986 when the owner first raced in the series.  In 2007, Ware focused on putting together a team in his return that would compete with factory teams, yet remain a small independent. [[Brock Sellards]], [[Tyler Bright]], [[Jeff Dement]] and [[Tyson Hadsell]] completed the team under the Yamaha flagship alongside Bad Boy Power Drinks and Pro30.\n\nTyler Bright captured a holeshot award at Detroit (1) in the Superlites and Jeff Dement captured a holeshot award at Phoenix.\n\nIn 2008, [[Jake Marsack]] joined the organization and the success followed. Marsack finished 4th at San Francisco, just one spot from the podium and on a muddy evening in Daytona, Jake Marsack raced his way through the mud to a 3rd-place finish on the podium, marking the first time in modern-day history that an independent team finished that high.\n\n===AMA Motocross Series===\nRWR completed the three major series in AMA with the addition of the Motocross Series in 2007.  Riders [[Tyler Bright]], [[Tyson Hadsell]] and [[Jake Marsack]] raced for Ware on Yamaha's with Bad Boy Power Drinks and Pro30 on board.\n\nThe team came back in 2008 and made several main events but trouble kept them from competing with the bigger budget teams in the series.\n\nIn 2009, Ware went to a single rider team with [[Tyler Bright]] on a Honda with Mahindra Tractors on board in sponsorship.\n<ref name=\"wareracing.com\">wareracing.com</ref>\n\n===WMA Motocross Series===\nFew teams have scored as much success in the WMA Motocross Series, a motocross series for female riders, as Rick Ware Racing.  With Bad Boy Power Drinks and Pro30 in sponsorship, [[Jessica Patterson]], made history on her Honda bike for the organization.\n\nIn 2006, Patterson captured her 3rd title in the series and first for RWR.  Patterson backed that title up in 2007 with Ware, becoming the most successful female rider in AMA Motocross history.  During the two years with RWR, Patterson captured 10 holeshot awards and 13 victories, never failing to make a podium during the two-year stint.\n\nWare went in a different direction after the 2007 season to focus more on the NASCAR, Motocross and X-Games Series, after making his mark in the history books in the WMA Series\n<ref name=\"wareracing.com\"/>\n\n===Summer X Games===\nRick Ware Racing became interested in the crowd and excitement surrounding the X Games since its inception.  In 2009, RWR finally took the step into the events with Women's Motocross rider, [[Sherri Cruse]] for X-Games 15.\n\nCruse had captured the bronze medal in 2008 was highly favored in the event.  With Circle K and Fastwax on board, Cruse stumbled early in the event and charged from last place to 4th in the shorted race due to a television schedule.\n\nWare had faith in Cruse and went back X-Games 15 in 2010 for the same event.  Cruse had suffered an injury just weeks before the event and still completed the event after falling during the race.  Cruse finished 8th.\n\nRWR returned to the X Games in 2011 with a new rider in the Women's Moto X, Vicki Golden.  Golden had competed with RWR and Tuf Honda during the 2011 AMA Arenacross Series and gave her the nod for X Games 17.  Vicki Golden grabbed the holeshot for the event and went on to win gold for the organizations first gold medal in the X Games.<ref name=\"wareracing.com\"/>\n\n==Other series==\n===Allison Legacy Series===\nIn 2012, Rick Ware Racing joined the [[Allison Legacy Series]] with [[Tyler Hill (racing driver)|Tyler Hill]], the brother of [[Timmy Hill]].

He drove in ARCA for a total of four seasons full or part-time. He also ran two races in the [[NASCAR Truck Series]], and made one attempt in the [[Nationwide Series]] (now Xfinity) in [[2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2008]].\n\n==Racing career==\nCasola started out racing in local Saturday night short track races, winning races and championships along the way. He eventually reached the Hooters [[X-1R Pro Cup Series]], which he competed in part-time for a single season in 2006 (in his family's No. 02 car). He could not get behind the wheel of a stock car until age seventeen because of [[New Jersey]] state regulations. Despite this, he worked at sending resumes to many ARCA and NASCAR teams.<ref>{{cite web |first=Dominick |last=Casola |url=https://www.hotrod.com/articles/ctrp-0802w-from-the-cockpit/ |title=FROM THE COCKPIT: Dominick Casola |website=Hot Rod |publisher=Motor Trend Group LLC |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe got a chance to compete in ARCA full-time and for rookie of the year in [[2007 ARCA Re/Max Series|2007]], driving the No. 1 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for [[Andy Belmont]]'s team and sponsored by his family's business A. Casola Farms. He only missed one race that season, the season-opener at Daytona, with his car owner Belmont in the car for that race (which he failed to qualify for), presumably because Casola had never competed on a plate track before meaning he would not be approved to race. Finishing the season thirteenth in points, Casola got three top-10 finishes as well as two top-5's, which were a fifth at [[World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway|Gateway]] and a third at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arcaracing.com/articles/1979998-vacation-is-over-and-casola-heads-back-to-work-at-pocono |title=Vacation is Over and Casola Heads Back to Work at Pocono |website=ARCARacing.com |date=July 30, 2007 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[2008 ARCA Re/Max Series|2008 season]], he joined [[Win-Tron Racing]] to drive their No. 32 [[Dodge]] part-time, sharing this car with Andy Hanson, [[Chris Wimmer]], [[James Buescher]], [[Matt Merrell]], and [[Bradley Riethmeyer]]. He ran the first six races of the season, before then only competing in both races at his home track of [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]] as well as [[Berlin Raceway|Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepitlane.org/press/2008/13-32-prerace.html |title=Dominick Casola & Win-Tron Racing Look For Another Strong Run At Pocono |website=ThePitLane.org |date=July 30, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> He earned his first top-10 of the season at the first of the two Pocono races.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://us.motorsport.com/arca/news/pocono-dominick-casola-race-report/2707471/ |title=Casola Captures Season Best In Pocono; Win-Tron Three-For-Three \"New Jersey Native Ties Pocono Best Finish\" |website=Motorsport.com |publisher=[[Win-Tron Racing]] |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2010 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|2010]], Casola made his debut in the [[NASCAR Camping World Truck Series]], driving the No. 00 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] for Daisy Ramirez Motorsports at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. Since he was a late entry for the race, he received zero points. This was his only start in any NASCAR series that year. He started 35th and finished 28th in the race.\n\nCasola did not race in any series in 2011, and believed that his career was over at that point. However, in August 2012, driver Roger Carter, owner of the Carter 2 Motorsports team in the ARCA Series, called Casola to drive for his team when the normal driver of his car (Larry Barford Jr.) parted ways with them and he needed a new driver. His first and only race for C2M that year came at the dirt race at Springfield, where he started and finished 26th in the No. 04 Dodge.<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Biggy |url=http://mysaintjames.com/sjrb/ALUMNI/In%20The%20News/Announcements/Casola%20enjoying%20second%20chance%20at%20auto%20racing%20(pdf).pdf |title=Casola enjoying second chance at auto racing |website=[[Asbury Park Press]] |publisher=[[USA Today Network]] |date=2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> He returned to the team in the No. 40 for a part-time schedule in 2013, splitting time in that car with Galen Hassler, [[Nick Tucker]], Mark Meunier, [[Cody Lane]], [[Korbin Forrister]], Justin Lloyd, Joseph Hughs, and David Sear. Casola ran six races, which included both races at Pocono again as well as his other home track of [[New Jersey Motorsports Park]]. His best finish was a 16th at [[Chicagoland Speedway|Chicago]]. The other two races he ran were [[Road America]] and [[DuQuoin State Fairgrounds Racetrack|DuQuoin]]. On top of that, he returned to the Truck Series that year in their race at Pocono, driving the No. 28 for [[FDNY Racing]].\n\nAlthough he has not made any stock-car starts since the 2013 season, Casola, as recently as 2018, continues to occasionally compete in local [[Late model racing|late model races]], including at [[Wall Stadium]], according to his Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://team.valvoline.com/es/fast-track-entry/fast-track-entrydominick-casola-02-20-2018 |title=Fast track to fame presented by Valvoline Entry: Dominick Casola |website=[[Valvoline]] |date=February 20, 2018 |accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

He drove in ARCA for a total of four seasons full or part-time. He also ran two races in the [[NASCAR Truck Series]], and made one attempt in the [[Nationwide Series]] (now Xfinity) in [[2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2008]].\n\n==Racing career==\nCasola started out racing in local Saturday night short track races, winning races and championships along the way. He eventually reached the Hooters [[X-1R Pro Cup Series]], which he competed in part-time for a single season in 2006 (in his family's No. 02 car). He could not get behind the wheel of a stock car until age seventeen because of [[New Jersey]] state regulations. Despite this, he worked at sending resumes to many ARCA and NASCAR teams.<ref>{{cite web |first=Dominick |last=Casola |url=https://www.hotrod.com/articles/ctrp-0802w-from-the-cockpit/ |title=FROM THE COCKPIT: Dominick Casola |website=Hot Rod |publisher=Motor Trend Group LLC |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe got a chance to compete in ARCA full-time and for rookie of the year in [[2007 ARCA Re/Max Series|2007]], driving the No. 1 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] for [[Andy Belmont]]'s team and sponsored by his family's business A. Casola Farms. He only missed one race that season, the season-opener at Daytona, with his car owner Belmont in the car for that race (which he failed to qualify for), presumably because Casola had never competed on a plate track before meaning he would not be approved to race. Finishing the season thirteenth in points, Casola got three top-10 finishes as well as two top-5's, which were a fifth at [[World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway|Gateway]] and a third at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arcaracing.com/articles/1979998-vacation-is-over-and-casola-heads-back-to-work-at-pocono |title=Vacation is Over and Casola Heads Back to Work at Pocono |website=ARCARacing.com |date=July 30, 2007 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[2008 ARCA Re/Max Series|2008 season]], he joined [[Win-Tron Racing]] to drive their No. 32 [[Dodge]] part-time, sharing this car with Andy Hanson, [[Chris Wimmer]], [[James Buescher]], [[Matt Merrell]], and [[Bradley Riethmeyer]]. He ran the first six races of the season, before then only competing in both races at his home track of [[Pocono Raceway|Pocono]] as well as [[Berlin Raceway|Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepitlane.org/press/2008/13-32-prerace.html |title=Dominick Casola & Win-Tron Racing Look For Another Strong Run At Pocono |website=ThePitLane.org |date=July 30, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> He earned his first top-10 of the season at the first of the two Pocono races.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://us.motorsport.com/arca/news/pocono-dominick-casola-race-report/2707471/ |title=Casola Captures Season Best In Pocono; Win-Tron Three-For-Three \"New Jersey Native Ties Pocono Best Finish\" |website=Motorsport.com |publisher=[[Win-Tron Racing]] |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2010 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series|2010]], Casola made his debut in the [[NASCAR Camping World Truck Series]], driving the No. 00 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] for Daisy Ramirez Motorsports at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]]. Since he was a late entry for the race, he received zero points. This was his only start in any NASCAR series that year. He started 35th and finished 28th in the race.\n\nCasola did not race in any series in 2011, and believed that his career was over at that point. However, in August 2012, driver Roger Carter, owner of the Carter 2 Motorsports team in the ARCA Series, called Casola to drive for his team when the normal driver of his car (Larry Barford Jr.) parted ways with them and he needed a new driver. His first and only race for C2M that year came at the dirt race at Springfield, where he started and finished 26th in the No. 04 Dodge.<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Biggy |url=http://mysaintjames.com/sjrb/ALUMNI/In%20The%20News/Announcements/Casola%20enjoying%20second%20chance%20at%20auto%20racing%20(pdf).pdf |title=Casola enjoying second chance at auto racing |website=[[Asbury Park Press]] |publisher=[[USA Today Network]] |date=2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> He returned to the team in the No. 40 for a part-time schedule in 2013, splitting time in that car with Galen Hassler, [[Nick Tucker]], [[Mark Meunier]], [[Cody Lane]], [[Korbin Forrister]], Justin Lloyd, Joseph Hughs, and David Sear. Casola ran six races, which included both races at Pocono again as well as his other home track of [[New Jersey Motorsports Park]]. His best finish was a 16th at [[Chicagoland Speedway|Chicago]]. The other two races he ran were [[Road America]] and [[DuQuoin State Fairgrounds Racetrack|DuQuoin]]. On top of that, he returned to the Truck Series that year in their race at Pocono, driving the No. 28 for [[FDNY Racing]].\n\nAlthough he has not made any stock-car starts since the 2013 season, Casola, as recently as 2018, continues to occasionally compete in local [[Late model racing|late model races]], including at [[Wall Stadium]], according to his Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://team.valvoline.com/es/fast-track-entry/fast-track-entrydominick-casola-02-20-2018 |title=Fast track to fame presented by Valvoline Entry: Dominick Casola |website=[[Valvoline]] |date=February 20, 2018 |accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.
