and [[Hubei]] to the southwest. At the 2010 census, it had a total population of 5,612,590, whom 1,644,344 lived in the built-up area made of 2 urban districts. Neighbouring prefecture-level cities are the provincial capital of [[Hefei]] to the east, [[Anqing]] to the south, [[Huanggang]] (Hubei) and [[Xinyang]] (Henan) to the west, and [[Huainan]] and [[Fuyang]] to the north. Although the character \"{{linktext|lang=zh|\u516d}}\" (literally: \"six\") is normally pronounced \"Li\u00f9\", in this case it changes to \"L\u00f9\" on account of the historical [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary reading]].\n\n==Geography and climate==\nLu'an is marked by the southern fringes of the [[North China Plain]] in its north and the northern part of the [[Dabie Mountains]] in its south. Its administrative area spans 31\u00b001\u2032\u221232\u00b040\u2032 N latitude and 115\u00b020\u2032\u2212117\u00b014\u2032 E longitude.\n\nLu'an has a [[monsoon]]-influenced, [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfa''), with four distinct seasons. Winters are cold and damp, with average low temperatures in January dipping just below freezing; the January 24-hour average temperature is {{convert|2.6|C|1}}. Summers are typically hot and humid, with a July average of {{convert|27.8|C|1}}. The annual mean is {{convert|15.68|C|1}}, while annual precipitation averages just above {{convert|1100|mm|0}}, a majority of which occurs from May to August. Annual sunshine duration is 2,000 to 2,300 hours.\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|location = Lu'an (1971\u22122000)\n|Jan record high C = 22.5\n|Feb record high C = 26.9\n|Mar record high C = 32.5\n|Apr record high C = 34.7\n|May record high C = 37.6\n|Jun record high C = 38.4\n|Jul record high C = 40.6\n|Aug record high C = 39.4\n|Sep record high C = 40.0\n|Oct record high C = 34.1\n|Nov record high C = 30.0\n|Dec record high C = 23.8\n\n|Jan high C =  6.8\n|Feb high C =  8.8\n|Mar high C = 13.3\n|Apr high C = 20.9\n|May high C = 26.0\n|Jun high C = 29.1\n|Jul high C = 32.1\n|Aug high C = 31.6\n|Sep high C = 26.8\n|Oct high C = 21.8\n|Nov high C = 15.5\n|Dec high C =  9.7\n\n|Jan mean C =  2.6\n|Feb mean C =  4.5\n|Mar mean C =  9.1\n|Apr mean C = 16.0\n|May mean C = 21.2\n|Jun mean C = 24.8\n|Jul mean C = 27.8\n|Aug mean C = 27.2\n|Sep mean C = 22.4\n|Oct mean C = 17.0\n|Nov mean C = 10.6\n|Dec mean C =  4.9\n\n|Jan low C = \u22120.5\n|Feb low C =  1.3\n|Mar low C =  5.5\n|Apr low C = 11.7\n|May low C = 17.0\n|Jun low C = 21.2\n|Jul low C = 24.4\n|Aug low C = 23.9\n|Sep low C = 18.9\n|Oct low C = 13.2\n|Nov low C =  6.7\n|Dec low C =  1.4\n\n|Jan record low C = \u221213.6\n|Feb record low C = \u221211.6\n|Mar record low C =  \u22123.1\n|Apr record low C =   0.2\n|May record low C =   8.0\n|Jun record low C =  12.1\n|Jul record low C =  18.0\n|Aug record low C =  16.8\n|Sep record low C =  10.7\n|Oct record low C =   1.7\n|Nov record low C =  \u22124.7\n|Dec record low C = \u221211.7\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm =  40.5\n|Feb precipitation mm =  54.7\n|Mar precipitation mm =  86.5\n|Apr precipitation mm =  83.8\n|May precipitation mm = 113.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 162.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 185.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 137.3\n|Sep precipitation mm =  83.4\n|Oct precipitation mm =  77.3\n|Nov precipitation mm =  55.2\n|Dec precipitation mm =  27.3\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days =  8.6\n|Feb precipitation days =  8.8\n|Mar precipitation days = 13.0\n|Apr precipitation days = 11.3\n|May precipitation days = 11.6\n|Jun precipitation days = 12.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 13.0\n|Aug precipitation days = 11.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 10.4\n|Oct precipitation days =  9.2\n|Nov precipitation days =  8.0\n|Dec precipitation days =  6.4\n|source 1 = [http://www.weather.com.cn/cityintro/101221501.shtml?

Signed as a replacement for the departing [[Judy Carne]], Tomlin was an instant success on the already established program, in which in addition to appearing in general sketches and delivering comic gags, she began appearing as the regular characters she created; they became well known and she portrayed them outside of the show in later recordings and television specials:\n* '''Ernestine''' was a brash, tough and uncompromising [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]] who generally treated customers with little sympathy. Ernestine often snorted when she let loose a barbed response or heard something salacious; she also wore her hair in a 1940s hairstyle with a hairnet, although the character was contemporary. Her opening lines were often the comical \"one ringy dingy... two ringy dingy\", and, \"is this the party to whom I am speaking?\" In the sketches, Ernestine was usually at her switchboard taking calls. She occasionally called her boyfriend, Vito, a telephone repair man, or her pal Phoenicia, another operator.[[File:Lilly Tomlin Edith Ann 1975.JPG|thumb|180px|Tomlin as Edith Ann, 1975]] Tomlin reprised the role in 2016 for a TV ad as part of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]'s campaign against [[SeaWorld]],<ref>Kelli Bender, \"Lily Tomlin Reprises Ernestine Role for PETA's New Ad Blasting SeaWorld,\" ''[https://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/14/lily-tomlin-ernestine-peta-seaworld People]'', 14 April 2016.</ref> Tomlin has also reprised the role on several episodes of ''[[Sesame Street]]''.\n* {{anchor|Edith_Ann}} '''Edith Ann''' is a precocious five-and-a-half-year-old girl who waxes philosophical on everyday life, either about life as a kid or things for which she feels she has the answers, although she is too young to fully understand. She often ends her monologues with \"And that's the truth\", punctuating it with a noisy [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]]. Edith Ann sits in an oversized rocking chair (to make Tomlin seem child-sized) with her rag doll, Doris, and often talks of life at home with her battling parents and bullying older sister, Mary Jean (Lily Tomlin's given birth names). Edith Ann has an oversized, playfully aggressive dog named Buster and a boyfriend named Junior Phillips, a possibly unrequited love. (Only Edith Ann and \"Doris\" appear in the Edith Ann sketches.) Tomlin reprised the character for a series of sketches on ''Sesame Street'' in the 1970s, and voiced her in three prime-time cartoon specials in the 1990s (including ''[[Edith Ann: A Few Pieces of the Puzzle]]'').\n* '''Mrs. Judith Beasley''' is a housewife and mother from [[Calumet City, Illinois]], who is often chosen for television commercials and offers \"good consumer advice\". She appears in the film ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]'' as the lead character's neighbor.\n* '''Mrs. Earbore (The Tasteful Lady)''' is a somewhat prudish and prissy, conservatively dressed middle-aged apolitical woman who dispenses advice on gracious living and a life of elegance.\n* '''Susie the Sorority Girl''' is a blonde collegiate who could be the Tasteful Lady's daughter. Humorless and melodramatic, her biggest worries are the likes of who took her missing album by [[The Carpenters]].\n* '''The Consumer Advocate Lady''' is a dour, austere woman who rigidly inspects and tests products for their alleged value.  The Consumer Advocate Lady is something of a variation of Mrs. Beasley.\n* '''Lucille the Rubber Freak''' is a woman addicted to eating rubber, whose monologue details her habit from its beginning (chewing the eraser on pencils) to her obsessive rock bottom (eating the tip off mother's cane). Tomlin performed this character as part of her ''Laugh-In'' audition.\n* '''Tess/Trudy''' is a homeless bag lady who accosts theater-goers and various passers-by with her offbeat observations and tales of communications with extraterrestrials. (\"They don't care if you believe in 'em or not\u2014they're different from God.\")\n* '''Bobbi-Jeanine''' is a showbiz veteran of the lounge circuit where she sings and plays organ. She often dispenses advice. (\"It's not called Show Art, it's Show Business.\")\n\nTomlin was one of the first female comedians to break out in male drag with her characters '''Tommy Velour''' and '''Rick'''. In 1982, she premiered '''Pervis Hawkins''', a black rhythm-and-blues soul singer (patterned after [[Luther Vandross]]), with a mustache, beard, and close-cropped [[afro]] hairstyle, dressed in a three-piece suit. Tomlin used very little, if any, skin-darkening cosmetics as part of the character, instead depending on stage lighting to create the effect.\n\nIn 1970, [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] offered Tomlin $500,000 to play her character Ernestine in a commercial, but she declined, saying it would compromise her artistic integrity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20100107/entertainment/100109893?p=2&tc=pg\n|accessdate=October 16, 2012|title=Lily Tomlin, Playing Lakeland Next Week, Dishes on Her Act, Sexuality and Retiring  |first=John |last=Chambliss |location= Lakeland, FL |work=The Ledger\n|date=January 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT98\">{{cite news |title=Lily Tomlin in Madison Ave. debut with Peter Lynch|work= New York Times |first=Stuart |last=Elliott |date=September 4, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/04/business/the-media-business-advertising-lily-tomlin-in-madison-ave-debut-with-peter-lynch.html |accessdate=October 16, 2012}}</ref> In 1976, she appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''<ref>Season 2 Episode 1, September 18, 1976</ref> as Ernestine in a [[Ma Bell]] advertisement parody in which she proclaimed, \"We don't care, we don't have to...we're the phone company.\" The character later made a guest appearance at ''[[The Superhighway Summit]]'' at [[UCLA]] on January 11, 1994, interrupting a speech being given on the [[information superhighway]] by then-Vice President [[Al Gore]].

She published Edith Ann's \"autobiography\" ''My Life'' (1995), co-written with [[Jane Wagner]].\n\n=== Recordings ===\nIn 1972, Tomlin released ''[[This Is a Recording (Lily Tomlin album)|This Is A Recording]]'', her first comedy album on [[Polydor Records]] in 1972 that contained Ernestine's run-ins with customers over the phone. The album hit No. 15 on the [[Billboard Hot 200|''Billboard'' Hot 200]], becoming (and remaining {{as of|2011|lc=y}}) the highest-charting album ever by a solo comedienne.<ref name=\"Billb\">[https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044968/chart-beat-katy-perry-kathy-griffin-miley-cyrus \"Chart beat: Katy Perry, Kathy Griffin, Miley Cyrus\"].

(Tomlin has two of the  three top charting female comedy albums on ''Billboard'', sandwiching a 1983 [[Joan Rivers]] release.)<ref name=\"Billb\"/>\n\nTomlin's third comedy album, 1975's ''Modern Scream'', a parody of movie magazines and celebrity interviews featured her performing as multiple characters, including Ernestine, Edith Ann, Judith, and Suzie. Reviewing in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] said: \"When I hear Tomlin impersonate Suzie Sorority or explain how she managed to play a heterosexual in ''Nashville'' ('I've seen these women all my life, so I know how they walk, I know how they talk'.)

The Oscar that year went to [[Lee Grant]] for her role in ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]''. A comedy-mystery, ''[[The Late Show (film)|The Late Show]]'', teaming Tomlin with [[Art Carney]], was a critical success in 1977. One of the few widely panned projects of Tomlin's career was 1978's ''[[Moment by Moment]]'', directed and written by Wagner, which teamed Tomlin in a cross-generational older woman/younger man romance with [[John Travolta]].\n\nIn 1980, Tomlin co-starred in ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', in which she played a secretary named [[Violet Newstead]] who joins coworkers [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Dolly Parton]] in seeking revenge on their boss, Franklin M.

Tomlin starred in the 1981 science fiction comedy, ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]'', a send-up of consumerism, and was the sickly heiress in the comedy, ''[[All of Me (1984 film)|All of Me]]'', opposite [[Steve Martin]].\n\nTomlin and [[Bette Midler]] played two pairs of identical twins who were [[babies switched at birth|switched at birth]] in the 1988 comedy, ''[[Big Business (1988 film)|Big Business]]''.

In March 2007, two videos were leaked onto [[YouTube]] portraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin, in which among other things he called her sexist names. When the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' asked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, \"I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movie\u2014even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure.

Signed as a replacement for the departing [[Judy Carne]], Tomlin was an instant success on the already established program, in which in addition to appearing in general sketches and delivering comic gags, she began appearing as the regular characters she created; they became well known and she portrayed them outside of the show in later recordings and television specials:\n* '''Ernestine''' was a brash, tough and uncompromising [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]] who generally treated customers with little sympathy. Ernestine often snorted when she let loose a barbed response or heard something salacious; she also wore her hair in a 1940s hairstyle with a hairnet, although the character was contemporary. Her opening lines were often the comical \"one ringy dingy... two ringy dingy\", and, \"is this the party to whom I am speaking?\" In the sketches, Ernestine was usually at her switchboard taking calls. She occasionally called her boyfriend, Vito, a telephone repair man, or her pal Phoenicia, another operator.[[File:Lilly Tomlin Edith Ann 1975.JPG|thumb|180px|Tomlin as Edith Ann, 1975]] Tomlin reprised the role in 2016 for a TV ad as part of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]]'s campaign against [[SeaWorld]],<ref>Kelli Bender, \"Lily Tomlin Reprises Ernestine Role for PETA's New Ad Blasting SeaWorld,\" ''[https://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/14/lily-tomlin-ernestine-peta-seaworld People]'', 14 April 2016.</ref> Tomlin has also reprised the role on several episodes of ''[[Sesame Street]]''.\n* {{anchor|Edith_Ann}} '''Edith Ann''' is a precocious five-and-a-half-year-old girl who waxes philosophical on everyday life, either about life as a kid or things for which she feels she has the answers, although she is too young to fully understand. She often ends her monologues with \"And that's the truth\", punctuating it with a noisy [[Blowing a raspberry|raspberry]]. Edith Ann sits in an oversized rocking chair (to make Tomlin seem child-sized) with her rag doll, Doris, and often talks of life at home with her battling parents and bullying older sister, Mary Jean (Lily Tomlin's given birth names). Edith Ann has an oversized, playfully aggressive dog named Buster and a boyfriend named Junior Phillips, a possibly unrequited love. (Only Edith Ann and \"Doris\" appear in the Edith Ann sketches.) Tomlin reprised the character for a series of sketches on ''Sesame Street'' in the 1970s, and voiced her in three prime-time cartoon specials in the 1990s (including ''[[Edith Ann: A Few Pieces of the Puzzle]]'').\n* '''Mrs. Judith Beasley''' is a housewife and mother from [[Calumet City, Illinois]], who is often chosen for television commercials and offers \"good consumer advice\". She appears in the film ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Woman]]'' as the lead character's neighbor.\n* '''Mrs. Earbore (The Tasteful Lady)''' is a somewhat prudish and prissy, conservatively dressed middle-aged apolitical woman who dispenses advice on gracious living and a life of elegance.\n* '''Susie the Sorority Girl''' is a blonde collegiate who could be the Tasteful Lady's daughter. Humorless and melodramatic, her biggest worries are the likes of who took her missing album by [[The Carpenters]].\n* '''The Consumer Advocate Lady''' is a dour, austere woman who rigidly inspects and tests products for their alleged value.  The Consumer Advocate Lady is something of a variation of Mrs. Beasley.\n* '''Lucille the Rubber Freak''' is a woman addicted to eating rubber, whose monologue details her habit from its beginning (chewing the eraser on pencils) to her obsessive rock bottom (eating the tip off mother's cane). Tomlin performed this character as part of her ''Laugh-In'' audition.\n* '''Tess/Trudy''' is a homeless bag lady who accosts theater-goers and various passers-by with her offbeat observations and tales of communications with extraterrestrials. (\"They don't care if you believe in 'em or not\u2014they're different from God.\")\n* '''Bobbi-Jeanine''' is a showbiz veteran of the lounge circuit where she sings and plays organ. She often dispenses advice. (\"It's not called Show Art, it's Show Business.\")\n\nTomlin was one of the first female comedians to break out in male drag with her characters '''Tommy Velour''' and '''Rick'''. In 1982, she premiered '''Pervis Hawkins''', a black rhythm-and-blues soul singer (patterned after [[Luther Vandross]]), with a mustache, beard, and close-cropped [[afro]] hairstyle, dressed in a three-piece suit. Tomlin used very little, if any, skin-darkening cosmetics as part of the character, instead depending on stage lighting to create the effect.\n\nIn 1970, [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] offered Tomlin $500,000 to play her character Ernestine in a commercial, but she declined, saying it would compromise her artistic integrity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20100107/entertainment/100109893?p=2&tc=pg\n|accessdate=October 16, 2012|title=Lily Tomlin, Playing Lakeland Next Week, Dishes on Her Act, Sexuality and Retiring  |first=John |last=Chambliss |location= Lakeland, FL |work=The Ledger\n|date=January 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT98\">{{cite news |title=Lily Tomlin in Madison Ave. debut with Peter Lynch|work= New York Times |first=Stuart |last=Elliott |date=September 4, 1998 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/04/business/the-media-business-advertising-lily-tomlin-in-madison-ave-debut-with-peter-lynch.html |accessdate=October 16, 2012}}</ref> In 1976, she appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''<ref>Season 2 Episode 1, September 18, 1976</ref> as Ernestine in a [[Ma Bell]] advertisement parody in which she proclaimed, \"We don't care, we don't have to...we're the phone company.\" The character later made a guest appearance at ''[[The Superhighway Summit]]'' at [[UCLA]] on January 11, 1994, interrupting a speech being given on the [[information superhighway]] by then-Vice President [[Al Gore]].

A comedy-mystery, ''[[The Late Show (film)|The Late Show]]'', teaming Tomlin with [[Art Carney]], was a critical success in 1977.

In March 2007, two videos were leaked onto [[YouTube]] portraying on-set arguments between Russell and Tomlin, in which among other things he called her sexist names. When the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' asked Tomlin about the videos, she responded, \"I love David. There was a lot of pressure in making the movie\u2014even the way it came out you could see it was a very free-associative, crazy movie, and David was under a tremendous amount of pressure.

Maika landed in the middle of reddish glare and walks on the water.]]\n-->\n'''''Spadla z oblakov''''' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]], in [[English language|English]] translated as ''She Came Out of the Blue Sky'') is a [[Slovak language]] [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] [[TV series]] for [[Children's television series|children]] created in 1978. The series became very popular in [[Czechoslovakia]] and several other countries.\n\nThe series was based on 1967 child book ''Spadla z nebe'' (''She came out of the blue sky'') by [[V\u00e1clav Pavel Borovi\u010dka]], a Czech writer and screenwriter. The first, very successful edition was followed by several reprints, the last in year 2000 ({{ISBN|80-7214-365-4}}). The TV series follows the book quite closely, except for the ending, which is changed from sad to relatively happy (instead of dying, the protagonist goes back where she came from).\n\n==The plot==\nAn [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial alien]] lands on Earth near the (fictional) Slovak town \u010cabovce. The alien, which looks like a little girl, meets with a group of children from the town who name her Maika (Slovak spelling: Majka). They instantly know she is no normal person, since she repeatedly demonstrates her ability to levitate and even walk on water.\n\nAt first, her appearance and mannerisms invoke the [[uncanny valley]]; her skin appears wax-like and her speech is staccato. She is able to speak correct, if stilted, Slovak after plugging in the correct language module in the utility belt she is always wearing (at first she tried to address the children in German).\n\nMaika seems completely humorless and unfeeling, questioning even such simple expressions as what it means to \"like\" something. She says she came to Earth from the remote planet ''Gurun'' by means of the \"system\" ''Felix''. (The day she appeared, a strange aurora-like glow was seen over the nearby woods, and a peculiar mechanical voice speaking the word \"Felix\" intruded in local broadcasts. Just what Felix is, beyond its being Maika's means of transportation and possessing an intelligence of its own, is left unclear throughout. It may not be exactly what humans would understand as a \"ship\", though it is mentioned in the series that the day Maika appeared, [[Palomar Observatory]] noticed a small object moving with immense speed in Earth's vicinity.)\n\nMaika demonstrates extensive knowledge of encyclopedical facts about the human world, which she says have been derived from earthly radio broadcasts picked up by the Gurunians. At the same time, it becomes evident that the aliens have poor insight into human nature and even human anatomy. When the children try to hold a \"banquet\" in Maika's honor, she eats nothing, as she gets her energy from a gem-like \"stabilizer\" in her belt. Instead her eyes start to glow and twinkle as she transmits her view of the eating kids to Gurun, and the report curiously also intrudes on all TV sets in the area, complete with the narration of \"Felix\": The alien voice informs the Gurunians that the bodies of earthlings end in an upward projection called a \"head\", and that this \"head\" has several orifices, through one of which the earthlings absorb fuel. The fuel is however of extremely poor quality, requiring them to constantly refuel in ever-repeated rituals called \"breakfast\", \"lunch\" and \"dinner\".\n\nIt is thus implied that though Maika herself has human features including a head and a mouth, such anatomical features are in fact alien to the Gurunians, and Maika's current human-like body would be a mere imitation to facilitate contact with humans.\n\nOver the course of the series, Maika however develops a deeper understanding of people's emotions and behaviour, slowly getting acquainted with them through the help of her new friends, and in time she seems to experience genuine emotions herself. Her appearance also gets more human, her skin and hair becoming less wax-like (again indicating that her body is really an imitation, which she can fine-tune and improve as she gets to observe humans up close). Among her friends, she eventually stops talking in the staccato, robot-like voice she used at first, beginning to sound more like a normal human child. She also seems to develop an appreciation for the human concept of \"fun\", and uses her abilities to fly or to effortlessly replicate things as a source of entertainment and adventures for her friends.\n\nEventually the kids are no longer able to keep Maika hidden from the adults, nor does she herself try to be particularly discreet. After various demonstrations of her abilities, the local community accepts that she is indeed an alien, and she even participates in a press conference.\n\nAfter promiscuous use of the matter replicator during the press conference, Maika suddenly appears weak and indicates that the \"stabilizer\" in her belt needs to be replaced. Karol, the boy she has connected most closely with, helps her get to a glade in the woods where a stretch of scorched earth indicates the place Felix originally came down. Warned by Maika, Karol hides behind a rock as a blinding, pulsating light descends, and a new \"stabilizer\" lands in Maika's hand. Seconds later, Felix is gone, but Maika happily dances as she once again has all the energy she needs.\n\nWhile the publicity curiously does not seem to cause an instant world sensation, an unidentified foreign nation takes an interest in Maika, and their agents eventually attempt a kidnapping. Maika herself is rather cooperative, regarding the kidnapping as an opportunity for her to learn more about earth culture. However, once the kidnappers have her in their helicopter and try to take her out of the country, she uses her abilities to reverse the helicopter mid-air. The foreign agents are arrested by the authorities. (The Slovak authorities ''themselves'' appear altogether benign and are seemingly happy to leave Maika alone with her young friends, even after her demonstration of potentially world-changing alien technology during the press conference.)\n\nUsing her abilities to levitate objects and even people, Maika takes her friends on adventures as far as [[Bratislava]] and even [[Prague]], but it seems that this again depletes the \"stabilizer\" she derives her energy from. At the end of the penultimate episode, Maika is once again weak, and worst of all, she is now even unable to communicate with the \"system Felix\" so that she can get a replacement stabilizer.\n\nThe last episode is a race against time as Karol once more tries to bring Maika (seemingly dying) to the glade in the woods, but this time with no guarantee that Felix will even be there. Luckily one of the kids is a radio amateur that has earlier picked up the strange voice of the alien \"system\", and he finally manages to make contact and inform Felix of the plight of their ambassador. The intense, pulsating light once again descends on the woods, and Karol understands that this is goodbye. In his last moments with Maika, he declares his love for her. Maika herself sheds her first-ever tear, and promises Karol that she will return to him and \"the gang\".\n\nWith her departure, the series closes, though the kids are hopeful that in time, they will see their strange friend again.\n\nThe relatively happy ending of the TV series departs from the original book, which ended on a sad note as instead of going home, Maika dies.\n\n==Details==\nThe series was produced in 1978 by [[Czechoslovak Television]] [[Bratislava]] in [[Film Ateliers Gottwaldov]]. It consists of 13 parts, each lasting about 25 minutes. [[Radim Cvr\u010dek]] served as the director, the main child role (Maika) was played by Zuzana Prav\u0148ansk\u00e1. The music was composed by [[Harry Macourek]].\n\nThe format of the series vaguely gives the impression that it is a reconstruction of real events. The very first episode starts out in a rather didactic fashion: A seemingly learned man, who is later shown to be a doctor, directly addresses the camera and talks about the world-shaking events that have recently taken place; he adds a sense of realism by exactly pinpointing the location we are about to see as 49\u00b0 5\u2032 20\u2033 N, 19\u00b0 25\u2032 22\u2033 E. These geographical coordinates are repeated in many of the introductions to the following episodes, adding a flair of scientific exactitude. (In reality, the coordinates simply point to the wood-covered outskirts of a large field, hardly resembling the location seen in the series.)\n\nAfter Maika's departure, the series ends with two characters suddenly breaking the fourth wall and directly addressing the viewers. In light of Maika's promise that she will return, they tell viewers that if they ever come to the [[Tatra mountains]] and see a flying girl, that would be her.\n\n''Spadla z oblakov'' does contain a number of special effects, some of which have dated worse than others, but all would be good to excellent when considered by the standards of a 1978 TV production. Maika regularly flies, shows glowing eyes when she transmits what she sees to her home planet, and sometimes uses her automatic replicator which can copy material objects exactly (apparently down to molecular level). However, the series does not primarily rely on astonishing visual effects and keeps the storyline focused on understanding the human world from the point of view of a (non-human) child. At the same time, the human children try to figure out the visitor, whose mannerisms evolve from uncannily detached to almost perfectly human-like by the end of the series.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Zuzana Pravnansk\u00e1 as Majka \n* Matej Landl as Karol\n* Lubor Cajka as Sl\u00e1vo\n* Svetlana Majbov\u00e1 as Katka\n* Karol Pol\u00e1k as Dedi\u010d\n* [[Michal Such\u00e1nek (Czech actor)]] as Jurko\n* Pavel Lazar as Ferko\n* Roman Kudrna as Igor\n* J\u00e1n Kram\u00e1r as VB Kvasn\u00e1k\n* Milan Kis as Sl\u00e1vo's father, hotel doorman\n* [[Franti\u0161ek Zvar\u00edk]] as Valko, hotel manager\n* Peter Scholtz as Emil Hor\u00e1k\n* Emil Horv\u00e1th St. as teacher\n* Jozef Bedn\u00e1rik as Palo\n* V\u00e1clav Babka as doctor\n* M\u00e1ria H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 as grandmother\n\n== Parallels with ''E.T.'' ==\nThe 1978 series has numerous parallels with the popular 1982 movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. In both stories, a diminutive alien appears on Earth, but is initially only known to a group of children. In both, the alien is able to levitate things and flies with its newfound friends. In both, the kids initially try to hide the alien from the adults, but its existence is eventually revealed. In both, the alien eventually falls ill and desperately needs to contact its own people for them to pick it up. In both, radio contact is finally established by improvised means. In both, the story ends with a sad goodbye between the alien and the boy it has connected most closely with.\n\n== Name in other languages==\nThe series has been aired in several foreign countries (first in 1981 in Norway) under different names.\n\n* English: ''She Came Out of the Blue Sky''\n* Russian: \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044b\n* German: ''Sie kam aus dem All''\n* Polish: ''Majka z Kosmosu/Spad\u0142a z ob\u0142ok\u00f3w''\n* Cambodian: \u1798\u17c9\u17c3\u1780\u17b6 \u1780\u17bb\u1798\u17b6\u179a\u17b8\u1792\u17d2\u179b\u17b6\u1780\u17cb\u1796\u17b8\u179b\u17be\u1798\u17c1\u1783\n* Norwegian (Nynorsk): ''Majka \u2013 jenta fr\u00e5 verdsrommet''\n* Vietnamese: ''Maika - C\u00f4 b\u00e9 t\u1eeb tr\u00ean tr\u1eddi r\u01a1i xu\u1ed1ng''\n* Hungarian: ''Csillagok k\u00fcld\u00f6tte''\n* Bulgarian: \u041f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435\n* Spanish: ''Mayka, La Ni\u00f1a del Espacio''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0077083}}\n* [http://spadla.narod.ru/index_e.htm Website about the serial, contents, screenshots] (English and Russian, Russian translation of the book)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twdsb0JHFYI A YouTube video with opening song]\n\n[[Category:Slovak television series]]\n[[Category:1970s children's television series]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:1970s Czechoslovak television series]]\n[[Category:1978 Czechoslovak television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Fictional Slovak people]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Spadla z oblakov\n| image                =<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Spadla z oblakov.jpg|center|250px|thumb|2006 DVD cover.

Maika landed in the middle of reddish glare and walks on the water.]]\n-->\n'''''Spadla z oblakov''''' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]], in [[English language|English]] translated as ''She Came Out of the Blue Sky'') is a [[Slovak language]] [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] [[TV series]] for [[Children's television series|children]] created in 1978. The series became very popular in [[Czechoslovakia]] and several other countries.\n\nThe series was based on 1967 child book ''Spadla z nebe'' (''She came out of the blue sky'') by [[V\u00e1clav Pavel Borovi\u010dka]], a Czech writer and screenwriter. The first, very successful edition was followed by several reprints, the last in year 2000 ({{ISBN|80-7214-365-4}}). The TV series follows the book quite closely, except for the ending, which is changed from sad to relatively happy (instead of dying, the protagonist goes back where she came from).\n\n==The plot==\nAn [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial alien]] lands on Earth near the (fictional) Slovak town \u010cabovce. The alien, which looks like a little girl, meets with a group of children from the town who name her Maika (Slovak spelling: Majka). They instantly know she is no normal person, since she repeatedly demonstrates her ability to levitate and even walk on water.\n\nAt first, her appearance and mannerisms invoke the [[uncanny valley]]; her skin appears wax-like and her speech is staccato. She is able to speak correct, if stilted, Slovak after plugging in the correct language module in the utility belt she is always wearing (at first she tried to address the children in German).\n\nMaika seems completely humorless and unfeeling, questioning even such simple expressions as what it means to \"like\" something. She says she came to Earth from the remote planet ''Gurun'' by means of the \"system\" ''Felix''. (The day she appeared, a strange aurora-like glow was seen over the nearby woods, and a peculiar mechanical voice speaking the word \"Felix\" intruded in local broadcasts. Just what Felix is, beyond its being Maika's means of transportation and possessing an intelligence of its own, is left unclear throughout. It may not be exactly what humans would understand as a \"ship\", though it is mentioned in the series that the day Maika appeared, [[Palomar Observatory]] noticed a small object moving with immense speed in Earth's vicinity.)\n\nMaika demonstrates extensive knowledge of encyclopedical facts about the human world, which she says have been derived from earthly radio broadcasts picked up by the Gurunians. At the same time, it becomes evident that the aliens have poor insight into human nature and even human anatomy. When the children try to hold a \"banquet\" in Maika's honor, she eats nothing, as she gets her energy from a gem-like \"stabilizer\" in her belt. Instead her eyes start to glow and twinkle as she transmits her view of the eating kids to Gurun, and the report curiously also intrudes on all TV sets in the area, complete with the narration of \"Felix\": The alien voice informs the Gurunians that the bodies of earthlings end in an upward projection called a \"head\", and that this \"head\" has several orifices, through one of which the earthlings absorb fuel. The fuel is however of extremely poor quality, requiring them to constantly refuel in ever-repeated rituals called \"breakfast\", \"lunch\" and \"dinner\".\n\nIt is thus implied that though Maika herself has human features including a head and a mouth, such anatomical features are in fact alien to the Gurunians, and Maika's current human-like body would be a mere imitation to facilitate contact with humans.\n\nOver the course of the series, Maika however develops a deeper understanding of people's emotions and behaviour, slowly getting acquainted with them through the help of her new friends, and in time she seems to experience genuine emotions herself. Her appearance also gets more human, her skin and hair becoming less wax-like (again indicating that her body is really an imitation, which she can fine-tune and improve as she gets to observe humans up close). Among her friends, she eventually stops talking in the staccato, robot-like voice she used at first, beginning to sound more like a normal human child. She also seems to develop an appreciation for the human concept of \"fun\", and uses her abilities to fly or to effortlessly replicate things as a source of entertainment and adventures for her friends.\n\nEventually the kids are no longer able to keep Maika hidden from the adults, nor does she herself try to be particularly discreet. After various demonstrations of her abilities, the local community accepts that she is indeed an alien, and she even participates in a press conference.\n\nAfter promiscuous use of the matter replicator during the press conference, Maika suddenly appears weak and indicates that the \"stabilizer\" in her belt needs to be replaced. Karol, the boy she has connected most closely with, helps her get to a glade in the woods where a stretch of scorched earth indicates the place Felix originally came down. Warned by Maika, Karol hides behind a rock as a blinding, pulsating light descends, and a new \"stabilizer\" lands in Maika's hand. Seconds later, Felix is gone, but Maika happily dances as she once again has all the energy she needs.\n\nWhile the publicity curiously does not seem to cause an instant world sensation, an unidentified foreign nation takes an interest in Maika, and their agents eventually attempt a kidnapping. Maika herself is rather cooperative, regarding the kidnapping as an opportunity for her to learn more about earth culture. However, once the kidnappers have her in their helicopter and try to take her out of the country, she uses her abilities to reverse the helicopter mid-air. The foreign agents are arrested by the authorities. (The Slovak authorities ''themselves'' appear altogether benign and are seemingly happy to leave Maika alone with her young friends, even after her demonstration of potentially world-changing alien technology during the press conference.)\n\nUsing her abilities to levitate objects and even people, Maika takes her friends on adventures as far as [[Bratislava]] and even [[Prague]], but it seems that this again depletes the \"stabilizer\" she derives her energy from. At the end of the penultimate episode, Maika is once again weak, and worst of all, she is now even unable to communicate with the \"system Felix\" so that she can get a replacement stabilizer.\n\nThe last episode is a race against time as Karol once more tries to bring Maika (seemingly dying) to the glade in the woods, but this time with no guarantee that Felix will even be there. Luckily one of the kids is a radio amateur that has earlier picked up the strange voice of the alien \"system\", and he finally manages to make contact and inform Felix of the plight of their ambassador. The intense, pulsating light once again descends on the woods, and Karol understands that this is goodbye. In his last moments with Maika, he declares his love for her. Maika herself sheds her first-ever tear, and promises Karol that she will return to him and \"the gang\".\n\nWith her departure, the series closes, though the kids are hopeful that in time, they will see their strange friend again.\n\nThe relatively happy ending of the TV series departs from the original book, which ended on a sad note as instead of going home, Maika dies.\n\n==Details==\nThe series was produced in 1978 by [[Czechoslovak Television]] [[Bratislava]] in [[Film Ateliers Gottwaldov]]. It consists of 13 parts, each lasting about 25 minutes. [[Radim Cvr\u010dek]] served as the director, the main child role (Maika) was played by Zuzana Prav\u0148ansk\u00e1. The music was composed by [[Harry Macourek]].\n\nThe format of the series vaguely gives the impression that it is a reconstruction of real events. The very first episode starts out in a rather didactic fashion: A seemingly learned man, who is later shown to be a doctor, directly addresses the camera and talks about the world-shaking events that have recently taken place; he adds a sense of realism by exactly pinpointing the location we are about to see as 49\u00b0 5\u2032 20\u2033 N, 19\u00b0 25\u2032 22\u2033 E. These geographical coordinates are repeated in many of the introductions to the following episodes, adding a flair of scientific exactitude. (In reality, the coordinates simply point to the wood-covered outskirts of a large field, hardly resembling the location seen in the series.)\n\nAfter Maika's departure, the series ends with two characters suddenly breaking the fourth wall and directly addressing the viewers. In light of Maika's promise that she will return, they tell viewers that if they ever come to the [[Tatra mountains]] and see a flying girl, that would be her.\n\n''Spadla z oblakov'' does contain a number of special effects, some of which have dated worse than others, but all would be good to excellent when considered by the standards of a 1978 TV production. Maika regularly flies, shows glowing eyes when she transmits what she sees to her home planet, and sometimes uses her automatic replicator which can copy material objects exactly (apparently down to molecular level). However, the series does not primarily rely on astonishing visual effects and keeps the storyline focused on understanding the human world from the point of view of a (non-human) child. At the same time, the human children try to figure out the visitor, whose mannerisms evolve from uncannily detached to almost perfectly human-like by the end of the series.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Zuzana Pravnansk\u00e1 as Majka \n* Matej Landl as Karol\n* Lubor Cajka as Sl\u00e1vo\n* Svetlana Majbov\u00e1 as Katka\n* Karol Pol\u00e1k as Dedi\u010d\n* [[Michal Such\u00e1nek (Czech actor)]] as Jurko\n* Pavel Lazar as Ferko\n* Roman Kudrna as Igor\n* J\u00e1n Kram\u00e1r as VB Kvasn\u00e1k\n* Milan Kis as Sl\u00e1vo's father, hotel doorman\n* [[Franti\u0161ek Zvar\u00edk]] as Valko, hotel manager\n* Peter Scholtz as Emil Hor\u00e1k\n* Emil Horv\u00e1th St. as teacher\n* Jozef Bedn\u00e1rik as Palo\n* V\u00e1clav Babka as doctor\n* M\u00e1ria H\u00e1jkov\u00e1 as grandmother\n\n== Parallels with ''E.T.'' ==\nThe 1978 series has numerous parallels with the popular 1982 movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. In both stories, a diminutive alien appears on Earth, but is initially only known to a group of children. In both, the alien is able to levitate things and flies with its newfound friends. In both, the kids initially try to hide the alien from the adults, but its existence is eventually revealed. In both, the alien eventually falls ill and desperately needs to contact its own people for them to pick it up. In both, radio contact is finally established by improvised means. In both, the story ends with a sad goodbye between the alien and the boy it has connected most closely with.\n\n== Name in other languages==\nThe series has been aired in several foreign countries (first in 1981 in Norway) under different names.\n\n* English: ''She Came Out of the Blue Sky\n* Russian: ''\u041f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044b\n* German: ''Sie kam aus dem All\n* Polish: ''Majka z Kosmosu/Spad\u0142a z ob\u0142ok\u00f3w\n* Cambodian: ''\u1798\u17c9\u17c3\u1780\u17b6 \u1780\u17bb\u1798\u17b6\u179a\u17b8\u1792\u17d2\u179b\u17b6\u1780\u17cb\u1796\u17b8\u179b\u17be\u1798\u17c1\u1783\n* Norwegian (Nynorsk): ''Majka \u2013 jenta fr\u00e5 verdsrommet\n* Vietnamese: ''Maika - C\u00f4 b\u00e9 t\u1eeb tr\u00ean tr\u1eddi r\u01a1i xu\u1ed1ng\n* Hungarian: ''Csillagok k\u00fcld\u00f6tte\n* Bulgarian: ''\u041f\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435\n* Spanish: ''Mayka, La Ni\u00f1a del Espacio\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0077083}}\n* [http://spadla.narod.ru/index_e.htm Website about the serial, contents, screenshots] (English and Russian, Russian translation of the book)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twdsb0JHFYI A YouTube video with opening song]\n\n[[Category:Slovak television series]]\n[[Category:1970s children's television series]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:1970s Czechoslovak television series]]\n[[Category:1978 Czechoslovak television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Fictional Slovak people]]\n", "name_user": "Jonesey95", "label": "safe", "comment": "FixLintererrors usingAutoEd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spadla_z_oblakov"}

Both parishes separated from St. James (established 1881), the first Anglican Church in Granville, as Vancouver was then known.<ref>Leslie Buck (2019), ''Peace be to the whole community: The story of St Paul's Anglican Church in the West End of Vancouver'', Vancouver: Second City Print Solutions, {{ISBN|978-1-77136-761-5}}.</ref>\n\n== Early history ==\n=== Church buildings ===\nThe first church building was located at the centre of the parish, but in 1898 it was placed on skids and moved north-west, away from railway yards in Yaletown and closer to where most parishioners lived in the West End.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 7</ref>  In 1905, it was replaced by a larger church, and the old church became the parish hall.[[File:St Paul's new and old churches 1905.jpg|thumb|The new church on the site of the old church with the old church re-located alongside to become the parish hall, 1905]]  \n\nThe new church had eighteen windows (not including clerestory windows), all except three glazed with leaded lights.  Stained glass was fitted in the east wall window (portraying St Paul preaching in Athens), the west wall window (St Peter with Dorcas doing good works), and the north transept wall (Faith, Hope and Charity).  Between 1952 and 1964, nine more windows were fitted with stained glass, all in some way portraying Christ.  Until 1952, the only portrayal of Christ in the church had been a print showing Jesus as a small boy.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 16.</ref>\n\nThe church pipe organ, Opus 264 by Casavant Fr\u00e8res of Qu\u00e9bec, is said to be the first to be constructed west of the Rockies.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 15.</ref>\n\nThe old church was replaced by a new parish hall and a rectory in 1911.  In 1929, the rectory was re-located to allow the hall to be extended.  By then, the site at the corner of Jervis Street and Pendrell Street had assumed its present configuration,<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 4.</ref> except for a wheelchair ramp added in 2002.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 36.</ref>\n\nMortgage costs associated with extending the parish hall were exacerbated by the mid-thirties depression. Optimism revived after the Second World War with the appointment of Godfrey Gower (1944 \u2013 1951) and the mortgage was ceremoniously burned in 1945.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church burns the mortgage, 1945.jpg|thumb|Godfrey Gower (centre) and parish officials burn the mortgage on the parish hall, 1945]]  \n\nGodfrey Gower resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster<ref>https://www.vancouver.anglican.ca/diocesan-profile/our-history, accessed 19 April 2020.</ref> and was succeeded by Patrick Ellis (1951 - 1960) and then Joe Ellis (1960 - 1973).  During the 1960s a plan to build a car park was frustrated by the City of Vancouver.  Instead, the parish built, and in 1973 opened, a high-rise apartment building for accommodating seniors at subsidised rents.<ref>Buck, op.cit, page 31.</ref>[[File:The Pendrellis entrance Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Entrance to The Pendrellis apartment building on Pendrell Street next to the church.]]  \n\n=== Parish activities ===\nThe first rector, Ernest Flewelling (1891 - 1894), was followed by Thomas Outerbridge and Henry Bowers, both briefly, and then by Harold Underhill (1896 - 1908).\n\nThe parish thrived, first under Adam de Pencier (1908 \u2013 1910), who resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster, then Frederick Chadwick (1910 - 1913) and then the seventh and lonest-serving reactor, Harold King (1914 - 1944), serving a large and relatively prosperous middle-class membership.  Rectors adopted a traditional Anglican Sunday liturgical pattern of Holy Communion, Morning Prayer and Evensong, and promoted well-supported educational and social activities like Ladies\u2019 and Men\u2019s Guilds, scouts and guides and youth groups.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church, Vancouver BC, 1959.jpg|thumb|Patrick Ellis (rector, 1951 - 1960) addresses the congregation at Morning Prayer, Christmas 1959]]  \n\nLiturgical practice tended to be conservative.  The introduction of a processional cross in 1931 was contentious,<ref>Parish Archives Folder D22/1.6, Minutes dated 20 April 1931.</ref> and even more so was the introduction of women into the choir in 1933.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 42.</ref> \n\n\n\n== Post-1980 changes ==\n\nAs the centennial of the parish approached the eleventh rector, Harold McSherry (1973 - 1984), retired.  In the search for his successor, a profile was prepared describing how the character of the West End of Vancouver had changed significantly since the parish had been established.<ref>Parish Archives, Folder D11/2.1.</ref>  The situation was summarised thus: \n\n<blockquote>\"In the 1950s, developers began pulling down the old family houses of the West End to make room for apartment buildings.  The composition of the population changed with the changes in residential housing and the population density increased to become one of the highest in Canada.  Old-style families were replaced by single-parent families, who were joined by previously unknown (or, at least, unrecognized) residents like gays and lesbians and unmarried couples living together.  For most of these persons St Paul\u2019s was perceived as irrelevant, if not invisible, and to some as passively or actively hostile.\" <ref>Buck, op.cit., page 50.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== New ministries ===\n\nIn 1985, David Crawley (1985\u20131990) was appointed rector.<ref>Crawley subsequently became Bishop of Kootenay (1990 - 2004) and then concurrently Archbishop of British Columbia and Yukon (1994 - 2004).</ref>  He set in process significant reforms of pastoral ministries and liturgical practices.  Foremost of all, he initiated a ministry to members of the LGBT community,<ref>David Crawley, \"A Parish Transformed\".  In Charles Hefling (Ed), \"Our Selves, Our Souls and Bodies\".  Cambridge, Mass: Cowley Publications.</ref> many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.  In reflecting upon this experience, Crawley later wrote: \"St Paul's had not so much found a mission as it had regained its soul\"<ref>Crawley, , op.cit., page 207.</ref>\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Crawley\u2019s successor, Neil Gray (1991\u20132003), set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  The result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion.\n\nIn 2004, the then assistant priest, Dale Yardy, officiated at the first Blessing of a Covenanted Union of a same-sex couple in St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 84.</ref> \n\nSt Paul's played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth-walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a 13-metre, full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.  Very soon, the number of individual visits to the labyrinth exceeded four thousand a year, mostly by persons who were not members of St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 14.</ref>[[File:St Paul's Labyrinth, Vancouver.jpg|thumb|The way into the Labyrinth]]  \n\nIn 1995, St Paul's Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 12.</ref>\n\n=== Liturgical developments ===\n\nAs parish ministries were evolving, so also were liturgical practices.

Both parishes separated from St. James (established 1881), the first Anglican Church in Granville, as Vancouver was then known.<ref>Leslie Buck (2019), ''Peace be to the whole community: The story of St Paul's Anglican Church in the West End of Vancouver'', Vancouver: Second City Print Solutions, {{ISBN|978-1-77136-761-5}}.</ref>\n\n== Early history ==\n=== Church buildings ===\nThe first church building was located at the centre of the parish, but in 1898 it was placed on skids and moved north-west, away from railway yards in Yaletown and closer to where most parishioners lived in the West End.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 7</ref>  In 1905, it was replaced by a larger church, and the old church became the parish hall.[[File:St Paul's new and old churches 1905.jpg|thumb|The new church on the site of the old church with the old church re-located alongside to become the parish hall, 1905]]  \n\nThe new church had eighteen windows (not including clerestory windows), all except three glazed with leaded lights.  Stained glass was fitted in the east wall window (portraying St Paul preaching in Athens), the west wall window (St Peter with Dorcas doing good works), and the north transept wall (Faith, Hope and Charity).  Between 1952 and 1964, nine more windows were fitted with stained glass, all in some way portraying Christ.  Until 1952, the only portrayal of Christ in the church had been a print showing Jesus as a small boy.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 16.</ref>\n\nThe church pipe organ, Opus 264 by Casavant Fr\u00e8res of Qu\u00e9bec, is said to be the first to be constructed west of the Rockies.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 15.</ref>\n\nThe old church was replaced by a new parish hall and a rectory in 1911.  In 1929, the rectory was re-located to allow the hall to be extended.  By then, the site at the corner of Jervis Street and Pendrell Street had assumed its present configuration,<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 4.</ref> except for a wheelchair ramp added in 2002.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 36.</ref>\n\nMortgage costs associated with extending the parish hall were exacerbated by the mid-thirties depression. Optimism revived after the Second World War with the appointment of Godfrey Gower (1944 \u2013 1951) and the mortgage was ceremoniously burned in 1945.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church burns the mortgage, 1945.jpg|thumb|Godfrey Gower (centre) and parish officials burn the mortgage on the parish hall, 1945]]  \n\nGodfrey Gower resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster<ref>https://www.vancouver.anglican.ca/diocesan-profile/our-history, accessed 19 April 2020.</ref> and was succeeded by Patrick Ellis (1951 - 1960) and then Joe Ellis (1960 - 1973).  During the 1960s a plan to build a car park was frustrated by the City of Vancouver.  Instead, the parish built, and in 1973 opened, a high-rise apartment building for accommodating seniors at subsidised rents.<ref>Buck, op.cit, page 31.</ref>[[File:The Pendrellis entrance Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Entrance to The Pendrellis apartment building, next to St Paul's Anglican Church on Pendrell Street]]  \n\n=== Parish activities ===\nThe first rector, Ernest Flewelling (1891 - 1894), was followed by Thomas Outerbridge and Henry Bowers, both briefly, and then by Harold Underhill (1896 - 1908).\n\nThe parish thrived, first under Adam de Pencier (1908 \u2013 1910), who resigned to become Bishop of New Westminster, then Frederick Chadwick (1910 - 1913) and then the seventh and lonest-serving reactor, Harold King (1914 - 1944), serving a large and relatively prosperous middle-class membership.  Rectors adopted a traditional Anglican Sunday liturgical pattern of Holy Communion, Morning Prayer and Evensong, and promoted well-supported educational and social activities like Ladies\u2019 and Men\u2019s Guilds, scouts and guides and youth groups.[[File:St Paul's Anglican Church, Vancouver BC, 1959.jpg|thumb|Patrick Ellis (rector, 1951 - 1960) addresses the congregation at Morning Prayer, Christmas 1959]]  \n\nLiturgical practice tended to be conservative.  The introduction of a processional cross in 1931 was contentious,<ref>Parish Archives Folder D22/1.6, Minutes dated 20 April 1931.</ref> and even more so was the introduction of women into the choir in 1933.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 42.</ref> \n\n\n\n== Post-1980 changes ==\n\nAs the centennial of the parish approached the eleventh rector, Harold McSherry (1973 - 1984), retired.  In the search for his successor, a profile was prepared describing how the character of the West End of Vancouver had changed significantly since the parish had been established.<ref>Parish Archives, Folder D11/2.1.</ref>  The situation was summarised thus: \n\n<blockquote>\"In the 1950s, developers began pulling down the old family houses of the West End to make room for apartment buildings.  The composition of the population changed with the changes in residential housing and the population density increased to become one of the highest in Canada.  Old-style families were replaced by single-parent families, who were joined by previously unknown (or, at least, unrecognized) residents like gays and lesbians and unmarried couples living together.  For most of these persons St Paul\u2019s was perceived as irrelevant, if not invisible, and to some as passively or actively hostile.\" <ref>Buck, op.cit., page 50.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== New ministries ===\n\nIn 1985, David Crawley (1985\u20131990) was appointed rector.<ref>Crawley subsequently became Bishop of Kootenay (1990 - 2004) and then concurrently Archbishop of British Columbia and Yukon (1994 - 2004).</ref>  He set in process significant reforms of pastoral ministries and liturgical practices.  Foremost of all, he initiated a ministry to members of the LGBT community,<ref>David Crawley, \"A Parish Transformed\".  In Charles Hefling (Ed), \"Our Selves, Our Souls and Bodies\".  Cambridge, Mass: Cowley Publications.</ref> many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.  In reflecting upon this experience, Crawley later wrote: \"St Paul's had not so much found a mission as it had regained its soul\"<ref>Crawley, , op.cit., page 207.</ref>\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Crawley\u2019s successor, Neil Gray (1991\u20132003), set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  The result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion.\n\nIn 2004, the then assistant priest, Dale Yardy, officiated at the first Blessing of a Covenanted Union of a same-sex couple in St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 84.</ref> \n\nSt Paul's played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth-walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a 13-metre, full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.  Very soon, the number of individual visits to the labyrinth exceeded four thousand a year, mostly by persons who were not members of St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 14.</ref>[[File:St Paul's Labyrinth, Vancouver.jpg|thumb|The way into the Labyrinth]]  \n\nIn 1995, St Paul's Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 12.</ref>\n\n=== Liturgical developments ===\n\nAs parish ministries were evolving, so also were liturgical practices.  At the principal Sunday morning service, the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer which was used for the last time in 1995.\n\nA contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used for the first time in 1981 and the Book of Common Prayer rite was used for the last time in 2014.\n\nGray's successor, Markus D\u00fcnzkofer (2004\u20132012), made regular use of a nave altar for celebrating Eucharist.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 58.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the then Bishop of New Westminster, David Somerville, ordained women as priests for the first time in the diocese.
