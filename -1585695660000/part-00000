Such progress was promoted by the availability of large series of clinical data provided by newly founded paediatric hospitals. A 2005 study examined the demographic and clinical features of patients with chorea admitted to the first British paediatric hospital (the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London]]) between 1852 and 1936. The seasonal and demographic characteristics of Sydenham's chorea during this time appear strikingly similar to those observed today, [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street hospital]] case notes provide detailed descriptions of the \"typical cases\" of Sydenham's chorea, and show that British physicians working in the early age of paediatric hospitals recognized the most distinctive clinical features of this condition.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author1=D Martino |author2=A Tanner |author3=G Defazio |author4=A J Church |author5=K P Bhatia |author6=G Giovannoni |author7=R C Dale |title=Tracing Sydenham's chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease in Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507\u2013511 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15851434|doi= 10.1136/adc.2004.057679|url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full |pmc=1720385}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century the term \"[[chorea]]\" referred to an ill-defined spectrum of [[hyperkinesia]]s, including those recognised today as chorea, [[tic]]s, [[dystonia]], or [[myoclonus]]. [[William Osler]] stated, \"In the whole range of medical terminology there is no such [[olla podrida]] as Chorea, which for a century has served as a sort of nosological pot into which authors have cast indiscriminately affections characterised by irregular, purposeless movements.\"<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nSydenham's chorea, a frequent cause of paediatric acute chorea, is a major manifestation of rheumatic fever. The association of chorea with rheumatism was first reported in 1802, and confirmed in the following decades by several French and English authors.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/> The inclusion of chorea under the rheumatic umbrella helped discriminate Sydenham's chorea from other \"choreic\" syndromes. The incidence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease is not declining. Recent figures quote the incidence of Acute Rheumatic Fever as 0.6\u20130.7/1,000 population in the United States and Japan compared with 15\u201321/1,000 population in Asia and Africa.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The prevalence of Acute Rheumatic Fever and Sydenham's Chorea has declined progressively in developed countries over the last decades.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nausieda PA, Grossman BJ, Koller WC, etal | year = 1980 | title = Sydenham's Chorea:An update | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 331\u2013334 | doi=10.1212/wnl.30.3.331| pmid = 7189038 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eshel E, Lahat E, Azizi E, etal | year = 1993 | title = Chorea as a manifestation of rheumatic fever-a 30-year survey | doi = 10.1007/bf01955239 | pmid = 8404967 | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 152 | issue = 8| pages = 645\u2013646 }}</ref> Physicians working in early children's hospitals recognised new clinical syndromes through the definition of \"typical clinical cases\". Complex multi-systemic diseases, such as rheumatic fever, were categorised only after the observation of large, hospital based series. Therefore, paediatric hospitals gradually became an important setting for the application of a modern \"statistical averaging\" technique to paediatric syndromes. Historical authorities in paediatrics, such as [[Walter Butler Cheadle]] and [[Octavius Sturges]], worked at London's Hospital for Sick Children, and their clinical notes help elucidate how the typical case of Sydenham's chorea was defined.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nBetween 1860 and 1900 the proportion of choreic patients ranged between 5% and 7% of the total number of patients admitted (mean per year, 1003), whereas from 1900 to 1936 it was constantly below 4% (mean per year). Chorea was the fourth most frequent cause of admission between 1860 and 1900, and in the 1880s temporarily became the second most frequent diagnosis among inpatients. Contemporary articles report a homogeneous distribution of paediatric chorea all over [[England]] However, since many choreic children were \"cured\" at home, the hospital based rates probably underestimate the incidence of chorea in the general paediatric population.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nA higher number of cases were admitted during the colder months, consistent with the reference epidemiological report on chorea at the end of the century. In the 1950s and 1960s the highest frequency of chorea was recorded during the winter months in several Northern and Central European countries. The incidence of rheumatism among Great Ormond Street Hospital inpatients peaked in October, preceding chorea by approximately two months. This is consistent with the current knowledge that most of the rheumatic fever symptoms appear about 10 days after the streptococcal infection, whereas Sydenham's chorea occurs typically 2\u20133 months after infection.\n\nMore than 80% of choreic patients were aged between 7 and 11 years (mean 9.2). Due to a referral bias, this age may be falsely low. Indeed, the British Medical Association (1887) reported the peak age between 11 and 15 years. In the present series, the female:male ratio was 2.7, in accordance with the general choreic population of Britain towards the end of the 1800s. In children below age 7, the female preponderance is less manifest. This was observed also by [[Charles West (physician)|Charles West]] (founder physician of Great Ormond Street Hospital), and subsequently by Osler, who stated that \"the second hemi-decade contains the greatest number of cases in males, and the third the greatest number in females\". In the majority of the 20th century studies, female preponderance is evident only in children over 10 years of age. These observations suggest a role for [[Estrogen|oestrogen]] in Sydenham's chorea expression. Supporting this view, oral [[contraceptives]] and pregnancy can cause relapses of disease.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nTen percent of the 1,548 patients whose records were researched for the British study were subsequently admitted with a relapse of chorea. Given that relapse admissions had a negative impact on the hospital cure rate, this rate might underestimate the actual relapse incidence in the general population of patients.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nIt is named after British physician [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624\u20131689).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker K, Lawrenson J, Wilmshurst JM | year = 2006 | title = Sydenham's Chorea-clinical and therapeutic update 320 years down the line | url = | journal = South African Medical Journal | volume = 96 | issue = 9| pages = 906\u2013912 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2226.html |title=Sydenham's chorea |publisher=Whonamedit |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The alternate eponym, \"Saint Vitus Dance\", is in reference to [[Vitus|Saint Vitus]], a Christian saint who was persecuted by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperors and died as a martyr in AD 303.

Such progress was promoted by the availability of large series of clinical data provided by newly founded paediatric hospitals. A 2005 study examined the demographic and clinical features of patients with chorea admitted to the first British paediatric hospital (the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London]]) between 1852 and 1936. The seasonal and demographic characteristics of Sydenham's chorea during this time appear strikingly similar to those observed today, [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street hospital]] case notes provide detailed descriptions of the \"typical cases\" of Sydenham's chorea, and show that British physicians working in the early age of paediatric hospitals recognized the most distinctive clinical features of this condition.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author1=D Martino |author2=A Tanner |author3=G Defazio |author4=A J Church |author5=K P Bhatia |author6=G Giovannoni |author7=R C Dale |title=Tracing Sydenham's chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease in Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507\u2013511 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15851434|doi= 10.1136/adc.2004.057679|url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full |pmc=1720385}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century the term \"[[chorea]]\" referred to an ill-defined spectrum of [[hyperkinesia]]s, including those recognised today as chorea, [[tic]]s, [[dystonia]], or [[myoclonus]]. [[William Osler]] stated, \"In the whole range of medical terminology there is no such [[olla podrida]] as Chorea, which for a century has served as a sort of nosological pot into which authors have cast indiscriminately affections characterised by irregular, purposeless movements.\"<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nSydenham's chorea, a frequent cause of paediatric acute chorea, is a major manifestation of rheumatic fever. The association of chorea with rheumatism was first reported in 1802, and confirmed in the following decades by several French and English authors.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/> The inclusion of chorea under the rheumatic umbrella helped discriminate Sydenham's chorea from other \"choreic\" syndromes. The incidence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease is not declining. Recent figures quote the incidence of Acute Rheumatic Fever as 0.6\u20130.7/1,000 population in the United States and Japan compared with 15\u201321/1,000 population in Asia and Africa.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The prevalence of Acute Rheumatic Fever and Sydenham's Chorea has declined progressively in developed countries over the last decades.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nausieda PA, Grossman BJ, Koller WC, etal | year = 1980 | title = Sydenham's Chorea:An update | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 331\u2013334 | doi=10.1212/wnl.30.3.331| pmid = 7189038 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eshel E, Lahat E, Azizi E, etal | year = 1993 | title = Chorea as a manifestation of rheumatic fever-a 30-year survey | doi = 10.1007/bf01955239 | pmid = 8404967 | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 152 | issue = 8| pages = 645\u2013646 }}</ref> Physicians working in early children's hospitals recognised new clinical syndromes through the definition of \"typical clinical cases\". Complex multi-systemic diseases, such as rheumatic fever, were categorised only after the observation of large, hospital based series. Therefore, paediatric hospitals gradually became an important setting for the application of a modern \"statistical averaging\" technique to paediatric syndromes. Historical authorities in paediatrics, such as [[Walter Butler Cheadle]] and [[Octavius Sturges]], worked at London's Hospital for Sick Children, and their clinical notes help elucidate how the typical case of Sydenham's chorea was defined.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nBetween 1860 and 1900 the proportion of choreic patients ranged between 5% and 7% of the total number of patients admitted (mean per year, 1003), whereas from 1900 to 1936 it was constantly below 4% (mean per year). Chorea was the fourth most frequent cause of admission between 1860 and 1900, and in the 1880s temporarily became the second most frequent diagnosis among inpatients. Contemporary articles report a homogeneous distribution of paediatric chorea all over [[England]] However, since many choreic children were \"cured\" at home, the hospital based rates probably underestimate the incidence of chorea in the general paediatric population.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nA higher number of cases were admitted during the colder months, consistent with the reference epidemiological report on chorea at the end of the century. In the 1950s and 1960s the highest frequency of chorea was recorded during the winter months in several Northern and Central European countries. The incidence of rheumatism among Great Ormond Street Hospital inpatients peaked in October, preceding chorea by approximately two months. This is consistent with the current knowledge that most of the rheumatic fever symptoms appear about 10 days after the streptococcal infection, whereas Sydenham's chorea occurs typically 2\u20133 months after infection.\n\nMore than 80% of choreic patients were aged between 7 and 11 years (mean 9.2). Due to a referral bias, this age may be falsely low. Indeed, the British Medical Association (1887) reported the peak age between 11 and 15 years. In the present series, the female:male ratio was 2.7, in accordance with the general choreic population of Britain towards the end of the 1800s. In children below age 7, the female preponderance is less manifest. This was observed also by [[Charles West (physician)|Charles West]] (founder physician of Great Ormond Street Hospital), and subsequently by Osler, who stated that \"the second hemi-decade contains the greatest number of cases in males, and the third the greatest number in females\". In the majority of the 20th century studies, female preponderance is evident only in children over 10 years of age. These observations suggest a role for [[Estrogen|oestrogen]] in Sydenham's chorea expression. Supporting this view, oral [[contraceptives]] and pregnancy can cause relapses of disease.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nTen percent of the 1,548 patients whose records were researched for the British study were subsequently admitted with a relapse of chorea. Given that relapse admissions had a negative impact on the hospital cure rate, this rate might underestimate the actual relapse incidence in the general population of patients.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nIt is named after British physician [[Thomas Sydenham]] (1624\u20131689).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker K, Lawrenson J, Wilmshurst JM | year = 2006 | title = Sydenham's Chorea-clinical and therapeutic update 320 years down the line | url = | journal = South African Medical Journal | volume = 96 | issue = 9| pages = 906\u2013912 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2226.html |title=Sydenham's chorea |publisher=Whonamedit |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}</ref> The alternate eponym, \"Saint Vitus Dance\", is in reference to [[Vitus|Saint Vitus]], a Christian saint who was persecuted by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperors and died as a martyr in AD 303.

There is robust evidence that the genetic variants associated with the three most common subtypes (LQT1, LQT2 and LQT3) are truly causative of the syndrome. However, there is uncertainty as to whether some of the other rarer subtypes are truly disease-causing by themselves or instead make individuals more susceptible to QT prolongation in response to other factors such as [[Drug-induced QT prolongation|medication]] or low blood potassium levels ([[Hypokalemia|hypokalaemia]]).<ref name=\"Giudicessi 2018\" />\n\n=== LQT1 ===\nLQT1 is the most common subtype of Romano\u2013Ward syndrome, responsible for 30 to 35% of all cases.<ref name=\"Bohnen 2017\" />  The gene responsible, ''KCNQ1,'' has been isolated to [[chromosome 11]]p15.5 and encodes the alpha subunit of the [[KvLQT1]] potassium channel.  This subunit interacts with other proteins (in particular, the minK beta subunit) to create the channel, which carries the delayed potassium rectifier current ''I''<sub>Ks</sub> responsible for the repolarisation phase of the [[cardiac action potential]].<ref name=\"Bohnen 2017\" />\n\nVariants in ''KCNQ1'' cause the LQT1 subtype of Romano\u2013Ward syndrome when a single copy of the variant is inherited (heterozygous, autosomal dominant inheritance). When two copies of the variant are inherited (homozygous, autosomal recessive inheritance) the more severe Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is found, associated with more marked QT prolongation, congenital sensorineural deafness, and a greater risk of arrhythmias.<ref name=\"Bohnen 2017\" />\n\nLQT1 is associated with a high risk of faints but lower risk of sudden death than LQT2.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nLQT1 may also affect glucose regulation. After ingesting glucose, those with LQT1 produce more insulin than would be expected, which is followed by a period of insulin resistance.

There is robust evidence that the genetic variants associated with the three most common subtypes (LQT1, LQT2 and LQT3) are truly causative of the syndrome. However, there is uncertainty as to whether some of the other rarer subtypes are truly disease-causing by themselves or instead make individuals more susceptible to QT prolongation in response to other factors such as [[Drug-induced QT prolongation|medication]] or low blood potassium levels ([[Hypokalemia|hypokalaemia]]).<ref name=\"Giudicessi 2018\" />\n\n=== LQT1 ===\nLQT1 is the most common subtype of Romano\u2013Ward syndrome, responsible for 30 to 35% of all cases.<ref name=\"Bohnen 2017\" />  The gene responsible, ''KCNQ1,'' has been isolated to [[chromosome 11]]p15.5 and encodes the alpha subunit of the [[KvLQT1]] potassium channel.  This subunit interacts with other proteins (in particular, the minK beta subunit) to create the channel, which carries the delayed potassium rectifier current ''I''<sub>Ks</sub> responsible for the repolarisation phase of the [[cardiac action potential]].<ref name=\"Bohnen 2017\" />\n\nVariants in ''KCNQ1'' cause the LQT1 subtype of Romano\u2013Ward syndrome when a single copy of the variant is inherited (heterozygous, autosomal dominant inheritance). When two copies of the variant are inherited (homozygous, autosomal recessive inheritance) the more severe Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is found, associated with more marked QT prolongation, congenital sensorineural deafness, and a greater risk of arrhythmias.<ref name=\"Bohnen 2017\" />\n\nLQT1 is associated with a high risk of faints but lower risk of sudden death than LQT2.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nLQT1 may also affect glucose regulation.

Furthermore, mutations in ''SCN5A'' can cause [[Brugada syndrome]], cardiac conduction disease, and [[dilated cardiomyopathy]]. In rare situations, some affected individuals can have combinations of these diseases.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== Other subtypes ===\nLQT5 is caused by variants in the ''KCNE1'' gene.

FAS.org, 14 April 2000.</ref> Conceived for modern [[Armoured warfare|armored ground warfare]] and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 [[short ton]]s (almost 62 [[metric ton]]s), it introduced several innovative features, including a [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine|turbine engine]], sophisticated [[Chobham armour|Chobham]] [[composite armor]], a computer fire control system, separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment, and [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection for crew safety. Initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]] gun, while later variants feature a licensed [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44]].\n\nIt is terrible because it says so on Wikipedia, therefore it's fact.\n\nThe M1 Abrams was developed from the failure of the [[MBT-70]] project to replace the obsolescent [[M60 Patton]], because it is poorly designed. There are three main operational Abrams versions, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament, protection, and electronics. Efforts to develop an M1A3 version were first publicly disclosed in 2009.<ref name=\"Armylooking2009\" />{{update after|2019|6|17}} Extensive improvements have been implemented to the latest M1A2C and D (formerly designated M1A2 System Enhancement Package version 3 or SEPv3 and M1A2 SEPv4, respectively) versions such as improved [[composite armor]], better optics, digital systems and ammunition.<ref>{{citation |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |title=Inside the US Army's Lethal New M1A2 SEP v.3 Abrams Main Battle Tank |url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |work=[[The National Interest]] |date=2 June 2016 |access-date=18 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018190927/http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |archive-date=18 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The Abrams was due to be replaced by the [[Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles|Future Combat Systems XM1202]] but due to its cancellation, the U.S. military has opted to continue maintaining and operating the M1 series for the foreseeable future by upgrading with improved optics, armor and firepower.\n\nThe M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and currently serves as the main battle tank of the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The export version is used by the armies of [[Egyptian Army|Egypt]], [[Kuwaiti Army|Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabian Army|Saudi Arabia]], [[Australian Army|Australia]], and [[Iraqi Army|Iraq]]. The Abrams was first used in combat in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and has seen combat in both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]] under U.S. service, while Iraqi Abrams tanks have seen action in [[International military intervention against ISIL|the war against ISIL]] and have seen use by Saudi Arabia during the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemeni Civil War]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the M1 Abrams}}\n\n===Previous developments===\n{{main|MBT-70}}\n\nThrough the 1960s the US Army and German Army had collaborated on a single design that would replace both the [[M60 Patton]] and the [[Leopard 1]]. The overall goal was to have a single new design with improved firepower to handle new Soviet tanks like the [[T-62]], while providing improved protection against the T-62's new 115&nbsp;mm [[smoothbore]] gun and especially [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |title=Licht vom Mond |accessdate=2010-11-08 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022112816/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |archive-date=2012-10-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2019}} \n\nThe resulting design, the [[MBT-70]], incorporated new technologies across the board. A [[hydropneumatic suspension]] provided excellent cross-country ride quality and also allowed the entire tank to be raised or lowered by the driver, with the lowest position placing the top of the tank only {{convert|6|feet}} off the ground. New 1,500&nbsp;hp-class engines powered the designs which could both reach {{convert|43|mph}}, 50% faster than the T-62. Finally, two new guns were introduced, a US 152&nbsp;mm design whose primary long-range weapon was the [[MGM-51 Shillelagh|Shillelagh missile]], while the Germans introduced a new [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|120 mm smoothbore]] design.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\"/>\n\nWhile the design was highly capable, its weight continued to grow, as did its budget.

After several rounds of input, the decision was made to offer maximum armor to defeat the \"heavy threat\". Heavy in this context considered the 115&nbsp;mm gun of the T-62 using projected improvements of their [[APFSDS]] ammunition through the 1980s, or the new 125&nbsp;mm gun of the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]] firing [[high-explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nTo this end, a new design basis emerged in February 1973, LK 10372. It had to defeat any hit from a Soviet gun within 800 meters and 30 degrees to either side. The tank would be armed with the 105&nbsp;mm M68 gun, a licensed version of the [[Royal Ordnance L7]], along with a coaxial 20&nbsp;mm version of the [[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nExamining the experiences of the [[Yom Kippur War]] that year, a number of design changes were made. The newly-created [[Chobham armour|\"Burlington\" armor]] from the [[British Army]]'s labs was incorporated to improve protection, especially against HEAT, and to incorporate the new armor package, the original goal of keeping weight under {{convert|50|ST}} was abandoned. The Bushmaster was seen as superfluous and was replaced with a [[M240 machine gun]], the US version of the [[FN MAG]]. As TACOM continued to improve the detailed design, initial samples of the armor system were sent to the [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] for testing.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nAt the time, the US military's procurement system was beset with problems being caused by the desire to have the best possible design. This often resulted in the programs being canceled due to cost overruns, leaving the forces with outdated systems, as was the case with the MBT-70. There was a strong movement within the Army to get a new design within budget to prevent the MBT-70 experience from repeating itself. For the new design, the Army stated the unit cost was to be no more than $507,000 in 1972 dollars ({{inflation|US|507000|1972|fmt=eq}}) and gave the contract out to the industry. Chrysler and GM entered bids.<ref name=bail>{{cite newspaper |newspaper= Washington Monthly |date=1987  |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+first+Chrysler+bail-out%3b+the+M-1+tank.-a04696991 |title= The First Chrysler Bail-Out: The M-1 Tank}}</ref>\n\n===More changes===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2019}}\nThrough the period while the initial prototypes were being  built, a debate broke out between Germany and US about the use of the 105&nbsp;mm gun. The Army was planning on introducing several new types of ammunition for the 105 that would greatly improve its performance, notably, the XM-774 using [[depleted uranium]]. These rounds would give it the performance needed to defeat any Soviet tank with ease. There was some concern that depleted uranium would not be allowed in Germany, perhaps just in peacetime, so improvements to the tungsten cored M735 were also considered.\n\nThrough this same period, there was an ongoing effort to improve [[NATO]] logistics by standardizing ammunition to the maximum possible degree. The Germans were moving ahead with their 120&nbsp;mm gun on the Leopard 2K, and noted that the British had also introduced a 120&nbsp;mm gun of their own in keeping with their long-range combat doctrine. Although initially skeptical of the need for a 120&nbsp;mm gun, at some point the issue was raised that the Soviets might introduce a tank with composite armor. In this case, the 120 would give them the performance needed to defeat such a development even without depleted uranium.\n\nBy 1977 the decision had been made to eventually move the new tank to a 120&nbsp;mm gun. After head-to-head testing between the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5]] and the [[Rheinmetall Rh-120]], the latter was chosen. The turret designs of the two prototypes were modified to allow either gun to be fitted.\n\n===Prototypes===\nPrototypes were delivered in 1976 by Chrysler Defense and [[General Motors]] (GM) armed with the license-built version of the 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]]. They entered head-to-head testing at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], along with a [[Leopard 2]] \"2K\" prototype for comparison. The testing showed that the GM design was generally superior, offering better armor protection, and better fire control and turret stabilization systems.<ref name=bail/>\n\nDuring testing, the power packs of both designs proved to have issues. The Chrysler design used a [[gas turbine]] engine from [[Lycoming Engines]], the [[Honeywell AGT1500|AGT1500]], which had extensive heat recovery systems in an attempt to improve its [[Fuel efficiency|fuel economy]] to something similar to a traditional [[internal combustion engine]]. This proved not to be the case; the engine consumed much more fuel than expected. The GM design used a new variable-compression Diesel design which proved to be problematic.<ref name=bail/> There is no evidence that GM considered using the [[MTU Friedrichshafen|MTU]] engine of the MBT-70, which outperformed both and had been chosen for the Leopard 2K.\n\nBy the spring of 1977, the decision to choose the GM design was largely complete. In addition to offering better overall performance, there were concerns about Chrysler's engine both from a reliability and fuel consumption standpoint. The GM program was also slightly cheaper overall at $208 million compared to $221 million for Chrysler. In July 1977, Lt. Colonel George Mohrmann prepared a stack of letters informing Congress of the decision to move ahead with the GM design. All that was required was the final sign-off by the [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]].<ref name=bail/>\n\n=== Chrysler is chosen ===\nOn 20 July, [[United States Secretary of the Army]] Martin Hoffman and a group of generals visited [[Deputy Defense Secretary]] [[Bill Clements]] and [[Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] Malcolm Currie on their decision. They were surprised when Clements and Currie criticized their decision and demanded the turbine be selected. Donald Rumsfeld heard arguments from both in the afternoon and asked for twenty-four hours to review the issues. The Army team spent the night writing briefs and presented them to Rumsfeld the next morning, who then announced a four-month delay.<ref name=bail/>\n\nWithin days, GM was asked to present a new design with a turbine engine. According to Assistant Secretary for Research and Development Ed Miller, \"It became increasingly clear that the only solution which would be acceptable to Clements and Currie was the turbine... It was a political decision that was reached, and for all intents and purposes that decision gave the award to Chrysler since they were the only contractor with a gas turbine.\"<ref name=bail/> However, the Chrysler design had the advantage that the entire power pack had room to be replaced by any number of engine designs, including a Diesel if needed.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nThe turbine engine does not appear to be the only reason for this decision. Chrysler was the only company that appeared to be seriously interested in tank development; the M60 had been lucrative for the company and relied on that program for much of its profit. In contrast, GM made only about 1% of its income from military sales, compared to 5% for Chrysler, and only submitted their bid after a \"special plea\" from the Pentagon.<ref name=bail/>\n\nOn 12 November 1976, the Defense Department awarded a $20 billion development contract to Chrysler.<ref name=bail/>\n\n===Production starts===\nLow initial rate production (LIRP) of the vehicle was approved on 7 May 1979.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book |title=Abrams: A History of the American Main Battle Tank |last=Hunnicutt |first=R.P. |publisher=Presidio |year=1990 |isbn=9780891413882 |pages=202}}</ref> In February 1982, [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] Division (GDLS) purchased Chrysler Defense, after Chrysler built over 1,000 M1s.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Dynamics buys Chrysler tank division|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/general-dynamics-buys-chrysler-tank-division.html|publisher=New York Times, 20 February 1982 |accessdate=3 April 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403195514/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/20/business/general-dynamics-buys-chrysler-tank-division.html |archivedate=3 April 2017 }}</ref> The M1 Abrams was the first vehicle to adopt [[Chobham armor]].\n\n[[File:105mm cannon on an M1 Abrams tank, 1986.png|thumb|left|105 mm M1 Abrams tank of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment at Grafenw\u00f6hr Training Area in Germany, 1986]]\nA total of 3,273 M1 Abrams tanks were produced during 1979\u20131985 and first entered U.S. Army service in 1980.

Some units painted their M1s with the older Mobility Equipment Research and Design Command (MERDC) 4-color paint scheme but the turn-in requirements for these tanks required repainting them to overall forest green. Therefore, even though a large number of the base model M1s were camouflaged in the field, few or none exist today.\n\nM1A1s came from the factory with the NATO three color camouflage Black/Med-Green/Dark-Brown [[Chemical Agent Resistant Coating]] (CARC) paint jobs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Today M1A1s are given the NATO three color paint job during rebuilds. M1s and M1A1s deployed to [[Operation Desert Storm]] were hastily painted [[desert tan]]. Some, but not all, of these tanks were re-painted to their \"authorized\" paint scheme. M1A2s built for Middle Eastern countries were painted in desert tan. Replacement parts (roadwheels, armor skirt panels, drive sprockets, etc.) are painted olive green, which can sometimes lead to vehicles with a patchwork of green and desert tan parts.\n\nAustralian M1A1s were desert tan when delivered but have undergone a transition to the Australian Army vehicle standard 'Disruptive Pattern Camouflage'; a scheme that consists of black, olive drab, and brown.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Miller |url=http://www.mheaust.com.au/Aust/Research/Abrams.htm |title=Australian Military Vehicles Research -Disruptive Pattern Camouflage for the Australian Abrams M1A1 AIM SA (as at 2010) |publisher=Mheaust.com.au |accessdate=28 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110249/http://www.mheaust.com.au/Aust/Research/Abrams.htm |archivedate=6 July 2011 }}{{self-published source|date=July 2011}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=July 2011}}<ref>{{cite web |author=Australian Government, Department of Defence |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2010/may/20100513/index.htm |title=Exercise Chong Ju \u2013 Desert tan vs Auscam Abrams |publisher=Defence.gov.au |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120729121247/http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2010/may/20100513/index.htm |archivedate=29 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army can equip its Abrams tanks with the Saab Barracuda [[Multi-spectral camouflage|camouflage system]], which provides concealment against visual, infrared, thermal infrared, and broad-band radar detection.<ref>[http://armyrecognition.com/june_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/u.s._army_orders_saab_barracuda_camouflage_solutions_31206152.html U.S. Army Orders Saab Barracuda Camouflage Solutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615013237/http://www.armyrecognition.com/june_2015_global_defense_security_news_uk/u.s._army_orders_saab_barracuda_camouflage_solutions_31206152.html |date=15 June 2015}} \u2013 Armyrecognition.com, 12 June 2015</ref>\n\n====Concealment====\nThe turret is fitted with two six-barreled [[M250 grenade launcher|M250]] [[smoke grenade]] launchers (USMC M1A1s use an eight-barreled version), with one on each side.

HEAT and sabot rounds will make it through the beginning layers of armor but won't make it to the crew compartment. Ceramics have an ability to absorb a lot of heat, and take physical blows. The remaining hot gasses and metal shrapnel spread out or settle in empty air pockets. Both contractors reevaluated their proposed armor configurations based upon the newly obtained data. This led to major changes in the General Motors XM1. The most prominent of which is the turret front changing from vertical to sloped armor. The Chrysler XM1 on the other hand retained its basic shape although a number of changes were made. The Ballistic Research Laboratory had to develop new armor combinations in order to accommodate the changes made by the contractors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunnicutt|first1=R.P.|title=Abrams: A History of the American MBT|date=1990|publisher=Presidio|page=178}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to most other main battle tanks, the M1 Abrams feature composite armor only on the frontal aspect of the hull. However, the Abrams' turret features composite armoring across both the front and the sides. In addition, the side skirts of the frontal half of the hull are also made of composite, providing superior ballistic protection against chemical energy munitions such as HEAT rounds. The composition of the Abrams' composite armor consists of sandwiched plates of non-explosive [[reactive armor]] (NERA) between conventional steel plates. The NERA plates feature elasticity, allowing them to flex and distort upon perforation, disrupting the penetrating jets of shaped charges and providing more material and space for a kinetic round to pass through, thus providing increased protection compared to conventional steel armor of similar weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://below-the-turret-ring.blogspot.com/2017/01/early-m1-abrams-composite-armor.html|title=Below The Turret Ring: Early M1 Abrams composite armor|last=M.m|date=18 January 2017|website=Below The Turret Ring|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409002252/https://below-the-turret-ring.blogspot.com/2017/01/early-m1-abrams-composite-armor.html|archive-date=9 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFor the base model M1 Abrams, [[Steven Zaloga|Steven J.

A tank's front armor is much stronger than that on the sides, top, or rear. In an urban environment, attacks can come from any direction, and attackers can get close enough to reliably hit weak points in the tank's armor or gain sufficient elevation to hit the top armor.\n\nArmor upgrades include [[reactive armor]] on the sides of the tank and [[Cage armor|slat armor]] (similar to that on the [[Stryker]]) on the rear to protect against [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and other shaped charge warheads. A [[Transparent Armor Gun Shield]] and a thermal sight system are added to the loader's top-mounted M240B 7.62&nbsp;mm machine gun, and a [[Kongsberg Gruppen]] Remote Weapon Turret carrying a 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun (again similar to that used on the Stryker) is in place of the tank commander's original 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun mount, wherein the commander had to expose himself to fire the weapon manually. An exterior [[telephone]] allows supporting infantry to communicate with the tank commander.\n\nThe TUSK system is a field-installable kit that allows tanks to be upgraded without needing to be recalled to a maintenance depot. While the reactive armor may not be needed in most situations, like those present in [[maneuver warfare]], items like the rear slat armor, loader's gun shield, infantry phone (which saw use on Marine Corps M1A1s as early as 2003), and Kongsberg Remote Weapons Station for the 12.7 mm (.50&nbsp;in) caliber machine gun will be added to the entire M1A2 fleet over time.\n\nOn 29 August 2006, General Dynamics Land Systems received a U.S. Army order for 505 Tank Urban Survivability Kits (TUSK) for Abrams main battle tanks supporting operations in Iraq, under a US$45&nbsp;million contract.

The later M1A2 variant had a 'flex' mount that required the tank commander to expose his or her upper torso in order to fire the weapon. In urban environments in Iraq, this was found to be unsafe. With the Common Remote Operated Weapons System ([[CROWS]]) add-on kit, an M2A1 .50 Caliber Machine gun, M240, or M249 SAW can be mounted on a CROWS remote weapons platform (similar to the [[Protector (RWS)|Protector M151]] remote weapon station used on the [[Stryker]] family of vehicles). Current variants of the Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) on the M1A2 have forgone this, instead adding transparent gun shields to the commander's weapon station.

These three components are determined using a [[laser rangefinder]], crosswind sensor, a [[pendulum]] static cant sensor, data concerning performance and flight characteristics of each specific type of round, tank-specific boresight alignment data, ammunition temperature, air temperature, barometric pressure, a muzzle reference system (MRS) that determines and compensates for barrel drop at the muzzle due to gravitational pull and barrel heating due to firing or sunlight, and target speed determined by tracking rate tachometers in the Gunner's or Commander's Controls Handles. All of these factors are computed into a ballistic solution and updated 30 times per second. The updated solution is displayed in the Gunner's or Tank Commander's field of view in the form of a reticle in both day and Thermal modes. The ballistic computer manipulates the turret and a complex arrangement of mirrors so that all one has to do is keep the reticle on the target and fire to achieve a hit. Proper lead and gun tube elevation are applied to the turret by the computer, greatly simplifying the job of the gunner.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:DA-SD-06-06814.jpg|thumb|left|2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment soldier, assisting in the critical job of \"boresighting\" the alignment of all the tank's sights to the center of the axis of the bore of the main gun on an M1A1 Abrams in [[Mosul, Iraq]] in January 2005.

The ballistic solution generated ensures a hit percentage greater than 95&nbsp;percent at nominal ranges.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Either the commander or gunner can fire the main gun. Additionally, the Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV) on the M1A2 can be used to locate targets and pass them on for the gunner to engage while the commander scans for new targets. In the event of a malfunction or damage to the primary sight system, the main and coaxial weapons can be manually aimed using a telescopic scope [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]] to the main gun known as the Gunner's Auxiliary Sight (GAS). The GAS has two interchangeable [[crosshair|reticles]]; one for High-explosive anti-tank warhead and MPAT (MultiPurpose AntiTank) rounds and one for APFSDS and STAFF (Smart Target-Activated Fire and Forget) ammunition. Turret traverse and main gun elevation can be accomplished with manual handles and cranks in the event of a Fire Control System or Hydraulic System failure. The commander's M2HB .50&nbsp;caliber machine gun on the M1 and M1A1 is aimed by a 3\u00d7 magnification sight incorporated into the Commander's Weapon Station (CWS), while the M1A2 uses either the machine gun's own [[iron sights]], or a remote aiming system such as the [[Common Remotely Operated Weapon System|CROWS]] system when used as part of the [[Tank Urban Survival Kit|TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit)]]. The loader's M240 machine gun is aimed either with the built-in iron sights or with a thermal scope mounted on the machine gun.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn late 2017, the 400 USMC M1A1 Abrams will be upgraded with better and longer-range sights on the Abrams integrated display and targeting system (AIDATS) replacing the black-and-white camera view with a color one and adding day/night thermal sights, simplified handling with a single set of controls, and a slew to cue button that repositions the turret with a single command. Preliminary testing showed the upgrades reduced target engagement time from six seconds to three by allowing the commander and gunner to work more closely and collaborate better on target acquisition.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ Abrams Tank Upgrades Will Give Marines \u2018Killer Edge\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824062936/http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ |date=24 August 2016}} \u2013 DoDBuzz.com, 23 August 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome Marines' M1A1 tanks: How an upgrade will help make them more lethal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827201232/https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome |date=27 August 2016}} \u2013 MarineCorpstimes.com, 26 August 2016</ref>\n\n===Mobility===\n\n====Tactical====\n[[File:AGT1500 engine and M1 tank.JPEG|thumb|Marines from 1st Tank Battalion load a [[Honeywell AGT1500]] multi-fuel turbine back into the tank at Camp Coyote, Kuwait, February 2003.]]\n\nThe M1 Abrams's [[powertrain]] consists of a [[Honeywell]] [[AGT-1500|AGT 1500]] (originally made by [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]]) [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine]] capable of {{convert|1500|shp|kW|sp=us}} at 3,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|3950|lb\u00b7ft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 1,000 rpm, and a six-speed (four forward, two reverse) [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] X-1100-3B Hydro-Kinetic [[automatic transmission]], giving it a governed top speed of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on paved roads, and {{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} cross-country.

The improved engine and tracks are not part of an Army upgrade program, but may be included in a near-term engineering change proposal (ECP) phase.<ref>[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/abrams-dieselization-project-a-modest-proposal/ Abrams Dieselization Project: A Modest Proposal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110185057/http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/abrams-dieselization-project-a-modest-proposal/ |date=10 November 2013}} \u2013 Defensemedianetwork.com, 5 November 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/abrams-dieselization-project-doing-the-math/ Abrams Dieselization Project: Doing the Math] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110185059/http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/abrams-dieselization-project-doing-the-math/ |date=10 November 2013}} \u2013 Defensemedianetwork.com, 7 November 2013</ref>\n\nUsing a high power density {{convert|330|cc|in3|abbr=on}} [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]] modified to use diesel and military grade jet fuel, the Army's [[United States Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center|TARDEC]] developed a {{convert|220|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Auxiliary Power Unit]] designed to fit into the M1 Abrams, replacing an existing battery pack that weighs about {{convert|500|lb|kg}}.

The Abrams can be carried by a [[C-5 Galaxy]] or a [[C-17 Globemaster III]]. The limited capacity (two combat-ready tanks in a C-5, one combat-ready tank in a C-17) caused serious logistical problems when deploying the tanks for the first Persian Gulf War, though there was enough time for 1,848 tanks to be transported by ship.\n\nMarines transport their [[Marine Air Ground Task Force]] (MAGTF)-attached Abrams tanks by combat ship. A ''[[Wasp class amphibious assault ship|Wasp]]''-class [[Landing Helicopter Dock]] (LHD) typically carries a platoon of 4 to 5 tanks attached to the deployed [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]], which are then amphibiously transported to shore by [[Landing Craft Air Cushion]] (LCAC) at 1 combat-ready tank per landing craft.\n\nThe Abrams is also transportable by truck, namely the [[Oshkosh M1070 heavy equipment transporter|M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporter]] (HET). The HET can operate on highways, secondary roads, and cross-country. The HET accommodates the four tank crew members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/wheeled/m1070.html |title=M1070 Heavy Equipment Transporter (HET) Fact File United States Army |publisher=Army.mil |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706020118/http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/wheeled/m1070.html |archivedate=6 July 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe first instance of the Abrams being airlifted directly into a battlefield occurred in October 1993.

FAS.org, 14 April 2000.</ref> Conceived for modern [[Armoured warfare|armored ground warfare]] and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 [[short ton]]s (almost 62 [[metric ton]]s), it introduced several innovative features, including a [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine|turbine engine]], sophisticated [[Chobham armour|Chobham]] [[composite armor]], a computer fire control system, separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment, and [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection for crew safety. Initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]] gun, while later variants feature a licensed [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44]].\n\nThe M1 Abrams was developed from the failure of the [[MBT-70]] project to replace the obsolescent [[M60 Patton]]. There are three main operational Abrams versions, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament, protection, and electronics. Efforts to develop an M1A3 version were first publicly disclosed in 2009.<ref name=\"Armylooking2009\" />{{update after|2019|6|17}} Extensive improvements have been implemented to the latest M1A2C and D (formerly designated M1A2 System Enhancement Package version 3 or SEPv3 and M1A2 SEPv4, respectively) versions such as improved [[composite armor]], better optics, digital systems and ammunition.<ref>{{citation |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |title=Inside the US Army's Lethal New M1A2 SEP v.3 Abrams Main Battle Tank |url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |work=[[The National Interest]] |date=2 June 2016 |access-date=18 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018190927/http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/inside-the-us-armys-lethal-new-m1a2-sep-v3-abrams-main-16445 |archive-date=18 October 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The Abrams was due to be replaced by the [[Future Combat Systems Manned Ground Vehicles|Future Combat Systems XM1202]] but due to its cancellation, the U.S. military has opted to continue maintaining and operating the M1 series for the foreseeable future by upgrading with improved optics, armor and firepower.\n\nThe M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and currently serves as the main battle tank of the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. The export version is used by the armies of [[Egyptian Army|Egypt]], [[Kuwaiti Army|Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabian Army|Saudi Arabia]], [[Australian Army|Australia]], and [[Iraqi Army|Iraq]]. The Abrams was first used in combat in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and has seen combat in both the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War]] under U.S. service, while Iraqi Abrams tanks have seen action in [[International military intervention against ISIL|the war against ISIL]] and have seen use by Saudi Arabia during the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemeni Civil War]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the M1 Abrams}}\n\n===Previous developments===\n{{main|MBT-70}}\n\nThrough the 1960s the US Army and German Army had collaborated on a single design that would replace both the [[M60 Patton]] and the [[Leopard 1]]. The overall goal was to have a single new design with improved firepower to handle new Soviet tanks like the [[T-62]], while providing improved protection against the T-62's new 115&nbsp;mm [[smoothbore]] gun and especially [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |title=Licht vom Mond |accessdate=2010-11-08 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022112816/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45464941.html |archive-date=2012-10-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2019}} \n\nThe resulting design, the [[MBT-70]], incorporated new technologies across the board. A [[hydropneumatic suspension]] provided excellent cross-country ride quality and also allowed the entire tank to be raised or lowered by the driver, with the lowest position placing the top of the tank only {{convert|6|feet}} off the ground. New 1,500&nbsp;hp-class engines powered the designs which could both reach {{convert|43|mph}}, 50% faster than the T-62. Finally, two new guns were introduced, a US 152&nbsp;mm design whose primary long-range weapon was the [[MGM-51 Shillelagh|Shillelagh missile]], while the Germans introduced a new [[Rheinmetall Rh-120|120 mm smoothbore]] design.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\"/>\n\nWhile the design was highly capable, its weight continued to grow, as did its budget. By 1969, the unit cost stood at five times the original estimates.<ref name=\"DerSpiegel\"/> In August 1969 the Senate halted funding of the program until the [[Government Accounting Office]] could undertake an audit of the program.<ref name=\"GAO Audit\">{{cite news |last1=Weaver Jr. |first1=Warren |title=Tank Fund Halted for a Cost Study |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/09/archives/tank-fund-halted-for-a-cost-study-senate-balks-the-pentagon-pending.html |accessdate=26 August 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=9 August 1969 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826113509/https://www.nytimes.com/1969/08/09/archives/tank-fund-halted-for-a-cost-study-senate-balks-the-pentagon-pending.html |archive-date=26 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Starting afresh===\nAs a result of the problems with the MBT-70, the U.S. Army introduced the XM803, using some technologies from the MBT-70 but removing some of the more troublesome features. This succeeded only in producing an expensive system with capabilities similar to the M60.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title=MBT-70 / XM803 |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823045247/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |archivedate=23 August 2010 }}</ref> Congress canceled the MBT-70 in November and XM803 December 1971, and redistributed the funds to the XM1 Abrams named after General [[Creighton Abrams]].\n\nThe [[Tank-automotive and Armaments Command]] (TACOM) began examining specific goals. After several rounds of input, the decision was made to offer maximum armor to defeat the \"heavy threat\". Heavy in this context considered the 115&nbsp;mm gun of the T-62 using projected improvements of their [[APFSDS]] ammunition through the 1980s, or the new 125&nbsp;mm gun of the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]] firing [[high-explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nTo this end, a new design basis emerged in February 1973, LK 10372. It had to defeat any hit from a Soviet gun within 800 meters and 30 degrees to either side. The tank would be armed with the 105&nbsp;mm M68 gun, a licensed version of the [[Royal Ordnance L7]], along with a coaxial 20&nbsp;mm version of the [[M242 Bushmaster|Bushmaster]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nExamining the experiences of the [[Yom Kippur War]] that year, a number of design changes were made. The newly-created [[Chobham armour|\"Burlington\" armor]] from the [[British Army]]'s labs was incorporated to improve protection, especially against HEAT, and to incorporate the new armor package, the original goal of keeping weight under {{convert|50|ST}} was abandoned. The Bushmaster was seen as superfluous and was replaced with a [[M240 machine gun]], the US version of the [[FN MAG]]. As TACOM continued to improve the detailed design, initial samples of the armor system were sent to the [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] for testing.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nAt the time, the US military's procurement system was beset with problems being caused by the desire to have the best possible design. This often resulted in the programs being canceled due to cost overruns, leaving the forces with outdated systems, as was the case with the MBT-70. There was a strong movement within the Army to get a new design within budget to prevent the MBT-70 experience from repeating itself. For the new design, the Army stated the unit cost was to be no more than $507,000 in 1972 dollars ({{inflation|US|507000|1972|fmt=eq}}) and gave the contract out to the industry. Chrysler and GM entered bids.<ref name=bail>{{cite newspaper |newspaper= Washington Monthly |date=1987  |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+first+Chrysler+bail-out%3b+the+M-1+tank.-a04696991 |title= The First Chrysler Bail-Out: The M-1 Tank}}</ref>\n\n===More changes===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2019}}\nThrough the period while the initial prototypes were being  built, a debate broke out between Germany and US about the use of the 105&nbsp;mm gun. The Army was planning on introducing several new types of ammunition for the 105 that would greatly improve its performance, notably, the XM-774 using [[depleted uranium]]. These rounds would give it the performance needed to defeat any Soviet tank with ease. There was some concern that depleted uranium would not be allowed in Germany, perhaps just in peacetime, so improvements to the tungsten cored M735 were also considered.\n\nThrough this same period, there was an ongoing effort to improve [[NATO]] logistics by standardizing ammunition to the maximum possible degree. The Germans were moving ahead with their 120&nbsp;mm gun on the Leopard 2K, and noted that the British had also introduced a 120&nbsp;mm gun of their own in keeping with their long-range combat doctrine. Although initially skeptical of the need for a 120&nbsp;mm gun, at some point the issue was raised that the Soviets might introduce a tank with composite armor. In this case, the 120 would give them the performance needed to defeat such a development even without depleted uranium.\n\nBy 1977 the decision had been made to eventually move the new tank to a 120&nbsp;mm gun. After head-to-head testing between the [[Royal Ordnance L11A5]] and the [[Rheinmetall Rh-120]], the latter was chosen. The turret designs of the two prototypes were modified to allow either gun to be fitted.\n\n===Prototypes===\nPrototypes were delivered in 1976 by Chrysler Defense and [[General Motors]] (GM) armed with the license-built version of the 105&nbsp;mm [[Royal Ordnance L7]]. They entered head-to-head testing at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], along with a [[Leopard 2]] \"2K\" prototype for comparison. The testing showed that the GM design was generally superior, offering better armor protection, and better fire control and turret stabilization systems.<ref name=bail/>\n\nDuring testing, the power packs of both designs proved to have issues. The Chrysler design used a [[gas turbine]] engine from [[Lycoming Engines]], the [[Honeywell AGT1500|AGT1500]], which had extensive heat recovery systems in an attempt to improve its [[Fuel efficiency|fuel economy]] to something similar to a traditional [[internal combustion engine]]. This proved not to be the case; the engine consumed much more fuel than expected. The GM design used a new variable-compression Diesel design which proved to be problematic.<ref name=bail/> There is no evidence that GM considered using the [[MTU Friedrichshafen|MTU]] engine of the MBT-70, which outperformed both and had been chosen for the Leopard 2K.\n\nBy the spring of 1977, the decision to choose the GM design was largely complete. In addition to offering better overall performance, there were concerns about Chrysler's engine both from a reliability and fuel consumption standpoint. The GM program was also slightly cheaper overall at $208 million compared to $221 million for Chrysler. In July 1977, Lt. Colonel George Mohrmann prepared a stack of letters informing Congress of the decision to move ahead with the GM design. All that was required was the final sign-off by the [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]].<ref name=bail/>\n\n=== Chrysler is chosen ===\nOn 20 July, [[United States Secretary of the Army]] Martin Hoffman and a group of generals visited [[Deputy Defense Secretary]] [[Bill Clements]] and [[Director of Defense Research and Engineering]] Malcolm Currie on their decision. They were surprised when Clements and Currie criticized their decision and demanded the turbine be selected. Donald Rumsfeld heard arguments from both in the afternoon and asked for twenty-four hours to review the issues. The Army team spent the night writing briefs and presented them to Rumsfeld the next morning, who then announced a four-month delay.<ref name=bail/>\n\nWithin days, GM was asked to present a new design with a turbine engine. According to Assistant Secretary for Research and Development Ed Miller, \"It became increasingly clear that the only solution which would be acceptable to Clements and Currie was the turbine... It was a political decision that was reached, and for all intents and purposes that decision gave the award to Chrysler since they were the only contractor with a gas turbine.\"<ref name=bail/> However, the Chrysler design had the advantage that the entire power pack had room to be replaced by any number of engine designs, including a Diesel if needed.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|2015}}\n\nThe turbine engine does not appear to be the only reason for this decision.

This led to major changes in the General Motors XM1. The most prominent of which is the turret front changing from vertical to sloped armor. The Chrysler XM1 on the other hand retained its basic shape although a number of changes were made. The Ballistic Research Laboratory had to develop new armor combinations in order to accommodate the changes made by the contractors.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunnicutt|first1=R.P.|title=Abrams: A History of the American MBT|date=1990|publisher=Presidio|page=178}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to most other main battle tanks, the M1 Abrams feature composite armor only on the frontal aspect of the hull.

The NERA plates feature elasticity, allowing them to flex and distort upon perforation, disrupting the penetrating jets of shaped charges and providing more material and space for a kinetic round to pass through, thus providing increased protection compared to conventional steel armor of similar weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://below-the-turret-ring.blogspot.com/2017/01/early-m1-abrams-composite-armor.html|title=Below The Turret Ring: Early M1 Abrams composite armor|last=M.m|date=18 January 2017|website=Below The Turret Ring|access-date=21 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409002252/https://below-the-turret-ring.blogspot.com/2017/01/early-m1-abrams-composite-armor.html|archive-date=9 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFor the base model M1 Abrams, [[Steven Zaloga|Steven J.

A tank's front armor is much stronger than that on the sides, top, or rear. In an urban environment, attacks can come from any direction, and attackers can get close enough to reliably hit weak points in the tank's armor or gain sufficient elevation to hit the top armor.\n\nArmor upgrades include [[reactive armor]] on the sides of the tank and [[Cage armor|slat armor]] (similar to that on the [[Stryker]]) on the rear to protect against [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s and other shaped charge warheads. A [[Transparent Armor Gun Shield]] and a thermal sight system are added to the loader's top-mounted M240B 7.62&nbsp;mm machine gun, and a [[Kongsberg Gruppen]] Remote Weapon Turret carrying a 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun (again similar to that used on the Stryker) is in place of the tank commander's original 12.7 mm (.50 in) caliber machine gun mount, wherein the commander had to expose himself to fire the weapon manually. An exterior [[telephone]] allows supporting infantry to communicate with the tank commander.\n\nThe TUSK system is a field-installable kit that allows tanks to be upgraded without needing to be recalled to a maintenance depot. While the reactive armor may not be needed in most situations, like those present in [[maneuver warfare]], items like the rear slat armor, loader's gun shield, infantry phone (which saw use on Marine Corps M1A1s as early as 2003), and Kongsberg Remote Weapons Station for the 12.7 mm (.50&nbsp;in) caliber machine gun will be added to the entire M1A2 fleet over time.\n\nOn 29 August 2006, General Dynamics Land Systems received a U.S. Army order for 505 Tank Urban Survivability Kits (TUSK) for Abrams main battle tanks supporting operations in Iraq, under a US$45&nbsp;million contract.

These three components are determined using a [[laser rangefinder]], crosswind sensor, a [[pendulum]] static cant sensor, data concerning performance and flight characteristics of each specific type of round, tank-specific boresight alignment data, ammunition temperature, air temperature, barometric pressure, a muzzle reference system (MRS) that determines and compensates for barrel drop at the muzzle due to gravitational pull and barrel heating due to firing or sunlight, and target speed determined by tracking rate tachometers in the Gunner's or Commander's Controls Handles. All of these factors are computed into a ballistic solution and updated 30 times per second. The updated solution is displayed in the Gunner's or Tank Commander's field of view in the form of a reticle in both day and Thermal modes. The ballistic computer manipulates the turret and a complex arrangement of mirrors so that all one has to do is keep the reticle on the target and fire to achieve a hit. Proper lead and gun tube elevation are applied to the turret by the computer, greatly simplifying the job of the gunner.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n[[File:DA-SD-06-06814.jpg|thumb|left|2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment soldier, assisting in the critical job of \"boresighting\" the alignment of all the tank's sights to the center of the axis of the bore of the main gun on an M1A1 Abrams in [[Mosul, Iraq]] in January 2005.

The ballistic solution generated ensures a hit percentage greater than 95&nbsp;percent at nominal ranges.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Either the commander or gunner can fire the main gun. Additionally, the Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CITV) on the M1A2 can be used to locate targets and pass them on for the gunner to engage while the commander scans for new targets. In the event of a malfunction or damage to the primary sight system, the main and coaxial weapons can be manually aimed using a telescopic scope [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]] to the main gun known as the Gunner's Auxiliary Sight (GAS). The GAS has two interchangeable [[crosshair|reticles]]; one for High-explosive anti-tank warhead and MPAT (MultiPurpose AntiTank) rounds and one for APFSDS and STAFF (Smart Target-Activated Fire and Forget) ammunition. Turret traverse and main gun elevation can be accomplished with manual handles and cranks in the event of a Fire Control System or Hydraulic System failure. The commander's M2HB .50&nbsp;caliber machine gun on the M1 and M1A1 is aimed by a 3\u00d7 magnification sight incorporated into the Commander's Weapon Station (CWS), while the M1A2 uses either the machine gun's own [[iron sights]], or a remote aiming system such as the [[Common Remotely Operated Weapon System|CROWS]] system when used as part of the [[Tank Urban Survival Kit|TUSK (Tank Urban Survival Kit)]]. The loader's M240 machine gun is aimed either with the built-in iron sights or with a thermal scope mounted on the machine gun.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn late 2017, the 400 USMC M1A1 Abrams will be upgraded with better and longer-range sights on the Abrams integrated display and targeting system (AIDATS) replacing the black-and-white camera view with a color one and adding day/night thermal sights, simplified handling with a single set of controls, and a slew to cue button that repositions the turret with a single command. Preliminary testing showed the upgrades reduced target engagement time from six seconds to three by allowing the commander and gunner to work more closely and collaborate better on target acquisition.<ref>[http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ Abrams Tank Upgrades Will Give Marines \u2018Killer Edge\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824062936/http://www.dodbuzz.com/2016/08/23/abrams-tank-upgrades-will-give-marines-killer-edge/ |date=24 August 2016}} \u2013 DoDBuzz.com, 23 August 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome Marines' M1A1 tanks: How an upgrade will help make them more lethal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827201232/https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/articles/marines-m1a1-tanks-are-about-to-get-even-more-awesome |date=27 August 2016}} \u2013 MarineCorpstimes.com, 26 August 2016</ref>\n\n===Mobility===\n\n====Tactical====\n[[File:AGT1500 engine and M1 tank.JPEG|thumb|Marines from 1st Tank Battalion load a [[Honeywell AGT1500]] multi-fuel turbine back into the tank at Camp Coyote, Kuwait, February 2003.]]\n\nThe M1 Abrams's [[powertrain]] consists of a [[Honeywell]] [[AGT-1500|AGT 1500]] (originally made by [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming]]) [[multifuel]] [[gas turbine]] capable of {{convert|1500|shp|kW|sp=us}} at 3,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and {{convert|3950|lb\u00b7ft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 1,000 rpm, and a six-speed (four forward, two reverse) [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] X-1100-3B Hydro-Kinetic [[automatic transmission]], giving it a governed top speed of {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on paved roads, and {{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} cross-country.

By 2008, online learning programs were available in the United States in 44 states at the K-12 level.<ref>Olszewski-Kubilius, Paula; Corwith, Susan. \"Distance Education: Where It Started and Where It Stands for Gifted Children and Their Educators.\" Gifted Child Today, v. 34 issue 3, 2011, p. 16-24,.</ref>\n\n[[Internet forum]]s, online [[discussion group]] and [[online learning community]] can contribute to an efficacious distance education experience. Research shows that [[socialization]] plays an important role in some forms of distance education.<ref name=\"SRE4(13)2\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.09.199 |title=Alleviating the Senses of Isolation and Alienation in the Virtual World: Socialization in Distance Education |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |volume=93 |pages=332\u20137 |year=2013 |last1=Sazmandasfaranjan |first1=Yasha |last2=Shirzad |first2=Farzad |last3=Baradari |first3=Fatemeh |last4=Salimi |first4=Meysam |last5=Salehi |first5=Mehrdad }}</ref>\n\nE-courses are also a viable option for distance learning.  There are many available that cover a broad range of topics.\n\n== Paced and self-paced models ==\nDistance education can be delivered in a paced format similar to traditional campus-based models in which learners commence and complete a course at the same time. Paced delivery is currently the most common mode of distance education delivery. Alternatively, some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrollment and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner's time, skill and commitment levels. Paced courses may be offered in either synchronous mode, but self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously. Each delivery model offers both advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers, and institutions.\n\n[[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein classify distance education into four groups along the dimensions Time dependency and Number of participants: 1) [[MOOCs]] (Massive Open Online Courses): Open-access online course (i.e., without specific participation restrictions) that allows for unlimited (massive) participation; 2) [[Small private online course|SPOCs]] (Small Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and therefore requires some form of formal enrollment; 3) SMOCs (Synchronous Massive Online Courses): Open-access online course that allows for unlimited participation but requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously); 4) SSOCs (Synchronous Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously).<ref name=\"Kaplan Haenlein 2016\"/>\n\nPaced models are a familiar mode since they are used almost exclusively in campus-based schools. Institutes that offer both distance and campus programs usually use paced models so that teacher workload, student semester planning, tuition deadlines, exam schedules, and other administrative details can be synchronized with campus delivery. Student familiarity and the pressure of deadlines encourages students to readily adapt to and usually succeed in paced models. However, student freedom is sacrificed as a common pace is often too fast for some students and too slow for others. In addition life events, professional or family responsibilities can interfere with a students capability to complete tasks to an external schedule. Finally, paced models allows students to readily form communities of inquiry<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://coi.athabascau.ca|title = Community of Inquiry site|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Athabasca University|last = |first = }}</ref> and to engage in collaborative work.\n\nSelf-paced courses maximize student freedom, as not only can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or up to a year or longer. Students often enroll in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, have not been able to complete a scheduled course, need additional courses or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though, is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination, resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools<ref>{{Cite book|title = Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media|last = Dron|first = Jon|publisher = AU Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Anderson|first2 = Terry}}</ref> are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.19173/irrodl.v12i3.890 |title=Three generations of distance education pedagogy\t|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=80\u201397 |year=2011 |last1=Anderson |first1=Terry |last2=Dron |first2=Jon }}</ref> for use in self-paced programs.\n\n== Benefits ==\n[[Distance line|Distance]]<ref>0</ref> learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments.<ref name=Oblinger>{{cite journal |last=Oblinger |first=Diana G. |year=2000 |title=The Nature and Purpose of Distance Education |journal=The Technology Source |volume= |series= |issue=March/April |page= |pages= |publisher=Michigan Virtual University |location=Michigan |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url=http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |language= |format= |accessdate=23 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718000146/http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"CFP\">{{cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=M|title=Benefits of TED Talks|journal=Canadian Family Physician|date=December 2014|volume=60|issue=12|pages=1080|pmid=25500595|pmc=4264800|doi=}}</ref> Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure.<ref name=Oblinger /> Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.<ref name=\"Maggio, L.

The distance educational increase in communication, particularly communication amongst students and their classmates, is an improvement that has been made to provide distance education students with as many of the opportunities as possible as they would receive in in-person education. The improvement being made in distance education is growing in tandem with the constant technological advancements. Present-day online communication allows students to associate with accredited schools and programs throughout the world that are out of reach for in-person learning. By having the opportunity to be involved in global institutions via distance education, a diverse array of thought is presented to students through communication with their classmates. This is beneficial because students have the opportunity to \"combine new opinions with their own, and develop a solid foundation for learning\".<ref name=\"calpoly1\">{{cite journal |title=Educational Benefits of Online Learning|pages=1\u20136|year=1998|url=http://blackboardsupport.calpoly.edu/content/faculty/handouts/Ben_Online.pdf|publisher=CalPoly.edu |accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> It has been shown through research that \"as learners become aware of the variations in interpretation and construction of meaning among a range of people [they] construct an individual meaning\", which can help students become knowledgeable of a wide array of viewpoints in education.<ref name=\"calpoly1\" /> To increase the likelihood that students will build effective ties with one another during the course, instructors should use similar assignments for students across different locations to overcome the influence of co-location on relationship building.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00308.x |title=Homophily of Network Ties and Bonding and Bridging Social Capital in Computer-Mediated Distributed Teams |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=1062\u201384 |year=2006 |last1=Yuan |first1=Y.

Many textbooks are now available as electronic textbooks, known as e-textbooks, which can offer digital textbooks for a reduced price in comparison to traditional textbooks. Also, the increasing improvements in technology have resulted in many school libraries having a partnership with digital publishers that offer course materials for free, which can help students significantly with educational costs.<ref name=\"worldwidelearn2013\" />\n\nWithin the class, students are able to learn in ways that traditional classrooms would not be able to provide.

For those in a healthcare or mental health distance learning program, online-based interactions have the potential to foster deeper reflections and discussions of client issues<ref name=\"Stanton, S. 20012\" /> as well as a quicker response to client issues, since supervision happens on a regular basis and is not limited to a weekly supervision meeting.<ref name=\"Stebnicki, M.

[[Daniel Barwick]] noted that there is no evidence that large class size is always worse or that small class size is always better, although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes; he argued that higher education has not made a sufficient effort to experiment with a variety of instructional methods to determine whether large class size is always negatively correlated with a reduction in learning outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barwick |first=Daniel W.|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/barwick |title=Views: Does Class Size Matter? |website=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> Early proponents of Massive Open Online Courses ([[MOOC]])s saw them as just the type of experiment that Barwick had pointed out was lacking in higher education, although Barwick himself has never advocated for [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]].\n\nThere may also be institutional challenges. Distance learning is new enough that it may be a challenge to gain support for these programs in a traditional brick-and-mortar academic learning environment.<ref name=\"Stanton, S. 20012\" /> Furthermore, it may be more difficult for the instructor to organize and plan a distance learning program,<ref name=\"Stebnicki, M. A. 20012\" /> especially since many are new programs and their organizational needs are different from a traditional learning program.\n\nAdditionally, though distance education offers industrial countries the opportunity to become globally informed, there are still negative sides to it. Hellman states that \"These include its cost and capital intensiveness, time constraints and other pressures on instructors, the isolation of students from instructors and their peers, instructors\u2019 enormous difficulty in adequately evaluating students they never meet face-to-face, and drop-out rates far higher than in classroom-based courses.\"<ref name=\"Hellman, Judith Adler 2003\">Hellman, Judith Adler. \"The Riddle of Distance Education.\" Geneva. 1 June 2003.</ref>\n\nA more complex challenge of distance education relates to cultural differences between student and teachers and among students. Distance programmes tend to be more diverse as they could go beyond the geographical borders of regions, countries, and continents, and cross the cultural borders that may exist with respect to race, gender, and religion. That requires a proper understanding and awareness of the norms, differences, preconceptions and potential conflicting issues.<ref name=\"Nasiri et Mafakheri\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03075079.2014.914906 |title=Postgraduate research supervision at a distance: A review of challenges and strategies |journal=Studies in Higher Education |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1962\u20139 |year=2014 |last1=Nasiri |first1=Fuzhan |last2=Mafakheri |first2=Fereshteh }}</ref>\n\n== Educational technology ==\nThe modern use of electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning) facilitates distance learning and independent learning by the extensive use of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT),<ref name=\"CFP\"/> replacing traditional content delivery by postal correspondence.

This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the learner and teacher and has direct implications over the learning process and future endeavors in distance education. Distance education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learner and teacher. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of information and communication technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.<ref>Soekartawi, Haryono, A. & Librero, F. 2002.

There are many available that cover a broad range of topics.\n\n== Paced and self-paced models ==\nDistance education can be delivered in a paced format similar to traditional campus-based models in which learners commence and complete a course at the same time. Paced delivery is currently the most common mode of distance education delivery. Alternatively, some institutions offer self-paced programs that allow for continuous enrollment and the length of time to complete the course is set by the learner's time, skill and commitment levels. Paced courses may be offered in either synchronous mode, but self-paced courses are almost always offered asynchronously. Each delivery model offers both advantages and disadvantages for students, teachers, and institutions.\n\n[[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein classify distance education into four groups along the dimensions Time dependency and Number of participants: 1) [[MOOCs]] (Massive Open Online Courses): Open-access online course (i.e., without specific participation restrictions) that allows for unlimited (massive) participation; 2) [[Small private online course|SPOCs]] (Small Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and therefore requires some form of formal enrollment; 3) SMOCs (Synchronous Massive Online Courses): Open-access online course that allows for unlimited participation but requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously); 4) SSOCs (Synchronous Private Online Courses): Online course that only offers a limited number of places and requires students to be \"present\" at the same time (synchronously).<ref name=\"Kaplan Haenlein 2016\"/>\n\nPaced models are a familiar mode since they are used almost exclusively in campus-based schools. Institutes that offer both distance and campus programs usually use paced models so that teacher workload, student semester planning, tuition deadlines, exam schedules, and other administrative details can be synchronized with campus delivery. Student familiarity and the pressure of deadlines encourages students to readily adapt to and usually succeed in paced models. However, student freedom is sacrificed as a common pace is often too fast for some students and too slow for others. In addition life events, professional or family responsibilities can interfere with a students capability to complete tasks to an external schedule. Finally, paced models allows students to readily form communities of inquiry<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://coi.athabascau.ca|title = Community of Inquiry site|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Athabasca University|last = |first = }}</ref> and to engage in collaborative work.\n\nSelf-paced courses maximize student freedom, as not only can students commence studies on any date, but they can complete a course in as little time as a few weeks or up to a year or longer. Students often enroll in self-paced study when they are under pressure to complete programs, have not been able to complete a scheduled course, need additional courses or have pressure which precludes regular study for any length of time. The self-paced nature of the programming, though, is an unfamiliar model for many students and can lead to excessive procrastination, resulting in course incompletion. Assessment of learning can also be challenging as exams can be written on any day, making it possible for students to share examination questions with resulting loss of academic integrity. Finally, it is extremely challenging to organize collaborative work activities, though some schools<ref>{{Cite book|title = Teaching Crowds: Learning and Social Media|last = Dron|first = Jon|publisher = AU Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Anderson|first2 = Terry}}</ref> are developing cooperative models based upon networked and connectivist pedagogies<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.19173/irrodl.v12i3.890 |title=Three generations of distance education pedagogy\t|journal=The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=80\u201397 |year=2011 |last1=Anderson |first1=Terry |last2=Dron |first2=Jon }}</ref> for use in self-paced programs.\n\n== Benefits ==\n[[Distance line|Distance]]<ref>0</ref> learning can expand access to education and training for both general populace and businesses since its flexible scheduling structure lessens the effects of the many time-constraints imposed by personal responsibilities and commitments.<ref name=Oblinger>{{cite journal |last=Oblinger |first=Diana G. |year=2000 |title=The Nature and Purpose of Distance Education |journal=The Technology Source |volume= |series= |issue=March/April |page= |pages= |publisher=Michigan Virtual University |location=Michigan |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url=http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |language= |format= |accessdate=23 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718000146/http://technologysource.org/article/nature_and_purpose_of_distance_education/ |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"CFP\">{{cite journal|last1=Masson|first1=M|title=Benefits of TED Talks|journal=Canadian Family Physician|date=December 2014|volume=60|issue=12|pages=1080|pmid=25500595|pmc=4264800|doi=}}</ref> Devolving some activities off-site alleviates institutional capacity constraints arising from the traditional demand on institutional buildings and infrastructure.<ref name=Oblinger /> Furthermore, there is the potential for increased access to more experts in the field and to other students from diverse geographical, social, cultural, economic, and experiential backgrounds.<ref name=\"Maggio, L.

The improvement being made in distance education is growing in tandem with the constant technological advancements. Present-day online communication allows students to associate with accredited schools and programs throughout the world that are out of reach for in-person learning.

Schools have a responsibility to adopt a proactive policy for managing technology barriers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stephens |first=D. |date=July 2007 |title=Quality issues in distance learning |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/whitepapers/quality-issues-distance-learning.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601203911/http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/whitepapers/quality-issues-distance-learning.pdf |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Time management skills and self-discipline in distance education is just as important as complete knowledge of the software and tools being used for learning.\n\nThe results of a study of Washington state community college students showed that distance learning students tended to drop out more often than their traditional counterparts due to difficulties in language, time management, and study skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/publications/online-hybrid-courses-washington.html?UID=872|title=Online and Hybrid Course Enrollment and Performance in Washington State Community and Technical Colleges|last=Gabriel}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Dr. Pankaj Singhm, director of [[NIMS University|Nims University]], \"distance learning benefits may outweigh the disadvantages for students in such a technology-driven society; however before indulging into use of [[educational technology]] a few more disadvantages should be considered.\" He describes that over multiple years, \"all of the obstacles have been overcome and the world environment for distance education continues to improve.\" Dr. Pankaj Singhm also claims there is a debate to distance education stating, \"due to a lack of direct face-to-face social interaction. However, as more people become used to personal and social interaction online (for example dating, chat rooms, shopping, or blogging), it is becoming easier for learners to both project themselves and socialize with others. This is an obstacle that has dissipated.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scdl.net/InternationalConference/PDFS/DigitalProceeding/Full%20paper%20Pankaj%20Singh.pdf|title=Unleashing the potential of ODL - \"Reaching the unreached\"|last=|first=|date=24 January 2018|website=Symbiosis Center for Distance Learning|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nNot all courses required to complete a degree may be offered online. Health care profession programs in particular, require some sort of patient interaction through field work before a student may graduate.<ref>http://www.distancelearningnet.com/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-distance-learning/</ref> Studies have also shown that students pursuing a medical professional graduate degree who are participating in distance education courses, favor face to face communication over professor-mediated chat rooms and/or independent studies. However, this is little correlation between student performance when comparing the previous different distance learning strategies.<ref name=\"Jedlicka, J. S. 20022\" />\n\nThere is a theoretical problem about the application of traditional teaching methods to online courses because online courses may have no upper size limit. [[Daniel Barwick]] noted that there is no evidence that large class size is always worse or that small class size is always better, although a negative link has been established between certain types of instruction in large classes and learning outcomes; he argued that higher education has not made a sufficient effort to experiment with a variety of instructional methods to determine whether large class size is always negatively correlated with a reduction in learning outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barwick |first=Daniel W.|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/12/06/barwick |title=Views: Does Class Size Matter? |website=Inside Higher Ed |accessdate=3 October 2011}}</ref> Early proponents of Massive Open Online Courses ([[MOOC]])s saw them as just the type of experiment that Barwick had pointed out was lacking in higher education, although Barwick himself has never advocated for [[Massive open online course|MOOCs]].\n\nThere may also be institutional challenges. Distance learning is new enough that it may be a challenge to gain support for these programs in a traditional brick-and-mortar academic learning environment.<ref name=\"Stanton, S. 20012\" /> Furthermore, it may be more difficult for the instructor to organize and plan a distance learning program,<ref name=\"Stebnicki, M. A. 20012\" /> especially since many are new programs and their organizational needs are different from a traditional learning program.\n\nAdditionally, though distance education offers industrial countries the opportunity to become globally informed, there are still negative sides to it. Hellman states that \"These include its cost and capital intensiveness, time constraints and other pressures on instructors, the isolation of students from instructors and their peers, instructors\u2019 enormous difficulty in adequately evaluating students they never meet face-to-face, and drop-out rates far higher than in classroom-based courses.\"<ref name=\"Hellman, Judith Adler 2003\">Hellman, Judith Adler. \"The Riddle of Distance Education.\" Geneva. 1 June 2003.</ref>\n\nA more complex challenge of distance education relates to cultural differences between student and teachers and among students. Distance programmes tend to be more diverse as they could go beyond the geographical borders of regions, countries, and continents, and cross the cultural borders that may exist with respect to race, gender, and religion. That requires a proper understanding and awareness of the norms, differences, preconceptions and potential conflicting issues.<ref name=\"Nasiri et Mafakheri\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03075079.2014.914906 |title=Postgraduate research supervision at a distance: A review of challenges and strategies |journal=Studies in Higher Education |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1962\u20139 |year=2014 |last1=Nasiri |first1=Fuzhan |last2=Mafakheri |first2=Fereshteh }}</ref>\n\n== Educational technology ==\nThe modern use of electronic [[educational technology]] (also called e-learning) facilitates distance learning and independent learning by the extensive use of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT),<ref name=\"CFP\"/> replacing traditional content delivery by postal correspondence.

This gap has been observed to become wider if there is no communication between the learner and teacher and has direct implications over the learning process and future endeavors in distance education. Distance education providers began to introduce various strategies, techniques, and procedures to increase the amount of interaction between learner and teacher. These measures e.g. more frequent face-to-face tutorials, increased use of information and communication technologies including teleconferencing and the Internet, were designed to close the gap in transactional distance.<ref>Soekartawi, Haryono, A. & Librero, F. 2002.
