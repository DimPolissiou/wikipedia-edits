Indian traders traveled to the island in search of sandalwood. Trade links increased after the Portuguese colonisation of East Timor and portions of India. The Portuguese set up various garrisoned centres in India to carry out this trade, and all of Portugal's territories in Asia, including East Timor, were governed by the Portuguese Viceroy in Goa. Portuguese-trained Goan missionaries arrived in East Timor in the early 17th century, and were influential in spreading Catholicism in the country. Indians also traveled to East Timor to serve as soldiers, colonial bureaucrats, and missionaries. Some Indians arrived in East Timor in the late 19th century to work as migrant labour.

Indian traders traveled to the island in search of sandalwood. Trade links increased after the Portuguese colonisation of East Timor and portions of India. The Portuguese set up various garrisoned centres in India to carry out this trade, and all of Portugal's territories in Asia, including East Timor, were governed by the Portuguese Viceroy in Goa. Portuguese-trained Goan missionaries arrived in East Timor in the early 17th century, and were influential in spreading Catholicism in the country. Indians also traveled to East Timor to serve as soldiers, colonial bureaucrats, and missionaries. Some Indians arrived in East Timor in the late 19th century to work as migrant labour.

The Middle School is housed in the former building of St. Augustine's Orphanage, while the Junior School uses the former Glastonbury Orphanage. The Senior Campus is located at the former Highton campus of [[Geelong Grammar School]], which was purchased by Christian College in 1999 and opened to students in 2000. The Bellarine Campus is the former council offices for the [[Rural City of Bellarine]] which was amalgamated into the [[City of Greater Geelong]] in 1993. The school bought the property in 1995 and started classes in 1996 for students on the [[Bellarine Peninsula]], which removed the burden of travelling to Geelong.\n\n== Houses ==\nThere are four houses at Christian College into which students are split. They are Penman, Flynn, Taylor and Burrows. Burrows (previously known as Hume) is named after [[Eva Burrows]], Taylor after [[Hudson Taylor]], Penman (previously known as Cunningham) after [[David John Penman]] and Flynn after [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]]. Burrows are the current holders of the school D.C. Riddle Cup (awarded at the Senior Campus). This cup is awarded to the house that earns the most points over the four major carnivals of Athletics, Cross Country, Swimming and House Music. There are also various lunch time activities that also earn points towards the D.C. Riddle Cup. These lunch time activities include Cricket, Basketball, Netball, AFL, Soccer, \"Letters and Numbers\" (maths and English) competition and Drama.\n\n== Music program ==\nChristian College has a music program for strings, wind, percussion, piano, brass and bass. The school also has bands, choirs, orchestras, and symphonies that compete every year. In the [[Melbourne School Bands Festival]] 2008, Christian College Geelong received a Gold Award in the Advanced Concert Band Section. Christian College also had a tour to Sydney where some of the Christian College Bands performed at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The music department (in conjunction with the drama department) stages a bi-annual school musical, the most recent being ''Wizard of Oz'' in April 2013 with \"Seussical The Musical\" being May 2011.\n\nRecently the school also travelled to Hawaii to take part in the Annual Pacific Basin Music Festival, and received a gold award.\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn October 2015, at \"Celebration Day\" celebrations for the departure of Year 12s, three students arrived in an unauthorised helicopter, causing controversy inside and outside the school.\n\nThe incident was covered by the ''Geelong Advertiser'', ''The Age'' and Channel 9 News. The following year's \"Celebration Day\" for the departure of Year 12s was cancelled due to fear of a repeat event occurring. This caused for more controversy inside and outside the school, leading to the ''Geelong Advertiser'', ''The Age'' and ''Herald Sun'' covering the story.\n\nThe result of 2020 synchronised swimming caused quite a stir amongst the college community. Penman are the house that many believe to have won the competition. However, the winner Flynn won by one point. Penman had the last laugh on the day eventually being rewarded swimming champions.

His [[temple name]] was \"Taizu\" (\u592a\u7956) while his [[posthumous name]] was \"Emperor Gao\" (\u9ad8\u7687\u5e1d); \"Gaozu of Han\", derived from the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', is the common way of referring to this sovereign even though he was not accorded the temple name \"Gaozu\". Liu Bang was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history who was born in a peasant family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gaozu-emperor-of-Han-dynasty|title=Gaozu Emperor of Han Dynasty|last=|first=|date=|website= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to coming to power, Liu Bang initially served for the [[Qin dynasty]] as a [[law enforcement officer]] in his home town [[Pei County]], within the [[Chu (state)|conquered state of Chu]].  With the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]]'s death and the Qin Empire's subsequent political chaos, Liu Bang renounced his [[civil service]] position and became an anti-Qin rebel leader.  He won the race against fellow rebel leader [[Xiang Yu]] to invade the [[Guanzhong|Qin heartland]] and forced the surrender of the [[Ziying|last Qin ruler]] in 206 BCE.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the ''de facto'' chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]], and Liu Bang was forced to accept the poor and remote Bashu region (parts of present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) with the title \"'''King of Han'''\" ({{zh|t=\u6f22\u738b|p=H\u00e0n W\u00e1ng}}).  Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the [[Three Qins]], starting a civil war known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] as various forces battled for supremacy over China.\n\nIn 202 BCE, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the [[Battle of Gaixia]], unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]], promoted [[Confucianism]], and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu [[vassal]] states, among many other actions.  He also initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'' to maintain a ''[[de jure]]'' peace between the Han Empire and the [[Xiongnu]] after losing the [[Battle of Baideng]] in 200 BCE.  He died in 195 BCE and was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]].\n\n==Birth and early life==\nIn imperial Han myth, Liu Bang was a descendant of the mythical [[Emperor Yao]], who descended from the [[Yellow Emperor]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4raAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the family in Chinese history|author=Patricia Buckley Ebrey|editor=|year=2003|page=171|pages= |publisher=Psychology Press|volume=Volume 2 of Critical Asian scholarship|edition=illustrated|location=|isbn=0-415-28823-1|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> It was a common practice among many ancient Chinese noble families to claim descent from the mythical Yellow Emperor, in order to proclaim [[Mandate of Heaven|divine ruling legitimacy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&pg=PA505&dq=huangdi+family+tree#v=onepage&q=huangdi%20family%20tree&f=false|title=The encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1|author=Fabrizio Pregadio|editor=Fabrizio Pregadio|year=2008 |page=505|pages=|publisher=Psychology Press|volume=|edition=ill ustrated|location=|isbn=0-7007-1200-3|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang was born to a peasant family in Zhongyang Village (\u4e2d\u967d\u91cc), [[Feng County, Jiangsu|Feng Township]] (\u4e30\u9091), [[Pei County]] (\u6c9b\u7e23) in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the late years of the [[Warring States period]].<ref name=\"Birthplace\"/> His parents' names were not recorded in history; they were simply referred to as \"[[Liu Taigong]]\" (\u5289\u592a\u516c; lit. \"Old Sir Liu\") and \"Liu Ao\" (\u5289\u5aaa;<ref>Note that the Chinese character \"\u5aaa\" (\u01ceo) was not the personal name of Liu's mother.

See the [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=chardict&cdcanoce=0&cdqchi=\u5aaadictionary definition of \u5aaa].</ref> lit. \"Old Madam Liu\"). According to legend, before Liu Bang's birth, his mother was caught in a rainstorm and took shelter under a bridge. At that moment, lightning struck and the sky darkened. Liu Bang's father went to fetch his wife home and saw a dragon hovering above her. She became pregnant and later gave birth to Liu Bang.<ref name=\"iub.edu\">[http://www.iub.edu/~g380/4.3-Rise-2010.pdf Translation] of Sima Qian's ''Shiji''.</ref>\n\nIt was subsequently recorded that the young Liu Bang was outspoken, charismatic and of great generosity and forbearance. However, he enjoyed loafing, disliked reading, showed no interest in farming and [[manual labour]] and frequently ran into trouble with the law, hence his father often called him a \"little rascal\" for his lazy lifestyle. Liu Bang persisted in his idling ways and depended on his brother's family for food and lodging. When he grew older, he became a good friend and live-in companion of a former [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] of [[Lord Xinling]] named Zhang Er ({{zh|t=\u5f35\u8033}}, ? \u2014 202 BCE), who, at the time, was the [[county magistrate|magistrate]] of the nearby [[Minquan County|Waihuang County]].\n\nAfter Qin conquered Chu, Zhang Er went into hiding, and Liu Bang returned to his own home town in Pei County.  Contrary to other claims, he did not take any civil service exam as it did not exist yet at that time. Instead, he was later recommended and appointed as the local [[sheriff]] (\u4ead\u9577) at Sishui Pavilion (\u6cd7\u6c34\u4ead) in [[Pei County]], through the aid and supervision of his close friends [[Xiao He]] and [[Cao Shen]], who worked at the county office and often helped cover up his delinquent behaviour.  He nevertheless forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned himself a small reputation in the district.  Liu Bang was once sent for [[statute labour]] in the capital [[Xianyang]], and encountered the [[First Emperor]] going on an inspection tour around the nation.  Awed by the majestic sight of the royal convoy, he exclaimed, \"Alas, this is how a great man should be! (\u55df\u4e4e\uff0c\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u7576\u5982\u6b64\u4e5f)\"\n\nOne day, L\u00fc Wen (\u5442\u6587), a wealthy and influential [[gentry]] from [[Shan County|Shanfu County]], who had recently moved to Pei County, was putting on a feast to host the local elites.  [[Xiao He]], who was in charge of helping L\u00fc Wen collect gifts from the visitors, announced that \"those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins worth of gifts shall be seated outside the hall\".  Liu Bang went to the feast without bringing any money but said, \"I offer 10,000 coins.\"  L\u00fc Wen saw Liu Bang and was so impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him, despite Xiao He telling him that Liu Bang was not being serious.  L\u00fc Wen chatted with Liu Bang, and said, \"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I have never before seen someone so exceptional like you.\"  He then offered his daughter [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]]'s hand in marriage to Liu Bang.  After they were wed, L\u00fc Zhi bore Liu Bang a son Liu Ying (the future [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]]) and a daughter (the future [[Princess Yuan of Lu]]).\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\n[[File:Qin Uprisings.png|thumb|Uprisings of Qin Dynasty. Liu Bang's campaign is shown in purple.]]\n[[File:Liu Bang.jpg|thumb|Liu Bang, in an illustration by Qing-dynasty artist Shangguan Zhou \u4e0a\u5b98\u5468 (1665\u20131749)]]\nLiu Bang had been tasked with escorting a group of convicts to [[Mount Li]] where they would be put to work to help build the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|First Emperor's mausoleum]]. A few prisoners managed to escape during the journey. Liu Bang began to fear for his life as having convicts escape under one's care was, under the laws of the ruling [[Qin_dynasty|Qin dynasty]], a capital offence. Realizing that to keep his life he'd have to flee, Liu Bang decided to release the remaining prisoners in his care. A few of these convicts were so grateful to be set free that they decided to join Liu Bang of their own accord.\n\nAccording to legend they encountered a gigantic white serpent which killed members of Liu Bang's group with its poisonous breath. It is said that while drunk, Liu Bang slew the serpent that night and later encountered an old woman weeping by the side of the road the next morning. When the men following Liu asked her why she was crying, she replied, \"My child, the White Emperor's son, has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor.\"  She then mysteriously disappeared. After hearing the old woman's strange words, Liu Bang's followers believed that he was destined to become a ruler in the future and became even more impressed with him. This event is known as the \"Uprising of the Slaying of the White Serpent\" ({{zh|t=\u65ac\u767d\u86c7\u8d77\u7fa9}}).<ref>{{cite web |first1=\u4e09\u4e09\u4e24\u4e24 |title=\u5289\u90a6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u8d0f\u7684\u662f\u4ed6\uff1f |url=https://www.0-news.info/history/%E5%8A%89%E9%82%A6%E7%9A%84%E6%88%90%E5%8A%9F%E4%B9%8B%E9%81%93/ |website=https://www.0-news.info/ |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang and his followers took refuge on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]) and lived as outlaws in an abandoned stronghold. Liu had maintained secret contact with some of his old friends such as Xiao He and Cao Shen who still lived in Pei County. In 209&nbsp;BCE, two men named [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]] began the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] to overthrow the Qin dynasty. The magistrate of Pei County considered joining the rebellion as well and acting on the advice of both Xiao He and Cao Shen, he sent [[Fan Kuai]] (a relative of Liu Bang) to invite Liu and his followers back to Pei County to support him. However, he later decided against it and ended up denying Liu Bang entry into his lands. He also worried that Liu's friends Xiao He and Cao Shen might decide to open the gates for Liu now that he had been denied entry, so he set a plan in motion to kill them but Xiao and Cao managed to escape before it was put into action and eventually joined up with Liu and his entourage. While in Liu's company, Xiao came up with a plan to gain entry into the county and managed to convince Liu to take his advice. Liu Bang ordered his men to write letters, wrap them around their arrows and fire the arrows over the border and into the neighboring county from which they had been barred. In the letters they urged the local townsfolk to help him. The peasants responded to this call for aid by killing the magistrate and welcoming Liu back into Pei County. Liu Bang decided to style himself the \"Duke of Pei\" (\u6c9b\u516c) after this and became known to others by this title.\n\nIn 208 BCE, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the descendants of the former royal families who had ruled over the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] rebelled against the Qin Empire in the hope of restoring their former kingdoms. All of which had been conquered by the Qin dynasty in [[Qin's wars of unification|a series of wars]] to unify China under one ruler (the later Qin Emperor) about two decades earlier. In the county of Wu (present-day [[Jiangsu]]), a commoner named [[Xiang Liang]] (whose father had been a general for the state of Chu during the wars of unification) began his own uprising and installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Xiong Xin]] as \"King Huai the Latter\" (\u695a\u5f8c\u61f7\u738b) on the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. Liu Bang decided to join Xiang Liang's rebellion and served in Chu for some time. After Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao, King Huai II sent Xiang Liang's nephew [[Xiang Yu]] and minister [[Song Yi (Qin dynasty)|Song Yi]] to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao state, which was under attack by Qin forces.\n\nLiu Bang was later granted the title \"Marquis of Wu'an\" (\u6b66\u5b89\u4faf) by the king and tasked with leading an army which was to attack Qin. The king then promised that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (the heartland of the Qin state) first would receive the title \"King of Guanzhong\". In 206&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang managed to beat Xiang Yu in the race to Guanzhong and arrived outside of the Qin capital. [[Ziying]] who would end up being the last ruler of the Qin dynasty, surrendered the capital city of [[Xianyang]] to Liu Bang's forces.  Liu issued strict orders to his men which forbade them from killing any innocent civilians or pillaging the city. Thanks to this, peace and stability were temporarily restored in Xianyang while Liu Bang's forces were stationed there. Liu's friend and confidante Xiao He ordered the collection of all the legal documents in the Qin palace and government facilities so they could be preserved and safely transported away.\n\n== Chu\u2013Han Contention ==\n{{Main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n[[File:Mural Painting of a Banquet Scene from the Han Dynasty Tomb of Ta-hu-t'ing.jpg|thumb|300px|A late [[Eastern Han]] (25\u2013220 AD) [[Chinese painting|Chinese tomb mural]] showing lively scenes of a banquet (yanyin \u5bb4\u98f2), dance and music (wuyue \u821e\u6a02), acrobatics (baixi \u767e\u620f), and wrestling (xiangbu \u76f8\u6251), [[c:Category:Dahuting Tomb murals|from the Dahuting Tomb]] (Chinese: \u6253\u864e\u4ead\u6f22\u5893, Pinyin: ''Dahuting Han mu''), on the southern bank of the [[Suihe River]] in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]], China (just west of [[Xi County, Henan|Xi County]])]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 01 Wine vessel Western Han dynasty.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Shanxi Museum 2009 Taiyuan 839.jpg\n| width2 = 182\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' A [[jade]]-carved wine cup with [[relief]] decorations, [[Western Han]] (202 BCE \u2013 9 CE) <br>'''Right:''' a gilded bronze [[wine warmer]] with animalistic relief decorations, 26 BCE, [[Western Han]] period\n}}\n[[File:Met, female dancer, western han dynasty, 2nd century BC.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Western Han]] female dancer in [[silk]] robes, 2nd century BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; [[Xiang Zhuang]] intended to assassinate Liu Bang by pretending to do a [[sword dance]]]]\n[[Xiang Yu]] was dissatisfied that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to [[Guanzhong]]. Instigated by his advisor [[Fan Zeng]] and Cao Wushang (\u66f9\u7121\u50b7), an informer from Liu Bang's camp, he decided to set a trap to kill Liu Bang.  He pretended to invite Liu Bang to a banquet, while secretly planning to assassinate Liu during the feast.  However, Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was a close friend of Liu Bang's strategist [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]], and managed to persuade his nephew to not personally order Liu Bang's execution on the feast.  Frustrated by Xiang Yu's indecisiveness, Fan Zeng then ordered Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend performing a [[sword dance]] and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang, but Xiang Bo volunteered to join the dance and blocked his nephew every time he thrust his sword towards Liu Bang.\n\nSeeing Liu Bang was in mortal danger, Zhang Liang sneaked outside and summoned Liu Bang's brother-in-law and personal bodyguard [[Fan Kuai]], who then crashed the party clad in full armor and scolded Xiang Yu for the sinister plot.  Embarrassed by Fan Kuai's accusation, Xiang Yu ordered the sword dance to stop and rewarded Fan Kuai for his bravery.  Liu Bang then pretended to go to the latrine and used the chance to escape Xiang Yu's camp unannounced.  He and his forces then evacuated from Xianyang and retreated west.  Xiang Yu led his forces into Xianyang, where they plundered and pillaged the city and burnt down the [[Epang Palace]].\n\n[[Records of the Grand Historian]] recounts an event during this conflict, an event omitted from the emperor's own biography but present in the biography of Xiang Yu, where he pushed his own children out of his carriage to lighten it in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu's men.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin===\nAfter occupying Xianyang, Xiang Yu proclaimed himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]]. The Guanzhong area, which was rightfully Liu Bang's per [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise, was given by Xiang Yu to [[Three Qins|three former Qin generals]] instead. Liu Bang was relocated to [[Hanzhong]] in the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) and received the title \"King of Han\" (\u6f22\u738b). When a rebellion broke out in the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] in late 206&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu left Western Chu to suppress the revolt. Liu Bang used the opportunity to invade and conquer Guanzhong and then attack several Chu territories, including the capital Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce; present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nFrom 206\u2013202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a power struggle \u2013 historically known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] \u2013 for supremacy over China, while simultaneously attacking and subjugating the other kingdoms. In 203&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang came to an armistice, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west along the Hong Canal under the Chu and Han regimes respectively. A few months later, Liu Bang renounced the treaty and attacked Xiang Yu again. In 202&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu lost to Liu Bang at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and committed suicide, after which Chu surrendered to Han. Liu Bang had unified much of China under his control by then.\n\n==Establishment of the Han dynasty==\n[[File:Emperor gao of han c01s06i01.jpg|thumb|A portrait painting of Emperor Gao of Han (Liu Bang), from an 18th-century Qing Dynasty album of Chinese emperors' portraits.]]\nIn 202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang was enthroned as the emperor with support from his subjects even though he expressed reluctance to take the throne. He named his dynasty \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\", and was historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu\" (or \"Emperor Gao\"). He established the capital in [[Luoyang]] (later moved to [[Chang'an]]) and instated his official spouse [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]] as the empress and their son [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]] as the [[crown prince]].\n\nThe following year, Emperor Gaozu wanted to reward his subjects who had contributed to the founding of the Han Empire, but the process dragged on for a year because they could not agree on the distribution of the rewards. The emperor thought that [[Xiao He]]'s contributions were the greatest, so he awarded Xiao the title \"Marquis of Zan\" and gave him the largest amount of food stores. Some of the others expressed objections because they thought that Xiao was not directly involved in battle so his contributions should not be considered the greatest. Emperor Gaozu replied that Xiao He should receive the highest credit because he planned their overall strategy in the war against Xiang Yu. He named [[Cao Shen]] as the person who made the greatest contributions in battle and rewarded him and the others accordingly.\n\n==Reign==\n{{Further|Han dynasty}}\n\n===Reducing taxes and corv\u00e9e===\nEmperor Gaozu disbanded his armies and allowed the soldiers to return home. He gave an order stating that the people who remained in [[Guanzhong]] were exempted from taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]] for 12 years while those who returned to their respective native territories were exempted for six years and that the central government would provide for them for a year. He also granted freedom to those who had sold themselves into slavery to avoid hunger during the wars. In 195&nbsp;BCE, the emperor issued two decrees: the first officialised the lowering of taxes and corv\u00e9e; the second set the amount of tribute to be paid by the [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to the imperial court in the 10th month of every year. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced to a rate of 1/15 of crop yield. He also privatised the coinage.\n\n===Emphasis on Confucianism===\nIn his early days, Emperor Gaozu disliked reading and scorned [[Confucianism]]. After becoming the emperor, he still held the same attitudes towards Confucianism as he did before until he encountered the scholar [[Lu Jia (Western Han)|Lu Jia]] (or Lu Gu). Lu Gu wrote a 12-volume book, ''Xinyu'' (\u65b0\u8a9e), which espoused the benefits of governing by moral virtue as opposed to using harsh and punitive laws (as it was under the Qin dynasty). Lu Gu read each volume to the emperor after he finished writing it. The emperor was deeply impressed. Under Emperor Gaozu's reign, Confucianism flourished and gradually replaced [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] (of Qin times) as the state ideology. Confucian scholars, including Lu Gu, were recruited to serve in the government. The emperor also reformed the legal system by relaxing some laws inherited from the Qin regime and reducing the severity of certain penalties. In 196&nbsp;BCE, after suppressing a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], he passed by [[Shandong]], the birthplace of [[Confucius]], and personally prepared for a ceremony to pay respect to the philosopher.\n\n===Dispute over the succession===\nIn his later years, Emperor Gaozu favoured [[Concubine Qi]] and neglected [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. He thought that [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], his heir apparent (born to the empress), was too weak to be a ruler. Thus, he had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with another son, [[Liu Ruyi]], who was born to Concubine Qi. L\u00fc Zhi became worried, so she asked [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] to help her son maintain his position. Zhang Liang recommended four reclusive wise men, the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]], to help Liu Ying.\n\nIn 195&nbsp;BCE as Emperor Gaozu's health started to worsen, he desired even more to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as the crown prince. Zhang Liang tried to dissuade him but was ignored, so he retired on the excuse that he was ill. [[Shusun Tong]] (the crown prince's tutor) and Zhou Chang also strongly objected to the emperor's decision to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi. Zhou Chang said, \"I am not good in arguing, but I know this is not right. If Your Majesty deposes the Crown Prince, I won't follow your orders any more.\"<ref>(\u81e3\u53e3\u4e0d\u80fd\u8a00\uff0c\u7136\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u77e5\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002\u965b\u4e0b\u96d6\u6b32\u5ee2\u592a\u5b50\uff0c\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u4e0d\u5949\u8a54\u3002)</ref> Zhou Chang was outspoken but he had a stuttering problem, which made his speech very amusing. The emperor laughed. After that, the Four Haos of Mount Shang showed up in the court. Emperor Gaozu was surprised to see them because they had previously declined to join the civil service when he invited them. The four men promised to help Liu Ying in the future if he were to remain as the crown prince. The emperor was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support so he dismissed the idea of changing his heir apparent.<ref name=\"Ch'en2014\">{{cite book|author=Chi-yen Ch'en|title=Hsun Yueh and the Mind of Late Han China: A Translation of the SHEN-CHIEN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sar_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5348-9|pages=171\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n{{further|Kings of the Han dynasty|Battle of Baideng|Heqin}}\n[[File:Western Han soldiers.jpg|thumb|[[Horses in East Asian warfare|Cavalry soldiers]], painted [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic statues]], [[Western Han]] period, [[Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]\nAfter establishing the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu appointed princes and [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to help him govern the Han Empire and gave each of them a piece of land. There were seven vassal kings who were not related to the imperial clan: [[Zang Tu]], the King of Yan; [[King Xin of Han|H\u00e1n Xin]], the King of H\u00e1n; [[Han Xin]], the King of Chu; [[Peng Yue]], the King of Liang; [[Ying Bu]], the King of Huainan; Zhang Er, the King of Zhao; [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], the King of Changsha. However, later, the emperor became worried that the vassal kings might rebel against him because they, after all, had no blood relations with him. Han Xin and Peng Yue were (falsely) accused of treason, arrested and executed along with their families. Ying Bu and Zang Tu rebelled against him but were defeated and killed. Only Wu Rui and Zhang Er were left.\n\nThe [[Xiongnu]] in the north had been a threat since the [[Qin dynasty]]. [[Qin Shi Huang]] had sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to oversee the defences on the Qin Empire's northern border and the construction of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] to repel the invaders. Meng Tian achieved success in deterring the Xiongnu from advancing beyond the border. However, after the Qin dynasty collapsed, the Xiongnu seized the opportunity to move south and raid the border again. In 201&nbsp;BCE, H\u00e1n Xin (King of H\u00e1n) defected to the Xiongnu leader, [[Modu Chanyu|Modu]]. In the following year, Emperor Gaozu led an army to attack the Xiongnu but was besieged and trapped by the enemy at the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Acting on [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]]'s advice, he bribed Modu's wife with gifts and got her to ask her husband to withdraw his forces. Modu did so. After returning to the capital, Emperor Gaozu initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'', which involved sending noble ladies to marry the Xiongnu leaders and paying annual tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Changling 1.jpg|thumb|Changling (\u9577\u9675), [[Chinese pyramids|the tomb]] of Emperor Gaozu in Xianyang, Shaanxi.]]\n\nEmperor Gaozu was wounded by a stray arrow during the campaign against [[Ying Bu]]. He became seriously ill and remained in his inner chambers for a long period of time and ordered his guards to deny entry to everyone who tried to visit him. After several days, [[Fan Kuai]] barged into the chambers to see the emperor and the other subjects followed behind him. They saw Emperor Gaozu lying on his bed and attended to by a [[eunuch]]. Fan Kuai said, \"How glorious it was when Your Majesty first led us to conquer the empire and how weary we are now. Your subjects are worried when they learn that Your Majesty is ill, but Your Majesty refuses to see us and prefers the company of a eunuch instead. Has Your Majesty forgotten the incident about [[Zhao Gao]]?\" The emperor laughed and got out of bed to meet his subjects.\n\nEmperor Gaozu's health deteriorated later so [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] hired a famous physician to heal him. When Emperor Gaozu enquired about his condition, the physician told him that his illness could be cured, but the emperor was displeased and he scolded the physician, \"Isn't it Heaven's will that I managed to conquer this empire in simple clothing and with nothing but a sword? My life is determined by Heaven. It is useless even if [[Bian Que]] is here!\" He refused to continue with the treatment and sent the physician away. Before his death, he said that [[Cao Shen]] could succeed [[Xiao He]] as the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] after Xiao died, and that Wang Ling could succeed Cao Shen. He also said that Wang Ling might be too young to perform his duties so [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]] could assist Wang, but Chen was also qualified to assume the responsibilities of a chancellor all by himself. He also named [[Zhou Bo]] as a possible candidate for the role of Grand Commandant. He died in Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae) on 1 June 195&nbsp;BCE and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]].\n\n== Song of the Great Wind ==\nThe ''Song of the Great Wind'' was a song composed by Liu Bang in 195&nbsp;BCE when he visited his hometown in [[Pei County]] after suppressing [[Ying Bu]]'s rebellion. He prepared a banquet and invited all his old friends and townsfolk to join him.

His [[temple name]] was \"Taizu\" (\u592a\u7956) while his [[posthumous name]] was \"Emperor Gao\" (\u9ad8\u7687\u5e1d); \"Gaozu of Han\", derived from the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', is the common way of referring to this sovereign even though he was not accorded the temple name \"Gaozu\". Liu Bang was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history who was born in a peasant family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gaozu-emperor-of-Han-dynasty|title=Gaozu Emperor of Han Dynasty|last=|first=|date=|website= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to coming to power, Liu Bang initially served for the [[Qin dynasty]] as a [[law enforcement officer]] in his home town [[Pei County]], within the [[Chu (state)|conquered state of Chu]].  With the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]]'s death and the Qin Empire's subsequent political chaos, Liu Bang renounced his [[civil service]] position and became an anti-Qin rebel leader.  He won the race against fellow rebel leader [[Xiang Yu]] to invade the [[Guanzhong|Qin heartland]] and forced the surrender of the [[Ziying|last Qin ruler]] in 206 BCE.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the ''de facto'' chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]], and Liu Bang was forced to accept the poor and remote Bashu region (parts of present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) with the title \"'''King of Han'''\" ({{zh|t=\u6f22\u738b|p=H\u00e0n W\u00e1ng}}).  Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the [[Three Qins]], starting a civil war known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] as various forces battled for supremacy over China.\n\nIn 202 BCE, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the [[Battle of Gaixia]], unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]], promoted [[Confucianism]], and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu [[vassal]] states, among many other actions.  He also initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'' to maintain a ''[[de jure]]'' peace between the Han Empire and the [[Xiongnu]] after losing the [[Battle of Baideng]] in 200 BCE.  He died in 195 BCE and was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]].\n\n==Birth and early life==\nIn imperial Han myth, Liu Bang was a descendant of the mythical [[Emperor Yao]], who descended from the [[Yellow Emperor]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4raAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the family in Chinese history|author=Patricia Buckley Ebrey|editor=|year=2003|page=171|pages= |publisher=Psychology Press|volume=Volume 2 of Critical Asian scholarship|edition=illustrated|location=|isbn=0-415-28823-1|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> It was a common practice among many ancient Chinese noble families to claim descent from the mythical Yellow Emperor, in order to proclaim [[Mandate of Heaven|divine ruling legitimacy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&pg=PA505&dq=huangdi+family+tree#v=onepage&q=huangdi%20family%20tree&f=false|title=The encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1|author=Fabrizio Pregadio|editor=Fabrizio Pregadio|year=2008 |page=505|pages=|publisher=Psychology Press|volume=|edition=ill ustrated|location=|isbn=0-7007-1200-3|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang was born to a peasant family in Zhongyang Village (\u4e2d\u967d\u91cc), [[Feng County, Jiangsu|Feng Township]] (\u4e30\u9091), [[Pei County]] (\u6c9b\u7e23) in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the late years of the [[Warring States period]].<ref name=\"Birthplace\"/> His parents' names were not recorded in history; they were simply referred to as \"[[Liu Taigong]]\" (\u5289\u592a\u516c; lit. \"Old Sir Liu\") and \"Liu Ao\" (\u5289\u5aaa;<ref>Note that the Chinese character \"\u5aaa\" (\u01ceo) was not the personal name of Liu's mother. It was used as a formal way of addressing an old woman at the time. See the [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=chardict&cdcanoce=0&cdqchi=\u5aaadictionary definition of \u5aaa].</ref> lit. \"Old Madam Liu\"). According to legend, before Liu Bang's birth, his mother was caught in a rainstorm and took shelter under a bridge. At that moment, lightning struck and the sky darkened. Liu Bang's father went to fetch his wife home and saw a dragon hovering above her. She became pregnant and later gave birth to Liu Bang.<ref name=\"iub.edu\">[http://www.iub.edu/~g380/4.3-Rise-2010.pdf Translation] of Sima Qian's ''Shiji''.</ref>\n\nIt was subsequently recorded that the young Liu Bang was outspoken, charismatic and of great generosity and forbearance. However, he enjoyed loafing, disliked reading, showed no interest in farming and [[manual labour]] and frequently ran into trouble with the law, hence his father often called him a \"little rascal\" for his lazy lifestyle. Liu Bang persisted in his idling ways and depended on his brother's family for food and lodging. When he grew older, he became a good friend and live-in companion of a former [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] of [[Lord Xinling]] named Zhang Er ({{zh|t=\u5f35\u8033}}, ? \u2014 202 BCE), who, at the time, was the [[county magistrate|magistrate]] of the nearby [[Minquan County|Waihuang County]].\n\nAfter Qin conquered Chu, Zhang Er went into hiding, and Liu Bang returned to his own home town in Pei County.  Contrary to other claims, he did not take any civil service exam as it did not exist yet at that time. Instead, he was later recommended and appointed as the local [[sheriff]] (\u4ead\u9577) at Sishui Pavilion (\u6cd7\u6c34\u4ead) in [[Pei County]], through the aid and supervision of his close friends [[Xiao He]] and [[Cao Shen]], who worked at the county office and often helped cover up his delinquent behaviour.  He nevertheless forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned himself a small reputation in the district.  Liu Bang was once sent for [[statute labour]] in the capital [[Xianyang]], and encountered the [[First Emperor]] going on an inspection tour around the nation.  Awed by the majestic sight of the royal convoy, he exclaimed, \"Alas, this is how a great man should be! (\u55df\u4e4e\uff0c\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u7576\u5982\u6b64\u4e5f)\"\n\nOne day, L\u00fc Wen (\u5442\u6587), a wealthy and influential [[gentry]] from [[Shan County|Shanfu County]], who had recently moved to Pei County, was putting on a feast to host the local elites.  [[Xiao He]], who was in charge of helping L\u00fc Wen collect gifts from the visitors, announced that \"those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins worth of gifts shall be seated outside the hall\".  Liu Bang went to the feast without bringing any money but said, \"I offer 10,000 coins.\"  L\u00fc Wen saw Liu Bang and was so impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him, despite Xiao He telling him that Liu Bang was not being serious.  L\u00fc Wen chatted with Liu Bang, and said, \"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I have never before seen someone so exceptional like you.\"  He then offered his daughter [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]]'s hand in marriage to Liu Bang.  After they were wed, L\u00fc Zhi bore Liu Bang a son Liu Ying (the future [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]]) and a daughter (the future [[Princess Yuan of Lu]]).\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\n[[File:Qin Uprisings.png|thumb|Uprisings of Qin Dynasty. Liu Bang's campaign is shown in purple.]]\n[[File:Liu Bang.jpg|thumb|Liu Bang, in an illustration by Qing-dynasty artist Shangguan Zhou \u4e0a\u5b98\u5468 (1665\u20131749)]]\nLiu Bang had been tasked with escorting a group of convicts to [[Mount Li]] where they would be put to work to help build the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|First Emperor's mausoleum]]. A few prisoners managed to escape during the journey. Liu Bang began to fear for his life as having convicts escape under one's care was, under the laws of the ruling [[Qin_dynasty|Qin dynasty]], a capital offence. Realizing that to keep his life he'd have to flee, Liu Bang decided to release the remaining prisoners in his care. A few of these convicts were so grateful to be set free that they decided to join Liu Bang of their own accord.\n\nAccording to legend they encountered a gigantic white serpent which killed members of Liu Bang's group with its poisonous breath. It is said that while drunk, Liu Bang slew the serpent that night and later encountered an old woman weeping by the side of the road the next morning. When the men following Liu asked her why she was crying, she replied, \"My child, the White Emperor's son, has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor.\"  She then mysteriously disappeared. After hearing the old woman's strange words, Liu Bang's followers believed that he was destined to become a ruler in the future and became even more impressed with him. This event is known as the \"Uprising of the Slaying of the White Serpent\" ({{zh|t=\u65ac\u767d\u86c7\u8d77\u7fa9}}).\n\nLiu Bang and his followers took refuge on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]) and lived as outlaws in an abandoned stronghold. Liu had maintained secret contact with some of his old friends such as Xiao He and Cao Shen who still lived in Pei County. In 209&nbsp;BCE, two men named [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]] began the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] to overthrow the Qin dynasty. The magistrate of Pei County considered joining the rebellion as well and acting on the advice of both Xiao He and Cao Shen, he sent [[Fan Kuai]] (a relative of Liu Bang) to invite Liu and his followers back to Pei County to support him. However, he later decided against it and ended up denying Liu Bang entry into his lands. He also worried that Liu's friends Xiao He and Cao Shen might decide to open the gates for Liu now that he had been denied entry, so he set a plan in motion to kill them but Xiao and Cao managed to escape before it was put into action and eventually joined up with Liu and his entourage. While in Liu's company, Xiao came up with a plan to gain entry into the county and managed to convince Liu to take his advice. Liu Bang ordered his men to write letters, wrap them around their arrows and fire the arrows over the border and into the neighboring county from which they had been barred. In the letters they urged the local townsfolk to help him. The peasants responded to this call for aid by killing the magistrate and welcoming Liu back into Pei County. Liu Bang decided to style himself the \"Duke of Pei\" (\u6c9b\u516c) after this and became known to others by this title.\n\nIn 208 BCE, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the descendants of the former royal families who had ruled over the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] rebelled against the Qin Empire in the hope of restoring their former kingdoms. All of which had been conquered by the Qin dynasty in [[Qin's wars of unification|a series of wars]] to unify China under one ruler (the later Qin Emperor) about two decades earlier. In the county of Wu (present-day [[Jiangsu]]), a commoner named [[Xiang Liang]] (whose father had been a general for the state of Chu during the wars of unification) began his own uprising and installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Xiong Xin]] as \"King Huai the Latter\" (\u695a\u5f8c\u61f7\u738b) on the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. Liu Bang decided to join Xiang Liang's rebellion and served in Chu for some time. After Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao, King Huai II sent Xiang Liang's nephew [[Xiang Yu]] and minister [[Song Yi (Qin dynasty)|Song Yi]] to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao state, which was under attack by Qin forces.\n\nLiu Bang was later granted the title \"Marquis of Wu'an\" (\u6b66\u5b89\u4faf) by the king and tasked with leading an army which was to attack Qin. The king then promised that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (the heartland of the Qin state) first would receive the title \"King of Guanzhong\". In 206&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang managed to beat Xiang Yu in the race to Guanzhong and arrived outside of the Qin capital. [[Ziying]] who would end up being the last ruler of the Qin dynasty, surrendered the capital city of [[Xianyang]] to Liu Bang's forces.  Liu issued strict orders to his men which forbade them from killing any innocent civilians or pillaging the city. Thanks to this, peace and stability were temporarily restored in Xianyang while Liu Bang's forces were stationed there. Liu's friend and confidante Xiao He ordered the collection of all the legal documents in the Qin palace and government facilities so they could be preserved and safely transported away.\n\n== Chu\u2013Han Contention ==\n{{Main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n[[File:Mural Painting of a Banquet Scene from the Han Dynasty Tomb of Ta-hu-t'ing.jpg|thumb|300px|A late [[Eastern Han]] (25\u2013220 AD) [[Chinese painting|Chinese tomb mural]] showing lively scenes of a banquet (yanyin \u5bb4\u98f2), dance and music (wuyue \u821e\u6a02), acrobatics (baixi \u767e\u620f), and wrestling (xiangbu \u76f8\u6251), [[c:Category:Dahuting Tomb murals|from the Dahuting Tomb]] (Chinese: \u6253\u864e\u4ead\u6f22\u5893, Pinyin: ''Dahuting Han mu''), on the southern bank of the [[Suihe River]] in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]], China (just west of [[Xi County, Henan|Xi County]])]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 01 Wine vessel Western Han dynasty.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Shanxi Museum 2009 Taiyuan 839.jpg\n| width2 = 182\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' A [[jade]]-carved wine cup with [[relief]] decorations, [[Western Han]] (202 BCE \u2013 9 CE) <br>'''Right:''' a gilded bronze [[wine warmer]] with animalistic relief decorations, 26 BCE, [[Western Han]] period\n}}\n[[File:Met, female dancer, western han dynasty, 2nd century BC.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Western Han]] female dancer in [[silk]] robes, 2nd century BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; [[Xiang Zhuang]] intended to assassinate Liu Bang by pretending to do a [[sword dance]]]]\n[[Xiang Yu]] was dissatisfied that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to [[Guanzhong]]. Instigated by his advisor [[Fan Zeng]] and Cao Wushang (\u66f9\u7121\u50b7), an informer from Liu Bang's camp, he decided to set a trap to kill Liu Bang.  He pretended to invite Liu Bang to a banquet, while secretly planning to assassinate Liu during the feast.  However, Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was a close friend of Liu Bang's strategist [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]], and managed to persuade his nephew to not personally order Liu Bang's execution on the feast.  Frustrated by Xiang Yu's indecisiveness, Fan Zeng then ordered Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend performing a [[sword dance]] and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang, but Xiang Bo volunteered to join the dance and blocked his nephew every time he thrust his sword towards Liu Bang.\n\nSeeing Liu Bang was in mortal danger, Zhang Liang sneaked outside and summoned Liu Bang's brother-in-law and personal bodyguard [[Fan Kuai]], who then crashed the party clad in full armor and scolded Xiang Yu for the sinister plot.  Embarrassed by Fan Kuai's accusation, Xiang Yu ordered the sword dance to stop and rewarded Fan Kuai for his bravery.  Liu Bang then pretended to go to the latrine and used the chance to escape Xiang Yu's camp unannounced.  He and his forces then evacuated from Xianyang and retreated west.  Xiang Yu led his forces into Xianyang, where they plundered and pillaged the city and burnt down the [[Epang Palace]].\n\n[[Records of the Grand Historian]] recounts an event during this conflict, an event omitted from the emperor's own biography but present in the biography of Xiang Yu, where he pushed his own children out of his carriage to lighten it in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu's men.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin===\nAfter occupying Xianyang, Xiang Yu proclaimed himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]]. The Guanzhong area, which was rightfully Liu Bang's per [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise, was given by Xiang Yu to [[Three Qins|three former Qin generals]] instead. Liu Bang was relocated to [[Hanzhong]] in the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) and received the title \"King of Han\" (\u6f22\u738b). When a rebellion broke out in the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] in late 206&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu left Western Chu to suppress the revolt. Liu Bang used the opportunity to invade and conquer Guanzhong and then attack several Chu territories, including the capital Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce; present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nFrom 206\u2013202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a power struggle \u2013 historically known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] \u2013 for supremacy over China, while simultaneously attacking and subjugating the other kingdoms. In 203&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang came to an armistice, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west along the Hong Canal under the Chu and Han regimes respectively. A few months later, Liu Bang renounced the treaty and attacked Xiang Yu again. In 202&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu lost to Liu Bang at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and committed suicide, after which Chu surrendered to Han. Liu Bang had unified much of China under his control by then.\n\n==Establishment of the Han dynasty==\n[[File:Emperor gao of han c01s06i01.jpg|thumb|A portrait painting of Emperor Gao of Han (Liu Bang), from an 18th-century Qing Dynasty album of Chinese emperors' portraits.]]\nIn 202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang was enthroned as the emperor with support from his subjects even though he expressed reluctance to take the throne. He named his dynasty \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\", and was historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu\" (or \"Emperor Gao\"). He established the capital in [[Luoyang]] (later moved to [[Chang'an]]) and instated his official spouse [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]] as the empress and their son [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]] as the [[crown prince]].\n\nThe following year, Emperor Gaozu wanted to reward his subjects who had contributed to the founding of the Han Empire, but the process dragged on for a year because they could not agree on the distribution of the rewards. The emperor thought that [[Xiao He]]'s contributions were the greatest, so he awarded Xiao the title \"Marquis of Zan\" and gave him the largest amount of food stores. Some of the others expressed objections because they thought that Xiao was not directly involved in battle so his contributions should not be considered the greatest. Emperor Gaozu replied that Xiao He should receive the highest credit because he planned their overall strategy in the war against Xiang Yu. He named [[Cao Shen]] as the person who made the greatest contributions in battle and rewarded him and the others accordingly.\n\n==Reign==\n{{Further|Han dynasty}}\n\n===Reducing taxes and corv\u00e9e===\nEmperor Gaozu disbanded his armies and allowed the soldiers to return home. He gave an order stating that the people who remained in [[Guanzhong]] were exempted from taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]] for 12 years while those who returned to their respective native territories were exempted for six years and that the central government would provide for them for a year. He also granted freedom to those who had sold themselves into slavery to avoid hunger during the wars. In 195&nbsp;BCE, the emperor issued two decrees: the first officialised the lowering of taxes and corv\u00e9e; the second set the amount of tribute to be paid by the [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to the imperial court in the 10th month of every year. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced to a rate of 1/15 of crop yield. He also privatised the coinage.\n\n===Emphasis on Confucianism===\nIn his early days, Emperor Gaozu disliked reading and scorned [[Confucianism]]. After becoming the emperor, he still held the same attitudes towards Confucianism as he did before until he encountered the scholar [[Lu Jia (Western Han)|Lu Jia]] (or Lu Gu). Lu Gu wrote a 12-volume book, ''Xinyu'' (\u65b0\u8a9e), which espoused the benefits of governing by moral virtue as opposed to using harsh and punitive laws (as it was under the Qin dynasty). Lu Gu read each volume to the emperor after he finished writing it. The emperor was deeply impressed. Under Emperor Gaozu's reign, Confucianism flourished and gradually replaced [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] (of Qin times) as the state ideology. Confucian scholars, including Lu Gu, were recruited to serve in the government. The emperor also reformed the legal system by relaxing some laws inherited from the Qin regime and reducing the severity of certain penalties. In 196&nbsp;BCE, after suppressing a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], he passed by [[Shandong]], the birthplace of [[Confucius]], and personally prepared for a ceremony to pay respect to the philosopher.\n\n===Dispute over the succession===\nIn his later years, Emperor Gaozu favoured [[Concubine Qi]] and neglected [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. He thought that [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], his heir apparent (born to the empress), was too weak to be a ruler. Thus, he had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with another son, [[Liu Ruyi]], who was born to Concubine Qi. L\u00fc Zhi became worried, so she asked [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] to help her son maintain his position. Zhang Liang recommended four reclusive wise men, the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]], to help Liu Ying.\n\nIn 195&nbsp;BCE as Emperor Gaozu's health started to worsen, he desired even more to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as the crown prince. Zhang Liang tried to dissuade him but was ignored, so he retired on the excuse that he was ill. [[Shusun Tong]] (the crown prince's tutor) and Zhou Chang also strongly objected to the emperor's decision to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi. Zhou Chang said, \"I am not good in arguing, but I know this is not right. If Your Majesty deposes the Crown Prince, I won't follow your orders any more.\"<ref>(\u81e3\u53e3\u4e0d\u80fd\u8a00\uff0c\u7136\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u77e5\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002\u965b\u4e0b\u96d6\u6b32\u5ee2\u592a\u5b50\uff0c\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u4e0d\u5949\u8a54\u3002)</ref> Zhou Chang was outspoken but he had a stuttering problem, which made his speech very amusing. The emperor laughed. After that, the Four Haos of Mount Shang showed up in the court. Emperor Gaozu was surprised to see them because they had previously declined to join the civil service when he invited them. The four men promised to help Liu Ying in the future if he were to remain as the crown prince. The emperor was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support so he dismissed the idea of changing his heir apparent.<ref name=\"Ch'en2014\">{{cite book|author=Chi-yen Ch'en|title=Hsun Yueh and the Mind of Late Han China: A Translation of the SHEN-CHIEN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sar_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5348-9|pages=171\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n{{further|Kings of the Han dynasty|Battle of Baideng|Heqin}}\n[[File:Western Han soldiers.jpg|thumb|[[Horses in East Asian warfare|Cavalry soldiers]], painted [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic statues]], [[Western Han]] period, [[Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]\nAfter establishing the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu appointed princes and [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to help him govern the Han Empire and gave each of them a piece of land. There were seven vassal kings who were not related to the imperial clan: [[Zang Tu]], the King of Yan; [[King Xin of Han|H\u00e1n Xin]], the King of H\u00e1n; [[Han Xin]], the King of Chu; [[Peng Yue]], the King of Liang; [[Ying Bu]], the King of Huainan; Zhang Er, the King of Zhao; [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], the King of Changsha. However, later, the emperor became worried that the vassal kings might rebel against him because they, after all, had no blood relations with him. Han Xin and Peng Yue were (falsely) accused of treason, arrested and executed along with their families. Ying Bu and Zang Tu rebelled against him but were defeated and killed. Only Wu Rui and Zhang Er were left.\n\nThe [[Xiongnu]] in the north had been a threat since the [[Qin dynasty]]. [[Qin Shi Huang]] had sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to oversee the defences on the Qin Empire's northern border and the construction of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] to repel the invaders. Meng Tian achieved success in deterring the Xiongnu from advancing beyond the border. However, after the Qin dynasty collapsed, the Xiongnu seized the opportunity to move south and raid the border again. In 201&nbsp;BCE, H\u00e1n Xin (King of H\u00e1n) defected to the Xiongnu leader, [[Modu Chanyu|Modu]]. In the following year, Emperor Gaozu led an army to attack the Xiongnu but was besieged and trapped by the enemy at the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Acting on [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]]'s advice, he bribed Modu's wife with gifts and got her to ask her husband to withdraw his forces. Modu did so. After returning to the capital, Emperor Gaozu initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'', which involved sending noble ladies to marry the Xiongnu leaders and paying annual tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Changling 1.jpg|thumb|Changling (\u9577\u9675), [[Chinese pyramids|the tomb]] of Emperor Gaozu in Xianyang, Shaanxi.]]\n\nEmperor Gaozu was wounded by a stray arrow during the campaign against [[Ying Bu]]. He became seriously ill and remained in his inner chambers for a long period of time and ordered his guards to deny entry to everyone who tried to visit him. After several days, [[Fan Kuai]] barged into the chambers to see the emperor and the other subjects followed behind him. They saw Emperor Gaozu lying on his bed and attended to by a [[eunuch]]. Fan Kuai said, \"How glorious it was when Your Majesty first led us to conquer the empire and how weary we are now. Your subjects are worried when they learn that Your Majesty is ill, but Your Majesty refuses to see us and prefers the company of a eunuch instead. Has Your Majesty forgotten the incident about [[Zhao Gao]]?\" The emperor laughed and got out of bed to meet his subjects.\n\nEmperor Gaozu's health deteriorated later so [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] hired a famous physician to heal him. When Emperor Gaozu enquired about his condition, the physician told him that his illness could be cured, but the emperor was displeased and he scolded the physician, \"Isn't it Heaven's will that I managed to conquer this empire in simple clothing and with nothing but a sword? My life is determined by Heaven. It is useless even if [[Bian Que]] is here!\" He refused to continue with the treatment and sent the physician away. Before his death, he said that [[Cao Shen]] could succeed [[Xiao He]] as the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] after Xiao died, and that Wang Ling could succeed Cao Shen. He also said that Wang Ling might be too young to perform his duties so [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]] could assist Wang, but Chen was also qualified to assume the responsibilities of a chancellor all by himself. He also named [[Zhou Bo]] as a possible candidate for the role of Grand Commandant. He died in Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae) on 1 June 195&nbsp;BCE and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]].\n\n== Song of the Great Wind ==\nThe ''Song of the Great Wind'' was a song composed by Liu Bang in 195&nbsp;BCE when he visited his hometown in [[Pei County]] after suppressing [[Ying Bu]]'s rebellion. He prepared a banquet and invited all his old friends and townsfolk to join him. After some drinks, Liu Bang played the [[guqin]] and sang the ''Song of the Great Wind''.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.guoxue.com/art/ss000/hvsc001/dfg005.htm \u5927\u98ce\u6b4c]</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n'''\u300a\u5927\u98a8\u6b4c\u300b'''\n|\n'''Song of the Great Wind'''\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5927\u98a8\u8d77\u516e\u96f2\u98db\u63da\uff0c\n|\n''A great wind came forth,''<br />\n''the clouds rose on high''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5a01\u52a0\u6d77\u5167\u516e\u6b78\u6545\u9109\uff0c\n|\n''Now that my might rules all within the seas,''<br />\n''I have returned to my old village''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5b89\u5f97\u731b\u58eb\u516e\u5b88\u56db\u65b9\uff01\n|\n''Where will I find brave men''<br />\n''to guard the four corners of my land?''\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite book| author = John Minford|author2=Joseph S.

Folsom, John H. Minan, Lee Ann Otto, ''Law and Politics in the People's Republic of China'', [[West (publisher)|West Publishing]] (St. Paul, 1992), pp.&nbsp;76\u201377.</ref> According to a prominent government spokesman:<blockquote>We will never simply copy the system of Western countries or introduce a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation; although China\u2019s state organs have different responsibilities, they all adhere to the line, principles and policies of the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7932091.stm \"China 'will not have democracy'] China will never adopt Western-style democracy with a multi-party system, its top legislator has said.\" BBC 9 March 2009, accessed October 9, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], a variable number of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premiers]], five [[State councillor (China)|State Councilors]] (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the [[Secretary-General of the State Council|Secretary-General]], and now 26 [[Ministries of the People's Republic of China|ministers and other cabinet-level department heads]].  During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party. This dual structure thereby creates a single centralized focus of power.\n\nAt the same time there has been a move to separate party and state offices at levels other than the central government. It is not unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary.  This frequently causes conflict between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too powerful.  Some special cases are the [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], where according to constitution and respective basic law, most national laws do not apply and the [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about two weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in the PRC is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws. For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[Expressways of China|expressways]].<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2009/January/ChinaBitesTheBulletOnFuelTax.asp China bites the bullet on fuel tax].

Historically it has five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the party's [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Constitution]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]] must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/49109.htm#4 Chapter III Central Organizations of the Party - Article 22]</ref>\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in [[Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China|protocol sequence]]. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary, premier, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]], the chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|secretariat]] have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref name=\"CF111312\">{{cite news |title = China's Next Leaders: A Guide to What's at Stake |url = http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |access-date = 18 November 2012 |newspaper = China File |date = 13 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210034750/http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |archive-date = 2013-02-10 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Paramount leader ==\n[[File:Xi Jinping March 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] ]]\n{{Main article|Paramount leader}}\n\nPower is concentrated in the [[Paramount leader]], currently [[Xi Jinping]], who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], general secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/ |title = A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]] |quote = [[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

Before that an interim constitution-like document created by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the Constitution to just about 30 articles, and contained Communist slogans and revolutionary language throughout. The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under  the influence of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation. On December 4, 1982, it was promulgated and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The roles of the presidency and the courts were normalized, and under the constitution, all citizens were equal. Amendments in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2018 recognized private property, safeguarded human rights, and further promoted the non-public sector of the economy.\n\n==National People's Congress==\n{{Main|National People's Congress}}\n[[image:The 1st Session of the 12th National People's Congress open 20130305.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The 12th [[National People's Congress]] held in 2013]]\n\nThe [[National People's Congress]] (usually abbreviated NPC) is the national legislature of the People's Republic of China.

ultimate power of the state that makes the constitution and basic laws, and supervise and elects all following organs;\n# [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC): the permanent legislative organ which makes most laws, interprets the constitution and laws, conducts [[constitutional review]], and supervise all following organs;\n# [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], act as a ceremonial [[head of state]] in compliance with decisions made by the NPCSC, but exercises an independent power to nominate the Premier of the State Council; and the [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|Vice-President]], who has no power itself, but assist the President.\n# [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (synonymous with \"Central People's Government\"): the executive branch, whose [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] is the [[head of government]];\n# [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC): the military branch, whose [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the national armed forces including the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP), and the [[Militia (China)|Militia]];\n# [[National Supervisory Commission]] (NSC): the supervisory branch;\n# [[Supreme People's Court]] (SPC): the judicial branch;\n# [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]] (SPP): the prosecutorial branch.\n\nThe legal power of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] is guaranteed by [[Constitution of China|the PRC Constitution]] and its position as the supreme political authority in the PRC is realised through its comprehensive control of the state, military, and media.<ref>Ralph H. Folsom, John H. Minan, Lee Ann Otto, ''Law and Politics in the People's Republic of China'', [[West (publisher)|West Publishing]] (St. Paul, 1992), pp.&nbsp;76\u201377.</ref> According to a prominent government spokesman:<blockquote>We will never simply copy the system of Western countries or introduce a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation; although China\u2019s state organs have different responsibilities, they all adhere to the line, principles and policies of the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7932091.stm \"China 'will not have democracy'] China will never adopt Western-style democracy with a multi-party system, its top legislator has said.\" BBC 9 March 2009, accessed October 9, 2010.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]], a variable number of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|Vice Premiers]], five [[State councillor (China)|State Councilors]] (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), the [[Secretary-General of the State Council|Secretary-General]], and now 26 [[Ministries of the People's Republic of China|ministers and other cabinet-level department heads]].  During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party. This dual structure thereby creates a single centralized focus of power.\n\nAt the same time there has been a move to separate party and state offices at levels other than the central government. It is not unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary.  This frequently causes conflict between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too powerful.  Some special cases are the [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], where according to constitution and respective basic law, most national laws do not apply and the [[autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about two weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in the PRC is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws. For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[Expressways of China|expressways]].<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2009/January/ChinaBitesTheBulletOnFuelTax.asp China bites the bullet on fuel tax].

Historically it has five to nine members, and currently has seven members. Its officially mandated purpose is to conduct policy discussions and make decisions on major issues when the Politburo, a larger decision-making body, is not in session. According to the party's [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Constitution]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Central Committee]] must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/49109.htm#4 Chapter III Central Organizations of the Party - Article 22]</ref>\n\nThe membership of the PSC is strictly ranked in [[Orders of precedence in the People's Republic of China|protocol sequence]]. Historically, the general secretary (or party chairman) has been ranked first; the rankings of other leaders have varied over time. Since the 1990s, the general secretary, premier, chairman of the [[National People's Congress]], the chairman of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], the secretary of the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]], the party's top anti-graft body, and the first-ranked secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|secretariat]] have consistently also been members of the Politburo Standing Committee.<ref name=\"CF111312\">{{cite news |title = China's Next Leaders: A Guide to What's at Stake |url = http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |access-date = 18 November 2012 |newspaper = China File |date = 13 November 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130210034750/http://www.chinafile.com/china%E2%80%99s-next-leaders-guide-what%E2%80%99s-stake |archive-date = 2013-02-10 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n== Paramount leader ==\n[[File:Xi Jinping March 2017.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] ]]\n{{Main article|Paramount leader}}\n\nPower is concentrated in the [[Paramount leader]], currently [[Xi Jinping]], who heads the four most important political and state offices: He is [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], general secretary of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], and [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the PRC.<ref>{{cite web |url =https://multimedia.scmp.com/widgets/china/cpc-primer/ |title = A simple guide to the Chinese government|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]] |quote = [[Xi Jinping]] is the most powerful figure in the Chinese political system.

Before that an interim constitution-like document created by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] was in force. The second promulgation in 1975 shortened the Constitution to just about 30 articles, and contained Communist slogans and revolutionary language throughout. The role of courts was slashed, and the Presidency was gone. The 3rd promulgation in 1978 expanded the number of articles, but was still under  the influence of the just-gone-by Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe current constitution is the PRC's fourth promulgation. On December 4, 1982, it was promulgated and has served as a stable constitution for 30 years. The roles of the presidency and the courts were normalized, and under the constitution, all citizens were equal. Amendments in 1988, 1993, 1999, 2004, and 2018 recognized private property, safeguarded human rights, and further promoted the non-public sector of the economy.\n\n==National People's Congress==\n{{Main|National People's Congress}}\n[[image:The 1st Session of the 12th National People's Congress open 20130305.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The 12th [[National People's Congress]] held in 2013]]\n\nThe [[National People's Congress]] (usually abbreviated NPC) is the national legislature of the People's Republic of China.
